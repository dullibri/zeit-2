HEADLINE: Lawyer Charged in Astor Case Has Been Accused of Other Improprieties

BYLINE: By SERGE F. KOVALESKI and COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
Ever since the family battle broke out over Brooke Astor's care and fortune, most of the attention has focused on her only son, Anthony D. Marshall, 83, who served as the steward of his mother's finances for more than a quarter-century. But indicted this week along with Mr. Marshall was a lawyer with a troubled legal career who has faced disciplinary action in at least two states.
 Yesterday morning, that lawyer, Francis X. Morrissey Jr., 65, turned himself in at the Manhattan district attorney's office after being charged in the 18-count indictment with helping Mr. Marshall exploit an ailing Mrs. Astor so the two men could gain financially. Mr. Morrissey is charged with, among other things, forging Mrs. Astor's signature on a final amendment to her 2002 will. 
 In the afternoon, Mr. Morrissey, his wrists handcuffed in front of him, appeared at his arraignment but did not utter a word. One of his lawyers, Pery D. Krinsky, entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. An assistant district attorney, Peirce Moser, then summed up the crimes that Mr. Morrissey was charged with committing. 
 ''Under the guise of representing Mrs. Astor when she had diminished mental capacity, the defendant in reality worked himself into a position to collect millions of dollars when she died,'' he told Judge A. Kirke Bartley Jr. 
 Mr. Moser asked that Mr. Morrissey provide a personal recognizance bond of $100,000 and surrender his passport, the same request prosecutors made of Mr. Marshall on Tuesday. Mr. Morrissey stroked his chin with his left hand, which was no longer cuffed, and signed the necessary papers before leaving the courthouse in silence.
 It would seem to be the darkest moment in the career of a lawyer who over the years has gained a reputation for ingratiating himself to older people and finding his way into their wills or trusts, mostly as a beneficiary, but also as an executor or a trustee.
 In the indictment in the Astor case, Mr. Morrissey was charged with forgery, criminal possession of a forged instrument, scheme to defraud, and conspiracy. Mr. Marshall was charged with scheme to defraud, grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property, falsifying business records and other charges.
 Mr. Morrissey has been accused in several previous cases of taking advantage of mentally incompetent people near death and then being named as a beneficiary of such bequests as a Park Avenue apartment, a Midtown Manhattan apartment, expensive art and hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash. 
 Those cases were settled in confidential agreements with the other interested parties. As part of those settlements, Mr. Morrissey admitted no wrongdoing. 
 In a gift that was not challenged, Mr. Morrissey received an annuity worth more than $100,000 from an elderly alcoholic woman who claimed to have fallen in love with him before her death a few years ago, according to a person briefed on the situation. She kept a photo of Mr. Morrissey next to her bed.
 One of Mr. Morrissey's lawyers, Michael S. Ross, said in an e-mail message yesterday, ''A handful of Mr. Morrissey's close friends, including some he had known literally for decades, showed their appreciation and deep feelings by making gifts to him in their estates.
 ''While these gifts upset some who would receive less money, Mr. Morrissey's friends were fully entitled to express their feelings for him in this way,'' Mr. Ross said.
 Before he was indicted in the Astor case, Mr. Morrissey's most serious problem as a lawyer stemmed from work he had done in the field of admiralty law. In 1995, he was issued a two-year suspension by the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court linked to his representation of a Spanish company, Mar Oil, in a dispute it was having with an insurer over the loss of one of its supertankers.
 Mr. Morrissey, who was in disagreement with Mar Oil over his fee, was found to have wrongfully taken $925,675 out of an escrow account belonging to the firm to compensate himself, and to have deceived a top company executive into signing a letter that approved the payment, according to court documents.
 Stephen Gillers, a professor of legal ethics at New York University School of Law, has included the case in his curriculum.
 ''I teach the case because it is a good illustration of how not to treat your clients, and it is factually dramatic in showing how Morrissey's conduct violated his duty to Mar Oil,'' Mr. Gillers said. 
 In November 1996, Mr. Morrissey submitted his resignation from the State Bar of California with charges pending against him, according to records. A spokeswoman for the bar said that the charges remain confidential.
 Mr. Morrissey is the son of a Boston judge who was nominated for a position on the federal bench in the mid-1960s. But the nomination, which was being pushed by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was pulled back after questions were raised about the elder Mr. Morrissey's qualifications and character.
 The younger Mr. Morrissey, who received his law degree from the University of California, was admitted to practice law in New York on Oct. 15, 1973, according to court records. 
 Later that decade, he met Mrs. Astor. After 2000, Mr. Morrissey developed a closer relationship with her and started advising her on estate planning.
 He was invited to her birthday celebrations. He dined with her at the Knickerbocker Club and accompanied her to museum events and the theater. He took her to the opening of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night'' on May 6, 2003, in which Mr. Marshall and his wife, Charlene, had made an investment, according to a copy of Mrs. Astor's schedule. 
 Mr. Morrissey would drop Mrs. Astor notes about the goings-on of New York society and send her flowers and books, like ''The Diaries of Beatrice Webb,'' correspondence from her to Mr. Morrissey showed.
 Mr. Morrissey has also been an investor in and board member of Mr. Marshall's theater production company, Delphi Productions, which received hundreds of thousands of dollars of Mrs. Astor's money. 
 During this period and in earlier years, Mr. Morrissey was being accused of exploitation.
 On March 3, 2002, Sam Schurr, an economist who would die the next day at 83, apparently signed an amendment to a family trust that gave Mr. Morrissey his East 57th Street apartment and a drawing by Diego Rivera.
 In court papers challenging the document, a relative of Mr. Schurr's said it ''was the product of fraud and undue influence exerted on the decedent'' by Mr. Morrissey and others.
 Mr. Schurr was ''incompetent'' on the day of the signing, according to the court filing, which also said that he had suffered a stroke in May 2000 and that his health ''deteriorated progressively.'' The matter was subject to a confidential settlement in 2005. 
 ''He's a 'walker,' as we say in the trade: someone who befriends elderly people, mostly women, with the idea of getting on their good side and getting into their wills,'' said J. Hayes Kavanagh, a lawyer who represented several clients in a similar case against Mr. Morrissey. 
 In that matter, beneficiaries and a public administrator appointed by a surrogate's court alleged that Mr. Morrissey had exploited a woman during a revision of her will on July 17, 1997. 
 The woman, Elisabeth von Knapitsch, a widow who lived on Park Avenue, died on Jan. 15, 2000, at 91 with an estate worth about $15 million. In her will, Mr. Morrissey, who had known her since the early 1970s, received Ms. von Knapitsch's apartment, the furniture, four oil paintings -- including two by Renoir -- as well as $300,000 and whatever was left of her estate after other bequests had been made.
 But in court filings, five beneficiaries to her fortune said that Ms. von Knapitsch ''was not of sound mind or memory'' and was not capable of making a will. They accused Mr. Morrissey and others of subjecting her to ''duress and undue influence.'' Under a settlement agreement, Mr. Morrissey received a significant portion of the money designated for him in the will.
 A month before Jose Juarez Garza died in May 1987 at the age of 56, the will he made in 1976 was amended, appointing Mr. Morrissey as both co-executor and lawyer for his estate. But Mr. Garza, who was in the hospital at the time, was so ill that he apparently signed the amendment with an X, which was accompanied by the words ''His Mark,'' written by Peter J. Kelley, a lawyer who signed the document as a witness. 
 Mr. Morrissey supervised the signing of the amendment. ''Mr. Garza was in extremis and could not move his hand very easily. He was very weak,'' Mr. Kelley said in an interview. ''So we had him just make a mark. But from what I could tell, he knew what he was doing.''
 Mr. Kelley said he had worked with Mr. Morrissey on a number of wills and amendments, known as codicils, for various clients. He said that Mr. Morrissey would contact him and ''give me the parameters'' and ask him to draft a will or a codicil.
 As for Mr. Morrissey becoming a beneficiary in a number of wills, Mr. Kelley said that Mr. Morrissey ''is connected in the social set.'' He added, '' In my experience, he seldom sent out a bill, and people reciprocated. And he is extremely good at caring for elderly people, but it could be interpreted in different ways by different people.'' 
 ''He seemed dedicated to seeing that these people maintained their quality of life to the utmost,'' Mr. Kelley said. ''He would often take them to lunch every week, or see to it they would go to the occasional show or museum tour.''
 Another lawyer who Mr. Morrissey has often collaborated with on estate matters is Warren Forsythe, according to court records. This relationship was highlighted in another case in which Mr. Morrisey was accused of untoward influence in being designated in an amendment to receive one-third of a trust of Louise Page Morris, who died in October 2002 at age 98.
 In a petition to set aside the amendment, two relatives of Ms. Morris asserted that the two lawyers had unduly influenced ''clients of advanced age and fragile condition to sign wills and trust agreements that provided for gifts to'' Mr. Morrissey and ''for the appointments'' of Mr. Morrissey and Mr. Forsythe ''as paid fiduciaries of the wills and trusts.''
 Mr. Forsythe did not return calls seeking comment.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Sees Silver Lining

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Floyd Norris and Jad Mouawad contributed reporting.

 BODY:
As Wall Street rallied this week, it seemed that investors were taking comfort in the notion that the economy had become so imperiled by the crumbling housing market that it was forcing the government to finally mount an aggressive rescue effort.
 Investors found reassurance yesterday in talk that the White House was brokering a deal with banks that could diminish a looming tidal wave of home foreclosures. Soothing words from the Federal Reserve earlier this week revived the hope that more interest rate cuts are on the way, drowning nervousness in a din of buying. 
 ''The market now feels comfortable that the Fed has come to appreciate the severity of the situation,'' said Robert Barbera, chief economist at the brokerage and advisory firm ITG. ''The bad news gives you the blessing of lower interest rates.''
 But even as investors took heart in palpable signs that the government was preparing to dole out more medicine for the ailing economy, a number of economists cautioned that the pain itself was still unfolding, with its ultimate magnitude far from known. 
 Signs point to a slowdown in the creation of jobs and investments by companies. Consumers are clutching their wallets more tightly. Banks are denying loans to many businesses, unwilling to bet scarce capital in a time of risk and uncertainty. A glut of unsold homes keeps prices falling and the construction industry in distress.
 And even the sharp fall in the price of oil, which offered the comfort that higher energy costs might be easing, reflects a broader fear that global economic activity may slow as growth falters in the United States.
 Looming large over the landscape is uncertainty about the size of losses still confronting banks and other financial institutions as they reckon with bad mortgages along with credit card debts, auto loans and the complex detritus of an era of loose money now over.
 ''It's a sucker's rally,'' said Nouriel Roubini, a former Treasury official who runs an economic consultancy, RGE Monitor. ''The market is essentially hoping the Fed can rescue the economy. But they are discounting the onslaught of really lousy economic news.''
 The price of oil, which only last week threatened to break through $100 a barrel, closed yesterday at $88.71, completing its steepest weekly plunge in the last two years. Cheaper oil blunts the threat of inflation, adding to the sense that the Fed has room to take interest rates lower without worrying about setting off an upward price spiral.
 But the lower price also reflects the view of investors who now expect a substantial American economic slowdown, which would ease the pressure of the rising demand for energy. 
 ''The market is realizing how much of a train wreck the economy is right now,'' said John Kilduff, an energy analyst at MF Global in New York.
 There are plenty of reasons, of course, to count on the economy's inherent countervailing forces to ultimately help restore it to health. Lower interest rates should indeed spur more economic activity. A falling dollar has helped spur American exports and curb imports, contributing to a narrower trade deficit. And if the banks really do sign on to the deal the Bush administration is pushing to keep lower rates in place for subprime mortgages, that should keep a lot of people from losing their homes.
 Yet many of the forces gnawing at the economy remain in place, and actually appear to be intensifying. The trajectory was reinforced by data released yesterday, which showed that Americans now have less money in their pockets and are less inclined to spend. 
 Personal income grew at a seasonally adjusted rate of 0.2 percent in October compared with September, the Commerce Department reported. That was only half the rate expected. Consumption grew a paltry 0.2 percent, dropping from the 0.3 percent increase registered in September. Construction spending plummeted at double the anticipated pace. 
 Perhaps more ominously, a government report released yesterday suggested that the number of jobs created in the spring was far smaller than previously assumed. 
 The economy generally needs about 125,000 new nonfarm jobs each month to absorb newcomers entering the labor force and employ those who have lost work, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. In 2006, the economy was still creating about 200,000 positions a month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But in the first 10 months of this year, the number slipped to 125,000. 
 On Friday, the government is to disclose how many nonfarm jobs were created in November. Mr. Zandi and many economists expect the number to fall to about 75,000. ''That will erode confidence in the economy,'' he said. ''It becomes self-reinforcing, and the economy will slide into recession.''
 If the economy does land in recession, ''that would mean we're going to lose a million jobs over a two-year period,'' predicted Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. Whether the economy can avoid that fate, Mr. Levenson suggested, may ride on whether the words of comfort the market heard this week turn out to be sincere. 
 The Fed has to drop rates enough to break the financial logjam and encourage businesses and households to borrow and spend anew. The White House has to deliver a deal that really will prevent millions of families from losing their homes, he said.
 ''If the president puts his seal on it, that would tell me the grown-ups are in charge,'' Mr. Levenson said.

HEADLINE: Estimates May Have Overstated Job Growth

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The American economy appears to have created far fewer jobs this spring than has been reported so far, a new government report indicated yesterday. That could provide further impetus for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it meets Dec. 11. 
 The report included a sharp downward revision of the government's estimate of personal income growth for the second quarter. Because the changes were made as soon as better employment figures were available, the revisions made it seem likely that figures on job creation are also likely to be revised downward in coming months.
 The new report concluded that personal income from wages and salaries grew at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the second quarter, far below the 4.5 percent that had previously been estimated. 
 The government did not explain why the revision was made, and it is possible that some of it came from reducing estimates of wages or of the profits that employees received from exercising stock options. But it was most likely, said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, that the largest part of the revision came from a change in employment estimates.
 If so, he said, he expected the government would revise its estimate of the number of jobs created in the quarter, to as little as 50,000 a month from 126,000 a month. That would indicate that the economy was much weaker than had been thought.
 The Commerce Department had estimated that the overall economy grew at a 3.8 percent rate in the spring quarter, surging to a 4.9 percent pace this summer. But those figures are still subject to revision. 
 The government's first estimates of personal income are based in part on the Labor Department's monthly survey of employers. The revision of the personal income statistics yesterday came after the statisticians first saw figures from unemployment tax collections during the quarter. Those figures, based on the number of employees actually on payrolls, are viewed as more accurate and will later be used to revise the job growth figures.
 The employment situation this year has been confused by a sharp difference in the two surveys the government releases each month. Through October, the payroll survey estimated that 1.2 million jobs were added to the American economy.
 The household survey, which is based on talking to a sample of workers, has shown a decline of 72,000 jobs so far this year.
 ''This tells us the payroll number is truly flawed,'' Mr. Barbera said. ''The number the Fed has to key on is the household time series.''
 The payroll survey in the past has been considered more reliable and less volatile. But because it is based in part on assumptions about how many jobs are being created by new employers, it ''is likely to have some difficulty producing reliable estimates at economic turning points or during periods when there are sudden changes in trend,'' the Labor Department stated on its Web site. A large part of the job growth reported this year has come from those estimates, rather than from the survey itself.
 The payroll survey underestimated job growth in 2003, when the household survey showed a better employment picture. In the end, the payroll figures were revised higher.

HEADLINE: A Pygmy Traveler Gives Voice to a Marginalized People

BYLINE: By MITCH KELLER

DATELINE: LYNCHBURG, Va. 

 BODY:
 THE first thing you notice about Antoine Lonoa, a Pygmy from Congo, is that contrary to the stereotype, he is not unusually small. Indeed, his size would not draw attention on any street in New York.
 The second thing you notice is how easily Mr. Lonoa, the president of a group called the African Congress of the Pygmies, engages a roomful of curious Americans. With his quick smile, strong handshake and emphatic delivery, he passionately describes the plight of Congo's Pygmies, whom he describes as ''longtime victims of stigmatization, exclusion and contempt.''
 He also knows how to tell a joke. In his opening remarks at a recent conference here, Mr. Lonoa said he had heard that Americans were getting shorter. He wondered if that meant that eventually ''there could be 300 million Pygmies in the United States.''
 The humor helps. As a rare spokesman for the hundreds of thousands of Pygmies in nations like Congo, Mr. Lonoa is only too familiar with what he calls the ''repugnance'' society feels toward his people and the ''inferiority complex'' it has engendered in them. 
 While most Pygmies still live in the forest, they are being displaced and driven out by the relentless encroachment of the modern world: huge logging enterprises, settlement, the development of national parks, and violence among militias and rebel groups. Forced to relinquish their traditional territory -- ''land which we have occupied forever,'' Mr. Lonoa said -- and lacking both civil documentation and a political voice, Pygmies often take up a precarious existence at the shabby margins of society.
 But here in Lynchburg, a grimly symbolic place in Pygmy history, Mr. Lonoa and his wife, Therese Pambo, were treated as celebrity guests by scholars and students at a three-day conference in late October dedicated to their cause. Generations ago, Ota Benga, a Congolese Pygmy infamously displayed in a cage at the Bronx Zoo in September 1906, lived the last six years of his life here in Lynchburg. He committed suicide here in 1916, when he was in his early 30s, and was buried here.
 So it was that Mr. Lonoa, Ms. Pambo and Gregoire Bokungu, a pro-Pygmy activist who traveled with the Pygmies from Kinshasa, Congo, found themselves in comfortable lodgings at idyllic Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Va., riding in a shuttle van each morning past curiosities like Biscuitville, Food Lion, AutoZone and Dixie Outfitters. 
 Although he lives in Kinshasa now, Mr. Lonoa, 63, is from rural Bandundu Province, east of Kinshasa. He is among the small percentage of Pygmies who can read and write. Going to school, he said, is difficult or impossible for Congo's Pygmies; most of them still live far from towns and all of them face discrimination from the majority Bantu.
 ''You have to be very, very strong,'' he said. ''You have to be willing to put up with being treated like a second-class citizen.''
 AS a boy, Mr. Lonoa said, he had the good fortune of going to live in a town where the Bantu tribe was more tolerant of Pygmies, a move he made at the urging of a brother who was already there, and Bantu helped Mr. Lonoa get his schooling.
 Eventually he became a teacher and school administrator in Bandundu, a considerable accomplishment. But in Kinshasa, where he has lived since the mid-1990s, he has had a couple of different jobs, including parking attendant, and has often been unemployed. 
 Scientists believe that Pygmies were the original inhabitants of central Africa's vast rain forest, which has always provided for all their physical and spiritual needs. There are many different Pygmy societies in about a dozen African countries; Mr. Lonoa and Ms. Pambo are Batwa Pygmies. In Congo, a country of more than 60 million people, most estimates put the Pygmy population between 250,000 and 600,000.
 Many Bantu refuse to eat or socialize with Pygmies, or to pay them what they would pay a Bantu for the same work. ''Pygmies are abandoned to their own fate,'' said Mr. Bokungu, a Bantu. 
 Despite its name's suggestion of grand meeting halls and assembled legislators, the African Congress of the Pygmies is a small, struggling collaborative of people trying to promote and protect Congo's Pygmies. It has very little money and no office. 
 Like many of the Pygmies in Kinshasa, Mr. Lonoa and Ms. Pambo, who is a vice president of the collaborative, did not even have a permanent place to live until their new friends in Lynchburg stepped up. Enough money was raised to make a $500 deposit on an apartment and to start paying the $50 monthly rent.
 When Mr. Lonoa was asked how he would spread the news about his trip to America once he got home, he laughed. With no office and little money, communication is difficult.
 ''I don't have the material possibilities to do this,'' he said, speaking French through an interpreter. ''If you give me money, I'd like you to give me some people, too, to guide me.''
 Mr. Lonoa and Ms. Pambo were not the only Pygmies in the United States this fall. In October, two Pygmies from Congo met with officials of the World Bank in Washington. Pygmies recently scored a moral victory against the bank when a leaked report by the bank's own watchdog panel said the bank had backed environmentally destructive logging projects without consulting the Pygmies, and without considering the effects of the logging on the Pygmies' way of life. The report also found that logging companies had not delivered on pledges to invest in aid projects like schools and clinics.
 One of the people most responsible for waking Lynchburg to its Pygmy legacy and bringing Mr. Lonoa here is Dibinga wa Said, a Congolese political activist who now lives in Boston and is a patron of the African Congress of the Pygmies. A few years ago, having learned the story of Ota Benga, Dr. Dibinga came to Lynchburg in search of the Pygmy's burial site.
 ''They are animals, as far as the Congolese are concerned,'' Dr. Dibinga, a Bantu, said of the Pygmies. He said Westerners displayed ''a form of racism'' when they showed more concern for Africa's endangered gorillas than for the Pygmies and other trampled peoples. ''Africa is not a zoo for your amusement,'' he said. ''It is a continent of people who are struggling.''
 MR. LONOA'S trip to America included his first visit to a dentist, for an extraction, and a journey by bus to New York and the United Nations. Still, he did not seem overwhelmed by New York. ''There were so many people, it was so crowded, it reminded me of Kinshasa,'' he said.
 He said he and his wife had been warmly welcomed by Americans, who struck him as so cheerful and positive that a visitor from Africa might wonder ''if they even have troubles at all,'' he said. 
 Coming from a country bigger than California and Alaska combined that has only several hundred miles of paved roads, Mr. Lonoa was particularly struck by one convenience that Westerners take for granted.
 ''The roads are very well maintained,'' he said.

HEADLINE: States Take Child Support, Leaving Mothers to Skimp

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: MILWAUKEE 

 BODY:
The collection of child support from absent fathers is failing to help many of the poorest families, in part because the government uses fathers' payments largely to recoup welfare costs rather than passing on the money to mothers and children. 
 Close to half the states pass along none of collected child support to families on welfare, while most others pay only $50 a month to a custodial parent, usually the mother, even though the father may be paying hundreds of dollars each month. 
 Critics say using child support to repay welfare costs harms children instead of helping them, contradicting the national goal of strengthening families, and is a flaw in the generally lauded national campaign to increase collections. 
 Karla Hart, a struggling mother of four here, held out her monthly statement from the county child-support office. 
 Paid by the father: $229.40. 
 Amount deducted to repay federal costs of welfare: $132.18. 
 Her share: $97.22. ''That extra money was a bill I could pay,'' said Ms. Hart, 56, who has lupus and other serious ailments but against her doctor's advice has started working at a day care center, in a failing effort to achieve solvency. 
 Reflecting a growing, bipartisan sense that diverting child support money to government coffers is counterproductive, Congress, in the Deficit Reduction Act passed in early 2006, took a modest step toward change. Beginning in 2009, states will be permitted to pass along up to $100 for one child and $200 for two or more children, with the state and federal governments giving up a share of welfare repayments they have received in the past. 
 The Bush administration has set a goal of increasing the share of collections distributed to families and reducing the amount retained by the government. But the drive to reduce the budget deficit has gotten in the way. As part of last-minute budget crunching, the Republican-controlled Congress in that same act reduced by 20 percent the child-support enforcement money it gives to the states, starting this fall. Many states say the effort to force them to pay more of the enforcement costs will impede collections and prevent them from passing more money on to needy families. 
 ''There was a real groundswell toward the idea of giving more of the money, or even all of it, to the families,'' said Vicki Turetsky, an expert on child support at the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington. But that momentum has been stopped short, she said, by the financing change. 
 Ms. Hart was luckier than most mothers in her position because for more than eight years, under a federally approved experiment, Wisconsin gave all money collected from noncustodial parents to the families. When the experiment ended last year, she lost most of the check.
 ''My daughter told me this morning that she needed $9 for something at school, and I was like, 'But I have to pay the rent,''' Ms. Hart said. ''I gave it to her, and now I have to find that money someplace else.''
 Barry A. Miller, the chief of the North Carolina child support office, said North Carolina, like about half of all states, passed no support money on to families. ''We were seriously considering a change, but it's doubtful we could do that now,'' said Mr. Miller, who is also the president of the National Council of Child Support Directors. In North Carolina and elsewhere, lost federal aid may instead force cuts in personnel and enforcement. 
 On Nov. 15, 24 governors from both parties sent a letter to Congress asking it to repeal the cuts, arguing that they would hurt one of the government's most cost-effective programs, which raises more than $4 in child support for every $1 spent on enforcement. 
 The intensified national effort over the last decade to establish paternity for babies born out of wedlock and to collect more support money, mainly from fathers, is often described as a great success. And indeed, collections have increased significantly, to some $24 billion in 2006 from $12 billion in 1996, helping many families avoid penury. 
 But for the poorest men and women, the story is mixed. Young fathers with little education or job prospects find themselves in arrears and facing jail time or the loss of their driver's licenses as a result, making it all the harder to start earning and paying, said David J. Pate Jr., an assistant professor of social work at the University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee. 
 One startling indicator of how pervasively the poor are affected is highlighted by Daniel L. Hatcher, a legal expert on welfare issues at the University of Baltimore School of Law, in a forthcoming law review article. Of the nation's total uncollected child-support arrears of $105 billion in 2006, Professor Hatcher writes, fully half was owed to the federal and state governments to recover welfare costs, rather than to families. 
 When Congress set up the current child support system in the 1970s, recovering welfare costs was an explicit goal, with some experts arguing that it was only fair for fathers to repay the government for sustaining their offspring and that giving families the money was a form of ''double dipping.'' But experience and research have suggested to most experts and state and federal officials from both parties that the policy is counterproductive -- driving fathers into the underground economy and leaving families more dependent on aid.
 Today, said Ron Haskins, a Republican expert at the Brookings Institution, ''I don't think anyone thinks it's double dipping, especially because one of the major goals is to get more money to the mother so she can stay off welfare.'' 
 The major obstacle to change, Mr. Haskins said, ''has usually been that it cost both the federal government and the states money.'' 
 Studies of the Wisconsin experiment showed that when support payments were fully passed along to mothers, more fathers came forward and paid more of the support they owed, said Maria Cancian, director of the Institute for Research on Poverty at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. As families receive more support money, they are less apt to require public assistance, she and other experts say, making up for any short-term loss of revenues. And fathers are more likely to establish lasting patterns of payment and connection with their children, Ms. Cancian said. 
 Using child support for revenue collection ''is penny wise and pound foolish,'' she added. 
 Tonya Wenk, 24, of Milwaukee is so angry at the reduction in payments for her daughter that she and the father have applied to withdraw from the child support system. Ms. Wenk said the father, Lashun Gray, had always paid his required sum to the state and more in private. 
 Mr. Gray, 26, a forklift driver at a large store, said of the disappearing money, ''It bothers me a lot.'' 
 The federal government refused to extend the waiver that allowed Wisconsin to pay all money to families, but the state, despite a $27 million cut in federal aid, continues to forgive its own share of welfare costs. 
 That is why Ms. Hart, like others in Wisconsin, is receiving more than she would in other states. But this is small comfort to the ailing mother, who had to move to Milwaukee's outskirts when the building where she rented an apartment was lost to foreclosure, must share a bed with a daughter and worries that she cannot buy a computer for her children in high school.
 ''The school says go to a library to use one, but we don't have any transport to the library,'' said Ms. Hart, who cannot even think of owning a car. 
 Going to work, she said, may have been a wash financially because her federal disability check and food stamps were reduced, as is her energy. 
 ''As soon as I catch up, I'll slow down, but it just keeps going,'' she said. ''I'm tired and worn out.''

HEADLINE: Army Pays $725 in Set-Aside World War II Case

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
A month after the Army said it made a mistake when it court-martialed Samuel Snow and 27 other black soldiers in World War II, the Pentagon has cut Mr. Snow a check for back pay, money withheld while he served a year in prison on a rioting conviction.
 The check was for $725. No interest. No adjustment for inflation. 
 Mr. Snow, now 83, says $725 is not nearly enough for the anguish he endured as part of what was possibly the largest Army court-martial of the war. He has no plans to cash the check.
 ''I didn't think it was appropriate,'' said Mr. Snow, retired after more than 40 years of working as a janitor in Florida. ''I'm going to ask them for more or something.''
 In October, an Army board effectively overturned the convictions of Mr. Snow and the other former soldiers on rioting and other charges. The men, two of whom are known to survive, were imprisoned in many cases and dishonorably discharged after a riot at Fort Lawton here in August 1944 that led to the hanging death of an Italian prisoner of war held at the post.
 The Army Board for Correction of Military Records specifically set aside the convictions of Mr. Snow and three others whose families requested reviews of the cases. The board found that the convictions were flawed because two lawyers defended 43 soldiers, the lawyers had 13 days to prepare for trial and, most critically, the prosecution withheld important evidence that could have potentially helped the defendants.
 ''All rights, privileges and property lost as a result of the conviction should be restored to him,'' the board said of Mr. Snow. Rulings in the other cases were similar.
 Col. Daniel L. Baggio, chief of media relations for the Army, said in an interview and in e-mail messages that he could not discuss Mr. Snow's specific payment because of privacy laws. Colonel Baggio said a private of Mr. Snow's grade was paid $50 a month in 1945. 
 He said Mr. Snow's $725 appeared to reflect money withheld from his conviction on Dec. 18, 1944, to what would have been his likely discharge date, March 2, 1946. In an e-mail message, Colonel Baggio said the law controlling the board ''does not authorize payment of interest, pain and suffering or damages.'' If the back pay had been calculated at 8 percent for 61 1/2 years, compounded annually, Mr. Snow could have received more than $80,000. If the $725 was simply adjusted for inflation, it would amount to more than $7,700, a calculator on the Labor Department Web site shows.
 In 1949, Mr. Snow tried to upgrade his discharge but was rejected by the records board. He returned in 1975, and his status was upgraded to ''general under honorable conditions,'' according to Army documents. 
 The board determined then that after initially denying involvement, Mr. Snow confessed to rioting under duress because he had been jailed in a stockade. Mr. Snow said he received veteran's health benefits.
 Mr. Snow said in a phone interview that the $725 check was accompanied by a letter that said ''if I thought that wasn't agreeable, don't cash the check, because there wouldn't be no more if I did.'' 
 He said his son planned to look for ways to appeal, including going to his representative, Corrine Brown, Democrat of Florida. An aide to Ms. Brown said Friday that she recently met Mr. Snow. 
 ''I know the congresswoman would be concerned about this issue,'' Ms. Brown's legislative director, Nick Martinelli, said.
 It was unclear what other benefits might have been denied to Mr. Snow or the families of others convicted and what might be available now. Colonel Baggio said such back payments were uncommon but did not respond to follow-up questions on additional benefits. 
 An official of the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, who insisted on anonymity because he said he was not authorized to speak publicly about the case, said Mr. Snow could appeal for more pay or benefits. The official said Mr. Snow was the sole convicted soldier to have been sent a check. 
 It was unclear whether the other known survivor, Roy Montgomery of Illinois, had applied for a review. The review process was ordered by Congress after a book about the case, ''On American Soil,'' by Jack Hamann, a journalist and an author here, was published.

 BODY:
A BID TO EASE CREDIT IN EUROPE The European Central Bank said that it would extend a lending deadline in December to help the banking system through a period of unusually tight credit at the end of the year. The action represents a renewed effort by the bank to calm a lending system that had showed signs of returning to normal recently but now appears nearly as nervous as during the summer days when the global credit turmoil began. 
 The bank's normal midmonth lending, which typically has a maturity of a single week, will be extended in December so that loans are not due until Jan. 4. ''In this operation, the E.C.B. will aim to satisfy the banking sector's liquidity needs for the entire two-week period,'' the bank said in a statement.

 EUROPEAN SATELLITE PROJECT The European Union salvaged its most prominent investment project, agreeing to divert 2.4 billion euros ($3.5 billion) of public money to bail out its struggling satellite navigation project, Galileo. Intended to rival the Global Positioning System developed by the United States, Galileo has struggled with money difficulties and lengthy delays after a consortium that was supposed to get the satellite network off the ground failed to agree on financial terms. The deal was reached after a round of horse-trading among national governments fighting over the economic spoils. Late Thursday, Spain sought to block the deal because it was not granted a ground station as part of the network. Madrid finally agreed to the financing plan Friday after indications that the status of the station in Spain might be upgraded.

 RETAILER TO PAY $40 MILLION The discount retailer TJX Companies said that it had agreed to a settlement with Visa Inc. and Fifth Third Bancorp under which it would pay up to $40.9 million related to a security breach that put millions of shoppers' credit card data at risk. Visa, meanwhile, agreed to suspend or rescind various fines it had imposed against Fifth Third, TJX's card processor. TJX, the parent of the T.J.

 SAMSUNG DIVISION IS RAIDED Prosecutors in South Korea raided Samsung Securities, a financial arm of Samsung, searching for evidence of a slush fund as they expanded the investigation into a corruption scandal. About 40 prosecution officials searched the brokerage firm's headquarters in downtown Seoul for eight hours on Friday, and questioned its president, Bae Ho Won, as well as 13 other executives, the company said. They removed eight boxes of documents. Prosecutors have accused Samsung of operating a secret fund with many millions of dollars disguised as stock investments and using the money to bribe officials. Samsung has denied any wrongdoing.
 A spokesman for Samsung Securities, Kim Jin Ho, said: ''We are shocked by the search but are fully cooperating with the investigators. We don't know why our company has become a target. CHOE SANG-HUN
 RUN ON MONTANA FUND Montana school districts, cities and counties withdrew $247 million from the state's $2.4 billion investment fund over the past three days after officials said the rating on one of the pool's holdings was lowered to default. The fund, managed by the Montana Board of Investments, holds $90 million in Axon Financial, a structured investment vehicle, or SIV, that was cut to ''D'' by Standard & Poor's amid the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. 
 Officials in Florida halted withdrawals from a similar fund after counties and school districts took out $13 billion, or 48 percent of assets, on disclosures the pool held defaulted debt.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Freezing Some Rates On Loans

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department is leaning on mortgage lenders to temporarily freeze the interest rates on subprime loans for homeowners threatened with foreclosure, but the scope of any relief will depend on crucial details.
 Treasury officials said Friday that they were ''pleased by the progress'' in persuading major lenders to freeze the comparatively low rates on hundreds of thousands of home loans that are scheduled to increase over the next 18 months. 
 About two million homeowners have subprime mortgages with teaser rates that are scheduled to jump 30 percent or more. Federal officials predict that about 500,000 of those families could lose their homes; some analysts warn that the number could be significantly higher. 
 Federal officials and industry executives refused on Friday to disclose specific details, which are likely to make the difference between a plan that shields hundreds of thousands of people and one that shields almost no one. 
 On Thursday, executives from several banks met with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., as well as officials from the Federal Reserve and the other bank regulatory agencies. The meeting, first disclosed by The American Banker, included top executives at lenders like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual. The meeting included the American Securitization Forum, which represents investors and Wall Street firms with a stake in the mortgage-backed securities.
 Mr. Paulson may provide some details on Monday when he speaks to a housing conference. 
 After Thursday's meeting, industry officials said they were close to developing a standard for deciding which homeowners would qualify for a ''loan modification'' -- a temporary freeze of their teaser rates -- as well as how long the freeze would last. 
 But as of Friday night, there still appeared to be disagreements about the specifics. The chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila C. Bair, has argued in recent weeks that lenders should make the teaser rates permanent but has also said that a five-year freeze would provide a big help, according to government officials. 
 Industry executives have sought a shorter period with some recommending one year. One mortgage executive, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions are still fluid, described a three- to four-year freeze as the possible ''sweet spot'' for a compromise. 
 Advocates for distressed homeowners said a one-year freeze would do little to help troubled borrowers because few of them would be able to switch to a conventional mortgage with a lower rate in that time. A longer freeze would give homeowners time to build equity in their property or improve their credit ratings, both of which are crucial to obtaining lower rates. But a longer freeze would be costly to lenders and their investors.
 ''The tricky part is to figure out how to minimize the gaming,'' said Kurt Pfotenhauer, senior vice president of the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''All these people are contractually obligated to pay these loans on the terms they agreed to pay on. We need focus on people who, without this help, wouldn't be able to stay in their homes.''
 Several Democratic lawmakers praised Mr. Paulson's effort to promote a systematic approach by the industry. ''I am encouraged by reports of progress,'' Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said. ''If additional legislative action is necessary, we stand ready to work with the secretary as this process moves forward.''
 But specialists warned that it was too soon to describe the effort as a breakthrough, and some advocates for homeowners were skeptical that a voluntary plan by lenders would bring much relief.
 ''We need an increase in loan-modification activity that is so dramatically above what's happening in the marketplace that it's hard for a purely voluntary agreement to get the job done,'' Eric Halperin, director of the Washington office of the Center for Responsible Lending, said. 
 Mr. Halperin, citing a report by Moody's Investor Service, said mortgage servicing companies were modifying only about 1 percent of their troubled loans. One big reason, according to many specialists, is the difficulty in reaching agreement between the companies that service a mortgage and the investment funds that actually own the loan.
 But lenders and investors alike are under political pressure to come up with answers. House and Senate Democrats are pushing bills to stop so-called ''predatory lending'' that would restrict several practices that are common among subprime lenders. Democrats are also trying to pass a bill that would authorize bankruptcy judges to change the terms of a mortgage to help people keep their homes. 
 Industry executives adamantly oppose the proposal, saying it would dry up capital for mortgage financing by removing a pillar of security for investors.
 Within the industry, much of the struggle is between the original lenders and loan servicers on one side and investment funds that ended up owning the mortgages through complex investment securities on the other. Many lenders have been willing to offer freezes, but investment funds are leery because they would shoulder most of the cost.
 Harvey L. Pitt, a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who is working for some hedge funds with a stake in the debate, predicted that even a generous freeze would only benefit a minority of subprime borrowers.
 Mr. Pitt said a freeze would do nothing to help people who took out ''no-documentation'' loans, overstated their incomes and borrowed more than they could repay. Nor would a freeze help people whose mortgage is higher than the value of their homes. In the last two years, hundreds of thousands of people took out loans equal to the purchase cost of their houses -- only to see housing prices decline.
 One administration official said on Friday that Mr. Paulson was not trying to ''bang heads together'' in reaching an agreement. 
 But Randall Kroszner, a governor on the Federal Reserve Board who participated in the meeting on Thursday, said lenders and investors stood to lose less by modifying many mortgages than they would by foreclosing on a house.

HEADLINE: Endangered Species

 BODY:
In early June, the Audubon Society released a report chronicling the disturbing decline of some of America's most common bird species. This week, it issued a grim sequel: a survey that highlights the status of the species in most serious trouble, those at or near the verge of extinction. 
 In most cases, these are not familiar birds. Some, like the golden-cheeked warbler, live only in one small region. Others, like the ashy storm-petrel, live offshore and are not likely to be seen by casual observers. According to this report, called WatchList 2007, nearly a quarter of the 700 bird species in America are threatened, usually by direct human economic activity, like development and gas and oil production. 
 The shock of the decline of common species is easily felt by most of us, if only because the numbers involved are so large and the birds at risk -- including several kinds of sparrows and the common tern -- are so familiar. But the value of a species is not determined by its numbers. The loss of any species is a tragedy. 
 What the Audubon Society, and its partner the American Bird Conservancy, have compiled is an index of potential extinction. It makes it clear that humans are directly responsible for the threats that most of these birds face, but also that Americans have the ability to save many of these species by wise use of the Endangered Species Act.
 The simple fact is that birds designated by that act, like the condor or the whooping crane, stand a much better chance of survival, and even population growth, than undesignated birds. What precedes protection, as always, is awareness -- the recognition that a bird like the lesser prairie-chicken, which few of us are likely to encounter in the wild, also deserves to survive.

HEADLINE: In Settlement, Charity Will Split Its Assets

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Internal Revenue Service issued a ruling on Friday that clears the way for the settlement of a long-running dispute between Tennessee and Mississippi over a private foundation.
 Under the settlement, the Maddox Foundation of Hernando, Miss., will transfer $54 million to the Dan and Margaret Maddox Charitable Trust in Nashville over the next 60 days, and then the two organizations will go their separate ways.
 Tennessee went to court in an effort to bring the foundation's assets back to the state after its directors moved it to Mississippi without seeking court approval. It argued that Dan Maddox, who left more than $100 million when he and his wife died in a freakish boating accident in 1998, had little connection to Mississippi and had intended that the bulk of the money be used for charities in Tennessee. 
 After the move, the foundation began paying Robin G. Costa, its president and the executor of Mr. Maddox's estate, handsomely and covering a variety of her travel expenses. The foundation bought a minor league hockey team and an Arena Football League team, contending that the purchases were charitable in nature because they encouraged local economic development. 
 The financial transfer is part of a settlement the two states signed in May. They sought an I.R.S. ruling to ensure that in transferring the money from the foundation to the trust, the trust would not incur any potential liabilities of the foundation. The I.R.S. ruled that it would not.
 Each side claimed victory on Friday. 
 ''We have scores of agencies here that provide a wide range of services to the community,'' said Joseph A. Woodruff, a lawyer who represented the state of Tennessee. ''This trust will be a significant source of grants to fuel these activities.''
 In a statement, Ms. Costa said: ''The litigation has hampered the ability of the foundation to continue its delivery of charitable services to its programs and beneficiaries, many of which are in northwest Mississippi. We can now put all of those controversies behind us and move forward with a renewed commitment to improving the lives of the people of Mississippi and surrounding states.''
 Mr. Maddox built a fortune in auto financing, oil wells and real estate. Ms. Costa was a trusted employee who became executor of his estate and a director of the Maddox Foundation, then based in Nashville.
 In 2001, she and the foundation's other director, Tommye Maddox Working, the daughter of Mr. Maddox's son's wife, voted to move the foundation and its millions to Mississippi, where laws allow the director of a nonprofit corporation to make decisions without seeking the approval of other directors.
 After it transfers assets to the Tennessee trust early next year, roughly 80 percent of the foundation's remaining assets will be illiquid investments, including real estate and the sports teams. James K. Hasson Jr., a lawyer for the foundation, said it would work to restore a more balanced mix of liquid and illiquid assets.
 In addition, the foundation remains under investigation by the I.R.S. The agency does not disclose what issues it is examining, but nonprofit legal experts have questioned the foundation's purchase of the teams and various expenses incurred by Ms. Costa, including more than $1.5 million in payments to the law firm where former Gov. Ronnie Musgrove of Mississippi, works. 
 In a deposition in the case, a former foundation employee said Ms. Costa had told her and an associate that she had been having an affair with Mr. Musgrove. Mr. Musgrove denied the deposition's accusations.
 ''There are still a few open questions,'' Mr. Hasson said of the I.R.S. investigation.

HEADLINE: As Always, an Unequal Pie

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
THE distribution of wealth lies at the heart of political economics. Nations and empires have risen and fallen, and millions have died, as a result of humanity's struggle to decide how (or whether) to divide wealth.
 But for all that, the level of wealth inequality has remained remarkably consistent over the last 2,000 years, according to a recent study by Branko Milanovic, a researcher with the World Bank, and two economics professors, Peter H. Lindert of the University of California, Davis, and Jeffrey G. Williamson of Harvard University (economics.harvard.edu). 
 While ''human civilization has advanced by leaps and bounds over the past two millennia, income inequality has stayed relatively the same,'' Zubin Jelveh of Portfolio.comwrote about the study. 
 The ''inequality extraction ratio'' is basically the share of the wealth difference taken by ''elites.'' Since the United States is the wealthiest nation in history, the potential for elites taking a bigger share of the wealth (without allowing mass starvation) is greater. But they have not done so. ''Thus,'' the researchers write, ''the social consequences of increased inequality may not entail as much relative impoverishment, or as much perceived injustice, as might appear.''
 Tim Harford of Slate.com, writing about the same report, called this ''faint praise for the United States, perhaps.'' But, he added: ''It is interesting to observe that while modern societies are rich enough to be much more unequal than their predecessors, they show similar patterns of income inequality. Perhaps -- I am speculating wildly -- human societies have some hard-wired tolerance for inequality?''
 Or perhaps, no matter how wealthy a society, there will always be income inequality, whether or not we are ''hard wired'' for it. 
 REWORKED FINANCE SITEAOL has added lots of new features to its Money & Finance site -- news feeds, interactive charting abilities and more research data (money.aol.com). But users who just want to look up the price of a stock, and do not know the company's ticker symbol, still have to take the extra step of looking up the symbol first. On Google Finance, which started in March, users can simply enter the company's name (finance.google.com). 
 Despite that convenience, though, Google has been unable to catch the category leader, Yahoo Finance (finance.yahoo.com). 
 ''Google's service is not even in the top 15 of financial sites and has yet to break 1 million unique visitors a month,'' notes theTech Blog of The Financial Times (blogs.ft.com/techblog).
 BUBBLE TOWN Myrtle Beach, S.C., tops the list of cities that will be hit hardest by the housing debacle, according to a study by the consulting firm Global Insight (globalinsight.com).
 Why Myrtle Beach? One reason is higher insurance premiums in the hurricane-vulnerable resort town. 
 ''But climate-driven insurance costs would appear to take a back seat to 'get-rich-quick' madness,'' writes Andrew Leonard of Salon. Speculators own a big portion of the housing stock in Myrtle Beach.
 ODD PLACES TO EAT The Canada-focused blog Canpages.comhas a list, with pictures, of ''weird Canadian restaurants'' offering ''unique options for a dinner you won't soon forget.'' 
 At O.NOIR in Montreal, the lights are kept off. ''With not a ray gone astray, your visual sense essentially shuts down, heightening your other senses,'' the blog states. 
 The vegan Le Spirite Lounge in Montreal has two rules: Diners must ''finish their meal to get dessert'' and must ''finish dessert, or they can never go back.'' DAN MITCHELL

HEADLINE: It's December, and America Is Not in a Buying Mood

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
AMERICANS have grown much more pessimistic about both their own future and that of the economy, according to surveys being released just as the holiday shopping season gets going.
 While it is unclear how much that pessimism will influence shopping, the pollsters are finding that fewer Americans say they are planning major purchases than at any time in recent years, and that the proportion expecting the economy will create more jobs is at its lowest level since 1974. 
 Such concerns could be cited as an argument for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when its Open Market Committee meets Dec. 11, despite worries about inflation. But another survey indicates that Americans are growing more worried about the inflation outlook as well.
 Notwithstanding all the doom and gloom in the surveys, Americans generally do not seem to think things are that bad at the moment. It is in response to questions about what will happen in future months that the pessimism shows up.
 The Conference Board survey of consumer confidence, released this week, showed a rating of 115.4 for current conditions in November. That is down from a recent high of 148.5 in March, but above where the index was two years ago. But the expectations index fell to 68.7, the lowest level since early 2003, when the economy seemed to be mired in a jobless recovery after the 2001 recession.
 As is shown in the accompanying charts, only 2 percent of respondents to that survey said they planned to buy a new car within the next six months, the lowest figure since April 1974. The proportion that said they planned to buy a home during that period fell to 2.5 percent, a 13-year low. A lower-ticket item, but one whose purchase can also be delayed, is carpet. Just 3.3 percent of Americans said they planned to buy that within six months, the lowest figure since the survey began in 1967.
 Most Americans are not pessimistic, with substantial majorities saying they expect economic conditions to remain about the same. But among those who see a change coming, there are now more expecting business conditions to get worse than better and more expecting employment to fall. Americans who foresee their own income rising still outnumber those who expect to see it fall, but the proportion expecting a decline, 11 percent, is the highest since mid-2003.
 For the home building industry, there was some encouragement from a recent survey. The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index found that 60 percent of Americans think this is a good time to buy a home. That is well below the figure of a couple of years ago, but 10 percentage points above the low reached in 1990, during the last major period of weakness in home prices. But within that optimism are big changes. Fewer people now point to rising prices or favorable interest rates as a reason to buy, while the proportion who think home prices are low has leaped.
 Another survey released this week, the UBS/Gallup investor confidence survey, found that only 29 percent were optimistic that inflation would ease, while 48 percent were pessimistic. It also found more pessimism than optimism on economic growth and employment.

HEADLINE: Uneven Day Caps a Solid Week

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Stocks soared early yesterday but gradually gave up most of their gains as some negative news tempered the expectations of investors.
 Although all three major stock indexes were down in November, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have advanced for four consecutive sessions -- the Dow gained more than 600 points -- mostly on the anticipation of additional interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
 Personal spending and income rose less than expected in October, offering additional evidence of an economic slowdown, the Commerce Department reported yesterday. The data served to reinforce expectations that the Fed's policy-making board would cut interest rates when it meets later this month. 
 Technology stocks fell after Dell warned that demand might be slowing. But shares of many financial companies rose on reports that the government and lenders were discussing a plan to freeze interest rates on some subprime mortgages, a move that could stem problems in the credit and housing markets. 
 Shares in Countrywide Financial, a major lender, rose $1.52, to $10.82, while Wells Fargo rose $1.89, to $32.43. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, up more than 150 points early in the session, dropped to negative territory shortly after 3 p.m., then recovered to finish at 13,371.72, up 59.99 points, or 0.45 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.78 percent, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 0.27 percent.
 ''There isn't a tone of desperation in this market now,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford financial firm. 
 After threatening to break the $100 barrier last week, crude oil prices fell again yesterday, for their biggest weekly drop since April 2005. Oil prices in New York trading fell $2.30, to $88.71.
 While the Dow's morning rally fizzled, Ms. Krosby suggested that in a volatile environment, even a modest upswing was something to cheer. ''To get a sideways pattern in the market has a calming effect,'' she said.
 Still, a heartening week for investors was tempered by indications that the broader economy was beginning to feel the effects of high oil prices and tightened lending standards. 
 Consumer spending edged up a smaller-than-expected 0.2 percent in October while personal income grew at a 0.2 percent annual rate, below the 0.4 percent reading in September, according to the Commerce Department.
 ''The consumer definitely was a bit winded in October,'' said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial.
 Economists have warned for weeks that rising energy costs would put pressure on consumers' pocketbooks.
 Prices rose more than expected in October, a sign that inflation could be starting to tick up. A closely watched gauge, the personal consumption expenditures deflator, rose 2.9 percent last month, up from 2.4 percent in September. 
 Core prices, which exclude food and energy costs, stayed steady at an annual rate of 1.9 percent, slightly faster than analysts had predicted.
 Spending by construction companies declined more than expected in October, and business activity in the Chicago area -- considered a bellwether for broader industry -- stayed at a middling level.
 But investors took the gloomy data in stride -- in fact, the news may have pushed stocks higher. Signs of a slowdown could underscore the need for a new interest rate cut, which many investors believe is necessary to avoid a recession.
 ''In some weird, perverted, 'only Wall Street' sense, even the bad news is good,'' said James Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.
 Markets rallied at the opening bell as investors reacted to a speech on Thursday by Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, who said that a ''fresh wave of investor concern'' had led to tougher credit conditions that posed new risks to the economy, a sign that the central bank is seriously considering lowering its benchmark interest rate when it meets on Dec. 11. 
 Mr. Bernanke said that investors had been unnerved by losses and write-downs on home loans and that a new round of turbulence in financial markets had reversed some of the recovery in credit markets after a panic broke out in August over subprime mortgages.
 ''Needless to say, the Federal Reserve is following the evolution of financial conditions carefully, with particular attention to the question of how strains in financial markets might affect the broader economy,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke's comments came on the heels of remarks by Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's vice chairman, who pledged that the bank would be ''flexible and pragmatic.'' Fed officials foresee growth next year of 1.8 percent to 2.5 percent.
 Interest rates were steady yesterday with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling 1/32, to 102 17/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, at 3.94 percent, up from 3.93 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Rambo And The G.O.P.

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I don't know if children should be allowed to watch the Republican presidential debates.
 There's so much talk of violence and mayhem as the solution to our ills. The candidates seem so eager to flex their muscles and engage the nation in conflict: Let's continue the war in Iraq. Let's show them what we're made of in Iran. Let's round up those immigrants and ship 'em back where they came from.
 It's like watching adolescent boys playing the ultimate video game, with no regard for the consequences. Rudy, the crime-fighter and terror maven, says he's tougher than Mitt, who actually had illegals working on his property. Mitt begs to differ and says he'd like to double the size of the Guantanamo prison. 
 Are we electing a president or a sheriff?
 Representative Tom Tancredo of Colorado wants to stop all immigration, legal and illegal. Too much immigration brings problems, he said. Among other things, ''it makes it difficult for us to assimilate.''
 (The bludgeoning of logic is yet another form of violence coming out of the debates.)
 We've got the thunderclouds of a recession heading our way. We're in the midst of a housing foreclosure crisis that is tragic in its dimensions. We've got forty-some-million people without health coverage. And the city of New Orleans is still on its knees.
 So you tune in to the G.O.P. debate on CNN to see what's what, and they're talking about -- guns.
 Former Mayor Giuliani, once a gun-control champion, has swallowed the party's Kool-Aid straight from the packet, not even bothering to mix it with water. ''People will be allowed to have guns,'' he said. ''I'm not going to interfere with that.''
 It can be scary for small children to watch the former mayor of New York morph into Wayne LaPierre on national TV.
 I'll concede that it's difficult to have a thoughtful exploration of complex issues in a format that allows a candidate just 90 seconds to answer. But the Republicans, far more than the Democrats, go out of their way to present themselves as 21st-century Rambos -- a childish, cartoonish posture that solves nothing and can easily lead to tragedy in a world that is in fact quite dangerous.
 You'd think that a presidential campaign would be the perfect venue for a serious discussion about Iraq, the greatest foreign policy debacle in the republic's history. But even John McCain, who frequently seems as if he is the class of this G.O.P. field, followed up his comment about appeasement allowing Hitler to flourish with the following simplistic reference to Iraq:
 ''I just finished having Thanksgiving dinner with the troops, and their message to you is, the message of these brave men and women who are serving there is: 'Let us win.' ''
 How is that helpful or enlightening? What does he mean by ''win?'' And win at what additional cost to human life and other resources?
 The Republicans running for president are embarrassed to mention George W. Bush. But with few exceptions -- Mr. McCain's principled position on torture is one -- they want to continue Mr. Bush's failed, often belligerent and sometimes sadistic policies. (On immigration, an issue ripe for demagoguery, most of the howling G.O.P. pack has sprinted away from Mr. Bush, preferring a more macho, politically exploitive approach. Mr. McCain is again an exception.)
 The incessant drumbeat of brute force as the favored solution to difficult problems serves to normalize state violence to the point where we hardly notice it. Before his widely reported crack about Jesus being too smart to run for office, former Gov. Mike Huckabee talked proudly about the tough challenge he faced in ''carrying out'' the death penalty in Arkansas.
 ''I did it more than any other governor ever had to do it in my state,'' he said.
 The Republican Party has won a lot of elections in recent years. So maybe this crop of candidates knows something about American voters that many us would rather not acknowledge, that too many of them are small-minded, fearful, bigoted and too shallow to recognize policies that are against their own -- and their country's -- best interests.
 Or maybe that's not the case at all. Maybe this lot of Republican presidential candidates is misreading the public, and placing its bet on the wrong side of history.
 I hope it's the latter. Maybe voters in the early primaries will deliver the message that a more thoughtful, insightful, inclusive and constructive style of campaigning is desired.
 Maybe then we can finally get issues like torture off the table (Mr. McCain and Mr. Romney had a testy exchange over waterboarding the other night) and squarely address the concerns so many voters have about the deteriorating economic climate here at home and America's diminished standing abroad.

HEADLINE: DEAL IN CONGRESS ON PLAN TO RAISE FUEL EFFICIENCY

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER and MICHELINE MAYNARD. 
John M. Broder reported from Washington and Micheline Maynard from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Congressional negotiators reached a deal late Friday on energy legislation that would force American automakers to improve the fuel efficiency of their cars and light trucks by 40 percent by 2020.
 The proposal, which would require automakers to achieve 35 miles per gallon on average, is similar to a measure that was passed in the summer by the Senate but was bitterly opposed by the auto companies, who argued they did not have the technology or the financial resources to reach that goal.
 The auto companies gave up their long-held opposition to fuel- economy increases not long before the Senate version was passed, but proposed a much weaker alternative. In recent weeks, the chief executives of General Motors, the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler visited Capitol Hill in an effort to fend off a stronger measure, but the compromise announced Friday showed those efforts had little effect.
 The compromise emerged after days of difficult negotiations between House and Senate members and their staffs. The final deal was hammered out by the two main antagonists, the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the auto industry's most effective advocate on Capitol Hill. 
 The compromise should ensure passage in the House, although the Senate may insist on changes. It does not appear to include provisions, like $16 billion in new taxes on the oil industry, that drew a veto threat from President Bush.
 The latest version of the measure, if it becomes law, will force wrenching changes on the American car companies, from design studios to new-car showrooms to executive suites. Automakers now have to achieve 27.5 miles per gallon on cars, a figure that has not changed since 1984, and 22.2 miles per gallon for light trucks, including minivans, sport utility vehicles and pickups. Under the compromise, the companies will retain the distinction between the classes of vehicles, but must still meet a combined 35 m.p.g. fleetwide standard.
 Ms. Pelosi called the compromise on mileage ''an historic advancement in our efforts in the Congress to address our energy security and laying strong groundwork for climate legislation next year.'' She said that she was confident it would win the backing of environmentalists, auto makers and labor and would clear Congress by the end of this year.
 Mr. Dingell, in a statement, called the new mileage standard ''aggressive and attainable.'' 
 ''After weeks of productive discussion and negotiation, we have achieved consensus on several provisions that provide critical environmental safeguards without jeopardizing American jobs,'' he said. Critical to his agreement, he said, were incentives to the American auto industry for producing small cars in the United States and cars that run on a combination of gasoline and ethanol.
 The Big Three automakers have warned that complying with the new fuel economy rules will cost them tens of billions of dollars and rob consumers of choices. But even if they meet the law's mandate, the fuel efficiency of the American car fleet will still lag far behind that of other major industrialized countries. 
 European auto companies, for example, must average 40 miles per gallon and China requires a 35 m.p.g. standard. Automobiles sold in those countries are generally smaller and less powerful than the most popular models in the United States, however.
 Lawmakers and aides were still ironing out the other major parts of the pending energy legislation Friday night, including details of a provision calling for a huge increase in production of fuels made from corn and other renewable sources. 
 The package will also include a requirement that most electric utilities produce 15 percent of their power from renewable sources, like wind and solar, by 2020.
 A multibillion-dollar package of tax measures to pay for the other provisions was still under discussion Friday night but was not expected to be in the legislation to be brought to the House next week.
 The energy bill faces opposition from segments of the auto, oil and utility industries, among the best organized and well financed lobbies in Washington. But House and Senate leaders expressed confidence on Friday that they could win passage before the end of the year.
 The energy package, intended to reduce the nation's dependence on fossil fuels and slow the production of the gases that contribute to global warming, would bring major changes to America's highways, farms, factories, refineries and power plants. It contains not only the fuel-economy rules, which will alter the American auto fleet, but will divert vast tracts of farmland to produce ethanol and other renewable fuels and bring a bonanza for solar and wind power.
 Under terms of the auto mileage deal, the cars and trucks sold in the United States must meet a fleetwide average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. The Senate passed a bill with this standard in June, but the House version of the legislation, passed in August, did not include any new mileage mandate because of opposition led by Mr. Dingell. 
 Speaker Pelosi supported the new mileage standard and vowed that she would restore it in the final bill. She appears to have prevailed but Mr. Dingell won some important concessions. 
 The package nearly fell apart this week when Mr. Dingell insisted on leaving sole authority to regulate automobile mileage standards with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an arm of the Transportation Department. That would have weakened the power of the Environmental Protection Agency and the states, led by California, to regulate auto emissions of carbon dioxide, which are in large measure a function of the amount of fuel burned. 
 Federal court rulings this year have decided this so-called pre-emption issue in favor of the E.P.A. and the states, decisions that Mr. Dingell hoped to undo by Congressional action. The traffic safety administration has had authority over fuel-efficiency standards since 1975 but has not imposed any significant increase since 1985. The E.P.A. is currently writing rules to comply with a Supreme Court ruling this year that gave it the authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions and is weighing an application by California and 14 other states to set their own emissions standard.
 The authority of the E.P.A. to regulate tailpipe emissions and the right of California and other states to set their own, higher standards were considered deal-breakers by Ms. Pelosi and her fellow California Democrat, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, weighed in late in the week to tell negotiators that he would oppose the bill if the Mr. Dingell's preemption language stayed in. 
 Mrs. Pelosi and Democratic leaders in the Senate rejected Mr. Dingell's preemption effort, but softened the blow by agreeing to allow the car companies to retain a credit for vehicles capable of running on a blend of gasoline and ethanol. That credit was set to expire in 2008 but now will begin to decline in 2014 and be eliminated entirely by 2020.
 The compromise also contains incentives for American auto companies to continue producing small cars in the United States, a measure that the autoworkers union has estimated would save 17,000 autoworker jobs.

HEADLINE: Both Sides in Writers' Strike See New-Media Future at Stake

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The nearly month-old strike by screenwriters has entered a new and perhaps uglier phase, revealing the conflict for what it has been all along: not so much a tiff over industry economics as a struggle for power over Hollywood's perceived digital future.
 On Thursday night, striking television and movie writers angrily rejected an elaborate package of new proposals from their employers just hours after it was presented. By Friday morning, executives at the country's largest entertainment conglomerates were privately expressing shock that negotiators for the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East had dismissed without discussion the first phase of what the companies called a New Economic Partnership.
 The proposals were intended to end the strike by offering revised terms for the use of movies and shows on the Internet. But the writers bitterly complained that the package was merely a public relations ploy, failing to meet the guilds' core demands, including an insistence on new- media compensation at a multiple many times what they have received for years from DVD sales. 
 ''You can't put lipstick on a pig,'' said Mona Mangan, executive director of the East Coast guild, in a Friday morning telephone interview. ''They're trying to make a statement that they are, in fact, looking for a resolution. It's illusory.''
 Talks are set to resume here on Tuesday, and the companies, which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, have promised to present additional pieces of their fresh offer. But prospects for resolving what has already become a lengthy strike appeared dim. So far, television audiences and moviegoers have experienced little fallout from the strike. The late-night talk shows, including ''The Late Show With David Letterman'' and ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' immediately went dark, and shows like ''Two and a Half Men'' and ''The Office'' shut production. 
 The networks still have several new episodes of most of their series in reserve, and prime time will be relatively unaffected until early next year. Because feature films typically require lead times of a year or more, the strike, even if prolonged, will not significantly affect release schedules until 2009.
 For the nonwriting employees of many of the shuttered shows, however, the strike has brought financial hardship. On Friday, for example, NBC laid off the staff members of ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno.''
 As guild leaders dug in -- ''we must return to the lines on Monday in force'' the presidents of both unions told members in a Thursday night e-mail message -- the companies uncorked an offensive of their own. After months of sidestepping discussion of strike issues, studio and network executives worked the telephones with reporters, explaining their positions and signaling resolve at least equal to that of striking writers.
 They described their cause as a necessary struggle against union-imposed pay structures and restrictions that, if accepted, would keep their companies from operating effectively in a rowdy Internet world that has already badly damaged the music and news industries. 
 ''I won't participate in writing the death sentence for this industry,'' said one senior executive, who declined to be identified to avoid making his company a target of writers. This executive and others said the new proposal -- with details that were not fully disclosed by either side -- had been intended to spur vigorous bargaining by crossing conceptual lines that studios had earlier declared off-limits. It offered a fixed residual for Web-streamed programs that had none under prior proposals, opened the door to payments for digital broadcasts, and offered the guild jurisdiction over new-media productions that are based on work initially done for conventional television, according to a fact-sheet distributed by the producers alliance on Friday.
 The new proposal was delivered to guild leaders in a so-called ''sidebar'' -- less than a full session -- late Thursday morning, after three days of largely fruitless negotiation that was partly brokered by Bryan Lourd, a prominent talent agent and partner in the Creative Artists Agency. According to people involved with the talks, guild leaders met among themselves, then said they would need until Tuesday to digest the complicated package. 
 A few hours later, however, a letter from guild leaders blasted the new offer as a ''massive rollback,'' apparently because it offered less for shows distributed via new media than is paid for old.
 The leaders said, for instance, that it would pay only $250 for a year's reuse of an hourlong program streamed on the Web, in contrast to the $20,000 currently paid for a network rerun. They also said the new proposal did not change the company's proposed payments for downloaded films and shows. (The producers have offered writers the same residual rate they get for DVDs, which works out to 0.36 percent of wholesale revenues, which amounts to pennies per DVD but tens of thousands of dollars on the millions of copies of even modest hits; writers are seeking a rate of 2.5 percent.) The guilds also said the companies refused to grant them union jurisdiction over original content produced for the Internet.
 Jurisdictional issues have been a little-discussed hot button in the negotiations. Guild leaders have fought to assert their hold over larger swaths of what their letter described as ''multinational conglomerates,'' including units that produce reality television without guild writers, even as company executives have insisted on keeping union authority confined to their traditional movie and television businesses.
 Company executives on Friday derided the union leaders' description of their proposals as being built on a misguided notion that programming distributed via new media, which pulls in little revenue at the moment, should be bring in higher pay than old-media work. As of Friday morning, showrunners -- the writer-producers who supervise television shows -- had been told of no plans to reconvene an ad hoc group, United Showrunners, that had put pressure on companies early in the strike by making a show of solidarity with the guild. 
 Many writer-producers have quietly returned to their supervisory, though not writing, duties in the last few weeks; and a number of shows are now either shut down by the strike or preparing for a Christmas hiatus, reducing the effectiveness of any immediate action by the highly paid writer-producers, whose loyalty is crucial to the guilds' ability to prosecute a long strike.
 Cognizant of their importance, company executives privately said they expected to put their full proposal directly into the hands of guild members, so they would not be reliant on their leaders' interpretation.
 Their determination to find listeners within the guild ranks was apparently matched by the resolve of guild leadership to maintain the walkout. Ms. Mangan, for instance, made it clear that she regarded speculation that the guilds might soon return to work without a contract, perhaps joining later with the larger Screen Actors Guild in a larger action, as fanciful.
 ''I don't see it as an option,'' she said. ''I frankly cannot see ending this strike without a resolution.'' But there were some glimmers of hope late Friday afternoon when David Young, executive director of the West Coast guild, sounded a somewhat more conciliatory note. In a response to an e-mailed query, Mr. Young said guild leaders were pleased to know that companies were now offering an economic package they say will add $130 million to the $1.3 billion they already pay writers. 
 ''We look forward to returning to bargaining on Tuesday,'' Mr. Young wrote.

HEADLINE: Roger B. Smith, 82, Ex-Chief of G.M., Dies

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Mary M. Chapman and Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Roger B. Smith, the General Motors executive who tried to modernize the American automotive giant during the 1980s but instead became associated with its decline, died Thursday in suburban Detroit. He was 82.
 Tom Wilkinson, a G.M. spokesman, said Mr. Smith died after a short illness. G.M. did not give the cause.
 Mr. Smith, who was the company's chairman and chief executive from 1981 to 1990, became widely known to filmgoers in 1989 as the involuntary focus of the satiric documentary ''Roger & Me,'' which started Michael Moore's career as a director. 
 Mr. Smith was ''almost a character in Greek tragedy, the great man with the tragic flaw,'' said Marina von Neumann Whitman, who was a G.M. vice president during Mr. Smith's tenure and is now a professor of business administration at the University of Michigan. 
 Douglas A. Fraser, who was president of the United Automobile Workers union while Mr. Smith was chief executive, said of him, ''He tried to change the corporation, but he couldn't quite pull it off.'' 
 Mr. Smith led G.M. during one of the most wrenching decades in the history of the company and the automobile industry. As the 1980s began, G.M. sat atop the automobile industry, as it had since the end of World War II, with 46 percent of American market share.
 But by the time Mr. Smith retired, in 1990, G.M. held only 35 percent of the American market, with a lineup of look-alike automobiles blemished by poor quality. Customers were turning to Japanese companies and resurgent Detroit players like the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation.
 Variously described as arrogant and casual in manner, with ruddy skin and a high-pitched voice, Mr. Smith remained a controversial figure in Detroit long after he had left the automotive scene. 
 ''Roger Smith's tenure was one of the darkest in General Motors' history, for customers, workers and for residents of G.M.'s factory towns,'' the consumer advocate Ralph Nader said in 1995.
 But G.M.'s current chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said yesterday that Mr. Smith ''knew that we have to accept change, understand change and learn to make it work for us.''
 ''Roger was truly a pioneer in the fast-moving global industry that we now take for granted,'' Mr. Wagoner said.
 Roger Bonham Smith was born July 12, 1925, in Columbus, Ohio, the son of E. Quimby Smith and Bess Obetz Smith, and moved to Detroit as a youngster. He attended high school in Detroit and received his undergraduate and M.B.A. degrees from the University of Michigan. 
 He joined G.M. after serving in the Navy in World War II and spent his entire career there, rising through its financial ranks at a time when the company chose its chief executive from among its ''bean counters.'' 
 One of his first steps after becoming chief executive in 1981 was to order a reorganization of G.M.'s far-flung operations, which had been decentralized since the days of its legendary president, Alfred P. Sloan.
 Under Mr. Smith, the company branched out to explore new technologies, like robotics, electronics and data processing. It bought Hughes Electronics, as well as Electronic Data Systems, known as E.D.S. 
 But many of Mr. Smith's steps added layers of complexity, at times bringing the company to a virtual standstill while managers sorted out who would take responsibility.
 Even Mr. Smith voiced frustration at the outcome. ''Wouldn't it have been wonderful if I could have flipped a switch and it would have been done?'' he said in a 1995 interview.
 ''To his credit, he knew something was wrong there, so he began an age of frantic experimentation,'' said James P. Womack, chief executive of the Lean Enterprise Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and the co-author of ''The Machine That Changed the World,'' a study of Japanese factories in the United States. 
 Mr. Smith's name is associated with a number of automotive disasters. One was the GM-10 project, a series of cars shared by G.M.'s different brands intended to establish a more efficient way of product development but ended up being an experiment that ultimately cost the company $7 billion.
 The cars, as well as other models sold by G.M.'s divisions, were derided for looking too much alike; Lincoln lampooned them in an ad for its luxury cars. ''In the end some terrible damage was done'' to G.M.'s reputation, said Jon Lowell, a veteran Detroit automotive journalist.
 Mr. Smith had better success with a joint venture with the Toyota Motor Company to build small cars in California. He made the first gesture to Toyota's chief executive, Eiji Toyoda, a member of the company's founding family.
 Protectionist threats against Japan were mounting in the United States when the two men met at a country club in 1982 to discuss the small-car idea. (Toyota had earlier tried unsuccessfully to persuade Ford to participate in a joint-production plan.) G.M. and Toyota eventually settled on a G.M. plant in Fremont, Calif., using Toyota's production methods to build small vehicles for each company.
 Mr. Smith did not stop there. He built half a dozen new factories in North America and started the Saturn Corporation, which was meant to be a ''clean sheet of paper'' approach to producing and selling automobiles, particularly small cars, to compete with Japanese models.
 The Saturn announcement came as the industry was climbing out of a recession, and competition for the site of its factory was fierce. Governors, mayors and civic officials from around the United States poured into Mr. Smith's office on the 14th floor of the G.M. Building in Detroit, offering the company millions of dollars in incentives to land the plant.
 In the end, Mr. Smith chose Spring Hill, Tenn., about 35 miles south of Nashville, not far from the Tennessee plant built by the Nissan Motor Corporation. The Saturn plant officially opened the day before he retired in July 1990, rolling the first of its plastic-sided cars off the assembly line as he looked on. 
 Even though he promoted labor-management cooperation at Saturn, Mr. Smith became a target for the United Automobile Workers union. It struck G.M. several times during his tenure, notably in 1984, shutting the company for several weeks. 
 He angered working-class Detroit residents by building a factory in a traditionally Polish neighborhood, nicknamed Poletown. Though the struggling city welcomed the project, dozens of homes had to be demolished and hundreds of people relocated.
 While Mr. Smith was building new factories, G.M. was cutting jobs at older ones, as in Flint, Mich., Mr. Moore's hometown. In ''Roger & Me,'' Mr. Moore vividly depicted the decline in Flint, where one of every two residents had once worked for the company. The film chronicled an often-humorous effort by Mr. Moore to track down Mr. Smith to challenge him over Flint's demise.
 In fact, Mr. Smith was an accessible executive, regularly sitting for interviews and occasionally ferrying journalists back to their offices in his chauffeur-driven Cadillac. (Yesterday, Mr. Moore's Web site posted a picture of Mr. Smith framed in black.) 
 His candor raised the hackles of union leaders, including Mr. Fraser, the U.A.W.'s president at the time. After Mr. Smith threatened to shut plants during sensitive negotiations in 1982, Mr. Fraser vowed to find ''a zipper for Roger Smith's lips.'' 
 Mr. Smith also clashed with E.D.S.'s founder, H. Ross Perot, whom he put on the G.M. board after purchasing his company. Mr. Perot began criticizing G.M. as intransigent, infuriating Mr. Smith, who sought his ouster. Mr. Perot eventually left, with a $700 million buyout that barred him from discussing G.M. 
 Mr. Smith is survived by his wife of 53 years, Barbara; two sons, Roger B. Smith and Drew J. Smith; two daughters, Jennifer A. Ponski and Victoria B. Sawula; and six grandchildren.
 Despite the many controversies in his career, Mr. Smith said time would bear out the wisdom of his decisions. 
 ''I don't expect them to build a big stone monument to me; that's not my goal in life,'' he said in the 1995 interview. ''I'd like to think that if I did anything extraordinary, it was the work that we did in getting the corporation ready for the 21st century.''
 But General Motors continued to decline after he left. It has since spun off E.D.S. and Hughes Electronics, Mr. Smith's two major acquisitions, and it was passed temporarily by Toyota this year as the world's biggest car company; G.M. now holds only about 24 percent of the American market. 
 Today the company is in the midst of its latest restructuring, which calls for it to cut 30,000 jobs by next year. This fall, G.M. reached an agreement with 73,000 union workers in the United States, one-fifth the number when Mr. Smith was chief executive.
 ''He never could crack his own culture,'' Ms. Whitman, the former G.M. vice president, said of her former boss. ''He tried to become a modern leader, when he really was the old, imperious-style C.E.O. I do believe he tried, though.''

HEADLINE: Labor Pacts In Detroit Didn't Ease Stocks' Slide

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley reported from Detroit and Micheline Maynard from New York.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
Detroit auto companies have long expected a quid pro quo from Wall Street when it came to their dealings with the United Automobile Workers union. 
 Once the companies won labor contracts that improved their competitiveness, investors would bid up their share prices, or so they thought.
 Instead, shares of General Motors and the Ford Motor Company have been sliding since this summer when talks began on new four-year contracts. While the shares rose Friday, along with the market, the outlook for auto sales in 2008 is increasingly pessimistic as the broader economy struggles and the housing crisis deepens. 
 That has gotten the 2008 model year off to a gloomy start for auto companies, which on Monday are expected to report lower sales for November. The carmakers are relying on new versions of vehicles like the Chevrolet Malibu and the Ford Focus to lure buyers into showrooms.
 G.M. shares have fallen by a third since reaching a 52-week high of $43.20 in mid-October, shortly after members of the U.A.W. ratified a contract that was reached after a two-day strike.
 Ford's share price has fallen about 25 percent since starting talks with the union in July, even though it reached a deal without walkouts like the ones at G.M. and Chrysler.
 ''Structural issues are clearly getting better,'' an analyst at Morgan Stanley, Jonathan Steinmetz, said Friday in a research report, ''but cyclical factors are clearly getting worse.''
 It is an especially abrupt reversal for G.M. Its share price rose 57.7 percent last year, making it the stock with the biggest increase among the Dow Jones industrial average.
 G.M.'s chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, helped heighten the gloom Thursday night at a dinner with analysts in Manhattan. According to analysts' reports, Mr. Henderson predicted that automobile sales in the United States, which are expected to be slightly more than 16 million this year, would fall to about 15.7 million in 2008.
 The news caused concern, analysts said, because G.M. based its reorganization plan two years ago on an annual selling rate of 17 million vehicles, the level in the early part of the decade.
 Mr. Steinmetz at Morgan Stanley said G.M. clearly expects ''a tough near-term environment.'' 
 An analyst with Lehman Brothers, Brian Johnson, said the overall economy was simply too distressed for investors to feel upbeat about the Detroit companies. He said G.M.'s shares have fallen more than Ford's because the company's financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, has been hit hard by the collapse of the subprime mortgage market. Ford has little exposure to subprime mortgages.
 ''The good news is Ford and G.M. are no longer basket-case restructuring plays,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''But having turned themselves into a cyclical stock, they're coming in at a point when investors don't want to touch those stocks.''
 On Friday, shares of G.M. rose $1.09 to $29.87, and Ford rose 22 cents to $7.51.
 The deteriorating economic environment has led both G.M. and Chrysler to make more cuts. G.M. said it was eliminating shifts at three plants, and Chrysler said it would cut 11,000 more jobs, on top of 13,000 announced earlier. The news came five days after workers narrowly approved a contract, following a six-hour strike.
 The reductions might not end there. This week, Chrysler's chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, told employees that more layoffs could be needed if the market weakens more than expected.
 Separately, Chrysler's vice president for North American sales, Steven Landry, told business students at his alma mater in Nova Scotia that Chrysler anticipated losing about $1 billion in the 2008 fiscal year, on top of a $1.5 billion loss in 2007. That was an unexpected disclosure for an executive from Chrysler, which became a private company this year and no longer has to disclose financial data.
 Mr. Landry, who was speaking at a ceremony to present a donation from Chrysler, said the company expected to break even in 2008 before becoming profitable in 2009, according to The Daily News in Halifax.
 A Chrysler spokeswoman, Lori Pinter, declined to confirm the figures. Mr. Landry ''was speaking off the cuff and using some general examples from the standpoint of mentoring the students,'' she said.
 Analysts are forecasting that all three Detroit carmakers will report sales declines on Monday, when they release November figures. Toyota, Honda and Nissan of Japan, which have fewer trucks in their lineups, are expected to post increases.
 Chrysler is expected to report a double-digit decline, according to Edmunds.com, which predicts an 11.2 percent drop, while Mr. Johnson expects a 17 percent decline. The analysts said they expected smaller decreases for G.M. and for Ford, whose sales have fallen for 12 consecutive months.

HEADLINE: Poor Non-Urban Districts Await Corzine's Revised School Aid Plan

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU

 BODY:
The century-old building that houses Columbus Elementary School in Carteret, N.J., has become so crowded that art and music classes must share the same space. There is no high-tech language lab, so a Spanish teacher carries materials from classroom to classroom on a rolling cart.
 The students at the school, once predominantly working class and white, are now largely from immigrant families. More than two-thirds are poor enough to qualify for lunches that are free or reduced in price. 
 It is schools like Columbus that Gov. Jon S. Corzine's administration has in mind in proposing a new school financing formula that would spend at least $400 million next year on disadvantaged children in mainly rural or suburban communities like Carteret. Because it is not one of New Jersey's 31 Abbott districts, Carteret cannot benefit from the vast pool of state education money reserved for disadvantaged students under the current school financing system. 
 The new formula, expected to be officially unveiled next week, would replace a system that puts more than half of all state school aid to the Abbott districts, which enroll about one-fifth of the state's students, and sends the rest to the state's 584 other districts, based largely on need. 
 Governor Corzine has argued that the Abbott designation has become meaningless, because other districts serve students who are just as poor. Supporters of the Abbott system insist that it still plays a vital role.
 In Carteret, across Arthur Kill from Staten Island, the board of education and town officials sued the state Education Department unsuccessfully at least three times since the mid-1990s to win an Abbott designation. Then they lobbied local legislators and the governor's office to get more money for what they term ''Abbott-like districts.''
 ''I feel that a town like Carteret is penalized because we don't get the kind of funding in the Abbott districts, and yet the students who go to our schools are not any different,'' said Brent MacConnell, principal of Columbus Elementary. ''We're one of those fringe towns that is so close and yet so far.''
 The present system grew out of a 1981 lawsuit, Abbott v. Burke, which led to a court-ordered effort to narrow the achievement gap between rich and poor students, whites and minorities. In a series of decisions that set a precedent for school equality cases, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the poorest urban districts should be given the resources to spend as much on their students as the wealthiest suburban districts.
 John Myers, a consultant who specializes in school financing issues, said this week that the Abbott decision was one of the best attempts at the time to ensure that additional state education money reached poor communities. The plan focused on a small number of districts, though, and failed to provide adequately for poor students in the rest of the state, he said. 
 That problem has become increasingly obvious in recent years as demographic shifts have changed the state economic landscape. The differences between Abbott and non-Abbott districts have fostered resentments in towns that have repeatedly raised taxes and cut school budgets to offset their own dwindling share of state aid. 
 Critics have charged that some Abbott districts, like Camden, have wasted millions of dollars through fiscal mismanagement, while others, like Hoboken, continue to benefit, even though they are not so poor anymore. 
 In a news conference yesterday, the state education commissioner, Lucille E. Davey, pointed out that the original Abbott districts were identified by the Department of Community Affairs as distressed cities in the 1970s. She said the new formula would be applied equally to all districts, regardless of whether they have the Abbott designation. ''They're going to be looked at just like any other district,'' she said. 
 Ms. Davey said that under the new formula, aid for preschool programs would be expanded to more non-Abbott districts. The state now pays for preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds in Abbott districts, regardless of their family income. Under the new formula, a wealthier Abbott district would receive money only for 3- and 4-year-olds who were poor or disadvantaged.
 Some Abbott district officials and advocates said yesterday that they would oppose any reductions in state aid to their districts. They said their districts still have large concentrations of poor students and a long history of socioeconomic inequality to overcome, even in places like Hoboken that have experienced an economic upturn.
 Jack Raslowsky, the superintendent in Hoboken, said that more than three-quarters of the 2,600 students there were eligible for free or reduced-rate lunches. He said that he did not oppose the new formula, but that he believed Hoboken should continue to receive what it does now. ''The governor should not assist other districts at the expense of Hoboken or any of the other Abbott districts,'' he said.
 In Carteret, where brown fields are all that remain of its once thriving copper and chemical factories, school officials have struggled for years to adequately serve the influx of Hispanic, Indian, Pakistani and Filipino families that have transformed the town. School enrollment has grown steadily to 4,100 from 2,770 in 1995. Meanwhile, school budgets have been tight; this year, the district is using money in its emergency fund to replace broken boilers in the high school.
 Daniel J. Reiman, the Carteret mayor, said he has been frustrated when he compares his town's crowded, aging schools with the shiny new buildings rising in the Abbott districts, many of them with hardwood floors and cathedral-style ceilings. ''I can't get money for school construction, yet certain Abbott districts are able to get funding for artificial football fields,'' he said. ''You realize something's wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed.''
 Sandra DeQuarto, who has three children in the Carteret schools, said the list of classroom supplies that parents have to buy grows longer every year and now includes everything from calculators to rulers and glue. ''I'd love to see our schools get more money,'' she said. ''It would put us on the same playing field.''

HEADLINE: Charge the Rent, but Only if You Don't Need To

BYLINE: By JANET MORRISSEY

 BODY:
SEVERAL credit card companies have introduced programs over the last year allowing homeowners and renters to pay their monthly housing bills with a credit card. For the cash savvy, the program is a potential windfall, allowing users to rack up rewards points that qualify them for free trips and other perks. 
 But, financial experts say, those who are already in credit trouble should generally steer clear. They worry that cash-short homeowners, squeezed by falling house prices, rising interest rates and a general credit tightening, could use their credit cards as a short-term fix to avoid losing their house -- and this could ultimately push the homeowner into even deeper credit problems. 
 Both American Express and Visa offer programs allowing people to pay their mortgage or rent using a credit card. 
 American Express first started offering the initiative in 2003, when it teamed up with a residential developer, Related Companies, to allow tenants to pay rent at 16 of its rental buildings in New York and San Francisco. At the time, housing was booming and landlords were jockeying for ways to lure people away from homeownership and into rental properties. 
 David J. Wine, vice chairman of Related Companies, said the program had been hugely successful. ''Rents in Manhattan are among the highest in the country and when you're paying $4,000 or $5,000 in rent for an apartment, its nice to get something back'' through the credit card rewards programs, he said. American Express has since extended the program to about 200 cities in 35 states. 
 In May 2007, American Express expanded the concept to mortgages. It formed partnerships with American Home Mortgage (which has since filed for bankruptcy protection) and IndyMac Bank to allow cardholders to make their mortgage payments with credit cards if they closed a mortgage with one of the two partners. 
 Sarah Meron, a spokeswoman for American Express, emphasized that the program caters to people with strong credit and payment histories and does not include subprime mortgages. She said efforts were under way to seek more banks to participate in the program. 
 Visa started offering similar rental and mortgage payment programs this year. 
 Steven Altman, who is 38, enrolled in Visa's program at his Manhattan rental building, Tribeca Green, in February. 
 ''I signed up for it as soon as they offered it,'' said Mr. Altman, who has lived in the building since 2005. ''It's easy, it's automatic and it's convenient.'' Mr. Altman, a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, said the program suited him because he always paid his rent on time and always paid off his credit card in full. 
 ''If you pay your rent on time, you might as well do it this way and get the points,'' said Mr. Altman, who estimated that his monthly rent would accumulate enough points to qualify for several free airline tickets a year. ''You're just writing the check to a different place.''
 Mr. Altman said he would definitely sign up for the mortgage option if he purchased a home. ''Who doesn't love points?'' he asked.
 For homeowners with no liquidity problems, the credit card program is similar to an interest-free loan, said Nessa Feddis, a lawyer with the American Bankers Association. ''Basically, you're paying your mortgage with your credit card on one date, and then you don't have to actually have to pay it off until a couple of weeks later.''
 The program could also be a short-term solution for homeowners and renters facing temporary money problems because of an illness or unexpected expense, Ms. Feddis said. ''It's useful in an emergency.'' 
 But, said Paul Miller, managing director at the FBR Group, those who are not making a payment out of their income will probably default on the loan at some point. ''If you need a credit card to make a house payment, you're a very distressed borrower and most likely you're going to run into trouble.''
 Anthony L. Ebers, IndyMac's chief operating officer, emphasized that his bank offered the mortgage credit card program only to people with high credit scores and solid track records for paying their rent or mortgage on time. Since teaming up with American Express, he said, about 50 people have signed up for the program and none have defaulted on their payments. 
 But Mr. Ebers said he continued to monitor the program closely. He said his company planned to meet with American Express on April 2, 2008, to assess the pilot program. 
 Although the credit card mortgage programs try to weed out people with poor credit records, they do not eliminate them entirely. ''You can always do a cash advance on your credit card and pay a mortgage that way,'' said Vicki Vidal, senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''A lender can't control that.''
 Statistics in Britain show that homeowners have already been tapping their cards. A British poll released in October indicated that more than a million households had used a credit card to make a monthly mortgage or rental payment in the last 12 months. The poll, conducted by British marketing research firm YouGov for Roof magazine, indicated that 6 percent of all households had used credit cards, with the highest percentage, 7.5 percent, among young people, age 18 to 24. 
 In the United States, outstanding balances on credit cards rose 6 percent on average in the second quarter, which is double the quarterly average increase from 2002 to 2006, said Dennis Moroney, senior analyst at TowerGroup, a financial services research and advisory firm. This indicates people are either using their credit cards more often or they are using the cards for bigger expenses like mortgages and rents, he said. 
 Mr. Moroney estimated that the average household currently holds six or seven credit cards. ''There's an enormous amount of credit cards out there that are held, but are not necessarily used right now,'' he said. Consumers may start to take advantage of that, he added.
 Christopher J. Spoth, assistant director of supervision at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, said that it is important for credit card companies to monitor credit card balances and rescore people regularly. ''There are a lot of people walking around with 16 credit cards in their wallet,'' he said. ''That's clearly a potential risk and why credit card providers need to monitor that.''

HEADLINE: New Rallying Cry: Save the Small Airports

BYLINE: By BARBARA S. PETERSON

 BODY:
NOT long ago, many of New Jersey's small airports were endangered because of opposition from local communities and pressure from developers interested in converting the land to more profitable use, like condos or shopping malls. These general-aviation airports, which cater to private pilots, flight schools and other nonairline operations, were closing at the rate of one a year, falling to 43 today from a high of around 100 after World War II.
 But state officials say the trend may be reversing as larger airports in the region reach capacity and a new generation of very light jets prepares to take flight. 
 ''As private aviation takes off in the region, it is important for us to preserve a core airport system,'' said Kris Kolluri, New Jersey's transportation commissioner. ''Congestion is certainly a factor, and these smaller airports can play a role,'' he added, alluding to record delays that have strained major airports in the New York City area. 
 New Jersey has 16 reliever airfields, which the Federal Aviation Administration designates as capable of drawing general aviation traffic from major hubs like Newark Liberty International and La Guardia Airports. That entitles those smaller airports to additional funding from the government and makes them less likely to shut down. 
 But many of the smaller airports are privately owned ''mom and pop'' operations and have less incentive to resist the forces that have claimed so many others.
 Since the mid-1990s, when a New Jersey state commission was convened to study the reasons for the decline in general aviation, the state has made substantial investments in five airports that were in danger of being sold, Mr. Kolluri said. 
 Two were bought outright: Greenwood Lake Airport in West Milford, in Passaic County, and South Jersey Airport, in Burlington County. The state also bought development rights at airports in Lincoln Park, in Passaic County; Manville, in Somerset County; and Alexandria, in Hunterdon County, to protect them from encroachment from developers. 
 The total annual public investment in general-aviation facilities statewide is $14 million, Mr. Kolluri said, about evenly split between state and federal money. 
 The renewed push to preserve smaller airports comes at a time when private flying in the region is still struggling to recover from the twin effects of the Sept. 11 attacks and the economic downturn. Scheduled airline flights in the New York City area are up 15 percent over 2001, but general aviation is down 9 percent.
 ''General aviation, especially when it's for recreational and other personal uses, is very closely tied to the economy -- it's coming out of people's disposable income,'' said Chris Dancy, a spokesman for the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, in Frederick, Md. 
 But pilots' groups and entrepreneurs are hoping that the imminent arrival of the very light jets will jump-start interest in these alternative airfields. At list prices starting at just under $1 million, well under the cost of the average Learjet, the new jets could be used as air taxis or for ''on demand'' services at thousands of underused airfields around the country. 
 Only a few of the jets have been produced so far, however, and Mr. Dancy cautioned that ''it is far too early to tell if this business model of point-to-point air taxis is going to be viable.'' And some communities may resist the new jets unless it can be demonstrated that they are quieter than current models, as manufacturers assert. 
 Most of New Jersey's general-aviation airports have little jet traffic, but that may change as Teterboro Airport -- one of the busiest airfields for private jets -- continues to reduce operations. 
 The airport, which is run by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, has agreed to cut flights by 10 percent to assuage concerns from local residents about noise, as well as safety, following three accidents in four months in 2005. That included one in which a jet skidded off the runway, across the road and into a warehouse. 
 Last year Teterboro Airport handled around 187,000 takeoffs and landings, down about 10,000 from the previous year. By contrast, a quiet airport like Greenwood Lake handles around 20,000 takeoffs and landings annually. 
 Nonetheless, Tim Wagner, general manager at the West Milford airport, said he was ''definitely benefiting'' from the spillover from New York's crowded close-in airports; the number of planes parked there has risen to 93 from 54 in the last three years. He plans to build more hangars and put in a rental car location, and the airport is scheduled to open a restaurant this week. He has received $900,000 in state and federal grants to improve facilities.
 The F.A.A. requires that in exchange for financial assistance, an airport stay open for at least 20 years or pay back the grant, said Jim Peters, an agency spokesman. ''We haven't heard anything recently about any further airport closures'' in New Jersey, he said.
 However, last year tiny Bader Field Airport in Atlantic City closed down after several failed attempts by members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association to keep it running. The state says four other small airports have closed since 2000 -- in Marlboro, Pemberton, Piney Hollow and Vineland.
 For many communities, any allure an airport might have is often outweighed by what are perceived as sizable drawbacks, like the drone of low-flying propeller aircraft and possible safety and environmental hazards. 
 But Mr. Kolluri, the transportation commissioner, said demand exists for general-aviation airports.
 ''Every single hangar in the state is currently rented out, and there is a waiting list for new space,'' he said. ''The only way we can make sure this continues is that supply is adequate, and that won't happen if these airports continue to be sold off.''

HEADLINE: Higher Figures Are Expected for Infection of the AIDS Virus

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; Donald G. McNeil Jr. contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
More people in the United States are infected each year with the AIDS virus than previously thought, according to federal health officials, in a finding that could affect the debate over how much money should be spent on prevention efforts.
 No one is yet sure whether more people have actually been infected in recent years or the figures, still undergoing peer review, are simply a better estimate than the old ones. 
 For 14 years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention used informal methods to estimate that about 40,000 people annually in the United States are newly infected with H.I.V. In recent years, federal officials have worked to set up a more accurate assessment technique.
 The numbers from the new system are now in, although the agency has not released them.
 The Washington Blade, a gay newspaper, reported on Nov. 14 that the new estimates showed infection rates were 50 percent higher than previously believed, with 58,000 to 63,000 infected in the most recent 12-month period. The Washington Post and The Wall Street Journal had similar reports on Saturday.
 ''We currently have a paper going through a scientific review process,'' Tom Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman, said Saturday, ''and until that process is complete, we're not in a position to say one way or another whether the numbers will actually be up from current estimates.''
 A federal official who would not speak for attribution about the new numbers because of the review process said they were indeed higher than the old estimate, but not by as much as The Blade and The Post reported.
 It has been clear for at least a year that the old estimate would have to be revised upward, said David R. Holtgrave of Johns Hopkins University, a former director of one of the C.D.C.'s principal AIDS prevention programs.
 From 2001 to 2005, more than 186,000 people in 33 states received diagnoses of H.I.V. or AIDS, according to figures. That amounts to more than 37,000 new cases each year from just two-thirds of the country.
 ''With just a little simple math, you get more than 40,000 new cases,'' Dr. Holtgrave said.
 Whether the number of infections is higher than previously believed and whether infection rates are rising are both politically charged issues. 
 President Bush has increased financing for AIDS treatment and prevention programs abroad, but spending for domestic prevention efforts dropped 19 percent in inflation-adjusted terms from 2002 to 2007.
 Julie Davids, executive director of the Community H.I.V./AIDS Mobilization Project, a national advocacy group, said it planned to protest Tuesday in front of the C.D.C. headquarters in Atlanta to demand that the agency release the new figures and step up prevention efforts. ''We don't know whether infection rates are rising or they've just been higher than we thought,'' Ms. Davids said. ''But either way, this shows that prevention efforts are insufficient.''
 Doctors and states are required to report cases of full-blown AIDS, but only some states report positive results on tests for H.I.V. infection to the agency. It takes years for someone who is infected to develop symptoms; many people have been infected for years before they are tested.
 Under the C.D.C.'s new surveillance system, 19 states and cities are performing two different blood tests of H.I.V. antibodies -- the first indication of an infection. One test is highly sensitive and is able to spot an infection even in its earliest months. The other test is cruder, and patients must nurse an infection for many months before it can be identified with this test. 
 When a blood sample receives a positive result on the first test and a negative result on the second, officials have decided that this person was probably infected recently. By adding up these mixed results and projecting them across the country, the agency is able to come up with an estimate for new infections.
 The agency sent out a letter to scientists on Nov. 26 describing the new system and urging patience as the numbers are reviewed.

HEADLINE: The Decade That Won't Die

THE GREAT FUNK 
 Falling Apart and Coming Together (on a Shag Rug) in the Seventies. 
 By Thomas Hine. 
 Illustrated. 241 pp. Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30. 
 There are three kinds of revisionism. Marshaling cunning arguments to prove that James Polk is a vastly underrated president is tendentious but doable. Trying to convince skeptics that James Carter is a vastly underrated president is willfully contrary. Contending that James Buchanan is a vastly underrated president is flat-out nuts. But of the three, arguing that Buchanan should be up there on Mount Rushmore is by far the most fun, because if you're going to be a revisionist, you might as well swing for the fences. 
 In ''The Great Funk: Falling Apart and Coming Together (on a Shag Rug) in the Seventies,'' Thomas Hine, the widely published design critic and author of ''Populuxe,'' has adopted a cautious, sensible approach to re-evaluating our most maligned decade. Rather than speciously contending that the 1970s were a great period in American history -- the way pop historians like to argue that the Huns and the Vandals were classy chaps victimized by negative Roman spin, or that Phil Collins rocks -- Hine simply suggests that the '70s were not as bad as most people think. Conceding that the '70s were characterized by bad hair, bad clothes, bad music, bad design, bad books, bad politics, bad economics, bad carpeting, bad fabrics and a lot of bad ideas, he reminds us that the decade was nonetheless the spawning ground for many of the attitudes and values that define our society today. This is neither a radical nor an original theory -- we all know that feminism, gay rights and a morbid obsession with fuel efficiency grew out of the '70s -- so in the end Hine has succeeded in writing a thoughtful, fair but somewhat derivative book about an era that was completely outrageous. A wild and crazy guy, he is not.
 In a certain sense, Hine has exhumed a cadaver that was never interred. Because of cable TV, an innovation that really took off in the 1980s, ''Charlie's Angels,'' ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' ''All in the Family,'' ''Sanford and Son,'' ''Maude'' and ''The Jeffersons'' have never gone away; nor have disco (''Saturday Night Fever: The Musical''), punk (Ramones regalia everywhere), heavy metal (Ozzy Osbourne), bell-bottoms (''That '70s Show'') or Abba (''Mamma Mia!''). Like the absurdly mythologized '60s, the reliably clownish '70s have never been given space to recede into the past the way the '40s did, in part because ironic hipsters (''The Simpsons''; ''Family Guy''; the concept of ''jumping the shark,'' inspired by the Fonz) are forever going back to heap fresh ridicule on an era no one ever took seriously. Reading ''The Great Funk'' is like revisiting a nightmare many of us never awoke from in the first place.
 Reasonably comprehensive, if not encyclopedic, and filled with pictures that are worth thousands of the author's words, ''The Great Funk'' covers most of the major bases: Watergate, the energy crisis, hot pants, drugs, ''Deep Throat,'' polyester, revolting facial growth, ''Star Wars,'' Day-Glo baseball uniforms, the Village People, Carlos Castaneda, big hair, streaking, Bobby Riggs versus Billie Jean King, gay rights, geodesic domes, Jim Jones, ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' midi-skirts, the decline of classy cars, the rise of Gerald Ford. Unlike the '60s, dominated by charismatic politicians, the '70s were dominated by crooks and nebbishes, so it was pop culture that set the national agenda. That culture was narcissistic and silly, its values immortalized in Charles A. Reich's enormously popular ''Greening of America,'' the book that best captures the apocalyptic fruitiness of the era. In a passage defending that book, Hine sets forth the central thesis of his own work:
 ''Reich's mistake was to interpret minor, transient phenomena as bellwethers of permanent, positive change. Bell-bottoms were, he said, a way of expressing personal freedom, the delight and beauty of movement, and a rather comic attitude toward life. He wasn't wrong about that, but he seemed to think that people would be wearing bell-bottoms forever.'' 
 Seemingly relieved that this did not come to pass, Hine continues:
 ''Yet the book does not deserve the derision with which it is often remembered. Though much of his evidence for a cultural revolution proved to be fleeting, Reich nevertheless identified some important and lasting changes in the society. He saw that what emerged in America during the late '60s was not, as many believed, a political movement, but a social and cultural one. ... The openness to experience and respect for differences that Reich observed became so much a part of the American ethos that, today, it's obligatory to say you share such values, even if you don't.'' 
 And thus, compassionate conservatism.
 Hine, strong on fashion, architecture and design, is weak in other areas. He does not seem to understand that a society that worships both David Bowie and Carole King is not a monolithic one, that ''Rocky'' -- which he never mentions -- is a far more important movie than ''Logan's Run'' or ''Soylent Green,'' that the plot of ''Jaws'' is probably not heavily influenced by public disillusionment with politicians. He elevates Dolly Parton to a questionable role as a feminist icon and ignores John Denver, whose career cast a long, dark shadow over the entire decade. An even more notable omission is Hunter Thompson, the second-most gifted journalist of the period (after Tom Wolfe, who named the '70s ''the Me Decade''). He also leaves out Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, the Eagles -- whose ''Greatest Hits'' is the best-selling record in history -- and EST, and, blinded by his enthusiasm for the dapper men's fashions in Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' movies, he overlooks that same director's potent Watergate allegory, ''The Conversation,'' one of the most chilling films ever made. It's not that Hine gets everything wrong; it's more that he omits or sloughs off a number of things it would have helped to get right. 
 Breezy and glib, ''The Great Funk'' works nicely as a guide for those too young to remember the 1970s, those who may be surprised to learn that young I.R.S. agents actually wore Fu Manchus to work, that leisure suits were not initially viewed as a joke, that gas rationing really and truly occurred in this great nation, that Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford actually lived in the White House -- a possible explanation for the rampant substance abuse at the time -- and that the soccer moms who brought them into the world may have once worn Ultrasuede hot pants. Though he never minimizes the bizarre atmosphere of the era, Hine never captures the widespread feeling that America had taken a totally wrong turn in the '70s. 
 And though he wisely discusses the rise of evangelical Christianity and mentions that George W. Bush was at Yale the same time as Charles Reich, he never truly grapples with the fact that despite all those doobies and Allman Brothers mustaches that trickled down from Berkeley and Harvard Yard to Main Street, most people in the United States were not experiencing the '70s in quite the same way that Cher, Harry Reems, Larry Flynt, Ziggy Stardust and Buckminster Fuller were. The 1970s began with a mildly conservative president in the White House. The 1980s got going with an even more conservative president at the helm. Without Watergate, a conservative candidate would have won in 1976. Proving that not everybody wanted the funk, not everybody wanted the noise.

HEADLINE: Study Puts Price Tag On Delays At Airports

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The growing number of delayed flights at Kennedy International Airport and the region's other major airports has cost passengers nearly $200 million in lost productivity this year, according to a report to be released today by the New York City comptroller's office.
 The increase in delays has also cost the airlines more money for fuel and wages, interfered with delivery of air freight and increased pollution in neighborhoods near Kennedy, said the study, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times. 
 Taken together, the problems are chipping away at the city's competitiveness and could drive away some companies, the study said. 
 ''One of New York City's major competitive advantages is its outstanding air connections with the rest of the nation and the world,'' the comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said in the report. ''This advantage is now being degraded by the declining reliability of air travel into and out of New York.''
 The report comes less than a year after the federal government lifted the cap on the number of flights permitted to operate at Kennedy during peak hours. As a result of the change, on-time performance has worsened. The average time spent taxiing at Kennedy is 36 minutes, up from 22 minutes in 2003, compared with a 1.3-minute increase nationally during the same period. 
 Passengers at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports spent 3.9 million more hours waiting for their planes to take off after they left their gates in 2007 compared with a decade earlier, the report said.
 That cost passengers $187 million, Mr. Thompson said, citing data that is to be published in The American Economic Review this month. To come up with that figure, the economists assigned values to a range of travelers, from those on vacation to those flying for business.
 The logjams and delays have triggered a debate over the best solution among federal regulators, the airlines and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three airports. 
 Seeking to reduce the delays, the federal Department of Transportation met with airlines in October and asked them to either reduce or otherwise alter their schedules in the metropolitan area. The department said that if it could not reach agreements with the airlines by the end of the year, it might reimpose landing quotas at Kennedy.
 As part of the negotiations, federal officials have also pushed for a congestion pricing system that would charge airlines more to fly during peak hours.
 Many airlines and the Port Authority have opposed those measures. But Mr. Thompson said in the report that if conditions did not improve soon, he would favor congestion pricing over the current system, which bases landing fees on an airplane's weight. 
 ''The situation is urgent,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''We simply cannot accept another summer of soaring delays like last summer.''
 The report said a congestion pricing system could save airlines and passengers a total of $256.8 million a year at Kennedy through lower landing fees, fewer delay-related costs and time saved. It said that $169.3 million could be saved at Newark and $116.3 million at La Guardia.
 Mr. Thompson also said the Federal Aviation Administration should make the New York area a priority when new technology, designed to better distribute air traffic, is available. The F.A.A. has already decided that Alaska, the Gulf of Mexico region, Philadelphia and Louisville, Ky., will be the first to get the new technology. 
 The Port Authority has echoed Mr. Thompson's request.
 ''The right answer is to increase capacity,'' said Anthony E. Shorris, executive director of the Port Authority, who has met several times with the F.A.A. on this issue. 
 But even if improvements to air traffic control are made soon, they may barely keep up with expected growth at the New York area's airports, the report said, citing forecasts that the number of flights will increase 20.7 percent by 2015.

HOTEL 
 An American History. 
 By A. K. Sandoval-Strausz. 
 Illustrated. 375 pp. Yale University Press. $37.50. 
 How can you not be intrigued by a history of hotels in America that begins with a trenchant discussion of Immanuel Kant? ''The father of the modern philosophy of international law and human rights,'' as he is described, published ''Toward Perpetual Peace'' in 1795. He ''proposed that international conflict could be ended only under 'conditions of universal hospitality,' in which ... 'a right to visit''' belonged to all people.
 In a dense, ambitious and valuable new work, ''Hotel: An American History,'' A. K. Sandoval-Strausz points out that as Kant was writing, entrepreneurs in the United States were inventing a new kind of building, the hotel, and a new industry, hospitality. Within 50 years hotels had radically changed the way -- and the places where -- Americans lived and did business. 
 Sandoval-Strausz argues that along with industrialization, the growth of the middle class and the evolution of a consumer culture, the rise of the hospitality industry, part of ''the human geography of capitalism,'' is a crucial chapter in the development of modern America. ''Talk is cheap; buildings are expensive,'' as he puts it, so bricks and mortar are as reliable a primary source for the historian as any written document.
 Let's dispense with the ''human geography of capitalism'' immediately. It is nowadays to be expected, sadly, that an author familiar with Kant's work will also feel obliged to use language like ''domestic ideologies,'' ''microgeography of labor'' and, my personal favorite, ''gendered dynamic.'' This kind of talk is not cheap, and this history is not for the faint of heart. Luckily, with any aptitude for foreign languages, a reader can slip into a pseudo-fluency in academic jargon, such that one quickly forgets to even wonder how, exactly, to translate ''a patterning device.'' (A type of building? A blueprint? Yale?) By the time I got to the 1850s I was zipping along; the author's natural voice, unencumbered by jargon, is lucid and concise. 
 ''Hotel'' is filled with interesting information; Sandoval-Strausz, who teaches history at the University of New Mexico, develops social, moral, economic, legal and political connections with originality and insight. His impassioned reading of our ''built environment'' is fascinating, his research prodigious. And the subject merits his talent as a historian. Not only were American hotels an original architectural configuration, but they also gave rise to the apartment building, ''truly pathbreaking in its arrangement of domestic space.'' 
 Hotels were originally conceived as a way to shelter and control strangers -- a growing preoccupation in a country whose citizens were becoming among the most mobile people in the world. Foreigners remarked on the unusual and easy freedom of movement Americans claimed as a birthright; indeed, it seemed a hallmark of a democratic society. Anyone (except blacks and Jews) could go wherever he wanted. Sandoval-Strausz dates the inspiration for the creation of the hotel to the first presidential tours of the new colonies, from 1789 to 1791; to avoid the appearance of favoritism, George Washington insisted on staying in inns and taverns, converted houses with liquor licenses. His accommodations from New Hampshire to Georgia, when they were available, were for the most part dirty and uncomfortable; it was not uncommon for guests to share beds swarming with insects. Local burghers were so embarrassed by the reports of shoddy hospitality that they began to finance the construction of large, lavish public accommodations, the better to receive notable visitors to their cities.
 By the end of the 18th century, a critical period in the country's development, hotels had gained a symbolic role of enormous importance. America was an overwhelmingly agrarian society, but politicians urgently debated its proper economic destiny. Jeffersonian Republicans ''worried that too much commercial involvement would detract from the proper agricultural pursuits of the American people, tempting them into a love of luxury and corrupting their sensibilities''; Hamiltonian Federalists argued that a thriving commercial sector was a necessary and civilizing engine of progress. ''Hotels were ... an intervention in this debate,'' Sandoval-Strausz writes. They soon ''focused public attention on the benefits of trade and pointed toward a commercial future for the nation.''
 ''Hotel'' is also the story of Americans on the move. Sandoval-Strausz traces the rise of railroad hotels, which facilitated business dealings along trade routes. Even more interesting is the development of resort hotels, which sprang up along with the concept of vacation time. These destination spots, some of them architectural wedding cakes (and still standing, like the Hotel Del Coronado in San Diego), created and helped populate towns, like Colorado Springs, and even entire states, as when Henry M. Flagler built a series of hotels along the thinly populated coast of southern Florida. 
 In the 1850s a shortage of land in urban areas had led to soaring prices for the houses that were considered the proper setting for a middle-class family. Hotel living was less expensive and became an immensely popular alternative. But there was a great deal of controversy surrounding this new kind of home; with common kitchens, laundries and dining halls, cooks and maid service, women were freed from laborious (and unpaid) housework. Critics from The New York Times to Architectural Record thundered against the perils of hotel living, which the Record called ''the most dangerous enemy American domesticity has yet had to encounter.'' Husbands and wives could socialize in common parlors, ballrooms and billiard rooms; children were free to ''become spoiled, petted, ruined'' by ''an utter upsetting of all home habits,'' a report in The Times said. Indeed, I can remember my mother scolding me for not making my bed: ''What do you think this is -- a hotel?'' The critics may have been right, though nothing could stop the ''folly, extravagance and fashion'' unleashed in the nations' cities. Contemplating the gendered dynamics of this revolutionary patterning device gave me an entirely new take on spoiled, bratty, neglected, charming Eloise, living at the Plaza; she is lately much on my mind, as I walk past that trumped-up chateau every day. What was once one of the world's most opulent hotels is becoming an apartment building. We've come full circle: whereas hotel planners once took their decorating cues from domestic architecture, today's homes have bedrooms and bathrooms modeled on, for example, the Four Seasons; guests purchase bedding, linens and lamps from hotels.
 Hotels long ago lost the merry, bustling, teeming and preening social life that once rang through their lobbies. Businessmen conducted their affairs (amorous and financial) in those big public rooms, amply furnished with plush settees and brass spittoons. So-called chair warmers lounged about, taking in scenes of sartorial splendor as the ladies strolled past; the corridor linking the Waldorf Hotel to the Astoria became known as Peacock Alley. Along with the throngs came crime, which included the murder of seducers by their victims, women who had been lured to bed. Hotels also became popular places to commit suicide, much to the consternation of management. 
 At the end of his book, the author returns to Kant, arguing that his ''state of perpetual peace would make hosts and guests into its ambassadors, and hospitality into one of its defining ethics.'' One has to wonder, then, what might have happened had we occupied Iraq with Hiltons instead of Humvees. Surely the spread of democracy and the building of a nation would have been better served. I will never again check into a hotel without thinking of myself as an ambassador of peace; that alone, with its profound implications, makes this thoughtful book worthwhile.

HEADLINE: Campaign for Sale

 BODY:
The sticker price for next year's presidential and Congressional elections is rocketing toward $5 billion, shocking even political professionals who figure the ante in the opening Iowa round may cost out at $300 per caucusgoer. When you consider that the votes taken at those caucuses actually have no direct effect on who is nominated by either party, the cost should be ludicrous by the laws of economics, never mind politics.
 But the campaign is harvesting record amounts of money, seeded by the front-loading of the primary schedule with major contests in the first six weeks of the year, watered by the willingness of candidates and party machines to ignore the spirit of the law, and fertilized by the bottom lines of television companies. 
 By next Election Day, the two presidential nominees are expected to break the $1 billion mark in combined spending -- a 50 percent rise over the outrageously high price of the 2004 campaign. Congressional races will total out at hundreds of millions beyond that, while party organizations and their mushrooming stealth operations will run up their own deluxe tabs. 
 Even if the Supreme Court has started treating the cash of wealthy corporations and special-interest groups as free speech, there are responsible ways to put brakes on a runaway money train that promises to generate little in the way of voter turnout or issue elucidation. 
 The Federal Election Commission, normally weighted with machine loyalists from the two parties, has to become more of an enforcer of the law than an enabler of law-evaders. It must crack down harder on such blatant abusers as the noxious ''527 committees'' of 2004 that tapped illegal fat-cat donations to pass off bare-knuckle partisan operations as tax-exempt initiatives. 
 The commission did finally penalize prominent malefactors like the Republicans' Swift boat attackers and the Democrats' anti-Bush drive, called America Coming Together. But this came almost four years after initial complaints -- and the fines amount to just 1 or 2 cents per dollar for the hundreds of millions spent illegally by these shadow-party operatives. Treating subverters of fair elections as political jaywalkers can only encourage a fresh round of schemers next year. The commission needs to issue a broadside warning right now that its penalties will be far steeper and more timely and will target principals, not just their umbrella groups. 
 A second needed measure harks back to the felonies of Watergate, which resulted in the creation of publicly subsidized campaign financing as an alternative to special interest and private donations. The option worked well for the major nominees for 30 years, but Congress failed to update its subsidy levels for inflation. That -- and the frenzied, early and decisive primaries -- finds most of the current candidates rejecting the $65 million it would provide as so much chump change. 
 A worthy bill to restore public financing's relevancy is scheduled to be introduced this week. It is solidly bipartisan and bicameral, sponsored by Senators Russ Feingold and Susan Collins and Representatives Christopher Shays and David Price. The subsidy and spending formulas would be repaired to allow candidates to be competitive without plunging into the money maelstrom. 
 The measure would take effect in 2012, so there's no good reason why the current array of presidential candidates -- some of them already burned by tainted fat-cat donors -- should not join Senator Barack Obama in endorsing this step back toward campaign sanity.

Who Will Guard the Castle?
 Among the ripple effects of the Cheshire home invasion in July in which a mother and her two daughters were slain has been a renewed interest among homeowners nationwide in the ''castle doctrine.'' 
 Simply put, the law indemnifies homeowners from criminal charges if they wound or kill an intruder. In the last two years, 20 states -- Connecticut is not among them -- have enacted laws that allow people to shoot first and ask questions later when they catch a criminal in their home. In Connecticut, homeowners must observe ''their duty to retreat'' before using deadly force.
 Critics say the castle doctrine promotes violence and weakens police powers. But many now are demanding their states look more seriously at passing these types of doctrines to enhance their ability to defend themselves, their loved ones and their property without fear of prosecution.
 In Southbury, state police are considering charges against a John Nagy, who they say shot an intruder. According to the police, Mr. Nagy was awakened by a noise in his basement at about 2 a.m. on Nov. 4. He grabbed his gun and went to investigate. In the cellar, he encountered Justin Alter of Brookfield, who minutes earlier had been in a one-vehicle crash nearby. When Mr. Alter moved toward him, Mr. Nagy fired one shot, then ran outside and called 911.
 Some may view Mr. Alter as a sympathetic victim, but he could have saved himself and Mr. Nagy a lot of pain and suffering had he rung the doorbell.
 Police haven't said yet whether Mr. Nagy met his statutory duty to retreat, but he had no way of knowing whether Mr. Alter was a stranded motorist or homicidal maniac. The shooting turned out to be an unfortunate mistake, but it is an unnecessary tragedy to charge Mr. Nagy for making a split-second decision that under most other circumstances probably would have saved his life.
 The Republican-American, Nov. 26
 Who Pays for Business Tax Breaks?
 We learned last week that Medinstill is not going to pay any property taxes to the town of New Milford.
 I object to this and think it is misguided. I have lived in the same house for 30 years and in this time my property taxes have gone up sixfold.
 Why are taxes going up double the inflation rate? 
 We have a new company not paying taxes at all, and newcomers not paying their fair share.
 The results will be more taxes for everyone else.
 Town residents already spent $2 million on sewers for this company. 
 Next thing you know, every other company will be asking for the same tax breaks and the New Milford residents will have to pay even more property taxes to make up for it.
 There should be a separation of businesses and state. We should not have businesses and money-making enterprises bully towns and states for tax subsidies and have the citizens make up for the shortfalls.
 Instead of all these promises, we, the people of New Milford, should get guarantees that this will benefit our budget and that it will keep our taxes down in the future.
 Without any such guarantees, we may be better off without these deals. Then our taxes may finally stop going way up above the inflation rate. We sure don't need this kind of growth.

HEADLINE: Only Downtrend at Pump: Independent Stations

BYLINE: By STEWART AIN

 BODY:
WHEN Bill Hands bought an unbranded gasoline station in Orient on the North Fork 21 years ago, it had three pumps -- one for regular, one for premium and one for diesel. It still does.
 Mr. Hands's three-pump station, called the Orient Service Center, on Main Road, is a rarity on Long Island, according to Charles A. Gardner, director of the Suffolk County Office of Consumer Affairs. Long Island has lost at least 45 percent of its gasoline stations in the last quarter-century, and many of those that have disappeared were small independent stations.
 ''You don't see those at all anymore,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''They're not cost-effective.''
 While the number of stations has plummeted, the amount of gasoline sold has increased -- from pumps that can dispense up to five grades of gasoline. 
 Many factors have cut into profits and driven stations out of business, owners and industry officials say: new environmental laws, some of which require costly equipment upgrades; the soaring cost of oil; the cost of credit-card sales; and the consolidation of major oil companies.
 ''There are not many small mom and pop businessmen like ourselves who can make it anymore,'' said Andy Harris, who bought Turnpike Service in Jericho 22 years ago. ''I made more money 20 years ago on an oil change than I make today because the price of oil is so high. And the cost of insurance and workmen's compensation has hit the sky. Put it all together and you are making less and working harder today to make the same kind of money.''
 Mr. Hands, a major-league pitcher in the 1960s and '70s, said the big gasoline price increases had harmed small stations, too. ''Our profit margin stinks ever since the price went out of whack,'' he said. ''Most of the guys make more on a candy bar than a tank of gas.''
 Kathryn Odessa, executive director of the Long Island Gasoline Retailers Association, said that because it had become so expensive to do business, ''most of our guys look for a way to bring in business with a convenience store or a car wash.''
 ''We have between 800 and 1,000 members, and 20 years ago we probably had double that,'' she said. ''Every month we see several stations that are forced to close down.''
 Yet plenty of gas is being sold on Long Island -- 1.197 billion gallons in 2005, up from 1.106 billion in 2000, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. That is about an 8 percent increase.
 Today's pumps dispense many different grades of gasoline, some as many as five, and each has its own meter on the pump, Mr. Gardner said. He said the most at any one station is 45 meters; Suffolk has a total of 9,967 meters, up from 8,612 in 1986.
 But although the number of meters has increased, he said, the number of gas stations in Suffolk has dropped from 945 in 1986 to about 580 today. In Nassau County, 550 stations are operating today, compared with 1,130 30 years ago, said Glenn F. Powell, assistant director of weights and measures in the Office of Consumer Affairs. 
 New environmental laws have had an effect, said Ralph Bombardiere, executive director of the New York State Association of Service Stations and Repair Shops.
 Among the subjects of these laws are the disposal of used oil and batteries and the type of underground gas tanks that may be used. Over the years, steel tanks were ordered replaced with fiberglass tanks. By 2010, the law will require double-walled fiberglass tanks. 
 ''As a result, smaller stations are closed and sold because they are not worth putting in the new tanks and upgrading the station,'' Mr. Bombardiere said. ''They say there are 1,000 tanks in each county that have to be changed, and it costs about $100,000 per location.''
 Mr. Bombardiere said that environmental issues and economics had combined to force stations to pump more gas than in the past to remain profitable.
 ''Years ago, 50,000 gallons a month was O.K.,'' he said. ''Now 100,000 is not good enough. What they have done is added pumps to stations, and each station has to pump 150,000 to 300,000 a month.''
 Mr. Bombardiere said gas stations had turned to ''alternate profit centers,'' like convenience stores, because the profit margin on gasoline is so low. ''The margins are not more than 15 cents a gallon,'' he said.
 Because 60 percent of customers use credit cards, which cost retailers 9 cents for every $3 gallon of gasoline, the profit margin falls to 6 cents on those sales, Mr. Bombardiere said. Factoring in cash sales, the profit margin averages out to about 10 cents a gallon, he said.
 Mr. Powell, of the Nassau Office of Consumer Affairs, said consolidation in the industry has had an impact, too. 
 ''After Texaco and Chevron merged, Texaco and Shell merged their distribution network and Texaco pulled out of the market,'' he said. Shell has also closed a lot of stations, he said. 
 Major oil companies also own many of the tanks on Long Island and often the land on which the gas station sits. 
 Mitchell Macy, the owner of DJM Service Station in Deer Park, said that he had been renting his station from Mobil for the last 21 years and that Mobil was scheduled to replace the tanks early next year. But he said his experience had changed since Mobil merged with Exxon in 1999.
 ''There was once a family feeling, a team effort, a cooperative type of thing where the company was concerned about your well-being and the rent was reasonable,'' Mr. Macy said. ''Since the merger there has been a different mentality. The rent has tripled, from $4,000 a month to $12,000. They figure the property is worth X number of dollars and they want a return on their investment.''
 Mr. Macy said Mobil declined his offer to buy his station and refused to allow him to put in a convenience store. (Beth Snyder, an ExxonMobil spokeswoman, said only, ''Any business development discussions we would have with him are between him and the company.'')
 As a result, Mr. Macy said, he is selling cigarettes, candy, soft drinks and lottery tickets from the small area near the register.
 ''When I first came into this business, I was making a nice living,'' he said. ''Now there is just enough to subsist on.''

HEADLINE: Foreclosures Hurt Neighbors, Too

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
MANY homeowners are surviving the subprime mortgage crisis with little anxiety, but this could change as collateral damage spreads.
 According to a recent report by the Center for Responsible Lending, a credit advocacy group in Durham, N.C., more than 44 million homeowners could experience a decline in the value of their properties of about $5,000 on average over the next two years because of foreclosures in their neighborhoods. 
 ''For every homeowner who's directly affected, another 48 will get hurt too,'' said Ellen Schloemer, executive vice president of the Center for Responsible Lending. 
 In Hudson County, N.J., for instance, the Center for Responsible Lending estimates that 2,311 homes will be lost to foreclosure of subprime loans taken out in 2005 and 2006, but 252,000 nearby homes will have decreases in value that will average $13,400. 
 To determine the average amount of value lost, housing researchers relied on sales data involving homes in the greater Chicago area to determine a typical loss in value due to a foreclosure. They did not widely speculate on the reasons for the decreases.
 Among other things, however, foreclosed homes can depress neighborhood values because lenders often sell the homes at a discount to recoup their investments, and vacant homes can also attract crime, according to real estate professionals.
 In Suffolk and Nassau, the counties in the New York City region facing the most subprime-related foreclosures, 9,450 homes are expected to be lost to foreclosure, and 549,000 surrounding homeowners would be affected. In Nassau, those living within one-eighth of a mile of a foreclosed home would face decreases in value of nearly $7,100, while in Suffolk, they would lose $4,200 on paper.
 These estimates, Ms. Schloemer said, do not take into account an expected increase in foreclosures that will come next year, when many adjustable-rate mortgages, or ARMs, outside of the subprime realm will grow significantly more expensive.
 ''There's really not much homeowners can do, except encourage their legislators or policy makers to help people stay in their homes, because it benefits the entire community,'' Ms. Schloemer said.
 In New York State, foreclosure rates for subprime ARMs reached 10.4 percent in the second quarter of 2007 (the most recent period for which figures are available), a jump of nearly 2.5 percentage points from the first quarter. The state government allocated $100 million last summer for new low-interest loans for subprime borrowers in distress. In November, it said it would earmark $2 million for counseling for homeowners facing financial hardship.
 In New Jersey, where foreclosure rates for subprime ARMs rose by nearly 2 percentage points, to 8.7 percent in the second quarter, the state allocated $30 million in October to help homeowners catch up on delinquent mortgages. It also announced NJHope.nj.gov, a new Web site with information for those facing foreclosures.
 In Connecticut, where foreclosure rates for subprime ARMs jumped by nearly 2.5 percentage points, to 8.6 percent, in the second quarter, the state will begin allocating $50 million in low-interest loans this month to people facing foreclosure, according to Howard F. Pitkin, Connecticut's banking commissioner.
 More initiatives will follow, Mr. Pitkin said, and they could be joined by government outreach programs from local communities. ''They have to become aware of this issue,'' he said, ''and get their arms around the potential impact on their community.''

HEADLINE: Savoir Fair

BYLINE: By LINDA YABLONSKY

 BODY:
As the public face of Art Basel, the world's biggest trade fair for modern and contemporary art, Samuel Keller is a moving target -- at once an organizer, strategist, friend, flack, booster, bouncer, Old World roue and entirely social animal. One minute he'll be touring a biennial in Shanghai and the next will find him in Los Angeles, co-sponsoring a dinner for art dealers and collectors with Michael and Eva Chow. Twenty-four hours later, he'll arrive in New York to table-hop at the Four Seasons after the opening of the Richard Prince retrospective at the Guggenheim. 
 Of course, he won't stay long. Collectors are expecting him for a birthday party in Capri. 
 With his brown eyes, full lips and smoothly shaven head, Keller is what one friend calls ''the most famous baldy in the art world.'' His celebrity and considerable power stem from his transformation of a dour, unprofitable 38-year-old trade fair into a vibrant social and cultural enterprise that draws 60,000 people each June to Basel, the museum-rich Swiss town where he was born and still lives. 
 In this country, though, Keller is best known for creating the fair's flamboyant younger sister, Art Basel Miami Beach (or A.B.M.B.), which takes place this week amid a flurry of parties, concerts, films, exhibitions, product promotions and exchanges of art for gobs of money. The consequence of this hands-on, full-service programming is that the 41-year-old Keller has practically reinvented the way art is bought, sold and seen today. ''Sam has created a different kind of playing field than existed in the past,'' says Jerry I. Speyer, the New York City real estate mogul who is the chairman of the Museum of Modern Art. 
 ''He's among the best marketing people I've ever met.''
 Of course, Keller's eight-year tenure at Art Basel's helm has coincided with a global expansion of both the primary and resale art markets that has seen prices scale dizzying heights, resulting in a distressingly homogenizing commercialization of art that critics believe was instigated by the fairs.
 Keller doesn't agree. Over lemon sodas recently at Basel's Kunsthalle cafe -- an art-world hangout that he calls ''the canteen'' -- he doesn't sound the least bit defensive when he says, ''At Art Basel, we think buying and selling art is actually a very good thing. 
 It doesn't mean that we don't invite people who are critical. One forum we did was 'Is Money the New Criticism?' ''
 The Art Basel fairs have indeed distinguished themselves for the high standards to which they hold galleries applying for a berth. Dealers must submit proposals to a peer selection committee, of which Keller is the nonvoting chair. The committee also serves as the organization's watchdog, visiting each booth during a fair and warning or ejecting dealers whose wares or presentations have fallen below par. 
 Between fairs, Keller makes a point of visiting galleries on every continent, giving advice or, when necessary, playing the heavy. He is also the person who maps the galleries' placement on the fair's selling floor, which, depending on the flow of traffic, can affect sales volume. ''There's a huge potential for hating this man,'' says Rene Kamm, the C.E.O. of MCH Messe Schweiz AG, Art Basel's parent company. 
 Yet it is difficult, if not impossible, to find anyone in the art world willing to express even the most minor resentment. ''A lot of people are so angry when they are rejected from these fairs,'' says the New York dealer Jeffrey Deitch, ''yet Sam manages to stay friends with everyone.''
 ''We jokingly call him the mayor of Miami,'' adds Lawrence Luhring, a New York art dealer who sits on A.B.M.B.'s selection committee. ''He probably could run for mayor of Basel, he's such a consummate diplomat.'' 
 Even artists sing his praises. ''One of Sam's great accomplishments was to bring artists into the fairs, as opposed to making them closed-door events for collectors,'' 
 says Doug Aitken, an L.A.-based video artist whose large-scale projections have been shown to advantage at Art Basel.
 Keller attributes his gift for friendship and diplomacy to what he calls his ''Swissness,'' from which he also derives a certain modesty. 
 If he stays in five-star hotels on business, he lives in a semi-attached stucco home on a one-way street behind a clutch of bamboo. 
 He is purposeful, not secretive, but is so discreet about his private life that many in the art world who are accustomed to seeing him out night crawling are astonished to learn that he has a wife, Judith, who goes with him to Miami, and a 15-year-old son, James.
 Keller's first encounter with contemporary art came at age 11, when a school excursion was rained out and the teacher took his class to an exhibition in an old factory instead. At the University of Basel, he studied art history in addition to economics and philosophy, but ended up working in public relations, leading architecture tours for an agency of the Swiss tourist board that also organizes the Montreux Jazz Festival. After a stint in the P.R. office of Messe Schweiz, he was made Art Basel's communications director. That was in the mid-1990s. By 2000, he was running the fair and heading to Miami. 
 Established in 2002, at enormous cost to Messe Schweiz, Art Basel Miami Beach has pulled in its wake some 22 parallel art and design fairs to Miami and set off a flurry of expansion projects at area museums. From Dec. 6 through 9, A.B.M.B.'s official dates this year, close to 40,000 people are likely to attend. 
 But the success of the fair has been more than just commercial. ''Art is a convention between people,'' Keller says, ''and people need to speak about art. You would not believe how many of the key figures in the art world I have met socially, at restaurants and bars, before I met them professionally.'' 
 What sets the Miami fair apart from the formality of its Swiss counterpart are the open-house gatherings at local collectors' homes and the nightly parties at the hotels and on the beach near Art Positions, a section of the fair that Keller set up for younger galleries to exhibit in converted shipping containers. 
 Simon Lutz, a Basel restaurateur who is one of Keller's oldest friends, compares Miami's fair to that city's Winter Music Conference, which both he and Keller also attend. ''At the music conference,'' he says, ''people only go to the parties. Art Basel has plenty of raves, but everyone also goes to the fair.''
 Keller's biggest challenge, says Lauren Taschen, his events manager in Miami, is to stay awake. But Keller doesn't seem to care about sleep. ''I get a lot of energy from having all those people together,'' he says. 
 ''It's exciting. There are better things to do than sleep in Miami.''
 Still, the pace, along with the constant travel, can take its toll. That is partly why, beginning Jan. 1, Keller is taking the director's chair of the Beyeler Foundation, a privately financed museum of Modernist art established 10 years ago by Ernst Beyeler, a legendary Basel gallery owner who in 1970 co-founded the first Art Basel. The move, coming at such a peak in his career, may surprise Keller's associates, especially since his income at the Beyeler will be as moderate as it is now. ''I would have gone into art dealing if I wanted to get rich,'' he says. ''If art is your passion and not just your profession, what you do is go and see art exhibitions. That's what I love, so for me this is not such a big change -- except, of course, that the Beyeler is not-for-profit.''
 As we tour the museum's galleries, Keller's excitement over paintings by Picasso, Leger, Mondrian and Giacometti -- and over the museum itself -- is obvious, and infectious. Walking through the sculpture gardens, beside plowed fields and grazing cows, we pass the service entrance of the building, where the Dumpsters are kept. ''Even the backside of the office is beautiful to me!'' he says with a shake of his head. ''I can't think of anything better to do than come to work here every day.''

HEADLINE: To Be Safe, Call the Bride by Her First Name

BYLINE: By ANNA JANE GROSSMAN

 BODY:
WHEN Jill Van Camp decided to play catcher in a softball game on the September morning of her wedding, her mother worried that the bride might lose a tooth. Ms. Van Camp, 31, was more concerned about losing her good name. Literally. 
 She and Darren Bloch, 33, knew they wanted to spend their lives together, but were unsure how to monogram their towels. So they arranged the game between their respective families and friends, and proclaimed that the winning team would determine which of them would take the other's name. 
 Thanks to hyphens, a vogue toward creative morphing of names, and legislation in some states that has eased the process for a man to take his wife's lsurname, there have never been more surname options. 
 Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economics professor, and Maria Shim, then a Harvard student, studied various Massachusetts birth records, wedding announcements published in The New York Times and Harvard alumni records for a paper they published in 2004 in the Journal of Economic Perspectives. 
 They found that fewer than 4 percent of college-educated brides did not take their husband's last name in 1975, compared with about 20 percent in 2000.
 But brides, and bridegrooms as well, are learning that with choice comes complication. They are turning what was once an intimate conversation into an interactive dialogue with relatives, friends and even professional consultants. 
 When the former Katharine Newberry-Gillin, 25, a manager at a Trader Joe's food store in Osseo, Minn., was engaged last year to Kyle Sommers, also 25, there were many name-change options. 
 ''I was coming face to face with something that I'd always known would be a major issue,'' she said. ''When I was in school, people always joked about what kids with hyphenated names would do when they got married.'' 
 She decided to take the name-change question to the polls. At an online voting page she built at SurveyMonkey.com, several dozen friends and family members weighed in on whether she should become just Kate Sommers or Katie Sommerberry-Gillin. Or Katharine Elizabeth Gilnewsom. 
 She took the advice of many of her survey-takers and added her new husband's name to her own name, after subtracting the hyphen. Her legal name is now Katharine Newberry Gillin Sommers -- Kate N.G. Sommers, for short.
 The issue of men who want to change their names made news recently when a California man found himself caught in red tape trying to take his wife's name; he sued the state, claiming gender discrimination. The case was the impetus for legislation, signed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger in October, that will give married spouses and domestic partners equal rights to change their names beginning January 2009.
 Seven states already recognized a husband's right to take his wife's last name upon marriage. They are New York, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts and North Dakota. 
 Kate Talbert, 29, a medical student in Los Angeles, went to Indiebride.com two years ago for input about what new name she and her future husband, Brian Denny, 31, should call themselves after their wedding. They had already decided to create a new name, and she needed to figure it out quickly to order the engraved chocolate bars for their wedding guests. 
 ''It was nice to have other people to bounce ideas off of,'' she said. 
 As for her proposed names, ''Emerson'' made one fellow bride think of ''the bald doctor on M*A*S*H.'' ''Sarana,'' said another, would be ''difficult to pronounce if someone's calling you'' which might be good, ''because you can tell which ones are the telemarketers.''
 In the end, Ms. Talbert and Mr. Denny decided on E.E. Cummings's middle name, Estlin. 
 ''I wasn't hugely attached to my last name,'' said the former Mr. Denny, a computer programmer, ''and she just couldn't really see herself as Kate Denny. And taking her name didn't feel right, either. So we decided to take a new name instead.''
 ''My dad might've been a little sad, but not really,'' he added. ''My family is pretty open-minded.''
 Some choose to seek professional assistance when changing their name.
 Danielle Tate of Potomac, Md., runs the Web site Misstomrs.com, which can help women go through the legal steps to change their surnames. For $29.95, brides can print out all the necessary papers online -- and get Ms. Tate's candid thoughts on their best options.
 ''Women who are only children or who work in a family business usually don't want to change their name completely,'' she said. ''It's a personal choice, but people are hungry for advice, and there's just not a lot of reference out there.''
 Maryanna Korwitts, a professional name consultant in Naperville, Ill., takes a more academic approach.
 Ms. Korwitts is a self-described ''name-ologist'' who has studied calligraphic design; she helps people name businesses and babies and rethink their names before marriage, or after divorce. 
 ''All of us recognize that our name is more than just a word or a label, but we've never really been educated to understand the energy behind it,'' she said.
 When the wedding-day softball game at a resort in Mount Tremper, in upstate New York, finally began, Ms. Van Camp, a social worker in New York City, ended up feeling less in control of the outcome than she thought she would.
 ''We both felt a fair amount of hubris about our softball abilities,'' said Mr. Bloch, a vice president for external relations at the Empire State Development Corporation in New York City. 
 The bride ended up having to leave halfway through so that she could get her hair done. While she was gone, the Bloch team won.
 ''So I had to take his name,'' said the former Ms. Van Camp -- now Mrs. Bloch. ''But I'm a good player. I think if I'd been able to play the whole game, he'd be a Van Camp.''
 But the game had the same effect as a shared last name. ''It brought our families together,'' Mr. Bloch said.

Teachable Moments:
 Tell Me More, Indeed!
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Talking About Sex. Then Again, Maybe Not'' (Parenting column, Nov. 25):
 As the mother of four (three girls and a boy), I understand Michael Winerip's reticence about having ''the talk'' with his children. 
 And I guess, after reading his column, I can say that I, too, was waiting for those teachable moments, albeit only because I kept putting it off. 
 But I have to defend myself here. Maybe those of us who are afraid of engaging our children in this discussion are just unwilling to disturb their innocence.
 When my oldest daughter was about 5, she loved listening to the soundtrack to ''Grease.'' She would happily sing the words: ''Tell me more, tell me more, did you get very far? Tell me more, tell me more, like does he have a car?'' Contemplating those words, she asked me, ''How can you get very far if you don't have a car?'' 
 Maybe the experts would define this as my teachable moment. I, however, chose to remain silent and let the innocence live on for a little while longer.

 It Can Get Dangerous
 Going Round in Circles
 To the Editor:
 Re ''A Shift, but for Some Drivers, a Vicious Circle'' (Nov. 25):
 I use the roundabout where Routes 33 and 34 and County Road 547 meet no fewer than five times a week. It is true, the delays during rush hours are longer. 
 It also seems clear that the folks who (re)design these intersections seldom, if ever, use them. If they did, the design would be abandoned. 
 All the Department of Transportation has done is postpone the inevitable construction of an overpass or the installation of an intersection with traffic lights. A department spokeswoman said that ''motorists may need to modify their driving behavior.'' Rest assured, someone is going to be killed while we ''adjust to the new pattern.'' 
 New Jersey could pay off its debt in five years were there any enforcement of the statute that requires the use of directional signals. I'd be surprised if one in 10 drivers uses them, so it's a guessing game as to where the drivers in front of you will exit. 
 There is not even one sign at the roundabout urging or reminding drivers to use their signals. (Maybe the signs would have cost too much.)

 The Rutgers Report
 On New Jersey Migration
 To the Editor:
 Mary E. Forsberg (''The New Jersey Exodus That Wasn't,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 18) criticizes our report on the acceleration in net out-migration of New Jersey residents for ''selective use'' of census data on population trends by not accounting for the natural rate of population increase (births minus deaths) and net international migration. 
 But our first table provides the complete census data for all three components of population change from 2002 to 2006, and explicitly indicates that the total increase in population has been positive during this period. 
 New Jersey's population growth is slowing significantly because the gains due to births exceeding deaths and from net international migration are being increasingly offset by the acceleration in internal out-migration (there are more New Jersey residents leaving for other states than there are residents from other states moving into New Jersey). 
 Thus, the report focuses on net out-migration as the cause of the decline in the state's population growth.
 Ms. Forsberg cites the increase in state income tax returns and income between 2001 and 2005. We say that the effect of these gains has increased state tax revenues over this time. But our key point is that income and sales tax revenues would have been even higher had the net out-migration been less.
 Ms. Forsberg characterizes our report as ''scary warnings for the last person leaving the state to turn out the lights.'' Here is our conclusion from the report: ''Policies to reduce property taxes, invest in science and technology-based economic growth, enhance infrastructure, and restore business confidence offer significant economic and fiscal benefits by retaining New Jersey's residents and businesses.'' 
 These are hardly ''scary warnings.''

HEADLINE: The Seer

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI

 BODY:
When it came to building her personal collection, the legendary art dealer Ileana Sonnabend said she relied on a time-tested method. ''For years, after a show, I'd buy what nobody else wanted,'' she once told an interviewer. ''They were always the most difficult pieces, but in the end they became the strongest.'' 
 Sonnabend, who passed away in October, a few days before her 93rd birthday, never turned away from difficulty, though the singular course she charted through the art of her time was propelled by the deep pleasure art provided her. She was an intensely private -- some would say shy -- woman whose galleries, first in Paris and later in New York, consistently showcased the most radical work of the day, much of it, by artists like Robert Rauschenberg, Vito Acconci and Jeff Koons, a magnet for media attention and controversy. She was a passionate collector, not only of contemporary art but also of vintage photographs and French Art Deco furniture; yet she lived with just a tiny fraction of the extraordinary works she amassed, most of which remained on loan or in storage. 
 Married for more than 25 years to the pioneering art impresario Leo Castelli, Sonnabend downplayed her role in shaping his gallery's glittering roster of Pop and Minimalist artists. She stepped into the limelight after their divorce, when the Parisian gallery she started in 1962 with her second husband, Michael Sonnabend, opened the Continent's eyes to work by Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol. 
 And despite her reputation as a shrewd businesswoman, Sonnabend was, by all accounts, largely indifferent to commercial considerations, regularly championing art that was considered unsalable, usually because the slower, duller market hadn't yet caught up with it. She often helped artists by buying their work when nobody else would; and when she needed to, she paid her gallery's expenses through the sale of pieces she'd acquired decades before, their value having escalated astronomically. In that way, her business remained remarkably free of bottom-line considerations.
 ''We never looked for artists who were successful,'' explained Antonio Homem, the Sonnabend Gallery's longtime director (and the Sonnabends' adopted son). On the contrary, he continued, ''we had a tendency to look for artists who were not successful, because we thought they should be, and we'd try to make them so.''
 For some, this happened relatively quickly. 
 The careers of Jim Dine and Haim Steinbach took off rather rapidly after Sonnabend showed Dine's tool paintings and Steinbach's installations of lava lamps in the 1960s and the 1980s, respectively. For others, such as the influential German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher (images of Rhineland industrial architecture) or the recondite sculptor Barry Le Va (brain-teasing, process-oriented installations), success proceeded at a slow-burn pace.
 No matter. ''Ileana didn't need approval,'' Homem said. ''She felt that it would come at some point, because she believed in what she was doing. But she also felt that if it never came, she still believed in what she was doing. And she would want to do it anyway.''
 Unlike today's megadealers with their constant poachings of high-profile artists whose careers were fostered by smaller galleries -- and unlike today's collectors, whose feeding frenzy is driven by fashion and an eye for the auctions -- Sonnabend was ''a kind of incubator,'' said the photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, who has shown with the gallery since the 1970s. ''She hatched many artists.'' Late in life, beneath her mild, grandmotherly facade -- her signature tent dresses, her fabled reticence, her habit of knitting -- her opinions on art remained, as Jasper Johns described them in a recent e-mail message, ''surprisingly fearless and uncompromising.'' 
 Ileana Sonnabend was born in Bucharest, Romania, in 1914, the youngest daughter of Mihail Schapira, a wealthy Jewish industrialist. Educated by governesses, she learned about art from trips to her mother Marianne's native city, Vienna. While her mother and her elder sister (both noted beauties) would go clothes shopping, they'd drop Ileana off at the Kunsthistorisches Museum to spend the day with Titian and Velazquez.
 Bucharest's provincialism must have burnished the allure of an Italian dandy, the ne'er-do-well son of a Hungarian Jewish banker from Trieste, who showed up one evening at a dinner party, and whom she married shortly thereafter. Leo Castelli was 24, Ileana Schapira, 17; a picture of her from that era shows a pensive young woman with a hint of irony playing about her fine, dark eyes; under one arm she appears to be clutching an art publication. On their honeymoon in Vienna, she picked out a Matisse watercolor as her wedding present.
 Paris beckoned; partly to escape rising anti-Semitism in the East, the couple moved there with their infant daughter Nina in 1936. Leo hobnobbed with Surrealists, dallied with other women (in what would turn out to be a favorite pastime) and dabbled in banking, eventually opening an art gallery with his friend, the architect Rene Drouin. They mounted a single, highly successful exhibition, of Surrealist-inspired furniture, in the spring of 1939; by September the war had closed them down, and the Castellis set off again, with Nina's English nanny and Ileana's miniature dachshund in tow, to America.
 Mihail Schapira, having salvaged a small portion of his fortune, was already in New York; he installed them on the fourth floor of a town house he owned on East 77th Street. Leo joined the Army; Ileana enrolled at Columbia, where in a Proust seminar she met the erudite Michael Sonnabend, a bohemian ''refugee'' (as he called himself) from Buffalo, N.Y. After the war, the Castellis found another kind of home, in places like Peggy Guggenheim's gallery, Art of This Century, and the Club on Eighth Street (an intellectual playground for the artistic avant-garde). The reigning Abstract Expressionists (Jackson Pollock, Willem and Elaine de Kooning) were their frequent guests at the rambling summer house the couple purchased in a still-rural East Hampton. But by 1957, when Leo (after a decade of hesitation) opened the Castelli Gallery in the living room of their town-house apartment, he and Ileana were already looking toward the next generation.
 Word on the street still credits Ileana as being the eye behind Castelli Gallery. It was she who signed on Robert Rauschenberg, days after a visit the Castellis had made to the young painter's Pearl Street loft ended with the offer of a show to Jasper Johns instead. (Johns lived downstairs, and the two artists shared a single refrigerator; when Rauschenberg said he was going down to get ice for drinks, Leo, who had been fascinated by a Johns target painting he'd seen at the Jewish Museum, insisted on meeting him.)
 ''I had a rapport with her that I didn't have with Leo,'' Rauschenberg, the artist with whom Sonnabend was most intimately associated, said recently, speaking by telephone from his studio on Captiva Island, in Florida. ''I think he respected something a little more mysterious than my sensuality. He preferred Jasper. But Ileana liked our mutual foolishness.'' 
 A few years later, when Ileana was recovering from a serious illness, Rauschenberg gave her as a keepsake a Life Saver he had partially sucked and then cast in lead. ''Not because she needed one,'' he explained, ''but because she was one.'' Yet surely the need, and the gratitude, were mutual; art and her relationships with artists were something to hold on to, keeping her afloat in a life tossed between continents, when all else could appear transitory. For years she wore the Life Saver on a chain around her neck.
 In those days, Rauschenberg was working on his now-celebrated ''combines'' series, the painted assemblages that coaxed a haunting beauty from real-life detritus: old tires, stuffed birds, vintage photographs, electric fans, scraps of newspaper and the like. Not many people, at the time, understood the combines' radical transformation of life into art. (Only one work sold from Rauschenberg's 1958 show at Castelli Gallery -- to Leo.) And when Ileana -- who, though divorced from Castelli in 1959, remained his confidante and close collaborator -- showed Rauschenberg's work in the Parisian gallery she and Michael Sonnabend (by then her husband) opened a few years later, the French establishment offered stiff resistance. (''Dehors!'' Ileana once commanded a journalist from Paris Match when his conspiratorially negative tone before some works by Pop artists on display in the gallery had tried her patience excessively.)
 Yet the Sonnabends' persistent exposure of the new American art abroad helped pave the way for Rauschenberg's victory, when he won grand prize at the 1964 Venice Biennale. Despite suspicions that Castelli had fixed the jury, it was a watershed moment, as the international art world finally woke up to New York's ascendancy.
 The Sonnabends might be thought to have heeded that call, when they opened Sonnabend Gallery in New York: first uptown, on Madison Avenue, and then at 420 West Broadway. SoHo at the time was still largely industrial, but the inaugural opening of the building's four galleries -- Sonnabend, Castelli, Andre Emmerich and John Weber -- on the same September evening in 1971 signaled the start of an era.
 That night, a pair of relatively obscure British artists, Gilbert and George, created a public sensation with their ''Singing Sculpture.'' Dressed in suits, their faces and hands painted bronze, they mimed the gestures of automatons as they mouthed the words to ''Underneath the Arches,'' a 1931 British music-hall ditty. The lyrics, about a tramp sleeping outside (''pavement is my pillow / no matter where I stray / Underneath the arches / I dream my dreams away''), were like an anthem to the transcendentally homeless spirit of the new art -- performative, nomadic, outrageous, ephemeral.
 At the time, to artists just starting out, Ileana could appear both maternal and formidable. ''She was kind of scary, with that Peter Lorre accent,'' said the photographer William Wegman, who showed with her through most of the 1970s. ''But then, she loved my dog, Man Ray. She was always secretly feeding him dog treats underneath the table.'' (He also noted that she was one of the first to sell photography as art.)
 Vito Acconci remembers her initial visit, in 1971, to his small West Village apartment, when he showed ''Conversions,'' a film recording his futile attempts to transform his naked body into that of a woman. ''In the first part, I'm burning the hair off my breasts and pulling at it. In the second, I'm going through various exercises with my penis confined between my legs. And in the third part, there's a woman behind me holding my penis in her mouth,'' he recalled on the telephone recently. ''Well, after the third part, Ileana's only comment was, 'You make it very difficult, don't you?' '' 
 For his first show at Sonnabend, in 1972, Acconci presented ''Seedbed,'' a landmark performance in which he lay hidden beneath a ramp, masturbating for hours while visitors listened in on his rambling sexual fantasies. ''Seedbed'' didn't leave collectors with much to take home beyond, perhaps, a sense of shock. (There was a joke in the art world at the time, the artist recalled: ''It's very easy to own a Vito Acconci. All you have to do is shake his hand.'')
 And that was often the case throughout the '70s, as Sonnabend continued to show a heady mix of American and European artists, with Arte Povera, conceptual art, Minimalist sculpture, installation and performance featuring heavily in the program. ''In my time, there were not a lot of sales,'' observed Ealan Wingate, who worked at the SoHo gallery through much of the '70s and has since moved on to Gagosian Gallery.
 Homem says that Sonnabend Gallery has never stopped representing an artist, even when the market for their work appeared to have dried up indefinitely. That kind of fidelity on the part of an art dealer is almost unthinkable today. ''Nowadays, if a young M.F.A. shows with someone, and their work isn't selling, they're in trouble,'' said the artist John Baldessari. ''Then, if Ileana believed in you, it didn't matter.''
 What she did consistently, over the course of four decades, was inspire young artists with a sense of possibility. ''My grandmother said, 'You can do whatever you want to do in my house,' '' the painter Jim Dine, who began showing with Sonnabend in 1960, recalled. ''And that is, in a way, what Ileana said to me.''
 Jeff Koons said that Sonnabend ''just presented opportunities. She didn't want anything in return, other than to experience great art and to be able to offer the works she enjoyed to her friends.'' 
 He joined the gallery during another bold phase in Sonnabend's career -- her 1986 show of four young artists, including Ashley Bickerton, Peter Halley and Meyer Vaisman, who like Koons had been showing in the East Village gallery International With Monument. Their coolly conceptual, brashly American sensibility, which came to be known as Neo-Geo, followed in the lineage of Pop and Minimalism. 
 For Koons, Sonnabend provided a crucial link to the European tradition (Duchampian, Dadaist) that lay behind his displays of Hoover vacuum cleaners, sculptures of inflatable toy bunnies and other works that mined the latent sexual content of American icons. When, in 1988, Koons wanted to cast a life-size porcelain sculpture of Michael Jackson and a monkey, for example, Ileana suggested manufacturers in Europe. The piece (which sold for $5.6 million at auction in 2001) is part Nymphenburg rococo, part American monstrosity.
 ''Ileana became more and more daring with age,'' Annie Cohen-Solal, the French author who is writing separate biographies of Castelli and Sonnabend, said over lunch at Mezzogiorno, the Italian restaurant in SoHo that was one of the couple's haunts. ''She was always searching.''
 Every person I spoke with agreed that Sonnabend's eye for art was remarkable, but no one could pinpoint the nature and source of her talent for discernment. For Baldessari, it was related to her ability, when preparing a show, to ''invariably pick out the best works, the ones that were my favorites.'' The artist Dorothea Rockburne, who showed with Galerie Sonnabend in Paris, described Sonnabend's influence this way: ''Some people come into the studio, and the work seems to light up,'' she said. ''It starts taking bows in front of people who can see it.'' Rauschenberg, on the other hand, recalled her often responding negatively in the studio to changes in his practice, though the next day she'd be the new work's most fervent supporter. Homem cites Sonnabend's ''willingness to remain open to self-contradiction'' as key to her chameleon-like ability to embrace the changing forms of artistic originality.
 ''I remember thinking, when she was showing Koons, that it was amazing how many generations she seemed to stay alive as a dealer,'' said Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Govan noted that his relationship with Sonnabend was ''by far the least commercial I've ever had with an art dealer,'' recalling conversations with Ileana and Homem that ranged over art, opera, design, literature: ''They were totally nonaggressive about selling art. They preferred to talk about it.''
 Was this noblesse oblige or merely an extremely long-range marketing strategy? The great Parisian dealer Ambroise Vollard (Cezanne and Picasso's champion) also employed the opposite of a hard sell: making a point of not showing clients the pieces they asked to see. Sonnabend, too, could appear reluctant to part with works. ''Sometimes she preferred to keep them rather than to sell them,'' Count Giuseppe Panza, the great Italian collector, particularly of Pop and Minimalist art, suspected. ''I bought hundreds of works from Leo, and I never once remember a discussion of money,'' he recalled on the phone from his home in Milan. ''With Ileana, you had to negotiate, call back, and sometimes she'd say other collectors were interested. Usually I'd get the work I wanted. But she knew how to raise the prices very well.''
 Yet behind these business tactics lay an insistence on the work's true worth. ''My mother taught me that art is beyond value,'' Nina Sundell, Ileana and Leo's daughter, explained. ''But if you're going to sell it, and the more important it is, you'd better get a good price.''
 Sonnabend was, for many of her contemporaries, the last living link to a time when being an art dealer was less a business than a vocation. In the 1980s, when she was in her 70s (but smack in the middle of her professional life), she told an interviewer: ''I am not really a dealer. 
 I am an amateur, a word I use in the French sense: one who loves. In this case, it's a love of art.'' 
 Mary Boone, as a young dealer, moved into the ground floor at 420 West Broadway. Sonnabend was part of a select group of women, she says, including Paula Cooper, Barbara Gladstone and Marian Goodman, ''who had a radical effect on the climate and complexion of the art world, and who were my mentors.'' Boone, whose name became synonymous with the go-go art market of the 1980s, said: ''The financial impulses of today almost make the '80s look like the '70s. Even in the '80s, artists could experiment. Now everything is so expensive. Well, you need to take risks to make great art.''
 Rachel Lehmann, a partner in Chelsea's Lehmann Maupin Gallery, sees the role of a dealer in today's global economy as also having changed drastically. Sonnabend, she said, ''created a structure of total support for artists.'' Today, being a dealer involves ''showcasing the artist in such a way that information filters to the right constituencies, that the work is valid and needs to be taken seriously.'' Lehmann, who was Sonnabend's friend for almost 30 years, admired above all her great liberty of spirit. ''Having lived in different worlds, and having this huge amount of knowledge and experience, she had this very deep freedom, which for me is part of her legacy, and which allowed her to adapt so quickly to each new era,'' Lehmann said. ''She always gave me the impression that she could do exactly as she pleased.''

HEADLINE: Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: LILONGWE, Malawi 

 BODY:
Malawi hovered for years at the brink of famine. After a disastrous corn harvest in 2005, almost five million of its 13 million people needed emergency food aid.
 But this year, a nation that has perennially extended a begging bowl to the world is instead feeding its hungry neighbors. It is selling more corn to the World Food Program of the United Nations than any other country in southern Africa and is exporting hundreds of thousands of tons of corn to Zimbabwe.
 In Malawi itself, the prevalence of acute child hunger has fallen sharply. In October, the United Nations Children's Fund sent three tons of powdered milk, stockpiled here to treat severely malnourished children, to Uganda instead. ''We will not be able to use it!'' Juan Ortiz-Iruri, Unicef's deputy representative in Malawi, said jubilantly.
 Farmers explain Malawi's extraordinary turnaround -- one with broad implications for hunger-fighting methods across Africa -- with one word: fertilizer. 
 Over the past 20 years, the World Bank and some rich nations Malawi depends on for aid have periodically pressed this small, landlocked country to adhere to free market policies and cut back or eliminate fertilizer subsidies, even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers. But after the 2005 harvest, the worst in a decade, Bingu wa Mutharika, Malawi's newly elected president, decided to follow what the West practiced, not what it preached. 
 Stung by the humiliation of pleading for charity, he led the way to reinstating and deepening fertilizer subsidies despite a skeptical reception from the United States and Britain. Malawi's soil, like that across sub-Saharan Africa, is gravely depleted, and many, if not most, of its farmers are too poor to afford fertilizer at market prices.
 ''As long as I'm president, I don't want to be going to other capitals begging for food,'' Mr. Mutharika declared. Patrick Kabambe, the senior civil servant in the Agriculture Ministry, said the president told his advisers, ''Our people are poor because they lack the resources to use the soil and the water we have.''
 The country's successful use of subsidies is contributing to a broader reappraisal of the crucial role of agriculture in alleviating poverty in Africa and the pivotal importance of public investments in the basics of a farm economy: fertilizer, improved seed, farmer education, credit and agricultural research.
 Malawi, an overwhelmingly rural nation about the size of Pennsylvania, is an extreme example of what happens when those things are missing. As its population has grown and inherited landholdings have shrunk, impoverished farmers have planted every inch of ground. Desperate to feed their families, they could not afford to let their land lie fallow or to fertilize it. Over time, their depleted plots yielded less food and the farmers fell deeper into poverty.
 Malawi's leaders have long favored fertilizer subsidies, but they reluctantly acceded to donor prescriptions, often shaped by foreign-aid fashions in Washington, that featured a faith in private markets and an antipathy to government intervention. 
 In the 1980s and again in the 1990s, the World Bank pushed Malawi to eliminate fertilizer subsidies entirely. Its theory both times was that Malawi's farmers should shift to growing cash crops for export and use the foreign exchange earnings to import food, according to Jane Harrigan, an economist at the University of London.
 In a withering evaluation of the World Bank's record on African agriculture, the bank's own internal watchdog concluded in October not only that the removal of subsidies had led to exorbitant fertilizer prices in African countries, but that the bank itself had often failed to recognize that improving Africa's declining soil quality was essential to lifting food production.
 ''The donors took away the role of the government and the disasters mounted,'' said Jeffrey Sachs, a Columbia University economist who lobbied Britain and the World Bank on behalf of Malawi's fertilizer program and who has championed the idea that wealthy countries should invest in fertilizer and seed for Africa's farmers. 
 Here in Malawi, deep fertilizer subsidies and lesser ones for seed, abetted by good rains, helped farmers produce record-breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007, according to government crop estimates. Corn production leapt to 2.7 billion metric tons in 2006 and 3.4 billion in 2007 from 1.2 billion in 2005, the government reported. 
 ''The rest of the world is fed because of the use of good seed and inorganic fertilizer, full stop,'' said Stephen Carr, who has lived in Malawi since 1989, when he retired as the World Bank's principal agriculturalist in sub-Saharan Africa. ''This technology has not been used in most of Africa. The only way you can help farmers gain access to it is to give it away free or subsidize it heavily.''
 ''The government has taken the bull by the horns and done what farmers wanted,'' he said. Some economists have questioned whether Malawi's 2007 bumper harvest should be credited to good rains or subsidies, but an independent evaluation, financed by the United States and Britain, found that the subsidy program accounted for a large share of this year's increase in corn production. 
 The harvest also helped the poor by lowering food prices and increasing wages for farm workers. Researchers at Imperial College London and Michigan State University concluded in their preliminary report that a well-run subsidy program in a sensibly managed economy ''has the potential to drive growth forward out of the poverty trap in which many Malawians and the Malawian economy are currently caught.''
 Farmers interviewed recently in Malawi's southern and central regions said fertilizer had greatly improved their ability to fill their bellies with nsima, the thick, cornmeal porridge that is Malawi's staff of life. 
 In the hamlet of Mthungu, Enelesi Chakhaza, an elderly widow whose husband died of hunger five years ago, boasted that she got two ox-cart-loads of corn this year from her small plot instead of half a cart.
 Last year, roughly half the country's farming families received coupons that entitled them to buy two 110-pound bags of fertilizer, enough to nourish an acre of land, for around $15 -- about a third the market price. The government also gave them coupons for enough seed to plant less than half an acre.
 Malawians are still haunted by the hungry season of 2001-02. That season, an already shrunken program to give poor farmers enough fertilizer and seed to plant a meager quarter acre of land had been reduced again. Regional flooding further lowered the harvest. Corn prices surged. And under the government then in power, the country's entire grain reserve was sold as a result of mismanagement and corruption.
 Mrs. Chakhaza watched her husband starve to death that season. His strength ebbed away as they tried to subsist on pumpkin leaves. He was one of many who succumbed that year, said K. B. Kakunga, the local Agriculture Ministry official. He recalled mothers and children begging for food at his door. 
 ''I had a little something, but I could not afford to help each and every one,'' he said. ''It was very pathetic, very pathetic indeed.''
 But Mr. Kakunga brightened as he talked about the impact of the subsidies, which he said had more than doubled corn production in his jurisdiction since 2005.
 ''It's quite marvelous!'' he exclaimed. 
 Malawi's determination to heavily subsidize fertilizer and the payoff in increased production are beginning to change the attitudes of donors, say economists who have studied Malawi'sexperience. 
 The Department for International Development in Britain contributed $8 million to the subsidy program last year. Bernabe Sanchez, an economist with the agency in Malawi, estimated the extra corn produced because of the $74 million subsidy was worth $120 million to $140 million.
 ''It was really a good economic investment,'' he said.
 The United States, which has shipped $147 million worth of American food to Malawi as emergency relief since 2002, but only $53 million to help Malawi grow its own food, has not provided any financial support for the subsidy program, except for helping pay for the evaluation of it. Over the years, the United States Agency for International Development has focused on promoting the role of the private sector in delivering fertilizer and seed, and saw subsidies as undermining that effort.
 But Alan Eastham, the American ambassador to Malawi, said in a recent interview that the subsidy program had worked ''pretty well,'' though it displaced some commercial fertilizer sales.
 ''The plain fact is that Malawi got lucky last year,'' he said. ''They got fertilizer out while it was needed. The lucky part was that they got the rains.''
 And the World Bank now sometimes supports the temporary use of subsidies aimed at the poor and carried out in a way that fosters private markets. 
 Here in Malawi, bank officials say they generally support Malawi's policy, though they criticize the government for not having a strategy to eventually end the subsidies, question whether its 2007 corn production estimates are inflated and say there is still a lot of room for improvement in how the subsidy is carried out.
 ''The issue is, let's do a better job of it,'' said David Rohrbach, a senior agricultural economist at the bank. 
 Though the donors are sometimes ambivalent, Malawi's farmers have embraced the subsidies. And the government moved this year to give its people a more direct hand in their distribution.
 Villagers in Chembe gathered one recent morning under the spreading arms of a kachere tree to decide who most needed fertilizer coupons as the planting season loomed. They had only enough for 19 of the village's 53 families. 
 ''Ladies and gentlemen, should we start with the elderly or the orphans?'' asked Samuel Dama, a representative of the Chembe clan. 
 Men led the assembly, but women sitting on the ground at their feet called out almost all the names of the neediest, gesturing to families rearing children orphaned by AIDS or caring for toothless elders.
 There were more poor families than there were coupons, so grumbling began among those who knew they would have to watch over the coming year as their neighbors' fertilized corn fields turned deep green.
 Sensing the rising resentment, the village chief, Zaudeni Mapila, rose. Barefoot and dressed in dusty jeans and a royal blue jacket, he acted out a silly pantomime of husbands stuffing their pants with corn to sell on the sly for money to get drunk at the beer hall. The women howled with laughter. The tension fled.
 He closed with a reminder he hoped would dampen any jealousy. 
 ''I don't want anyone to complain,'' he said. ''It's not me who chose. It's you.''
 The women sang back to him in a chorus of acknowledgment, then dispersed to their homes and fields.

 CORRECTION:
 A chart on Sunday about improvements in Malawi's agricultural production, using erroneous information from a study by researchers at Imperial College London and Michigan State University, misstated the size of recent corn harvests. (Because of an editing error, the article also included the wrong figures.) The increase in production was in millions of metric tons, not billions. (Estimates show that corn production rose to 2.7 million metric tons in 2006 and 3.4 million in 2007 from 1.2 million in 2005.)

HEADLINE: From the Heights of $100 Oil, Most Stocks Look Vulnerable

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
THE recent spike in oil prices is probably a passing mania, many investment strategists say. But they warn that if oil remains near record levels next year, it would hurt most domestic stocks, with the notable exception of energy companies.
 ''The market clearly is not pricing in $100 oil and the economic restraint on growth that would be implied in that,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, the global markets strategist at JPMorgan Private Bank, a unit of JPMorgan Chase. In the New York futures market, the price of a barrel of oil settled Friday at $88.71, down from $98.18 the previous week. 
 If oil prices were to hover around $100 next year, Mr. Schweitzer said, that would have negative implications for the stock market. Investors would probably be advised to rotate from cyclical stocks to more defensive industries that tend to fare well in a weak economy. 
 An example of cyclical stocks that could be among the most vulnerable would be those of companies that make products whose purchases can be postponed, like new automobiles and vacations. A better bet might be health care and consumer staples, like food and beverages, which generally hold up well when times are tough.
 Mr. Schweitzer also said higher gasoline prices might spell even more trouble for the hard-pressed home builders. ''Most new development today takes place in outlying suburbs,'' he said, ''so that could be yet another drag on the home-building stocks.''
 Some energy experts say American consumers have not even begun to feel the pain at the pump from the rapid rise in crude oil prices.
 ''Higher gas prices are right around the corner,'' said Dan Pickering, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Company, an energy stock research firm in Houston. He estimated that gas prices could climb to $3.50 a gallon early next year.
 Higher pump prices and home heating bills could put a big strain on American consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of gross domestic product, said David Wyss, the chief economist of Standard & Poor's.
 Mr. Wyss said most retailers would probably lose business. ''Consumers tend to trade down'' if their wallets are pinched by higher energy prices, he said. Although Wal-Mart might pick up some shoppers who would ordinarily have gone to Macy's, he said, that probably would not be enough to offset losses in Wal-Mart's core customer base.
 One exception might be some of the luxury stores, Mr. Wyss said, especially those in big cities that can attract foreign tourists eager to exploit the weak dollar. Tiffany might do just fine, even with higher energy costs, he said. ''High-end customers are not going to be as hurt by gasoline prices.'' But, he added, ''they are more likely to stay away if they're nervous about what's happening in the stock markets.'' 
 In much of the country, Mr. Wyss said, high gasoline prices next summer would probably hurt the big hotel and restaurant chains. ''That would have less impact on McDonald's, because they are everywhere,'' he said, but many family-oriented restaurant chains could lose business if families took fewer road trips. 
 Automakers might suffer if gasoline prices remained above $3 a gallon, ''especially the American manufacturers, because they don't make enough relatively fuel-efficient cars and trucks,'' he said.
 Mr. Wyss recently raised his forecast for the average oil price in 2008 from $75 to $85, a level that, he said, would not be as bad for the economy as an average price of $100. Of course it would be even better for consumers if oil fell back to $70 a barrel, roughly its average price this year, he said, ''but it would not be a windfall. You just wouldn't have the negative effects.''
 Many experts attribute the recent price spike to a combination of speculation and over-reaction and say crude oil prices could deflate just as rapidly. 
 Michelle Dathorne, a credit analyst at Standard & Poor's who specializes in energy companies, said current supply and demand did not support oil at $100 a barrel. Over the last two years, there has been a fairly constant premium of $20 to $25 a barrel built into oil prices because of geopolitical concerns, she said. Until recently, rising prices were responding to demand. But she attributed the recent spike almost entirely to market speculation. 
 Michael Metz, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, was even more dismissive of traders who, he said, have bid up oil prices. ''I think this is a minibubble reflecting hysterical buying by speculators, who are fearful that we will embark on some sort of adventure in Iran and destabilize oil sources in the region,'' Mr. Metz said. 
 He predicted that a major correction in oil prices was imminent. But he said he did not expect this to hurt energy stocks, because $100 oil was not factored into their share prices. 
 He also said that if crude oil prices fell back too rapidly, the major oil producers would probably cut production. ''One quarter of the world's output is controlled by Saudi Arabia and Russia. If oil fell to $70 a barrel, they would cut,'' he said.
 WHILE major integrated energy companies like Exxon Mobil and Chevron have prospered in the current environment, Mr. Metz said he preferred the stocks of independent production companies right now. 
 ''They are both an earnings play and an asset play,'' he said, because the independents could be takeover targets for the major energy companies. 
 Mr. Pickering, the energy stock analyst, also liked the independent producers, like Devon Energy and Anadarko Petroleum. He also favors the deep-water drillers, including Transocean and Halliburton, because that is where most of the new oil finds are these days, he said.
 But Mr. Pickering said that even energy stocks -- the one area of the market that could benefit from higher commodity prices -- would be better off if crude oil prices fell back closer to their average for this year, because $100 oil could reduce global demand.
 ''We think the outlook for the group is better with oil at $70 for three years, versus oil at $100 for three months,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Greenhouse Villain Could Be a White Knight After All

BYLINE: By KEVIN CAMERON

 BODY:
THE European Union is serious about reining in the release of gases that contribute to global warming. As of Jan. 1, 2011, air-conditioning systems for all new European-made vehicles must begin the switch to a refrigerant other than the current formulation, known as R134a.
 If there is a familiar ring to this development, it's because the predecessor of R134a was itself banned for environmental reasons. While the effects on the earth's atmosphere are different this time, the scramble by automakers to comply seems every bit as urgent. 
 Air-conditioning makes use of the cooling effect that occurs when a gas is allowed to suddenly expand, familiar to some from the barroom trick of cooling drinks with a blast of carbon dioxide from a fire extinguisher. This effect can be prolonged using a suitable refrigerant gas, so long as the power to pump it around in a loop of compressors and radiators is maintained.
 In wide use for little more than a decade, the shortcoming of R134a is revealed by a standard measurement called the Global Warming Potential, established to compare other gases with the most plentiful greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The warming potential of R134a refrigerant is 1,410, meaning that the release of one gram of R134a would have the same global warming effect as releasing 1,410 grams of carbon dioxide. The warming number of Freon-12, the common auto refrigerant used into the 1990s, is 8,500.
 In an interesting twist, the leading alternative refrigerant being considered by European automakers is carbon dioxide. But it's hard to make real sense of the blizzard of reports on refrigerants and their performance. The German automakers' association has endorsed carbon dioxide, which not only has the baseline warming number of 1 but is also at least 20 percent more energy-efficient than the best systems using R134a, supporters say. 
 In the United States, the problem will be eliminating regulatory barriers for European autos using alternative refrigerants -- so they can be sold here.
 Aside from that issue, it might be tempting to let the Europeans go their own way. In the so-called Vermont ruling last September, a federal judge decided that individual states may specify exhaust emissions limits that are stricter than those set by the federal Environmental Protection Agency. 
 In California, the Air Resources Board is calling for a 30 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2016, and Vermont said it also wanted the reduction. Because 5.5 percent of the fuel burned by the United States auto fleet drives air-conditioning, alternative refrigerants would provide a benefit even here.
 The European Union's action reflects changing environmental priorities since 1983, when it was discovered that something was attacking the earth's ozone layer, the protective wrap in the atmosphere that absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the sun. If the notorious ''ozone hole'' above the southern polar region continued to expand, scientists said, the ultraviolet radiation would harm living things beyond just hapless penguins.
 Earlier it had been shown that the element chlorine could act as a catalyst in the atmospheric chemical reactions that destroy ozone. Where was this chlorine coming from? The research pointed at chlorofluorocarbons, synthetic compounds widely used as refrigerants, spray-can propellants and blowing agents for molding foam. An international agreement -- the Montreal Protocol -- soon called for phase-out of these chlorine compounds.
 New cars sold in much of the world since this agreement have used R134a refrigerant in their climate-control systems. It is a hydrofluorocarbon, which contains no chlorine. In the years since the ban of refrigerants containing chlorine, the ozone hole has receded.
 In the United States, the leading alternative seems to be R152a, with a warming potential of 120-140. Yet adopting this or another proposed blend is not simple. Refrigerants containing chlorine were inert and nontoxic because of the bond strength of the fluorine and chlorine in their molecules. But when hydrogen replaces chlorine, the molecules become less stable; R152a is regarded as slightly flammable. 
 There are also economic issues. In 2006, the European air-conditioning market was worth about $7 billion; chemical makers want the replacement to be a product they can patent, and sell with a trademark.
 The R152a alternative represents a 90 percent reduction of global warming potential compared with R134a. In addition, it is promoted as a direct replacement for R134a, requiring minimal mechanical changes to the air-conditioner. 
 But there are other problems: some refrigerants are incompatible with the lubricants used in air-conditioning compressors, and carbon dioxide systems operate at pressures five times that of today's systems, requiring heavy-duty hardware. 
 Joerg Schernikau, a vice president at Behr America, an air-conditioning supplier, said his company would most likely develop both European and American refrigerants.
 ''That's what we assume right now,'' he said, noting that Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen had recently chosen carbon dioxide.
 At Denso, the large Japanese auto parts manufacturer, Miwa Kurokawa, said that while manufacturers did not set the direction of global environmental planning, Denso intended to meet all regulations. 
 Can there be any other choice in a globalizing world that still lacks globalized standards?

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: FEEL THE HEAT: Replacing today's air-conditioner refrigerants will require more hot-weather testing of future models. (PHOTOGRAPH BY BRENDA PRIDDY & COMPANY) DIAGRAM: ALTERNATIVES FOR COOLING DOWN CARS: After 2010, the European Union will ban R134a, the most widely used refrigerant in automotive air-conditioning systems. An urgent search for a replacement is under way by automakers. One promising alternative is carbon dioxide. Here is a comparison of the refrigerants ranked by their Global Warming Potential, a measure of their contribution to the greenhouse effect. The G.W.P. number, in parentheses, represents each refrigerant's multiple of carbon dioxide's potential. R12 (8,500) Commonly known as Freon, R12 contains the element chlorine, which is destructive to earth's protective ozone layer. In use since the 1930s, it disappeared from auto air-conditioners in the 1990s as a result of the Montreal Protocol. R134a (1,410) The universal replacement for Freon, R134a is benign to the ozone layer. But its potential for high contributions to the global greenhouse effect -- in part because other refrigerants may be more efficient -- has numbered its days. R152a (120 - 140) Favored in the United States because it is a direct replacement for R134a that does not require re-engineering of the climate control systems, it has less support in Europe because of its flammability. R744 (1) Carbon dioxide, itself a greenhouse gas, would present little environmental threat when sealed inside an air-conditioning system. But it would need far higher working pressures, requiring new compressors and more rugged plumbing. TIMELINE R12 R134a R152a R744 Carbon dioxide was popular as a refrigerant in the first half of the 20th century. 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015

HEADLINE: A Cloudy Forecast For Commercial Market

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
MANY commercial real estate players may be ready to turn the page on 2007, in light of the continuing credit crisis and weakening economy. But they may not see a major turnaround throughout most of the country during the new year, according to one year-end industry report. 
 ''Uncertainty and challenges characterize 2008, with greater downside risk than real estate markets have faced in close to two decades,'' concluded the Emerging Trends in Real Estate report by PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Urban Land Institute, which interviewed more than 600 developers, services firms and investors over the summer. 
 The 29th annual survey, which was released last month, reflected the confusion that engulfed the industry as problems with mortgages were unfolding. Even though the commercial sector was faring better than housing, the biggest concerns for the respondents were economic: job growth, construction costs, interest rate changes, income and wage growth, and inflation. And not surprisingly, 78 percent said they expected underwriting standards for commercial and multifamily mortgages to be more stringent in 2008, compared with 70 percent surveyed last year and just 37 percent in 2005.
 More recent indicators underscore the concern, as the problems plaguing the residential market have spread to the commercial sector and the broader economy. In late November, Moody's Investors Service reported that commercial property values nationwide declined by 1.2 percent in September. 
 But despite the unease, ''there is still optimism out there,'' said Susan Smith, a manager in PricewaterhouseCoopers' Real Estate Business Advisory Services group in New York and an adviser on the report. ''There are opportunities across all sectors,'' she said.
 Although the overall commercial real estate market is likely to soften, the respondents said they expected certain regions to outperform others. The so-called global gateway cities like New York, Washington, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Boston have become magnets for employers, residents and investors, according to the report. ''Especially during times of uncertainty, this is where investors want to be,'' Ms. Smith said.
 New York City still reigns in real estate. ''It's a tale of two worlds -- New York and everything else,'' as one respondent put it. 
 Indeed, ''Class A'' office space -- in the newest and best-quality buildings -- in highly coveted areas like Midtown and downtown Manhattan continue to sell and lease for record prices, while vacancy rates are hovering around 5 percent, compared with 10 percent nationwide. 
 Maria Sicola, the executive managing director of research at Cushman & Wakefield, said that she expected Midtown Manhattan office rents to continue to rise by 5 to 10 percent in 2008. That is less than half the rate of this year's 30 percent growth. But she warns that rents generally lag other economic indicators by six months or more, so New York could still experience a flattening of rental rates, especially if the economy deteriorates. 
 In the third quarter of this year, significant office leases were signed, including Alliance Bernstein's lease of 150,581 square feet of space at 1345 Avenue of the Americas and America Online's lease of 144,404 square feet at 770 Broadway, according to Cushman & Wakefield. And even as the economic outlook clouds, real estate professionals believe there will be strong tenant demand for quality new buildings, such as 11 Times Square, a $400 million tower being developed by SJP Properties, which is expected to be completed in 2009. Asking rents are around $100 a square foot.
 While New York came in first in the survey by PwC and the Urban Land Institute, it wasn't the only standout. San Francisco, which is having a resurgence in its high-tech industry, and Seattle tied for second place among the respondents. 
 ''Seattle is really coming into its own,'' Ms. Smith said. 
 Seattle today has a broad range of employers in addition to large corporations like Microsoft and Boeing, and the city benefits from its proximity to the Pacific Rim shipping routes. Growth controls and geographic boundaries have led to higher-density, mixed-use developments, which are also helping to create vibrant downtown neighborhoods. Survey respondents ranked Seattle at the top for multifamily, industrial, hotel and retail opportunities. 
 Survey respondents also expected Boston's apartment rental market to remain strong, despite significant new supply coming onto the market. The city has been regaining some of the momentum it lost after a technology downturn early in the decade. Washington, Los Angeles, Honolulu, Austin, Tex., Raleigh/Durham, N.C., and Portland, Ore., were among the other top cities cited by respondents. At the bottom of the list were Detroit, New Orleans, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio. Respondents said they lacked ''global cachet'' and ''quality of life'' and continued to lose traditional manufacturing jobs. The report also said that investors tended to back away from second- and third-tier cities in a downturn.
 After a recent frenzy of hotel, retail and office development, the emphasis in 2008 may turn to the less glamorous but steady industrial sector, which includes warehouses and distribution centers. 
 Vacancy rates across the country for industrial properties are low and falling. Newer, high-tech warehouses and those near major ports or airports are the best positioned. ''Other industrial markets slowly wither,'' said the report. But the authors offered a caveat: Industrial markets could be hurt by a slowdown in consumer spending and imports. 
 The housing crisis will help the apartment rental market, which also rated high among the respondents. 
 Given the likelihood of a slowdown in consumer spending, the respondents were most concerned about the retail sector. In particular, many older second- and third-tier malls in suburban areas and smaller cities are rapidly becoming obsolete, Ms. Smith said, while a lot of new supply is coming next year. A traditional stronghold has been shopping centers anchored by a big grocery store, which tend to be more resistant to downturns. 
 The red-hot market for hotels is also likely to cool, according to the report. Hotels have done a booming business in the last few years, with occupancy levels and room rates increasing. But in a downturn, hospitality ''is the first sector to feel an economic hit,'' Ms. Smith said. 
 In particular, suburban markets, where many of the new developments are found, are likely to be hardest hit by any downturn. In contrast, luxury hotels in major metropolitan markets like New York, San Francisco and Boston should continue to fare well, Ms. Smith said. But she said that developing in these markets has become costly: ''The window to get in on and make money in hotels has passed.'' 
 The year ahead will largely be determined by supply-and-demand fundamentals, capital flows and, most of all, the economy, said Stephen R. Blank, a senior fellow at the Urban Land Institute.
 While the highly leveraged deals that drove up real estate prices are for the most part a thing of the past -- thanks to the fallout sweeping the subprime mortgage market -- foreign investors, pension funds and real estate investment trusts should temper price declines. ''It will mean a healthier market,'' Mr. Blank said.

HEADLINE: Housing Crisis? Try Mobile McMansions

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky. 

 BODY:
 THE magician, dapper and gray-haired, got laughs with card tricks and other feats that were already old when he was still young. And as he deftly linked and separated steel rings, Dick Stoner drew a crowd around an enormous banner that read ''Crossroads'' -- the company paying him so that it could stand out from more than a hundred other manufacturers at the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association's annual dealer convention in the cavernous Kentucky Exposition Center.
 It's no small trick to attract throngs from some 15,000 footsore attendees at a show that covers 925,000 square feet and is packed with vehicles costing $5,000 to $1 million. But Mr. Stoner is very good at his craft, and his patter is timeless. He blends punch lines and prestidigitation with frequent repetition of the Crossroads moniker. 
 After all, the $15 billion R.V. industry could use a little magic just now. To read news releases, of course, things are going really, really great! Public relations materials sent to reporters in the weeks before the trade show noted that the current five-year sales period was the best in the last 30 years and that a consumer survey from the University of Michigan had projected a 3.8 percent rise in shipments to manufacturers in the coming year. 
 In fact, though, things are not really, really great in R.V. land. Sales are slipping. Winnebago announced during the show that its revenue was falling for the first time in six years. And the industry association released updated projections indicating that industrywide sales would probably decline 4.8 percent next year compared with 2007.
 It's easy to see why sales are off. With an uncertain economy, tightening credit and gas prices through the roof, many would-be captains of land yachts are rethinking their dreams. Other issues also loom in a world increasingly worried about waste, sustainability and global warming. It might be getting harder to love a beast that gulps a gallon of fuel every seven miles. 
 Little wonder, then, that one word is on many lips. Bruce D. Hertzke, the chief executive of Winnebago, acknowledges that the times are ''challenging.'' In an interview, Richard Riegel, chief operating officer of Thor Industries, the parent company of 11 R.V. makers, including Crossroads and Airstream, invoked the specter of a ''challenging market.''
 Mark Warmoth, whose Weekend Warrior Trailer Manufacturing pioneered ''toy haulers'' -- R.V.'s with garage space in the back for all-terrain vehicles, motorcycles and other implements of ear-splitting outdoor fun -- is less prone to euphemism. ''A lot of people,'' he said, ''are laying down and dying.''
 But, gentle reader, before you start into a ''serves them right'' sermon about wretched excess, fuel consumption or the driving habits of snowbirds, consider this: Challenging times for the industry generally mean challenging times for many other Americans as well, because R.V. slumps tend to precede economic recessions.
 R.V.'s are a ''highly discretionary'' purchase, said Matt Howard, the vice president for marketing at Country Coach, a manufacturer of luxury craft that are roughly large enough to have their own ZIP code. ''The only reason somebody needs our motor coach is because they tell themselves they need our motor coach,'' he said. 
 Manufacturers say they are optimistic that the downturn is temporary and that they will bounce back before long. ''We will be affected, like a lot of the industry when the economy goes up or down,'' Mr. Hertzke said, noting that such shifts have occurred many times over the five decades that Winnebago has been in business. ''Each time we come back to a stronger, higher level.'' 
 Until things do turn around, there is still some joy in the market. It may seem counterintuitive, but the biggest, baddest -- and, of course, the most expensive -- R.V.'s are doing well, said Mr. Howard of Country Coach. The very high end, he points out, ''is where our growth is.''
 At the high end exists that peculiar breed of shopper that, to use a technical term from the world of economics, let's call the Rich Dude. They have sacks of money -- as the novelist Terry Pratchett puts it, ''so much gold in your pockets that you would have to employ two people just to hold your trousers up.'' And there are still many, many Rich Dudes out there. What does Rich Dude's money buy? At Country Coach, Rich Dude buys rolling palaces that can cost $1.7 million and come with Italian marble floors, high-tech controls, window-size flat-screen high-definition televisions and always-connected satellite systems for Internet and satellite TV. Do you want an electronic palm reader to unlock the door? ''We've done it,'' Mr. Howard said.
 Stepping into the Magna 630, a sort of blue whale on wheels, Mr. Howard explained in a tone as smooth as a creme brulee that the idea behind the Country Coach vehicles is ''residential luxury -- it's not a camping experience.''
 Which is why these models have two bathrooms. 
 Two? 
 Well, yeah. ''When I'm at home, I don't have to share my bathroom'' with guests, Mr. Howard said. The master bath is large, with a full-size shower. The old joke about standard R.V. bathrooms, he says, is that they are so small that the most effective way to shower is to ''soap up the walls and spin around.''
 Who buys such behemoths? These days, increasingly, baby boomers are hitting the age that historically coincides with motor home purchasing -- a vacation vehicle as nicely turned out as their Lexus or Mercedes. According to Mr. Howard, the target age of his buyers has been 63 to 68 years old. But a new market segment has opened and is growing fast: relative youngsters from 53 to 61.
 ''The boomers aren't waiting to retire to buy a coach,'' he noted. They ''want to manage their portfolio online and then take a walk on the beach.''
 Life without compromise is not cheap. At $700,000, the Magna is about three times as expensive as the average single-family home, and its 650-horsepower engine burns diesel almost as fast as it can be pumped into the 150-gallon tank.
 Richard Coon, the head of the trade association, argues that rising gas prices aren't a big issue for the owners of high-end R.V.'s, whose attitude can be summed up as: ''I just paid $400,000 for this motor home. Do you really think I give a rat's about the price of fuel?''
 Not missing a beat, Mr. Coon also pointed out that ''it's hard to say that in public, but that guy can afford the gas.''
 Mr. Howard of Country Coach estimated that even if a rolling condo got only 7 or 8 miles to the gallon, the spending increase for serious travelers as gas prices have climbed is, perhaps, a few hundred dollars a month.
 The decadence -- not just conspicuous consumption, but flamboyant consumption -- continues across the west wing of the Exposition Center in the territory staked out by the Newmar Corporation, where the company shows off an eye-popping vehicle that can probably be spotted from the International Space Station. It has been configured specifically to make the scene at sporting events. ''We are targeting the tailgaters,'' said Holly Nunemaker, a spokeswoman for the company.
 The $270,000 All-Star UTV -- for ''Ultimate Tailgating Vehicle'' -- is more than 40 feet long and nearly 13 feet tall and has so many gadgets and fold-outs that it looks like something Batman might plunk down the Wayne millions for in his golden years. 
 The UTV has two bathrooms, sure. But this one has two kitchens as well. There is a small galley for intimate family cooking and another for preparing and presenting the big feed before the game. One side of that kitchen is an industrial roll-up door that opens the room and its two stainless-steel countertops to the outside. 
 Open a panel on the outside, there's the heavy-duty Jenn-Air gas grill, which slides out on a shelf and can swivel so the chef is upwind. An exterior panel pops up to expose a 52-inch flat-screen TV -- the largest of the four on board. Friends can set up the lawn chairs around it in a kind of reverse drive-in, watching video under the two 17-foot-wide awnings while powerful external speakers blare out the audio.
 Did I mention the two flagpoles? You pop them up after you park.
 ALL is not over-the-top excess, however, at the show. Over in the Thor domain, the distinctively rounded, aluminum-clad Airstream trailers attract those with an interest in style and design. In new models like the 16-foot-long $45,000 Bambi, an Ikea-meets-the-Jetsons interior matches the nostalgically futuristic exterior and has become a draw for yuppies. 
 Mr. Riegel, the Thor executive, said a visitor focusing on the biggest and most expensive R.V.'s at the show would miss the point that companies like his want to make. ''We don't build rock star buses and race-car driver coaches,'' he said. ''There are a couple of hundred of those sold in a year. We build for the mass market, generally.''
 That means Thor shoots for annual sales of 100,000 R.V.'s and trailers. It offers luxurious coaches from its Mandalay division, with $325,0000 models, but it also markets $6,000 starter R.V.'s. That middle range, he said, is ''where the meat of the market is -- not in the rock star bus pricing.'' But he laughingly concedes that the land yachts are ''sexy.''
 At Winnebago, meanwhile, the company is opening a midsize line of recreation vehicles, including some that get 15 miles a gallon -- by R.V. standards, virtually a Prius. Americans yearn for the open road, said Mr. Hertzke, the company's chief executive. ''Nobody has a retirement plan that is just for them to just stay home.''
 Kelli Harms, a spokeswoman for Winnebago, said that some of the surging interest in R.V. travel in recent years came after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. ''Everybody re-evaluated what they're doing with their lives.'' 
 Rather than travel abroad, she said, more decided to ''see the great features of America.'' Yes, she conceded, you might see Paris and the Eiffel Tower if you venture overseas, but ''when is the last time you went to see Mount Rushmore?'' And a cross-country trek in an R.V. also gives you another kind of clarity: ''You do appreciate more what you have -- the freedom you have.''
 This sounds much nicer than an alternative explanation: that Americans became skittish about flying. Or maybe they were tired of being treated like potential terrorists just to go from Point A to Point B. You know, forced to throw away their yogurt in the security line, stuff their tiny shampoo bottles in just the right plastic bags, and take off their shoes for a weapons scan. Or the airline food itself, or -- 
 Oh, wait a minute. Is this still about R.V.'s? Rather than focusing on the drudgery of air travel, Ms. Harms went on to talk about community. Owning an R.V. creates camaraderie with other owners, she said, who socialize at campsites and build friendships. ''When you buy an R.V., you're purchasing the lifestyle, too.''
 YET even the democratizing effects of shared campsites could be shifting, with the emergence of the ultra-high-end vehicles. Monaco Coach, a luxury manufacturer whose vehicles can cost $700,000 or more, is building high-end ''destination resorts'' for super-R.V.'s so that they won't be the biggest, gaudiest vehicles at the campground. 
 The plots of land cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, said Jim Sheldon, a senior executive at Monaco, and the communities offer golf courses and upscale restaurants. ''For someone who has invested $500,000 to $700,000'' on an R.V., he said, ''spending another $200,000 for a destination location is very plausible.''
 Such talk might seem antithetical to the ''we're all just campers here'' ethic that has long characterized R.V. communities. But there's still plenty of room for the rest of us, said Mr. Warmoth, the founder of Weekend Warrior. In a black T-shirt and blue jeans, with his double-peaked goatee and graying curls that peek out from under his black gimme cap, he stands apart from the suit-and-tie armies of manufacturers' representatives at the show.
 Mr. Warmoth's innovation was trailers that offer full living space, but with a large room at the back that can be easily cleared of furniture. The back wall folds down to create a ramp and mobile garage for all manner of recreational, off-road equipment. ''It's brought in a younger group of people,'' he said. He says the toy haulers have contributed mightily to the company's $200 million in annual sales, and have inspired imitations throughout the industry. 
 Sitting on a leather couch in what he calls his ''top-dog, double throw-me-down huge'' trailer, called Full Throttle, which costs $75,000 and shows the ''warrior wing'' logo on every surface, Mr. Warmoth, 51, observed that ''this industry is very mild, and we're not. We're wild.''
 Mr. Warmoth's youngish weekend warriors are a bright spot for the industry. That is one reason Michael A. Schneider, the chief executive of the R.V. trade magazine publisher Affinity Group, says that ''most of us who have been around a while'' see the recent downturn as ''a temporary blip.'' People try the behemoths and just fall in love, he said. 
 Recessions come and go. Gas prices rise and, well, rise. But ''once somebody gets hooked on the lifestyle, sure, it's not pleasant when gasoline goes up,'' Mr. Schneider added. ''But they adjust, because they're passionate about the lifestyle.''

BYLINE: By JENNIFER BLEYER

 BODY:
HELEN UFFNER, the owner of a theatrical costume company, has a vast inventory of vintage items dating from the 1970s back to the 1860s, among them 8,300 dresses, 3,200 women's hats and 800 cartons of accessories. Items from her collection have made cameo appearances in movies like ''Capote,'' in television shows like ''Saturday Night Live'' and in countless Broadway plays.
 A decade ago, Ms. Uffner moved her business to a 7,000-square-foot loft on West 37th Street near Ninth Avenue, in the garment district. The location proved a perfect fit. ''We needed button people, trim people, fabric resources, millinery shops,'' Ms. Uffner said. ''In a business where time is money, it was nice to have everything within that grid.'' 
 But Ms. Uffner's business was in a small chunk of the garment district that was included in the rezoning of the Hudson Yards, on the Far West Side of Manhattan, nearly three years ago. In the garment district, the city decided to allow some residential development and different kinds of businesses, including the many, like hotels, that generally return more per square foot than a garment firm. Ms. Uffner soon received a letter from her landlord saying that her lease would not be renewed, and she promptly embarked on an exhaustive search in the area for a new space large enough to accommodate her collection. 
 No luck.
 ''I was shown buildings where maybe eight spaces were available, and they would innocently say, 'Sorry, nothing's available,''' Ms. Uffner recalled. ''Other agents and owners were honest with me. They said: 'Listen, we're waiting for the zoning laws to change again. We would rather cut up our spaces into small offices than have garment firms.'''
 Unable to find new quarters, Ms. Uffner moved last May to Long Island City, Queens, miles from the neighborhood of her choice. 
 The garment district, of course, is vastly diminished from its heyday in the 1950s. But over the last decade or so, as the city has grown more prosperous and seemingly every square foot of Manhattan real estate is in high demand, a second wave of trouble has been washing over the district's fabled streets. A growing number of embroiderers, fabric suppliers and sewing factories have lost their leases, making designers afraid that these ancillary businesses will become so scarce that they too will have to pack up. 
 For nearly a year, the city's Economic Development Corporation has been meeting with garment makers and their landlords, discussing ways to solve these troubles. It is clear why the city deems the issue urgent: The district may be less robust than it once was, but it is still home to about 1,800 garment firms employing 25,000 workers, and citywide, the apparel industry still accounts for 25 percent of manufacturing jobs. Those numbers could shrink fast. 
 ''A year ago, it was a factory here and a factory there,'' said Magda Aboulfadl, a project manager at the Garment Industry Development Corporation, an advocacy group. ''Even if you could see the writing on the wall, you could be in denial. Now you can't be in denial. Before it was death by a thousand cuts. Now it's entire limbs being cut off. And there are only so many limbs.''
 The Big Squeeze
 The garment district, bounded roughly by 34th and 42nd Streets and Fifth and Ninth Avenues, took shape in the 1920s and soon evolved into an industrial behemoth. Gilded showrooms on the avenues attracted buyers nationwide, and hundreds of small factories nestled in gritty buildings on the side streets. 
 In the 1950s, New York was home to 334,000 apparel workers, and the image of workmen pushing racks of coats and dresses through the district's narrow and congested streets became an iconic image of the city.
 In the 1970s, garment jobs began to migrate to factories overseas, where labor was significantly cheaper. In 1987, to protect what remained of the local apparel trade, the city instituted special zoning regulations that reserved much of the area's commercial space for garment firms.
 But starting in the mid-'90s, as the city's economy boomed and commercial rents skyrocketed, local landlords began getting restless. Many of them want to loosen the district's protective zoning, claiming that it handicaps them unfairly because while there is great demand for space, too little of it is from garment companies.
 ''To insist on a use that by and large doesn't exist anymore does not stem the tide of jobs leaving,'' said Barbara Randall, executive director of the Fashion Center Business Improvement District, whose board includes more than a dozen real estate executives. ''You're penalizing one class of businessmen in favor of another. The burden of manufacturing moving overseas is now the property owner's burden.''
 But according to Ms. Aboulfadl of the industry advocacy group, there is still considerable demand for space; it's just that merchants such as Ms. Uffner are losing out as available space is turned over to non-garment-industry tenants. ''I've seen whole floors go from factory to travel agency,'' Ms. Aboulfadl said. Whichever side is right, garment factories in the neighborhood are clearly feeling pressure. 
 The demand for commercial space means that many non-garment businesses -- like The New York Times, which has a new headquarters on Eighth Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets -- are moving to sites that once housed garment enterprises. Garment showrooms have been particularly affected by this trend. Long located on the avenues, which are not protected by the special zoning, showrooms have been losing their space to higher-paying tenants. Many showrooms have moved to the side streets, where they often displace garment manufacturers. 
 According to Patrick Murphy, vice president for fashion and retail growth initiatives at the Economic Development Corporation, this migration of showrooms is a primary impetus for the Bloomberg administration's discussions about rezoning in the district. 
 ''Our biggest concern is that if we don't change the zoning,'' Mr. Murphy said, ''all manufacturing is going to be forced out of the district. More showroom space isn't a bad idea, as long as you weren't disrupting all the manufacturing.'' 
 Some garment firms have been galvanized by these forces. Last spring, a group called Save the Garment Center began gathering signatures on petitions -- it has collected 3,500 so far -- and rallying garment makers to their cause.
 ''If we unprotect this area, we're going to be displaced,'' said Samanta Cortes, a founder of the group and the owner of an embroidery firm that has done work for Victoria's Secret and Ralph Lauren. ''And when we have to start going to Long Island City, we're going to disappear.''
 Other garment makers simply sound wistful for the way things were. 
 ''The covered-button guys, they're all gone,'' said Nanette Lepore, a fashion designer whose 120 workers occupy five floors of a building on 35th Street just off Seventh Avenue. ''Two-thirds of the fabric stores are gone. A lot of the embroidery is gone.'' 
 The roll of the relocated is long. Custom Accessories, a belt maker, moved to Florida in 2002. Great Buttons moved to Forest Hills, Queens, in July. TQC Cutting moved to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, last month. Art Max Fabrics, Felsen Fabrics and La Button Boutique are among the many that have closed entirely. 
 'It's All So Precarious'
 One manufacturer who has managed to survive the changes in the garment district is Paul Cavazza, 41, a spiky-haired father of three who was 9 when he started working in his parents' dress factory in Newburgh, N.Y. After studying at the Fashion Institute of Technology, Mr. Cavazza specialized in grading, which involves creating a design in multiple sizes, and marking, which is the strategic placement of a pattern on fabric. 
 His company, Create a Marker, was on West 38th Street for 11 years until a new owner bought the building last winter and notified tenants that their leases would not be renewed. 
 Some of the small sewing factories that occupied the building decided to close for good. But Mr. Cavazza scoured the neighborhood for a new location, sometimes telling landlords that he was in the graphic design business just to get a foot in the door. In what he regards as something of a miracle, Mr. Cavazza wangled a 10-year lease for a rough-hewn, 7,500-square-foot space on 35th Street near Eighth Avenue.
 It cost $150,000 just to move his massive cutting tables and machinery. But at least now, a relieved Mr. Cavazza said, ''I'm sleeping at night.''
 Mr. Cavazza is safe. But the jury is still out on Luis Alvarez, who owns IZA Trimmings, a company his family started in Cuba 74 years ago. Since 1980, the business has been on 37th Street near Eighth Avenue, selling thousands of varieties of ribbon, tassels, zippers, piping, lace, cord and applique.
 Mr. Alvarez's building, which is almost completely occupied by garment firms, was sold in June for $43 million. Since then, Mr. Alvarez and other tenants have been told that their leases will not be renewed. Mr. Alvarez has started looking for a new location, but it has been difficult. 
 ''I look at places on 38th and 39th Street and when they hear it's a trim shop, they say: 'No, no. Only bars and restaurants,''' Mr. Alvarez said. ''They're pushing the industry out.'' 
 Mr. Cavazza and Mr. Alvarez are hardly titans of the garment district; Mr. Cavazza has 27 employees, and Mr. Alvarez has only one, in addition to help from his elderly parents. But the struggles of small entrepreneurs nevertheless involve high stakes, because their industry is so fragile a web of interconnected businesses that need to be physically near one another to survive.
 ''You're not going to go to Long Island City to get a pattern, to New Jersey to get a button and to Union Square to get a lining,'' Mr. Cavazza explained. ''The fashion industry has adapted to so many things, but I don't believe that we'll be able to survive if we're taken apart and scattered.''
 In other words, if enough pattern makers, button dealers and fabric dyers have to close shop, the large enterprises that rely on them will depart, greatly speeding the district's decline. 
 Ms. Lepore, the fashion designer who works on 35th Street, runs one such enterprise. 
 She started her business in 1987 and moved to her current location in 1990. Her clothes, which are often highly intricate and richly textured, generate $65 million a year in sales to department stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's, and from her own boutiques in New York, London, Tokyo and elsewhere. 
 Except for her knitwear, which is made overseas, 95 percent of Ms. Lepore's clothing is produced within roughly four blocks of her Manhattan headquarters, she said. She spends up to $3 million a month in the garment district for services like sewing, cutting, dying, pleating, tucking, marking and grading, and for items like zippers, thread, fabric, beads and buttons.
 ''If every single factory leaves, I would really have to rethink how I run my business,'' Ms. Lepore said this fall. ''If we need a marker in two hours, we can walk it to a service on 36th Street, and they'll scramble and be able to break it down. We never ship late. That's one reason we're profitable.''
 As she circulated through her production floor watching workers drape dress forms, assemble samples and cut patterns, Ms. Lepore said: ''You have a whole industry here, and you're going to shut it down so you can have more offices and hotels? I was kind of in a bubble about it until the last couple months. Now I live in fear every day. It's all so precarious.''
 A 'City of Wall Street Guys'?
 For all the concern over the future of the garment district, there is an awareness on the part of city officials that it operates as an ecosystem, and there is optimism that it can be saved, if not in form, at least in function, in a way that satisfies both garment firms and their landlords.
 ''We're working with stakeholders on a proposal to allow for more uses on the side streets and to guarantee more production space,'' said Mr. Murphy, of the Economic Development Corporation. ''What we're trying to figure out is, how do we fix the zoning so we can preserve a critical mass of production space? No zoning change will happen without a meaningful preservation of apparel in the district.''
 One solution, suggested Ms. Randall of the business improvement district, might be to designate one or two buildings, managed by a nonprofit group or a public-private partnership, that would remain entirely devoted to garment production.
 The administration and the industry are in a race against the clock. Although there is no timetable for reaching an agreement, Mr. Murphy hopes that the city, the garment makers and the property owners will come up with a proposal within a year. 
 There is also a sense that the repercussions will extend far beyond this small slice of Midtown Manhattan, that much of the island is being buffeted by the forces at work here. 
 ''We have to ensure that there's a place for them here when they're not making as much as a hedge fund manager,'' Ms. Randall said of garment workers. ''A city full of Wall Street guys is just not an interesting place to be.''

Giving Unto Others
 To Keep Hunger Away
 To the Editor:
 After reading ''The Chicken and Rice Man'' (Nov. 25), about how Jorge Munoz feeds the immigrant day workers, I couldn't help but think of the bishop in ''Les Miserables,'' Charles-Francois-Bienvenu Myriel, and his extraordinary good will toward Jean Valjean. 
 Especially at this time of the year, it does our hearts good to know that people like the bishop, in the person of Mr. Munoz, really exist, and not just in a great novel by Victor Hugo. 
 What a Christmas we would have if more of us had the courage to be like Mr. Munoz and his family.
 Richard Palumbo 
 TriBeCa 
 To the Editor:
 ''The Chicken and Rice Man'' brought back bittersweet memories of 40 years ago on New York's Bowery. 
 In 1967, I was a wino, a derelict bum living in a flophouse on the Bowery. Every morning at 7 we bums were kicked out of the flophouses and not allowed back until 7 in the evening. The liquor stores didn't open until 8 a.m., and most of us didn't have anything left to drink from the night before. We needed to hustle up 60 cents for a pint of wine. 
 There was an old Asian man who appeared every morning in front of the flophouses, giving every bum he saw a piece of bread and a nickel. He was known simply as the ''bread and nickel man'' -- some called him ''the eucharist man'' because the bread would give your stomach something to gnaw on besides itself and the nickel would give you a start on the panhandling for the first bottle of wine of the day.
 Jorge Munoz, the ''rice and chicken man,'' is a humble man keeping hope alive under the el in Queens.

 Someday We'll Sing,
 'Take the G Train'
 To the Editor:
 Re ''For Riders of a Stepchild Line, Even an 'F' Looks Good'' (Nov. 25):
 While the G train may seem trivial today, if you track developing neighborhoods, you'll find that this line will become increasingly important over the next 10 years. 
 And while the G train does not go directly into Manhattan, it provides a connection for an enormous swath of burgeoning neighborhoods between subway lines that do make the crossing.

 To Reduce the Sewage
 In the Gowanus Canal
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Cleanup After the Cleanup'' (Nov. 18):
 The city's plan to redirect to a treatment plant about 120 million of the roughly 370 million gallons of sewer overflow dumped in the Gowanus Canal each year is a step in the right direction. 
 Nevertheless, our ultimate goal should be to prevent even one drop of untreated sewage from flowing into the canal. 
 The city could achieve that goal more quickly and economically by using permeable pavement to reduce the amount of runoff from the streets of Brooklyn.

 Just How Effective
 Is Stop and Frisk?
 To the Editor:
 In ''Profiling by the Numbers'' (Op-Chart, Nov. 18), Christopher Dunn, Donna Lieberman and Andy Pressman make an important point about racial profiling, but I was impressed by another statistic I saw in their data. 
 Of the 547,572 total black and white people stopped and frisked from Jan. 1, 2006, to Sept. 30, 2007, by the New York Police Department, 486,395 were never charged with anything. That means 89 percent of these ''stop and frisks'' were fruitless invasions of privacy.
 I wonder how many of the summonses that were issued were for minor violations, and whether they could have been effected without warrantless searches. Robert G. Lewis

HEADLINE: Putting a Price on a Wrongful Conviction

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS and JANET ROBERTS

 BODY:
WILLIAM GREGORY and David Pope were both convicted of rape. Mr. Gregory served seven years in a Kentucky prison and Mr. Pope was imprisoned by Texas for 15 years before being released because of new DNA evidence. 
 Mr. Gregory, 59, now lives at the edge of a golf course, in a five-bedroom house he bought with part of the $4.6 million he received in legal settlements. Mr. Pope, 46, received $385,000 from the State of Texas.
 To the extent that they got money, they are among the lucky ones. Of the more than 200 people released from prison since 1989 on the basis of new DNA evidence, 38 percent have received nothing for the years they spent behind bars. 
 What are those lost years worth?
 States have been wrestling with that question in recent years as the DNA revolution upended long-held notions about the reliability of evidence. And a new question has also emerged: Is money alone enough?
 With more than 140 exonerated prisoners released since 2000, 22 states and the District of Columbia now compensate them using formulas ranging from lump sums to calculations of lost wages.
 But the amounts vary widely. Wisconsin provides $5,000 a year up to a maximum of $25,000 total. California offers $100 a day. Tennessee provides up to $1 million total.
 Twenty-eight states offer nothing -- including states with multiple cases of discredited convictions -- forcing former inmates to sue in state or federal court. There they have the difficult task of proving bad faith or intentional misconduct by authorities. But when they succeed, as Mr. Gregory did, the payouts can be substantial. 
 Joshua Marquis, the district attorney in Clatsop County, Ore., has argued that many exonerated prisoners may not be innocent, but have been released because there was not enough evidence to retry them after DNA tests raised questions about their convictions. But in instances where clearly innocent people have been convicted, he said, ''they are owed a tremendous amount.''
 Some states do not have compensation laws, a result of budget constraints, other priorities, and, in some cases, suspicions that some exonerated prisoners may actually be guilty. This has left many with the courts as their only source of redress. 
 ''Once you open up those floodgates, where do you get all the money to pay for these falsely charged people?'' asked state Rep. Thomas R. Caltagirone of Pennsylvania, co-chairman of that state's House Judiciary Committee, where a compensation bill recently stalled. ''How much money is it going to require? How much is a person worth?'' 
 Nine people in Pennsylvania have been freed on the strength of DNA evidence after spending an average of 14 years in prison. But, said Representative Caltagirone, a Democrat, ''there is no political will to push it forward.''
 In Florida, where six people have been freed, lawmakers have battled for three years over a compensation plan that would exclude those with prior criminal histories.
 ''I believe the taxpayer would be horribly offended if their money were to be spent compensating an exonerated prisoner who has a history of serious crimes,'' said State Representative Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Republican. 
 Stan V. Smith, a forensic economist and expert on compensation for loss of life, said that in some respects, the wrongly convicted may actually suffer a loss greater than death.
 ''It's not just the years they lost and the mental anguish of being incarcerated wrongfully.'' Mr. Smith said. ''Your earnings are going to be impaired forever, your social interactions are going to be impaired forever. It's like being thrown into a time warp.''
 As the extent of those impairments has become clearer, exonerated prisoners and their advocates now argue that more than compensation is required. 
 ''One of the biggest challenges is that once an innocent person comes out of prison, they are not equipped with the tools to reintegrate into society, and that's something that money alone can't solve,'' said Representative Donald M. Payne, a New Jersey Democrat who introduced a bill to set aside $1.25 million a year for programs for exonerated prisoners.
 Of the states with compensation laws, only three -- Massachusetts, Louisiana and Vermont -- provide for the costs of medical and psychological care. 
 Most of the exonerated who get money waited two to three years, forcing them to rely on family, friends, lawyers and even strangers for shelter, clothing, food and emotional support immediately after their release.
 Some of those needs persist even for those who have been paid. Despite the millions he received, Mr. Gregory says he still suffers from bouts of paranoia and sometimes breaks down. Mr. Pope's $385,000 is long gone, spent on rent, clothes and a new car. Last summer, he was unemployed and living with his mother.
 In an extensive look this summer and fall at what had happened to 137 exonerated prisoners after their release, The New York Times found about half of them struggling -- drifting from job to job, dependent on others for housing or battling deep emotional scars. More than two dozen ended up back in prison or addicted to drugs or alcohol.
 ''Some people feel, 'All right, it's over now. You're out, you're free, so what are you complaining about? What's the problem?' '' said Darryl Hunt, exonerated in North Carolina after serving 18 years for murder.
 ''The problem is that we're free physically,'' he said. ''But mentally, we're still living the nightmare every day.''
 Mr. Hunt, 42, used some of the $2 million he received to start a program that has offered such services as education, counseling, job training and housing assistance to about 400 ex-convicts, including some exonerated prisoners.
 Several similar initiatives have sprouted nationwide, but all have struggled to secure funding; also, they often fail to tap into existing services. California is weighing a plan that would do just that by providing services already made available to paroled prisoners, including educational aid, vocational training and counseling, among others. 
 In New York, a bill has been drafted that would allow the wrongly convicted to receive services from agencies that already serve other needy populations, such as families on welfare.
 ''We're really still learning how to best make these people whole,'' said Stephen Saloom, policy director at the Innocence Project, which has helped to exonerate many prisoners. ''And the reason it has taken us so long is that we're really just starting to accept the imperfections of our judicial system and admit that mistakes do happen.''

HEADLINE: The Long and Short of It at Goldman Sachs

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
FOR decades now, as a writer, economist and scold, I have been receiving letters from thoughtful readers. Many of them have warned me about the dangers of a secret government running the world, organized by the Trilateral Commission, or the Ford Foundation, or the Big Oil companies or, of course, world Jewry.
 I always scoff at these letters. The world is far too complex a place to be run by any one group. But the closest I have recently seen to such a world-running body would have to be a certain large investment bank, whose alums are routinely Treasury secretaries, high advisers to presidents, and occasionally a governor or United States senator. 
 This all started percolating in my fevered brain last week when a frequent correspondent, a gent in Florida who is sure economic disaster lies ahead (and he may be right, but he's not), forwarded a newsletter from a highly placed economist at Goldman Sachs named Jan Hatzius. 
 That worthy scholar recently wrote a detailed paper about how he thought the subprime mess would get worse and worse. It would get so bad, he hypothesized, that it would affect aggregate lending extremely adversely and slow down growth.
 Dr. Hatzius, who has a Ph.D. in economics from ''Oggsford,'' as they put it in ''The Great Gatsby,'' used a combination of theory, data, guesswork, extrapolation and what he recalls as history to reach the point that when highly leveraged institutions like banks lost money on subprime, they would cut back on lending to keep their capital ratios sound -- and this would slow the economy.
 This would occur, he said, if the value of the assets that banks hold plunges so steeply that they have to consume their own capital to patch up losses. With those funds used to plug holes, banks' reserves drop further. To keep reserves in accordance with regulatory requirements, banks then have to rein in lending. What all of this means -- or so the argument goes -- is that losses in subprime and elsewhere that are taken at banks ultimately boomerang back, in a highly multiplied and negative way, onto our economy. 
 As the narrator in the rock legend ''Spill the Wine'' says, ''This really blew my mind.'' 
 So I started an e-mail correspondence with Dr. Hatzius, pointing out what I believed were a few flaws in his paper. Among them were his hypothesis that home prices would fall an average of 15 percent nationwide (an event that has never happened since the Depression, although we surely could be headed in that direction), and that this would lead to a drastic increase in defaults and losses by lenders. 
 This, as I see it, is a conclusion that is an estimation based upon a guess. I found especially puzzling the omission of the highly likely truth that the Fed would step in to replenish financial institutions' liquidity if necessary. In a crisis like that outlined by the good Dr. Hatzius, the Fed -- any postwar Fed except perhaps that of a fool -- would pump cash into the system to keep lending on track.
 I mentioned this via e-mail to Dr. Hatzius. He generously agreed that there was some slight merit to my arguments and that he was merely pointing out tendencies and possibilities (if I understand him correctly). 
 BUT forecasting is tricky, and I have a hard time believing that financial events to come will be qualitatively different from those that have already happened.
 I do want to emphasize Dr. Hatzius's gentlemanliness and intelligence. But I also want to emphasize that, as I see it, his document was mostly about selling fear. A spokesman for Goldman Sachs categorically denies this point and says that the firm's economic research is held to the highest levels of objectivity and that its economists' views are completely independent. 
 As I interpret it, Dr. Hatzius was saying that the financial system would possibly not be able to adjust to a level of financial losses that are large on an absolute scale but small compared with aggregate credit or the gross domestic product. He is also postulating that lenders would have to retrench so deeply that lending would stall and growth would falter -- an event that, again, has not happened on any scale in the postwar world, except when planned by the central bank. 
 In other words, with the greatest possible respect to Dr. Hatzius, his paper is not really what I would call a serious overview of the situation. It is more a call to be afraid and cautious based on general principles that he embraces and not on the lessons of history. (In this respect, he is much like many economic journalists and commentators who sell newsprint by selling fear. The common cause of journalists and Wall Streeters in this regard is a subject I will address in the future.) 
 Now, let me make a few small points here and then get to my own big point.
 Goldman Sachs is a huge name in terms of moneymaking and prestige. I totally understand the respect it receives for its financial dexterity. The firm is a superstar in that regard, and I, a small stockholder, am grateful. But it has never been clear to me exactly why its people are considered rocket scientists in any other area than making money. 
 Dr. Hatzius's paper is a prime example of my puzzlement. It shows extreme intelligence but basically misses the point: yes, there are possible macro dangers, but you have to go all the way around Robin Hood's barn to get to them, and you have to use what I think are extremely far-fetched hypotheticals to get to a scary situation. (This is not to diminish the real risks in today's economy, I'm just not as gloomy about them as Dr. Hatzius.)
 Why, then, is his document circulating? Perhaps as a token of Dr. Hatzius's genuine intelligence, which is fine. But to me, his paper seemed like a selling document in the real Wall Street sense of selling -- namely, selling short. (Dr. Hatzius notes that he has long been bearish on housing, since faraway 2006, but I respectfully note that that is a lot different from predicting a credit catastrophe. The spokesman for Goldman also noted the company's bearishness on housing since 2006. He also noted that in the recent past, Goldman Sachs has moved to a considerably larger short posture and that the firm is net short.)
 More thoughts came to me as I read a recent piece in Fortune by my colleague Allan Sloan, a veteran financial writer. Mr. Sloan traces the life and death throes of a Goldman Sachs-arranged collateralized mortgage obligation. He shows how truly toxic waste was sold to overly eager investors who now have major charge-offs, and he also points out that some parts of the C.M.O. were indeed safe and were either current or had been paid off.
 But what leaps out at me from this story is that Goldman Sachs was injecting dangerous financial products into the world's commercial bloodstream for years.
 My pal, colleague and alter ego, the financial manager Phil DeMuth, culled data from a financial Web site, ABAlert.com (for ''asset-backed alert''), that Goldman Sachs was one of the top 10 sellers of C.M.O.'s for the last two and a half years. From the evidence I see, Goldman was doing this for years. It might have sold very roughly $100 billion of the stuff in that period, according to ABAlert. Goldman was doing it on a scale of billions even when Henry M. Paulson Jr., the current Treasury secretary, led the firm. 
 The Goldman spokesman would not comment on this except to note that other firms sold C.M.O.'s too.
 The point to bear in mind, as Mr. Sloan brilliantly makes clear, is that as Goldman was peddling C.M.O.'s, it was also shorting the junk on a titanic scale through index sales -- showing, at least to me, how horrible a product it believed it was selling.
 The Goldman Sachs spokesman said that the company routinely shorts the securities it underwrites and said that this is disclosed. He noted candidly that Goldman is much more short in this sector than usual. 
 Here is my humble hypothesis, even after talking to Goldman: Is it possible that Dr. Hatzius's paper was a device to help along the goal of success at bearish trades in this sector and in the market generally? His firm says his paper, like all of its economists' work, was not written to support any larger short-trading strategy. But economists, like accountants, are artists. They have a tendency to paint what their patrons, who pay them, want to see. 
 From what I have observed over the years, Goldman has a fascinating culture. It is sort of like what I imagine the culture of the K.G.B. to be. You always put the firm first. The long-ago scandal of the Goldman Sachs Trading Corporation, which raised hundreds of millions just before the crash of 1929 to create a mutual fund, then used the fund's money to prop up stocks it owned and underwrote, was a particularly sad example. The fund, of course, went bust.
 Now, obviously, Goldman Sachs does many fine deals and has many smart, capable people working for it. But it's not the Vatican. It exists to make money for the partners and (much farther down the line) the stockholders. The people there are not statesmen. They are salesmen. 
 To my old eyes, the recent unhappiness about mortgages and Goldman's connection with them are not examples of sterling conduct. It is bad enough to have been selling this stuff. It is far worse when the sellers were, in effect, simultaneously shorting the stuff they were selling, or making similar bets. 
 Doesn't this bear some slight resemblance to Merrill selling tech stocks during the bubble while its analyst Henry Blodget was reportedly telling his friends what garbage they were? How different would it be from selling short the junky stock that your firm is underwriting? And if a top economist at Goldman Sachs was saying housing was in trouble, why did Goldman continue to underwrite junk mortgage issues into the market? 
 HERE is a query, as we used to say in law school: Should Henry M. Paulson Jr., who formerly ran a firm that engaged in this kind of conduct, be serving as Treasury secretary? Should there not be some inquiry into what the invisible government of Goldman (and the rest of Wall Street) did to create this disaster, which has caught up with some Wall Street firms but not the nimble Goldman?
 When the Depression got under way, the government created the Temporary National Economic Committee to study just what had happened on the Street to get the tragedy going. Maybe it's time for an investigation of just what Wall Street and Goldman did to make money as they pumped this mortgage mess into the economic system, and sometimes were seemingly on both sides of the deal.
 Or is Goldman Sachs like ''Love Story''? Does working there mean never having to say you're sorry?

Corrupt Practices Act Is Hardly Obscure
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Payload: Taking Aim at Corporate Bribery'' (Nov. 25), about international clandestine payments: 
 Nelson D. Schwartz and Lowell Bergman's piece demonstrated a complete lack of history on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. It is hardly a ''once-obscure law.'' Never has been. From the moment it passed, companies have groused to Congress each year about their inability to compete because of the ''no bribes'' stance of F.C.P.A. Congress has not only stood firm, it has expanded the F.C.P.A. coverage in response to international recognition of the importance of eliminating bribery as a barrier to economic development. Further, when the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics scandal hit, Congress amended and expanded F.C.P.A. to include NGOs as covered targets for corporate bribes.
 The Justice Department has long had an active and effective enforcement policy. And the Justice Department almost always wins. The two writers surely must have seen the fine meted out to Titan earlier this year. The F.C.P.A. has always been one powerful enforcement tool since 1977. Companies know its coverage, its rules, and so does the Justice Department. There is considerable respect between the two because of the law. Companies simply pay up when Justice comes calling. Obscure? To businesses, the F.C.P.A. is a way of life. Hello, gentlemen! Welcome to the good side of law-abiding businesses.

HEADLINE: The World as an Imperfect Globe

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
NEARLY a quarter century ago, Theodore Levitt, the Harvard business professor, heralded a global convergence of consumer tastes. The global corporation, he proclaimed, ''sells the same things in the same way everywhere.'' In 2005, Thomas L. Friedman, The New York Times columnist, sounded a similar trumpet about the effects of technology, inaugurating his world-is-flat franchise.
 But Pankaj Ghemawat amasses data to show that even now, globalization has profound, and most likely enduring, limits. 
 Mr. Ghemawat, who teaches at the Harvard Business School as well as at IESE Business School in Barcelona, traveled to India's state of Punjab in the early 1990s to examine a Pepsi-Cola plant and discovered that management felt compelled to have a stated policy of absolutely no AK-47s inside the building. World patterns of consumption and production might partly be converging, but business environments vary. 
 Borders and cultures still matter greatly. Mr. Ghemawat's ''Redefining Global Strategy'' (Harvard Business School, $29.95) aims ''to help businesses cross borders profitably by seeing the world as it really is, rather than in idealized terms.'' He does not refrain from lauding his own book as readable, relevant and rigorous.
 Mr. Ghemawat counts nearly 5,000 books on globalization from 2000-04 compared with fewer than 500 in the entire 1990s. But he says that by most yardsticks, from fixed capital investment to telephone traffic, internationalization remains at only around 10 percent of what is possible. The Internet stretches around the world, but many countries maintain filters, including China, one of the largest users of the Web, and globally most traffic is national. Mr. Ghemawat rightly calls the world that we live in ''semiglobalization.''
 Coca-Cola was first sold overseas in 1902 (in Cuba), and by 1929 it was available in 26 countries, he points out. To supply American soldiers during World War II, Coke built 63 bottling plants around the world, he says. But the company's strategy, he writes, bounced through extremes. In 1981, Coca-Cola sought to be not just global but uniform. In 2000, it shifted to the opposite approach, becoming hyperlocal in the way it produced and sold soft drinks. Mr. Ghemawat suggests that the winning approach lies between these extremes: neither one-size-fits-all standardization nor country-by-country customization.
 He skewers the empty phrases behind many corporate globalization drives: ''Internationalization is strategic.'' ''We have to internationalize or die.'' ''Eat or be eaten.'' Survivalism, he argues, is no substitute for genuine value creation. 
 To create value, businesses must embrace semiglobalization. Wal-Mart Stores, he observes, did best in countries similar or close to the United States, like Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom, and ended up having to leave Germany and South Korea. Mr. Ghemawat suggests that companies consider focusing on countries with a common language, common borders and former colonial relationships.
 Even that may not work for long, however. Spain enjoyed success in Latin America, leveraging a common language and intertwined history, notes Mr. Ghemawat. He could have added that Spanish direct investment in Latin America declined to 1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion) in 2006 from a peak of 27 billion euros in 1999, according to The Financial Times.
 Going global can entail increased costs, he shows. Top-loading washers, front-loading ones, refrigerators with more space for meat, or more for vegetables, giants ovens, space-saving ovens: every major appliance market has its dominant preferences, vexing transnational manufacturers. Unilever, meanwhile, must produce more than 100 variants of its global Lux brand of soaps.
 The book's most intriguing tale involves cement. Spurred by competitors' investments on its home turf, Cemex, which is based in Mexico, moved outward to become one of the largest companies globally in its industry. Cemex's profitability comes not from lower costs but higher prices, Mr. Ghemawat writes. It buys capacity in countries where it can reduce the number of competitors by also acquiring controlling stakes in marine terminals. 
 More broadly, cement is heavy and easily damaged in transport (by water), the author notes, yet it ''has experienced one of the greatest absolute increases in global concentration of any of the major industries for which I have compiled data.'' By contrast, International Paint, with operations in 54 countries, ''underperformed internationally for a long time because -- unlike Cemex -- it focused on global scale in a business in which key scale economies operated at the national level.'' Nuanced examples accrue, pointing up the salience of specific circumstances for determining the best approaches to global opportunities and constraints. 
 Mr. Ghemawat packages his welcome portrait of complexity in formulas -- CAGE (Cultural, Administrative, Geographic, Economic distance framework); ADDING (Adding volume, Decreasing costs, Differentiating, Improving industry attractiveness, Normalizing risks, Generating and deploying knowledge). This is a business school book, after all.
 The larger lessons he distills into banalities. ''Recognize that superior performance is often short-lived.'' ''Think through how your environment is likely to evolve.'' ''Anticipate how other players in your value system are likely to behave.'' ''You can and should use judgment to evaluate the results of the analysis.'' And inevitably, ''read the rest of this book.'' 
 Still, the combination of case studies and stentorian common sense culminates in a nicely revised picture of globalization as regionalization.
 Very few companies are globally global, Mr. Ghemawat observes. Even Toyota became No. 1 in autos by linking operations within the Americas, within Europe and within Asia, rather than across them. Definitions of region can vary -- not just continents but trans-Atlantic, Greater China, trans-Indian Ocean, Eurasia -- and Mr. Ghemawat examines a variety of regional hub strategies. But the latter, too, is no strategic panacea: regional platforms can grow into regional fiefdoms. 
 ''Nobody has figured out the optimal way to organize a complex global economy,'' he concludes. That is because no single optimal strategy exists. Companies are left to pursue what Mr. Ghemawat labels A.A.A: ''adaptation, aggregation, and arbitrage'' -- or, in straightforward English, multiple variants of individual tailoring.

HEADLINE: Jobs Picture May Not Be So Grim

BYLINE: By CONRAD de AENLLE

 BODY:
CONSUMER spending seems to be flattening out and home building appears to be in free fall, but most companies have shown little inclination to cut back on hiring. That picture may become clearer this week when employment conditions are announced for November. 
 A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates a net job creation of 75,000 for November, a steep decline from 166,000 in October. The unemployment rate is expected to creep up to 4.8 percent, from 4.7 percent.
 Such figures might increase fears that a recession is approaching, but one economist expects cheerier news. Bill Cheney, chief economist of John Hancock Financial Services, believes that the consensus is substantially underestimating job creation.
 ''I don't expect as much job growth as in October, but I don't think 100,000 would be a surprise,'' he said.
 Mr. Cheney contends that pessimism about the economy, including a deepening sense of foreboding about consumer spending, is overdone. The drop expected in new jobs may be the result of low estimates for the retail sector, he said.
 The Labor Department employment report, to be issued Friday, incorporates adjustments for seasonal factors. Retailers have cut their work forces in recent months, Mr. Cheney said, so a continuation of the trend at a time of year when hiring is typically strong would have a doubly depressing effect on reported job creation. That is not what he foresees, however.
 ''It is equally likely that retailers will be desperate and will hire the same number as usual,'' he said.
 If the job number comes in close to his 100,000 prediction, it could raise share prices, Mr. Cheney said.
 ''If we were to get a big drop in retail employment that fed into an even lower headline number, the bond market would be happy and the stock market would take it badly.
 ''I think it will be the other way around,'' he said. ''The report will err on the strong side for once.''
 In Mr. Cheney's view, investors are ignoring positive economic factors, like exports. The weak dollar has made American goods much more competitive overseas.Instead, investors are focusing on negatives like consumer spending and the housing market. But he argues that the housing market is not as terrible as is widely believed.
 ''This really is a point of great uncertainty in the economic cycle,'' Mr. Cheney acknowledged, ''but I think the consensus is too gloomy.''
 DATA WATCH An Institute for Supply Management monthly survey to be released on Wednesday is expected to show strength in nonmanufacturing segments of the economy ebbing in November. A reading of 55 is forecast in the Bloomberg poll, down from 55.8.

HEADLINE: The Dollar Is Falling, And That's Good News

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
ANXIETY about the dollar continues to spread. The falling greenback is often seen as a sign of an impending recession or the fall of the United States from global leadership. A low dollar simply looks bad. We are, after all, used to judging ourselves against others -- comparing our salaries with the earnings of our peers, and our homes with those of our neighbors. We're used to thinking it is a big advantage to stand at the top of a numerical list.
 But when it comes to currencies, a higher value neither brings national success nor predicts future prosperity. The measure of a nation's wealth is the goods and services it produces, not the relative standing of its currency. Take a look at 1985-88, when the dollar lost more ground than in the last few years. Those were good times, and the next decade was largely prosperous as well. 
 Today's lower value for the dollar reflects the success of other regions. Europe has shown it can make the European Union and its unified currency work, and thus the euro has become stronger. The Canadian union appears increasingly stable, and that means a higher value for the Canadian dollar. Over all, these geopolitical developments are good for America even if the dollar becomes weaker in relative terms.
 Many observers have an exaggerated sensitivity to the dollar's fall because they spend more time in relatively expensive countries. A shopping trip to London will give an American tourist the feeling that all prices have doubled or even worse. A weekend vacation or conference in nearby Toronto or Montreal may no longer feel like a bargain.
 But from a broader perspective, the value of the dollar hasn't fallen quite as much as it might seem. Since President Bush started his second term in January 2001, to Nov. 20 of this year, the dollar has dropped 19.8 percent -- if we weight the dollar by how much America trades with individual countries. That is a noticeable decline, but it is hardly a radical economic event. There are still many bargains, travel and otherwise, in Asia and Latin America for people paying in dollars. 
 A falling dollar does mean price inflation in the United States. Just as it costs more for an American to buy a fancy meal in Paris, so do French wines and German cars have a higher markup when they are sold in New York. But imports are only 16 percent of the American economy, and most foreign suppliers have been reluctant to risk their position in the American market by raising prices a great deal. Furthermore many price increases from Europe come on luxury goods and thus they fall on wealthy American buyers, who can afford it most easily. Wal-Mart serves a more working-class clientele and it is stocked with goods from Asia, where currency values have remained weaker against the dollar.
 Of course the lower value of the dollar also makes American exports more competitive. Much of Middle America is booming because of its ability to sell tractors, food stuffs and other products abroad at favorable prices. Even after a serious real estate decline, the American economy is continuing to expand, and this is largely because of the strength of our export sector, as encouraged by a low value for the dollar. 
 Another worry is that a falling dollar puts the United States at the mercy of China. Dr. Brad Setser, a currency analyst at RGE Monitor, estimates that the Chinese hold about $1.2 trillion in dollar-denominated assets. China is likely to slowly diversify into other currencies, but Chinese leaders have no interest in encouraging a run on the dollar or a fire sale of dollar-denominated assets. China is in a more vulnerable position than the United States, if only because China is a poorer country and has underdeveloped capital markets.
 Still, it would be naive to argue that a weak or falling dollar can never hurt the United States. Extreme volatility can increase general anxiety and discourage economic commitments. If the dollar went into a true free fall, it would damage the reputation of the United States as a desirable place for foreigners to invest. That would hurt; but on the other hand a low dollar would mean bargains for foreigners, thereby attracting investment and limiting the potential negative fallout from a dollar collapse.
 SO far the Federal Reserve and the Bush administration have shown little concern over the falling dollar. This isn't because of neglect or lack of interest; trillions of dollars worth of currency are traded every day, so policy makers have only a limited ability to push around long-term exchange rates, even if they wanted to do so.
 When it comes to market prices, people can always find reason to be unhappy. In the eurozone, for example, it is a common complaint that the euro is too strong and therefore it is too difficult for Europeans to export goods and services. 
 In the case of the dollar, we need to stop thinking of its value as a marker of economic success. The American economy has its problems, but so far the low value of the dollar has proved more a benefit than a cost.

HEADLINE: Learning How Local Local Food Can Be

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA MAGRIEL WETZLER

DATELINE: Bedford Hills 

 BODY:
 ON a recent October evening at Rainbeau Ridge Farm here, Ann Vilesis, the author of ''Kitchen Literacy'' (Island Press, 2007) was speaking about food. ''It's absurd we know so little about what we eat, and think it's normal,'' she said. ''We look the other way when we think about our foods. We need to smell the food and look the fish in the eye to see if it's fresh. We need to be aware that our food comes from the land.''
 Ms. Vilesis was addressing a group of about 40 aspiring locavores. A few of us there were also participants in a monthlong challenge, sponsored by Rainbeau Ridge, to find and use locally grown farm products within a 100-mile radius of Bedford, instead of thoughtlessly grabbing garlic from China or fruit juices from South Africa off supermarket shelves. 
 ''Think of the excessive amount of fuel it takes to bring global food to our tables,'' said Lisa Schwartz, a cheesemaker and the owner of Rainbeau Ridge Farm. Ms. Schwartz had come up with the idea of a local-eating challenge and had given us a resource list of farmers' markets, farms and retail sources to guide us through the month. 
 The project, we were told, was not about becoming a purist, which is virtually impossible (local chocolate? coffee? spices?), but about developing a larger awareness of where and how our food is grown. Does an apple grower spray his trees with chemical pesticides? How far has a strawberry traveled? When was the lettuce harvested? 
 The farmers' markets inspired me to slow my shopping habits, mosey from stall to stall and try new things: 18-inch-long beans; brussels sprouts on a three-foot stalk shouting freshness, complete with leaves on top and dirt clinging to the roots; knobby celeriac with an on-the-spot soup recipe and some food philosophy from the farmer. The satisfaction of knowing so much about your fresh produce is many layered.
 ''It's hard for Americans to swallow, but if I find a grub in my cauliflower, I'm happy,'' said Nina White, a cheesemaker and baker from Bobolink Dairy in Vernon, N.J. ''It means it's not been sprayed and I just soak it.''
 Linda Krensky, a challenge participant, said her 7-year-old daughter, Tess, loved to eat anything raw from a farmers' market, even bok choy. ''I cut off the top of a purple pepper,'' she said, ''and take out the seeds and she fills it with water saying, 'Oh, there is nothing better than pepper water right from the farm.' ''
 Except, maybe, fresh eggs. Pat Imbimbo, a dairy farmer at New England Farms in Granville, N.Y., takes his organically raised chickens, chicken eggs and quail eggs to farmers' markets, including the Katonah-Lewisboro market, and early customers may find eggs collected before the rooster crowed that morning. (Mr. Imbimbo's wife, Susan, confessed she blows kisses to the chickens at night. ''That's why they're so sweet.'')
 Searching beyond the markets for local food sources, I met Jack Algiere, a four-season-grower at Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture in Pocantico Hills, a nonprofit farm and education center devoted to raising awareness about community-based food production through classes and lectures. 
 ''I believe we need to support the dignity and integrity of our farmers, help them to be economically sustainable, and protect the open farmland against more McDonald's,'' Mr. Algiere said.
 Pointing out the rows of dark, rich soil showing off bright green lettuces, spinach and feathery fennel in his half-acre greenhouse, Mr. Algiere spoke of spending as much time ''raising'' soil with compost and a few minerals than on the crops. ''It's the soil that builds a strong immune system in the plant,'' he said. ''We want people to ask questions about what we are doing.''
 After a month of searching out local food I can't help doing just that, even pestering the produce manager in my supermarket about food sources. One doesn't turn back after reading Barbara Kingsolver's ''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle'' (HarperCollins, 2007) and learning about disease-prone, jam-packed pens where cattle and poultry, filled with growth hormones and antibiotics, stand in their own excrement. But after driving to a poultry farm 25 miles upstate to buy a chicken that was running around that morning, my husband had a point: ''We don't want the chickens to travel,'' he said, ''but we're traveling instead, using up fuel.'' (He was more enthusiastic about the delicious bright green string beans cooked with local shallots.) 
 On Nov. 4, the last day of the challenge, the other participants and I shared experiences over a potluck dinner at Rainbeau Ridge (all local food, of course). The next day I spoke with Ms. Schwartz about the effects of the project.
 ''The challenge itself was hugely important, no matter how pure we ended up being,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''I learned how difficult it can be to source local, how much we need to be our own food advocates. A farmer may say, 'We use integrated pest management.' We need to decode this. Does that mean, 'Oh, it's Tuesday, let's go spray' or 'It's Tuesday, let's check the crops'? If by Thursday he needs to spray, we need to know if he's using chemical pesticides or those from a natural source.''
 Is it all about chemicals, or fuel consumption or local economies? ''We each have to decide where our concerns are strongest,'' Ms. Schwartz said. ''By taking incremental steps in directions that are important to us, buying local becomes more of a habit.''

HEADLINE: Lots of Little Screens: TV Is Changing Shape

BYLINE: By DENISE CARUSO. 
Denise Caruso is executive director of the Hybrid Vigor Institute, which studies collaborative problem-solving. E-mail: dcaruso@nytimes.com

 BODY:
INEXPENSIVE broadband access has done far more for online video than enable the success of services like YouTube and iTunes. By unchaining video watchers from their TV sets, it has opened the floodgates to a generation of TV producers for whom the Internet is their native medium. 
 And as they shift their focus away from TV to grab us on one of the many other screens in our lives -- our computers, cellphones and iPods -- the command-and-control economic model of traditional television is being quickly superseded by the market chaos of a freewheeling and open digital network. 
 According to Move Networks, a company based in Utah that provides online video technologies, more than 100,000 new viewers jump online every 24 hours to watch its clients' long-form or episodic video. During the first two weeks of November alone, more than twice the number of Americans were watching TV online than in the entire month of August. 
 The shift is proving quite inspirational to digital media entrepreneurs. 
 ''What absolutely convinced me to start a company in this area was when I realized just how large the disruption was,'' said Kip McClanahan, the co-founder and chief executive of ON Networks, an online studio in Austin, Tex. ''It touches everything -- how video content is created and monetized, how it's distributed and consumed. And it's a half-trillion-dollar market, if you include the advertising that supports it and the revenue associated with subscriptions, tickets and so on.'' 
 A market that size provides plenty of room for experimentation. Many flavors of technology and programming are being tested, as are some changes in traditional revenue models. 
 Vuze, based in Palo Alto, and Joost, based in Leiden in the Netherlands, for example, have both developed proprietary software that must be downloaded to view their video programming. In addition to providing programming from established brands like PBS, Showtime, the BBC and A&E, the start-ups encourage new producers to make deals with them and upload new programs to their sites.
 ON does not distribute any traditional TV shows. Instead, it works with professional content creators who develop original programs in HDTV. So far, it has produced hundreds of episodes for 25 programs, all of which are available at the ON Web site, as well as through iTunes and AT&T, its distribution partners. They include a dating show, produced in partnership with NBC, and a home-building show called ''Mainstream Green.''
 Blip Networks, based in New York, is another company working to create its own established brands, providing thousands of short-form videos from all comers. In addition to one-off documentaries like ''Gotham Girls Roller Derby,'' Blip's library includes weekly news satires like ''Goodnight Burbank,'' which drew favorable notice from several mainstream media outlets, including USA Today and The Los Angeles Times.
 Blip syndicates its programming to America Online, Yahoo, Google, iTunes, Facebook and other big Web distributors. Vuze, Joost, Blip and ON all share as much as 50 percent of their revenue with the content producers, regardless of distribution medium. ''If that model existed today, writers wouldn't be on strike,'' said Mr. McClanahan. 
 Rene Pinnell, the director of ''Backpack Picnic,'' a popular sketch comedy show that came to ON after the troupe produced two pilots that were never shown by MTV, said the online environment is a ''really good deal'' for many reasons. 
 ''The biggest one is that it allows us a tremendous amount of creative freedom we wouldn't get in a more traditional media environment,'' he said. ''The investment is low for them -- nowhere near the $500,000 a network will spend on one episode. They can afford to trust us.'' 
 For its part, Hulu of Los Angeles has turned a traditional TV library into a promotional vehicle for, well, more TV. The joint venture between NBC Universal and the News Corporation offers scores of popular prime-time shows from all the major networks and channels, as well as past hits like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer.'' 
 ''Because people can watch TV shows when and where they want, they can sample a lot more shows,'' said Jason Kilar, chief executive of Hulu. 
 As a means to that end, Hulu may have persuaded the industry to relax a bit. Hulu's player allows viewers to create short video clips from the shows they watch and put them in e-mail messages or on Web sites, including blogs, an activity that in the past has drawn nasty letters from copyright lawyers. ''This is a key way that we can make sure the content finds the audience,'' said Mr. Kilar. 
 But what happens to the television industry when the traditional way for content to find its audience becomes obsolete?
 ''There's a lot of rewriting of the concept of windows in the TV network world today -- the timing of when and where shows appear,'' said Allen Weiner, the managing vice president for media and consumer technologies for the Gartner Group in Scottsdale, Ariz. 
 In the old days, after something appeared on TV, its release to other distribution channels was carefully staged -- from the timing of reruns to the DVD release to when it would be available on-demand. ''We're seeing all kinds of new windows occurring, and no one knows what the magic formula will be,'' he said. ''A lot depends on advertiser reaction and on user behavior.''
 One closely watched approach is the new online series ''Quarterlife,'' by Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick, who produced ''My So-Called Life.'' Episodes first appear on MySpace TV, then are available the next day on Quarterlife.com, and a week later on YouTube, Facebook and Imeem. There is talk that they may even appear later on network TV -- but as the last window, rather than the first.
 As far as ON is concerned, Mr. McClanahan intends to put his programs in every single window he can find. Unlike other companies, ON optimizes all its shows for viewing on any video-capable device, a feature he calls ''lifestyle distribution.'' 
 That's why he has deals with partners like iTunes and AT&T's Television, Broadband and Wireless Services, both of which can deliver video programs to multiple devices, from plasma TVs to computer screens and cellphones. 
 ''You can't expect to control consumers and force them to come to prime time at 7 p.m. on a Monday night,'' said Mr. McClanahan. ''If the consumer wants it on their phone at 3 p.m. while they're on the golf course, then that's where we have to deliver it.''

 CORRECTION:
The Re:framing column last Sunday, about growth in online video programming, included an outdated reference to the status of the new online series ''Quarterlife.'' The series has been picked up by NBC; it has not merely been discussed as a possibility for network television.

HEADLINE: Injected With Inspiration

BYLINE: By RICHARD S. CHANG

 BODY:
JAN HYDE remembers Pittsburgh the way it was when he grew up there in the 1950s and '60s, at the height of the city's economic boom and the peak of its population and pride. 
 ''Pittsburgh was one of these heavy-duty industrial cities in its day,'' he said. ''First you had U.S. Steel. You had Gulf Oil, you had Alcoa, you had Rockwell. They had 13 Fortune 500 companies.''
 Mr. Hyde, who is 67, also recalls a vice president at Gulf Oil, Grady Davis, who may be best known for his resolve to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans. (Steve McQueen drove a Gulf Oil Porsche 917 in the 1971 movie ''Le Mans.'') Closer to home, Mr. Grady supported an amateur Corvette race team from a local Chevrolet dealership. Its drivers, Don Yenko and Dr. Dick Thompson, were pioneer club racers and an inspiration to hot-rodders past and present. 
 They were also idols to a young man who had grown up nearby. 
 ''I was a kid and I didn't know much,'' Mr. Hyde, who was starting studies at M.I.T., said. ''But it was the neatest thing, and it got me into Corvette racing.'' 
 When Mr. Hyde graduated from college in 1962, his father helped him buy a 1959 Corvette. About a year later, he walked out of his apartment in San Francisco where he was working on the construction of the Bay Area Rapid Transit system to discover it had been stolen. 
 He drove a rental car for the next few weeks, ''looking for a Fuelie, and I wanted to get a 1960,'' he said. ''It took me maybe a month or two, and I found this one in February of 1964.''
 Fuelie was the nickname given to Corvettes with the top-of-the-line fuel-injected engine, an option from 1957-65. 
 ''It was the hot setup,'' Mr. Hyde said, but compared with the computer-controlled fuel injection systems of today's cars, Fuelies were notoriously finicky. Mr. Hyde described a Rube Goldberg contraption that depended on diaphragms, flappers and vacuum lines. ''It's a beautifully engineered system that I think was more maybe like a solution looking for a problem.''
 Today, few mechanics understand the intricacies of early fuel-injected Corvettes, ''so you have to have the confidence to take one of these things apart, rebuild it and put it back on the car,'' he said.
 Mr. Hyde drove the silver-and-white Fuelie from San Francisco to Cambridge, Mass., in 1965 to attend Harvard Business School. He met the woman who would become his wife, and he took her on their first date in the Fuelie. ''There were some issues with the seats at the time, so I had them removed to be fixed,'' he said. ''Phyllis sat on the floor.''
 He and Phyllis moved to New York and settled in Brooklyn Heights. Mr. Hyde established himself as a real estate and investment banking consultant, while she raised their son and daughter. (Now their roles are flipped: he is at home, and she has a medical practice.) 
 In his free time back then Mr. Hyde read enough books on motor sports to fill the shelves of a room in their attic. He also enrolled in racing school, and in 1966 bought a Corvette racecar with the goal of competing on the track, as his idols had done. 
 ''This was calamitous,'' he said, prefacing a story that makes you look twice at his twig frame for scars and lingering kinks. 
 In 1975, Mr. Hyde entered the Duryea Hillclimb in Reading, Pa., driving a borrowed '64 Sting Ray. ''Not a Fuelie,'' he said. 
 Everything was going fine as he crossed the finish line at 130 m.p.h. But he was unaware that the rear wheels were off the ground; when he tapped the brakes, they locked up. The car twisted sideways, skidded off the road and hit an abutment. 
 Witnesses told him that he must have been going around 90 m.p.h. at the point of impact. ''My bones were just sticking out of my leg,'' Mr. Hyde said.
 ''There wasn't a straight piece of plastic or metal left in the car,'' he said. ''That's when I thought maybe I'm better as a spectator.'' 
 Now that his status has changed -- semiretired, in his words -- Mr. Hyde has more time on his hands, time that is spent keeping his car in great shape, though he reminds you it is not a show car. 
 He has time, too, to keep the heritage of Corvette racing alive. He has produced a DVD on the subject, and last year he and two fellow semiretired Corvette fanatics began trying to record every Corvette that ever raced in an official series -- around 2,500 of them -- to create an online registry.
 Mr. Hyde said that no reliable source of information and expertise on the subject of Corvette racing existed. He said he hoped that registryofcorvetteracecars.com would fill that void and eventually become self-sustaining. For now, it is the beneficiary of Mr. Hyde's energy and enthusiasm for the car that captured his heart all those years ago. 
 ''It's my full-time occupation now,'' he said. ''I'm enjoying the hell out of it.''

HEADLINE: Nonstop Theft And Bribery Stagger Iraq

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Reporting was contributed by Anwar J. Ali, Diana Oliva Cave, Hosham Hussein, Qais Mizher and Abeer Mohammad.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
 Jobless men pay $500 bribes to join the police. Families build houses illegally on government land, carwashes steal water from public pipes, and nearly everything the government buys or sells can now be found on the black market. 
 Painkillers for cancer (from the Ministry of Health) cost $80 for a few capsules; electricity meters (from the Ministry of Electricity) go for $200 each, and even third-grade textbooks (stolen from the Ministry of Education) must be bought at bookstores for three times what schools once charged. 
 ''Everyone is stealing from the state,'' said Adel Adel al-Subihawi, a prominent Shiite tribal leader in Sadr City, throwing up his hands in disgust. ''It's a very large meal, and everyone wants to eat.''
 Corruption and theft are not new to Iraq, and government officials have promised to address the problem. But as Iraqis and American officials assess the effects of this year's American troop increase, there is a growing sense that, even as security has improved, Iraq has slipped to new depths of lawlessness. 
 One recent independent analysis ranked Iraq the third most corrupt country in the world. Of 180 countries surveyed, only Somalia and Myanmar were worse, according to Transparency International, a Berlin-based group that publishes the index annually. 
 And the extent of the theft is staggering. Some American officials estimate that as much as a third of what they spend on Iraqi contracts and grants ends up unaccounted for or stolen, with a portion going to Shiite or Sunni militias. In addition, Iraq's top anticorruption official estimated this fall -- before resigning and fleeing the country after 31 of his agency's employees were killed over a three-year period -- that $18 billion in Iraqi government money had been lost to various stealing schemes since 2004. 
 The collective filching undermines Iraq's ability to provide essential services, a key to sustaining recent security gains, according to American military commanders. It also sows a corrosive distrust of democracy and hinders reconciliation as entrenched groups in the Shiite-led government resist reforms that would cut into reliable cash flows. 
 In interviews across Baghdad, though, Iraqis said the widespread thieving affected them at least as powerfully on an emotional and moral level. The Koran is very clear on stealing: ''God does not love the corrupters,'' one verse says. And for average Iraqis, those ashamed of the looting that took place immediately after the fall of Saddam Hussein, the current era of anything-goes is particularly crushing because almost no one can avoid its taint. 
 For many, it is not a question of getting rich. Theft and corruption have become survival tools, creating a spiral of dishonest transactions that leave nearly everyone feeling dirty. 
 Abu Ali is a 23-year-old Sunni with a soft middle and a common tale. Identifying himself by only a nickname, which means father of Ali, he said that he, his wife, his elderly mother and six relatives fled their home in eastern Baghdad last year after receiving death threats from Shiite militias. First they rushed to Diyala Province, and when that turned violent, they moved back to a safer area of Baghdad -- broke and desperate. 
 A major breadwinner for his family, Abu Ali needed a job. And like many Iraqis, he saw only one employer hiring: the government. A neighbor who was a police officer suggested joining the force. Abu Ali asked how, noting that recruits outnumbered positions. The answer was simple: a $500 bribe. 
 Abu Ali borrowed the money a few months ago and found his way to a cellphone shop downtown, where, he said, a man in his late 20s welcomed him inside. The man identified himself as a police captain and seemed at ease with the transaction. His wealth sparkled all around. 
 ''He had a silver Mercedes,'' Abu Ali said. ''He was wearing a thick gold chain and a gold watch.''
 Abu Ali tried to bargain for a lower fee, but failed, handing over the cash and filling out official forms. In return, he said, he received a blue card stamped ''Ministry of the Interior,'' which declared him an accepted member of the police force. The man with the gold chain told him to watch for an announcement in the local paper that listed the names of newly accepted recruits, and to bring the card to his first day of training. 
 ''How do I know I'll really get the job?'' Abu Ali said he asked. ''He told me, 'I've put in 70 or 80 people already. Don't worry about it.'''
 Five months later, Abu Ali's name appeared in the newspaper. At the police academy in September, he said, he discovered that most of his class was from Sadr City and that everyone paid $400 to $800 to join. 
 ''There's not a single person among the 850 people in my class who joined for free,'' he said. 
 His commanders, he added, also now collect the salaries of recruits who quit, a payout of more than $100,000 a month. ''No one can stop it,'' Abu Ali said. ''Corruption runs from top to bottom.''
 The details of Abu Ali's story could not be independently verified, but they fit a pattern of bribes and payroll schemes found in nearly every nook of Iraq's government, according to government workers, Iraqi lawmakers and some American officials. 
 Many Iraqis speak from personal experience. 
 Mr. Subihawi, the Shiite tribal leader in Sadr City, said that when he recently tried to find a job for a young member of his tribe, he was told by local government officials that there was nothing available unless he was willing to pay. 
 Other Iraqis, in interviews, described similar encounters. 
 Cash is also often what leads to promotions -- with the help of a fake college degree, purchased for about $40 -- and theft is no less common. One government worker, who goes by the name Abu Muhammad, said a senior administrator at the ministry where he worked recently sold off computers, laser printers, office furniture and other supplies that appeared to have been paid for with American aid. The official was never caught or prosecuted, he said.
 Haider Abu Laith, an engineer at the Ministry of Culture, said a close friend and fellow engineer at a government agricultural agency recently told him he was being pressured to inflate the cost of equipment purchased abroad so that senior officials could skim the surplus. 
 He said his friend quit, fearing that he would be killed if he refused. 
 And at the Ministry of Health's main warehouse in Baghdad, American troops discovered this summer that two trucks full of medicines and medical equipment had disappeared while several guards on duty -- young men in acid-washed jeans, with gel in their hair -- said they saw nothing. 
 Even some Iraqi lawmakers admit that the free-for-all has become too extensive to stop easily. ''The size of the corruption exceeds the imagination,'' said Shatha Munthir Abdul Razzaq, a member of Parliament's largest Sunni bloc. ''Because there are no tough laws, no penalties for those who steal.''
 Stuart W. Bowen Jr., who runs the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, said Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki actually undercut anticorruption efforts this year by requiring that investigators get permission from his office before pursuing ministers or former ministers on corruption charges. 
 Mr. Maliki has also not rescinded a law, opposed by the Americans, that lets ministers exempt their employees from investigation. ''Those two legal positions within the fledgling Iraqi government are incompatible with democracy,'' Mr. Bowen said in an interview. ''My concerns about the corruption problem have risen.''
 Ali al-Dabbagh, the prime minister's spokesman, has said the government is determined to fight corruption. And at some gas stations, especially where American troops have concentrated their efforts, Iraqis report fewer demands for the bribes that once tripled or quadrupled the price of gas.
 But for a large number of people, survival still depends on taking what they can, when they can. Some estimates put unemployment at 40 percent. For many Iraqis, minor theft seems justified because others take so much and because daily life in Iraq still feels precarious -- a crust of calm resting on currents of sectarianism, poverty and anger. 
 Baghdad, in particular, is still marked by desperation, with more women begging at intersections and with many Iraqis barely getting by, even with a little cheating. 
 These are people like Sattar Alwan, 41, a taxi driver with a dark mustache who lives with nearly a dozen relatives in a makeshift, illegal house on government land in eastern Baghdad. He said his family built the squat brick structure because gunmen pushed them out of their own home and they had nowhere else to go.
 Or Abbas Wadi Kadhim, 42, who uses a raspy air compressor to extract city water from broken pipes so he can earn money washing cars. 
 Mr. Kadhim acknowledges that he does not pay for the water, nor does he pay rent at the abandoned government building a few hundred yards away, where he often sleeps so he can be ready when customers arrive at 7 a.m. 
 He figures his government owes him. He was imprisoned by Mr. Hussein's government and disabled in the Iran-Iraq war. His left forearm is as thin as a child's, and crooked at the wrist. 
 ''I have six kids,'' he said, spraying down a silver sedan last week, ''and all I get is 150,000 Iraqi dinar,'' about $120 a month in disability payments. ''It's not enough.''
 Mr. Kadhim said he was from Sadr City, a sprawling public housing project dominated by the Mahdi Army, Iraq's most prominent Shiite militia. He suggested that he could make more money if he were less religious. 
 ''The forbidden work is far away from us, as far away as the seven seas,'' he said, looking east toward his old neighborhood. 
 He sounded proud. He spends long hours scrubbing cars for $4 each in an empty lot with a clear view of Baghdad's main soccer stadium. His customers praise him for being thorough. But like many Iraqis who have made a choice to bend the rules, he seems still unsure of his moral footing: a little bit ashamed, a touch defensive. 
 ''This job is better for us than doing things that are forbidden,'' he said, his voice getting louder. ''It's better than stealing or using people.''''The more honest the job is and the harder we work, the better.''

Four-Wheeler Free-for-All
 The ocean beaches are a mess this time of the year, with deep ruts left by four-wheelers.
 Sometimes it is worth reminding ourselves that it is no longer the 1950s or '60s, when only a relative handful of people lived here, November was deathly quiet, and fewer than one in 50 people owned a four-wheel-drive vehicle. 
 Fewer people would take issue with four-wheelers if drivers, as they used to do, followed a single track or two up and down the beach. Now it seems that beach drivers go out of their way to blaze their own trails.
 It is simply not fair for one group to make it difficult for others to enjoy a walk on the sand. If the situation gets worse, it is likely to lead to additional government restrictions, something few of us really want.
 In lieu of more regulation, drivers need to be more conscientious about others who use the beach. Making an effort to drive single-file would be a start.

 School Taxes Aren't Too High
 The New York State Comptroller's office claims that school taxes in the state have outpaced inflation twofold. The reporting omitted important information that negates the myth of excessive school taxation. 
 Any comparison of increases in school taxes to the general rate of inflation is invalid. A better frame of reference would be those increases experienced by other governmental units, including the State of New York itself. 
 For example, the average increase in school taxes in 2007, as reported by the comptroller, was 5.9 percent, compared to a 9.4 percent increase in total taxes collected by New York State during the same period. When compared to the state, expense and tax increases in the Levittown School District are exceptionally responsible and efficient. 
 State and county politicians claim that 60 percent of our taxes go to school districts. When challenged, they concede that this figure includes only property taxes, not income and sales taxes, paid to the state. All considered, school taxes account for about 40 percent of all local and state taxes paid by the average New York citizen. 
 This omission of information is disingenuous at best. The myth of school taxation is, in fact, just that, a myth.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Compete, Except In Bonuses

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
DealBook also has a newsletter and a Web site, nytimes.com/dealbook, that is updated continuously when markets are open.

 BODY:
BONUSES on Wall Street are going to be bad this year, except if you work at Goldman Sachs. Or, oddly enough, if you're an associate at a white-shoe law firm. (Granted, the scale of banking bonuses is in a rarefied class of its very own, even when compared with law firms, but bear with me).
 Cravath, Swaine & Moore announced last month that it was doling out special bonuses to associate lawyers of $10,000 to $50,000. The special bonus is in addition to the regular bonuses of $35,000 to $60,000, depending on seniority. When you add it all up, second-year associates will pocket $225,000 this year, more than John G. Roberts Jr., chief justice of the United States. (He makes $212,000.) 
 Just days later, Debevoise & Plimpton announced it would match the new bonuses virtually dollar for dollar, as if it had simply copied and pasted the numbers directly from Cravath's memo. Almost in unison, most other top law firms followed suit.
 Lawyers are smart, but this herd mentality seems absolutely irrational, economically speaking -- and not because the compensation is too high. The top law firms have been stuck in copycat mode for years. As soon as one of them raises salaries for associates, the others fall in line almost immediately.
 At first glance, it makes sense in a free-market kind of way that law firms rush to match one another's compensation packages. They have to compete for talent, especially for the annual crop of law school graduates. Indeed, if they never raised salaries or bonuses, they would probably be accused of conspiring to keep costs down.
 But think about this for a moment: Is there any other business in which every competitor matches salaries and bonuses almost identically? It will probably take you far longer than a moment to come up with one, with the possible exception of highly unionized industries. Lawyers' closest business cousins, investment banks, typically pay their people based on merit and the health of their own businesses, while still being competitive in a down year (like Merrill Lynch.) 
 Law firms say they pay bonuses to stay competitive, which is true, but only to a point. It's not as if an entire class of associates at Debevoise would walk out the door to Cravath just because it raised bonuses. For one thing, there are not enough job openings. And as terrific as Debevoise associates may all be, Cravath would never want to hire all of them. Perhaps it would try to pick off a couple of top associates, but then Debevoise could just match the money dollar for dollar. The same goes for the dozen other firms that matched bonuses.
 The root of the problem may lie in the top law firms' oddly egalitarian tradition of paying the same amount to associates at the same level. Many refer to it internally as ''lockstep.'' At some firms, that applies to partners, too, though that is becoming increasingly rare. And to be fair, some firms, though not necessarily the top tier, like Schulte Roth & Zabel, give bonuses based on billable hours, which critics say has the potential to encourage ''bill padding'' -- a euphemism for fraud -- or at the very least, a white-collar sweatshop. 
 Equal pay advocates say it fosters teamwork and prevents resentment. But it also does something else: It makes it so easy to compare compensation across firms that it becomes glaringly obvious when one firm is out of sync. In the rest of the world, employers often pay a range of salaries and bonuses for the same job, and no one is sure what the guy or gal in the next office is making, never mind the people at a rival firm. 
 Not every firm plays the copycat game, though. Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz has long paid its associates almost twice the market rate, in part because it is able to charge its clients more than the market rate. It generally doesn't bill by the hour but by the project, like an investment bank.
 Which brings us back to the original question: Why do a dozen elite law firms all match the bonuses for associates? More specifically, why would one firm raise its bonus, knowing that its rivals will immediately match it? What competitive advantage is created for the firm that goes first, beyond a brief morale boost among the troops and perhaps bragging rights for five minutes?
 It calls to mind the masochistic ''fare wars'' among airlines, which often cut prices on competitive routes, forcing others to follow. But unlike an airline, a law firm has little hope of squeezing a competitor out of business -- or in legal-speak, moving it ''down from the first tier to the second tier.''
 It also has very little to do with recruiting. Bonuses are for people who already have jobs. It is somewhat understandable if top-tier firms match first-year associates' salaries so they can attract the very best students, but once they are employed, it makes less sense. Most people who switch firms at that tier do so because they think have a better chance of making partner somewhere else, or for lifestyle reasons.
 Evan R. Chesler, Cravath's presiding partner, told The New York Times last month that the firm had originally wanted to ''thank our lawyers for the hard work this year and the good year we've had.'' 
 IT'S a nice thought but somewhat specious. Partners at law firms are a notoriously greedy bunch -- that's why they accept so few new partners -- making it hard to believe that they are willing to part with their money so easily. I suggest there is something else at play: Law firms match bonuses to secure bragging rights. 
 Within their risk-averse, insular world, it's a way of saying, ''We're in the top tier.'' But it doesn't necessarily make good business sense. Though partners at elite firms routinely pocket millions, law firms have never been run as efficiently as truly great companies. After all, they're run by lawyers.

HEADLINE: Manhattan Turns to New Jersey To Fulfill Its Need for Electricity

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
 Manhattan already orders out to New Jersey for much of what it needs, from food to furniture to gasoline. Soon the list of imports from across the Hudson River may include electricity.
 Two private companies are vying to be the first to lay a cable under the river that would carry power to Consolidated Edison's electrical network in Manhattan. They are racing to meet a 2010 deadline for replacing the power produced by a 30-year-old generating plant in Queens that is to be shut down that year.
 The city's need to import power to meet growing demand becomes more urgent as obstacles rise to building new power plants in the city. With much of the city sitting on islands, building underwater transmission cables is likely to be part of the solution. 
 One company with hopes of building such a connection, the Cross Hudson Corporation, laid out its construction plan last month to a group of harbor users and local officials. 
 Cross Hudson would essentially build an 8.5-mile extension cord from a power plant in Ridgefield, N.J., to Midtown Manhattan. It is considering bidding on a contract to deliver a constant flow of up to 500 megawatts of electricity to the New York Power Authority, a state-owned utility, which supplies electricity to the New York City Housing Authority and other city agencies. 
 ''If the endgame here is to deliver power to New York by 2010, then we're in better position to do it,'' said Paul Rich, chief development officer of Cross Hudson, which has received approval for its project from some state and federal regulatory agencies. 
 But the power authority has already granted a similar contract to a different company, Hudson Transmission Partners, that has its own plan for running a cable between Manhattan and New Jersey. That cable would follow roughly the same path from Bergen County through the silty river bottom to Midtown.
 The rivalry between the two companies already has involved federal and state regulators, city officials and executives of Con Edison, some of whom would prefer to see two cables laid across the Hudson.
 ''We don't take sides. We want both of these projects,'' said Thomas Simpson, vice president for energy and telecommunications at the city's Economic Development Corporation. 
 Indeed, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg sent a letter in October to the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking that the commission find a way to allow both projects to proceed as scheduled.
 Tapping into the broad network of power plants in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and several other states could be ''very beneficial'' in diversifying the city's sources of power and reducing the prices it pays for electricity, Mr. Simpson said.
 But one problem is that both companies want to deliver their power to the same destination, the one available outlet at Con Edison's substation on West 49th Street, a few blocks from Times Square. Whichever company lays a cable first could gain a big advantage over the other in supplying the city's growing thirst for power.
 ''There are costs involved in not getting there first,'' said Christopher Hocker, vice president of planning for Hudson Transmission Partners. 
 The second to arrive might have to pay for the cost of expanding the substation to accommodate another connection, Mr. Hocker said. That expense would drive up the cost, which might already be approaching $500 million, he said.
 Still, Mr. Hocker said, both projects may be completed and could coexist. Neither cable by itself could substitute for all of the 885 megawatts of power now being supplied to the city by the Charles Poletti Power Project in Astoria, Queens, which the Environmental Protection Agency ranks as the third-largest source of toxic pollutants in the city. 
 Both ventures would collect fees from the buyers of electricity for providing the cable connections for transmitting it to consumers in the city.
 Mr. Hocker and his colleagues are not daunted by the size of a cross-river project because they spent the last few years constructing a much longer cable between central New Jersey and Long Island.
 That connection, known as the Neptune Regional Transmission System, stretches more than 50 miles under the Atlantic Ocean. It cost about $600 million and began moving electricity from a substation in Sayreville, N.J., to one in Levittown, N.Y., in July.
 The Long Island Power Authority contracted with the Neptune system to supplement the electricity it supplies in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and to the Rockaways in Queens. That was the second underwater cable to the island. Since 2004, the Long Island Power Authority has been drawing power from Connecticut through a 24-mile cable that crosses Long Island Sound.
 The Hudson Transmission Partners plan would, like the Neptune project, connect to the power grid in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which is known as the P.J.M. Interconnection. Its cable would carry as much as 660 megawatts off the grid from a substation in Ridgefield, N.J., underground to the riverfront in Edgewater. From there, it would run across and down the Hudson and under the city streets to Con Ed's substation.
 Most, but not all, of the electricity that would run through that cable would go to the New York Power Authority's customers. The rest could be sold to other consumers in Manhattan.
 Historically, the price of electricity off the P.J.M. grid has been significantly lower than the price of power generated in the city, said Mr. Simpson of the Economic Development Corporation. Lowering the cost of obtaining electricity is one of the goals Mayor Bloomberg set out in PlaNYC, his blueprint for long-term sustainability of city resources, he said, and one reason the mayor weighed in to ask federal regulators to allow both projects to proceed.
 Hudson Transmission Partners had sought to leapfrog Cross Hudson in line for federal regulatory approval. Cross Hudson's plan was conceived several years ago by the biggest utility in New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise Group, which had proposed running a dedicated cable, known as a generator lead, from its power plant in Ridgefield to the Con Ed substation in Manhattan.
 The utility received permits from several regulatory agencies, including the New York StatePublic Service Commission and the Army Corps of Engineers. But it did not move forward, and Cross Hudson Corporation bought the project from the utility. 
 In the meantime, Hudson Transmission Partners picked up on the idea and proposed building a cable of its own along much the same route and won a contract to supply power to the New York Power Authority. 
 Con Edison officials said they could make room for both cables to connect to their system and that there would probably be a need for both of them.
 ''We have a need, and what's driving that need is load growth,'' said Michael Forte, chief engineer for Con Edison.
 In fact, Mr. Forte said in an interview, Con Ed is planning an underwater cable of its own. It would carry power from Yonkers through the Bronx and under the Harlem River to Upper Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Buyer Beware in Seeking Lower Energy Costs

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

 BODY:
WITH winter setting in and heating fuel prices nearing record levels, Westchester residents may be thinking about taking advantage of Con Edison's Power Your Way program, which allows them to buy gas or electricity from a source other than Con Ed.
 But if saving money is the goal, it's a buyer be aware market. 
 ''It remains a crapshoot about whether or not you're going to save money, pay more money or have it come out a wash,'' said Jason K. Babbie, senior environmental policy analyst with the New York Public Interest Research Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.
 Last year, with winter approaching and faced with ever-increasing electricity bills, Adam Rench, of Croton-on-Hudson, decided to check out the Power Your Way options, which were included with his Con Edison bill. He decided to start buying his electricity from an energy supply company offering a one-year contract for a fixed rate.
 But instead of leveling off or getting lower, his bills were rising $20 to $30 a month, he said. After nine months, using bill comparison information provided by Con Ed, he found he had paid close to $250 more than he would have if he had not changed.
 ''I just assumed that if it was something coming out with the electricity bill and a state program,'' he said, ''it would be a good thing.'' About a decade has passed since utilities in the state were reorganized, opening the door to competition. Under the shift, utilities like Con Ed continue to deliver natural gas and electricity with other energy companies -- often called ESCO's -- supplying the gas or electricity.
 ''The restructuring was so the utility would not be a monopoly, so you would have choice,'' said Ann Dalton, a spokeswoman for the state's Public Service Commission.
 For many consumers, however, trying to figure out if change is right for them has been little more than a headache, and while it was hoped that competition would lead to savings for consumers, there is little evidence that has happened.
 ''You can't shop your way out of the problem we're facing,'' said Gerald A. Norlander, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, an advocacy group for energy users based in Albany. ''If people want to get their bills down, the best thing to do is conserve. No one has ever shown that resident customers who switched have saved any significant amount of money.''
 Mr. Norlander said he was concerned about a trend where ESCO's come in when prices increase and begin marketing rates to customers that appear to be lower, but in the long run turn out to be higher. Some companies also lock people in to a contract for a year or two with penalties for early termination.
 Mr. Rench, who owns an employment agency in Manhattan, said that when he inquired about getting out of his contract, he was told that it would take one to three months after the contract expired to move him back to Con Ed. So with three months still remaining on the contract, he began the process of switching back, only to be told that he would be charged an early termination fee of $80.
 Ultimately, he complained to the Public Service Commission, and the company agreed to let him out of the contract.
 ''It was a horrible experience,'' he said. ''The amount of energy I put into phone calls, the math, the calculator with two kids running around. It's just not worth it.''
 Ms. Dalton said the commission had a couple of Web sites to help educate consumers. One site, www.powertochooseny.com, provides information by ZIP code on companies that are registered with the state to provide energy, their rates and the basis for how they set them. It provides information on other services they offer and information on things like early cancellation fees. The state also has information at askpsc.com, and Con Ed (which is currently offering a deal for many consumers who switch to a new supplier) offers extensive information at poweryourway.com.
 ''Con Edison has always been in favor of customers' having the option to choose an alternate supplier, and we encourage our customers to shop for the supplier that is best for them,'' said Elizabeth Clark, a spokeswoman for the utility.
 But several consumers who have tried the system said that even if they had some success controlling what they paid for natural gas or electricity, there was such a small difference that it hardly seemed worth the effort.
 Matt Olim, a Con Ed customer in Manhattan, started a Web site, poweryourwaytruth.org, in September 2006 because he wanted to share his experience. He says he has two meters in his apartment and he buys electricity from Con Ed on one and from Energetix on the other.
 ''I think they're about the same,'' he said. ''I wish companies were more competitive. I believe in competition and I think it should improve cost and quality, but that hasn't happened yet.''

HEADLINE: Huckabee Stature Rises, Mobilizing Tax Critics

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
As Mike Huckabee rises in the Republican presidential polls, fiscal conservatives have been raising alarms about a series of tax increases he oversaw while governor of Arkansas -- new taxes on gasoline, nursing home beds and even pet groomers. 
 The Club for Growth, a politically influential antitax group, has dubbed Mr. Huckabee Tax Hike Mike and poured money into anti-Huckabee advertisements that were broadcast in early nominating states, with more on the way. Mr. Huckabee ''spends money like a drunken sailor,'' according to the group's news releases, and it has sprinkled YouTube and the airways with videos that mock him and his policies. 
 But the record offers a more complex and nuanced picture. While taxes did rise in the 10 years that Mr. Huckabee was governor, the portrayal of him as a wild-eyed spendthrift is hardly apt. For the most part, Mr. Huckabee's tax initiatives had wide bipartisan support, with the small number of Republicans in the overwhelmingly Democratic state legislature voting for the tax increases and many maintaining that the state was better for them. 
 In addition, when Mr. Huckabee left office last January, he had turned a $200 million budget shortfall into an $844 million surplus. Still, as the attacks on his fiscal policies have stepped up, the Huckabee campaign has also cited examples of some 90 taxes that went down under his tenure. 
 But over all, on balance, tax increases outweighed the tax cuts by some $500 million, and many of the cuts that Mr. Huckabee heralds owe little to his efforts. 
 ''He got bipartisan support on all the tax increases,'' said State Senator Kim Hendren, a veteran Republican and member of the legislative budget committee. ''Huckabee didn't say 'I just want to raise taxes to start programs.' He has a liberal heart for young people, for the disabled and for improving Arkansas' lot in education, and he is pretty good at working across party lines.''
 Mr. Huckabee's record on the tax front is emerging as a pivotal issue as he seeks to win the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and other early nominating states. In Iowa, he has built his following around Christian conservatives, but the tax issue could resonate in states like New Hampshire, which holds its primary five days later and where Mr. Huckabee has been devoting more time. 
 The attacks on him over taxes come as he faces criticism on other aspects of his record as governor, including fighting for tuition breaks for the children of illegal immigrants. 
 The biggest increase under Mr. Huckabee was mandated by the Arkansas Supreme Court, which in 2002 ruled that the state's school financing procedure was unconstitutional and ordered a more equitable plan -- which led to $400 million in new taxes. 
 Some other taxes came about directly because of Mr. Huckabee's efforts. After becoming governor in 1996, he traveled the length of the Arkansas River within the state to win support for an additional one-eighth-cent sales tax to improve the state parks system. 
 Early in his tenure, he pushed through a three-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax increase and a four-cent increase on diesel fuel, along with a bond issue, to improve a road system that was considered one of the worst in the country.
 And when the state lacked enough of the necessary matching money for federal Medicaid payments to its nursing homes, Mr. Huckabee and the legislature enacted a $5.25-a-day ''bed tax'' on nursing homes, which won the grudging approval of the state's nursing home industry. 
 All of this has become fodder for the Club for Growth and other antitax groups. At the Republican YouTube debate on Wednesday, an advertisement shown by a rival candidate, Fred D. Thompson, directly attacked Mr. Huckabee's tax policies.
 ''We've been making noise about Huckabee since Day 1 of his candidacy,'' said Nachama Soloveichik, a spokeswoman for the Club for Growth, which analyzes the tax policies of Republican candidates. ''There is a groundswell among conservatives that this cannot be our guy.''
 Both Democratic and Republican politicians and political observers say the legislature had little choice but to raise taxes from 2002 to 2004 given the fiscal challenges facing Arkansas.
 The biggest tax increases came in 2003 and 2004. A sagging economy had cut into revenues and the state faced a 2002 court order to equalize financing among school districts. 
 ''We had our backs against the wall; we had no choice,'' said State Senator Bobby Glover, a Democrat who has been in the legislature off and on since 1973. ''Our only other choice was to take more from prisons and heath care and other agencies.''
 In the end, the $400 million tax increase package was passed by an overwhelming majority, with Republican legislators taking the lead in pushing for it along with Democrats. The items included a sales tax increase of seven-eighths of a cent, the imposition of sales tax levies on several previously exempt services and some lesser taxes. 
 ''Republicans were fighting for the tax increase,'' said State Senator Denny Altes, the Republican minority leader of the State Senate who did not support the package. ''There were few votes against it. Some of the most conservative people, both Democrats and Republicans, supported it. It passed by 90 percent.'' 
 In general, Mr. Huckabee supported tax increases when he had a defined goal in mind, whether it was schools, roads or parks. 
 ''He tended to raise taxes for specific government programs,'' said Jay Barth, an associate political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Ark. ''He does believe in a robust government as an active force in the lives of its citizens, especially in helping the little guy.'' 
 The Club for Growth is circulating a video of Mr. Huckabee speaking to the legislature and going through a litany of all the taxes he could support, leaving the impression that there is no tax he would not embrace. 
 But the purpose of Mr. Huckabee's address was specific: Arkansas was facing a multimillion-dollar budget shortfall and Mr. Huckabee was pleading for a tax increase to cover it -- any tax, and listing all the possibilities. 
 The other big tax increase, which also received bipartisan support, was the one on gasoline to pay for road improvements. 
 ''Our roads were in terrible condition,'' said Dennis Milligan, chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party. ''We knew that in order to attract jobs and companies we needed better roads. Huckabee made a wise choice and now we have companies locating here and wonderful roads. He did a lot to improve roads, and you can't do it for free.'' 
 In the face of criticism from fiscally conservative Republicans, Mr. Huckabee has been spending more time talking about the taxes he cut than the ones he raised. For instance, at the Republican debate last week, he said that he had cut 90 taxes and that the sales tax was only a penny higher under his stewardship. 
 Of the 90 tax cuts cited by Mr. Huckabee, one was large: an increase in the standard deduction for income taxes. But most were very small, with some reducing state tax revenues by as little as $15,000 to $20,000, according to an Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration study that was reported in The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. 
 Still, the Huckabee campaign has set up a ''Truth Squad'' specifically intended to rebut the Club for Growth.
 ''Antitax radicals will never be convinced that tax monies can be legitimately spent on highways, bridges, schools and Medicare,'' the campaign said in a response to the Club for Growth.

HEADLINE: Business Lobby Presses Agenda Before '08 Vote

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Business lobbyists, nervously anticipating Democratic gains in next year's elections, are racing to secure final approval for a wide range of health, safety, labor and economic rules, in the belief that they can get better deals from the Bush administration than from its successor. 
 Hoping to lock in policies backed by a pro-business administration, poultry farmers are seeking an exemption for the smelly fumes produced by tons of chicken manure. Businesses are lobbying the Bush administration to roll back rules that let employees take time off for family needs and medical problems. And electric power companies are pushing the government to relax pollution-control requirements. 
 ''There's a growing sense, a growing probability, that the next administration could be Democratic,'' said Craig L. Fuller, executive vice president of Apco Worldwide, a lobbying and public relations firm, who was a White House official in the Reagan administration. ''Corporate executives, trade associations and lobbying firms have begun to recalibrate their strategies.''
 The Federal Register typically grows fat with regulations churned out in the final weeks of any administration. But the push for such rules has become unusually intense because of the possibility that Democrats in 2009 may consolidate control of the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives for the first time in 14 years. 
 Even as they try to shape pending regulations, business lobbies are also looking beyond President Bush. Corporations and trade associations are recruiting Democratic lobbyists. And lobbyists, expecting battles over taxes and health care in 2009, are pouring money into the campaigns of Democratic candidates for Congress and the White House.
 Randel K. Johnson, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said, ''I am beefing up my staff, putting more money aside for economic analysis of regulations that I foresee coming out of a possible new Democratic administration.''
 At the Transportation Department, trucking companies are trying to get final approval for a rule increasing the maximum number of hours commercial truck drivers can work. And automakers are trying to persuade officials to set new standards for the strength of car roofs -- standards far less stringent than what consumer advocates say is needed to protect riders in a rollover.
 Business groups generally argue that federal regulations are onerous and needlessly add costs that are passed on to consumers, while their opponents accuse them of trying to whittle down regulations that are vital to safety and quality of life. Documents on file at several agencies show that business groups have stepped up lobbying in recent months, as they try to help the Bush administration finish work on rules that have been hotly debated and, in some cases, litigated for years.
 At the Interior Department, coal companies are lobbying for a regulation that would allow them to dump rock and dirt from mountaintop mining operations into nearby streams and valleys. It would be prohibitively expensive to haul away the material, they say, and there are no waste sites in the area. Luke Popovich, a vice president of the National Mining Association, said that a Democratic president was more likely to side with ''the greens.''
 A coalition of environmental groups has condemned the proposed rule, saying it would accelerate ''the destruction of mountains, forests and streams throughout Appalachia.''
 A priority for many employers in 2008 is to secure changes in the rules for family and medical leave. Under a 1993 law, people who work for a company with 50 or more employees are generally entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for newborn children or sick relatives or to tend to medical problems of their own. The Labor Department has signaled its interest in changes by soliciting public comments. 
 The National Association of Manufacturers said the law had been widely abused and had caused ''a staggering loss of work hours'' as employees took unscheduled, intermittent time off for health conditions that could not be verified. The use of such leave time tends to rise sharply before holiday weekends, on the day after Super Bowl Sunday and on the first day of the local hunting season, employers said.
 Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy group, said she was ''very concerned that the Bush administration will issue new rules that cut back on family and medical leave for those who need it.'' 
 That could be done, for example, by narrowing the definition of a ''serious health condition'' or by establishing stricter requirements for taking intermittent leave for chronic conditions that flare up unexpectedly.
 The Chamber of Commerce is seeking such changes. ''We want to get this done before the election,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The next White House may be less hospitable to our position.''
 Indeed, most of the Democratic candidates for president have offered proposals to expand the 1993 law, to provide paid leave and to cover millions of additional workers. Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut was a principal author of the law. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York says it has been ''enormously successful.'' And Senator Barack Obama of Illinois says that more generous family leave is an essential part of his plan to ''reclaim the American dream.''
 Susan E. Dudley, administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, said, ''Research suggests that regulatory activity increases in the final year of an administration, regardless of party.''
 Whoever becomes the next president, Democrat or Republican, will find that it is not so easy to make immediate and sweeping changes. The Supreme Court has held that a new president cannot arbitrarily revoke final regulations that already have the force of law. To undo such rules, a new administration must provide a compelling justification and go through a formal rule-making process, which can take months or years. 
 Within hours of taking office in 2001, Mr. Bush slammed the brakes on scores of regulations issued just before he took office, so his administration could review them. A study in the Wake Forest Law Review found that one-fifth of those ''midnight regulations'' were amended or repealed by the Bush administration, while four-fifths survived.
 Some of the biggest battles now involve rules affecting the quality of air, water and soil.
 The National Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association have petitioned for an exemption from laws and rules that require them to report emissions of ammonia exceeding 100 pounds a day. They argue that ''emissions from poultry houses pose little or no risk to public health'' because the ammonia disperses quickly in the air. 
 Perdue Farms, one of the nation's largest poultry producers, said that it was ''essentially impossible to provide an accurate estimate of any ammonia releases,'' and that a reporting requirement would place ''an undue and useless burden'' on farmers.
 But environmental groups told the Bush administration that ''ammonia emissions from poultry operations pose great risk to public health.'' And, they noted, a federal judge in Kentucky has found that farmers discharge ammonia from their barns, into the environment, so it will not sicken or kill the chickens.
 On another issue, the Environmental Protection Agency is drafting final rules that would allow utility companies to modify coal-fired power plants and increase their emissions without installing new pollution-control equipment.
 The Edison Electric Institute, the lobby for power companies, said the companies needed regulatory relief to meet the growing demand for ''safe, reliable and affordable electricity.''
 But John D. Walke, director of the clean air program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said the rules would be ''the Bush administration's parting gift to the utility industry.''
 If Democrats gain seats in Congress or win the White House, that could pose problems for all-Republican lobbying firms like Barbour, Griffith & Rogers, whose founders include Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee.
 Loren Monroe, chief operating officer of the Barbour firm, said: ''If the right person came along, we might hire a Democrat. And it's quite possible we could team up in an alliance with a Democratic firm.''
 Two executive recruiters, Ivan H. Adler of the McCormick Group and Nels B. Olson of Korn/Ferry International, said they had seen a growing demand for Democratic lobbyists. ''It's a bull market for Democrats, especially those who have worked for the Congressional leadership'' or a powerful committee, Mr. Adler said.
 Few industries have more cause for concern than drug companies, which have been a favorite target of Democrats. Republicans run the Washington offices of most major drug companies, and a former Republican House member, Billy Tauzin, is president of their trade association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
 The association has hired three Democrats this year, so its lobbying team is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats.
 Loren B. Thompson, a military analyst at the Lexington Institute, a policy research organization, said: ''Defense contractors have not only begun to prepare for the next administration. They have begun to shape it. They've met with Hillary Clinton and other candidates.''

HEADLINE: For the 2008 Race, Google Is a Crucial Constituency

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LAST century, General Motors assembly plants were a regular stop on the itineraries of presidential candidates. This election cycle, Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., has become a favorite destination.
 Hillary Rodham Clinton made the pilgrimage in February. Then came John McCain, Bill Richardson, John Edwards, Ron Paul, Mike Gravel and most recently, Barack Obama. 
 In terms of theatrical symbolism, the trip to Google is similar to the G.M. plant visit. In both cases, the visits gave the candidate the chance for a photo opportunity at the most technologically advanced edge of the economy, ''signaling identification with the future,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication. 
 On a more mundane level, candidates in the pre-mass-media era were concerned with reaching as many prospective voters as possible in one place, and any large factory would do. At Google, the number of employees who can see the candidates in person is limited: the largest space at the Googleplex holds only a few hundred people. 
 Everyone in the 16,000-employee company can watch the event in real time over the company's internal network in their offices scattered around the globe. But Google employees, like almost everyone else, prefer the live version. At Senator Obama's talk last month, the atrium and overhanging balcony filled well in advance, and streams of employees poured into the building and then had to be turned away.
 The politicians visiting auto plants could control what was said during the event. Today, candidates must place themselves at the tender mercies of the audience. Those who go to Google sit exposed on the stage, without the protective lectern provided in a debate, answering questions for 45 to 60 minutes. But without the escape hatch of a timekeeper's buzzer, and as the only speaker, the candidate cannot evade uncomfortable questions. Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chairman and chief executive, for example, asked Senator Obama for his views on Iran, Pakistan, and Guantanamo -- and that was a single question. 
 The proceedings at Google are not unremittingly serious affairs. Mr. Schmidt asked Senator McCain, ''How do you determine good ways of sorting one million 32-bit integers in two megabytes of RAM?'' Immediately signaling that the question was asked in jest, Mr. Schmidt moved on. Six months later, Senator Obama faced the same question, but his staff had prepared him. When he replied in fluent tech-speak (''A bubble sort is the wrong way to go''), the quip brought down the house.
 Among the seven visiting candidates, only Senator Obama used his Google visit to announce details of policy proposals related to technology. Until his visit, he and Senator Edwards were widely viewed among technology bloggers as the two candidates who had the strongest positions on Internet neutrality, expanded broadband access and other technology issues. With his Google visit, however, Senator Obama succeeded in drawing attention to his plans for using technology to make government more accessible and transparent with, for example, live Internet feeds of all executive branch department and agency meetings. This was old-school campaigning, organized around a company visit, done well.
 Though all of the candidate sessions at Google are available on YouTube, they are not YouTube-like: they require an investment of time that, by YouTube viewer standards, is inconceivable. A 43-minute video of Senator Clinton's Google session has been available since February and has drawn only about 54,000 ''views,'' which count as soon as the video is begun but leave unknown the more interesting number: completed views. 
 Senator Edwards's and Senator Obama's videos, both of which run longer than an hour, have not been up as long and have still fewer viewers. The biggest draw has turned out to be Representative Ron Paul, whose July visit has been viewed, or at least started, more than 350,000 times.
 For perspective, consider the numbers that short-form videos of a less serious nature draw. Search for ''Barack Obama'' on YouTube and you will find that the most-viewed video is titled ''I Got a Crush ... on Obama.'' It lacks narrative, content and anything other than a young woman with large breasts lip-synching, but it has tallied more than four million views. The most-viewed video that turns up for a ''Hillary Clinton'' search is ''Vote Different,'' a dark parody of Apple's ''1984'' commercial that portrays the senator most unflatteringly, as a giant TV image that is shattered. It is also approaching four million views.
 YouTube has a separate section, ''YouChoose '08,'' that gives each candidate a protected space for more serious discourse, similar to the way the broadcast networks give Sunday mornings over to civic uplift. YouChoose also provides access to last Wednesday's CNN/YouTube debate with the Republican candidates, and the earlier one in July with the Democrats. 
 Professor Jamieson credits YouTube with broadening the range of questions in the debates, making them more memorable by having users submit the questions in the form of personal videos, and making everything searchable afterward. In the past, she said, ''if you missed a debate, you missed it.''
 The ability to select for playback any question in the debate and the candidates' responses provides easy, precise access to the contents, sliced and diced, that was never possible before. But it also contributes to a shortening of our collective attention span.
 THIS is hardly new -- we've already come a long way from the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858 for a Senate seat, which held the audience rapt, on one occasion, for three hours -- then everyone dispersed for dinner and came back for the four-hour rebuttal. The contrast with the public's attenuated attention in the age of television, which Neil Postman pointed out in his 1985 book ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business,'' was great. The contrast is all the greater today, with the advent of the short, nonlinear clips of YouTube.
 It is easy to forget that this is YouTube's first presidential campaign: the company was founded in only 2005 and acquired by Google in 2006. By the time the next campaign cycle rolls around in 2011, YouTube's influence on the culture may be so complete that a 45-minute linear video of a question-answer session will seem to most people to be about 43 minutes too long.
 A midcampaign trek to Google headquarters in Silicon Valley may soon seem no less quaint than one to a G.M. plant in Flint, Mich. The candidates need not seek out the cameras -- from now on, the cameras will always find them.

GLASS SLIPPER, GOLD SANDAL A Worldwide Cinderella. By Paul Fleischman. Illustrated by Julie Paschkis. Holt. $16.95. (Ages 5 and up)
 Multicultural versions of Cinderella aren't new, but Fleischman's text -- woven together from some of the 1,000 sources of the Cinderella story -- has to be one of the most artful. Here Cinderella puts on glass slippers or diamond anklets or gold sandals, and travels to the ball by breadfruit coach or galloping mare.
 HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS By J. K. Rowling. Illustrated by Mary GrandPre. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $34.99. 
 This book, among the best-selling of all time, brings to a close a 10-year series exceptional for its appeal to fans from 7 to 70. In this final volume, Harry faces his last battle with Voldemort and solves the mystery behind his enigmatic elders, Severus Snape and Albus Dumbledore. The Harry Potter books have won their author ''imperishable renown,'' as Christopher Hitchens wrote in these pages. ''Probably for many decades there will still be millions of adults who recall their initiation to literature as a little touch of Harry in the night.''
 EXTRAS By Scott Westerfeld. Simon & Schuster. $16.99. (Ages 12 and up)
 The finale to Westerfeld's thought-provoking Uglies series, set in a postindustrial dystopia, continues its dissection of a culture transfixed by beauty and celebrity. In the future, everyone tries to raise his or her ''face rank'' within the fame economy, using personal hovercams, as if would-be star and member of the paparrazi at the same time. There is also plenty of hoverboard derring-do as a band of outsiders confronts a new menace.

 Alexie's first young adult novel, winner of this year's National Book Award for young people's literature, overflows with truth, pain and black comedy amid lacerating memories of life on the rez. (''My parents came from poor people who came from poor people ... all the way back to the very first poor people.'') Closely based on the author's own childhood on the Spokane Reservation in Washington, the novel is an unforgettable portrait of getting by in harsh circumstances, then getting out. 
 HOW TO BE A BABY ... BY ME, THE BIG SISTER By Sally Lloyd-Jones. Illustrated by Sue Heap. Schwartz & Wade/Random House. $15.99. (Ages 4 to 8)
 An ultracharming picture book presented as a kind of comic how-to manual to a baby brother, full of love, self-importance and well-meaning scorn (''You talk, but no one knows what you're saying''). A shift in tone at the end signals the enduring affection and pride in being the older sibling.
 THE ARRIVAL By Shaun Tan. Arthur A. Levine/Scholastic. $19.99. (Ages 10 and up)
 This graphic novel portraying a stranger's arrival in a strange land draws on landscapes from Australia to America, photographs of Ellis Island and dreamlike imagery from who knows where. Ominous shadows vie with a hopeful vision of a new beginning. '''The Arrival' tells not an immigrant's story, but the immigrant's story,'' Gene Luen Yang wrote in these pages. A New York Times Best Illustrated Book of the year.

HEADLINE: Judging Eminent Domain

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
THE recent $12.4 million jury verdict against the Town of Branford for eminent-domain abuse signals the public's heightened sensitivity to the issue, said lawyers for both sides in the case. 
 The September verdict, which the town is expected to appeal, should serve as a warning to municipalities trying to appropriate privately owned land without a legitimate public purpose. It can be ''a high-risk proposition,'' said Timothy S. Hollister, a lawyer for the development company and landowners who sued the town in Superior Court in Waterbury. 
 More commonly a topic reserved for civics class, eminent domain has come up in many a kitchen-table conversation since 2005, when the Supreme Court issued its ruling in a high-profile Connecticut case, Kelo v. New London. 
 That ruling affirmed the City of New London's right to force Susette Kelo and other homeowners in the Fort Trumbull neighborhood to sell out in order to make way for economic revitalization. 
 The Kelo decision was widely criticized for making it easier for municipalities to seize properties for private economic development billed as beneficial to the public. The high court left the door open for states to enact further restrictions on eminent domain, however.
 The clamor from voters has been loud enough that 34 states have done so, to varying degrees, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
 Numerous polls around the country have shown widespread concern about the potential for abuse of eminent domain, ''and how profound the costs are for the people who are put through that,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm based in Arlington, Va., which represented the New London homeowners in their appeal. 
 Lawyers in the Branford case found that nearly everyone questioned during jury selection had at least a vague notion of what the Kelo case was about. For most, the lasting impression was that eminent domain ''could be a bad thing,'' said James W. Bergenn, another lawyer for the developer. 
 Branford officials have vehemently defended their decision in 2003 to take a 77-acre parcel of land owned by Frank Perrotti Jr. of Hamden and Thomas Santa Barbara Jr. of Branford.
 The two men had originally agreed to sell the property to a Monroe-based development company, New England Estates, for $4.75 million if the town approved the company's plans to build a 268-unit residential development. 
 But after the town's planning and zoning commission denied its development application in 2002, New England Estates raised the possibility of an affordable-housing project instead.
 Connecticut law makes it much harder for towns to turn down developments in which at least 30 percent of the units meet the state's definition of affordable. 
 Town officials began questioning the site's suitability for housing because of its proximity to a closed landfill.
 In May 2003, the Board of Selectmen voted in favor of a proposal to take the property by eminent domain for the purpose of investigating possible environmental contamination and perhaps to develop ball fields there. The town's legislative body approved the taking three months later.
 New England Estates petitioned the New Haven Superior Court for a temporary injunction halting the taking. In December 2003, the judge trial referee, Anthony V. DeMayo, denied the injunction. The next month, the town took ownership of the property, for which it paid Mr. Perrotti and Mr. Santa Barbara $1.1 million. 
 A vast majority of cases challenging such takings are resolved through injunctions; takings temporarily halted by court injunction are often abandoned. But because Judge DeMayo had granted New England Estates and the landowners the right to seek a claim for damages, this case took a different path: The developer and landowners took it to trial, alleging a violation of their civil rights under the takings clause of the Fifth Amendment and seeking lost profits. 
 Mr. Hollister, the developer's lawyer, maintained that town officials had made up reasons to take the land simply to stave off development.
 Unlike the City of New London, which exercised its power of eminent domain after a ''fair, public and factual'' process, Mr. Hollister said, Branford pursued a process ''so unfair and distorted as to violate the Constitution.'' 
 The jury agreed, awarding New England Estates $11.2 million in lost profits plus $1.2 million for expenses already incurred on the project. The jurors also awarded $340,000 to the landowners for lost option payments. 
 Those awards followed a separate decision by Judge William T. Cremins of the Waterbury Superior Court, in another complaint filed by the landowners, that revalued the 77 acres at $4.6 million and ordered the town to pay the additional $3.5 million. Both sides have appealed that decision. 
 While the Kelo case wasn't discussed in the courtroom during the six-week trial, it certainly informed the proceedings, Mr. Bergenn said.
 At the conclusion of jury selection, ''I knew I had nobody who hated developers,'' he said. ''Without Kelo, it would have been more of an uphill battle.'' 
 The town's lawyer in the case, Kerry R. Callahan, has filed a motion to set aside the trial verdict based on a variety of issues; a decision was still pending as of last week.
 While Mr. Callahan agreed that the jury was well aware of Kelo, he took a much dimmer view of its impact. Jurors were ''more wary of and perhaps even hostile to the concept that a government could take private property,'' he said.
 ''By the end of the trial,'' he added, ''it was clear that the jury was hostile to the whole eminent domain process.''

 CORRECTION:
An article in Westchester and Connecticut copies last Sunday about a $12.4 million jury verdict against the Town of Branford, Conn., for eminent-domain abuse erroneously included a party among the clients of the lawyer Timothy S. Hollister. Mr. Hollister represented the development company, New England Estates, which planned a project on the land, but not the owners of the property. The owners, Frank Perrotti Jr. and Thomas Santa Barbara Jr., were represented by Steven Humphrey and Brian R. Smith of the firm of Robinson & Cole.

HEADLINE: U.S. Credit Crisis Adds to Gloom Of Arctic Norway's Long Night

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Walter Gibbs contributed reporting from Oslo.

DATELINE: NARVIK, Norway, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
-- At this time of year, the sun does not rise at all this far north of the Arctic Circle. But Karen Margrethe Kuvaas says she has not been able to sleep well for days.
What is keeping her awake are the far-reaching ripple effects of the troubled housing market in sunny Florida, California and other parts of the United States.
 Ms. Kuvaas is the mayor of Narvik, a remote seaport where the season's perpetual gloom deepened even further in recent days after news that the town -- along with three other Norwegian municipalities -- had lost about $64 million, and potentially much more, in complex securities investments that went sour.
 ''I think about it every minute,'' Ms. Kuvaas, 60, said in an interview, her manner polite but harried. ''Because of this, we can't focus on things that matter, like schools or care for the elderly.'' 
 Norway's unlucky towns are the latest victims -- and perhaps the least likely ones so far -- of the credit crisis that began last summer in the American subprime mortgage market and has spread to the farthest reaches of the world, causing untold losses and sowing fears about the global economy.
 Where all the bad debt ended up remains something of a mystery, but to those hit by the collateral damage, it hardly matters. 
 Tiny specks on the map, these Norwegian towns are links in a chain of misery that stretches from insolvent homeowners in California to the state treasury of Maine, and from regional banks in Germany to the mightiest names on Wall Street. Citigroup, among the hardest hit, created the investments bought by the towns through a Norwegian broker. 
 For Ms. Kuvaas, being in such company is no comfort. People here are angry and scared, fearing that the losses will hurt local services like kindergartens, nursing homes and cultural institutions. With Christmas only weeks away, Narvik has already missed a payroll for municipal workers.
 Above all, the residents want to know how their close-knit community of 18,000 could have mortgaged its future -- built on the revenue from a hydroelectric plant on a nearby fjord -- by dabbling in what many view as the black arts of investment bankers in distant places.
 ''The people in City Hall were naive and they were manipulated,'' said Paal Droenen, who was buying fish at a market across the street from the mayor's office. ''The fund guys were telling them tales, like, 'This could happen to you.' It's a catastrophe for a small town like this.''
 Now, the towns are considering legal action against the Norwegian brokerage company, Terra Securities, that sold them the investments. They allege that they were duped by Terra's brokers, who did not warn them that these types of securities were risky and subject to being cashed out, at a loss, if their market price fell below a certain level.
 ''When you sell something that is not what you say it is, that is a lie,'' Ms. Kuvaas said. She disputed the suggestion that people here lacked the sophistication to understand what they were buying. ''We're not especially stupid because we live so far in the north,'' she said.
 Norway's financial regulator agreed that the brokers had misled the towns, and it revoked the license of Terra Securities, prompting the company to file for bankruptcy. But the company's parent, Terra Group, which is in turn owned by 78 savings banks and remains in business, rejected calls for it to compensate the towns. A spokesman for the group said it too had taken a hit from the episode.
 Norway's finance minister, Kristin Halvorsen, has ruled out the possibility of a state bailout, and Citigroup, which announced Thursday that it would shut down one of the money-losing investments Narvik bought, said it had no legal obligation to step in.
 At City Hall, the stark reality of the situation is starting to set in. Narvik's chief administrator, Trond L. Hermansen, figures he may recoup half of the town's $9.4 million investment in the defunct Citigroup product -- a package of securities linked to municipal bonds in the United States. Those securities declined in value after the market for bonds dried up.
 But Narvik has $34.5 million in a second Citigroup-devised investment, known as a collateralized debt obligation, which has also lost value as a result of the broader market turmoil. The town stands to lose at least some of that money, too.
 Those investments represent a quarter of Narvik's annual budget of $163 million, and covering the losses would necessitate taking out a long-term loan, which the town could only pay off by cutting back on services.
 ''You can calculate this in terms of places for schoolchildren or help for the elderly,'' said Mr. Hermansen, a soft-spoken man who sat in his office in near-darkness, the lights switched off.
 As the losses begin to bite, the political finger-pointing has begun. Down the hall from Ms. Kuvaas, the town's opposition leader, Torgeir Traeldal, is calling for an investigation of how and why Narvik could have made such an ill-advised investment.
 ''Heads are going to roll,'' Mr. Traeldal said, repeating the phrase a few times to drive home his point.
 From Mr. Traeldal's window, cargo ships are visible in Narvik's harbor, waiting to be loaded with iron ore. They testify to the town's strategic location, more than 120 miles north of the Arctic Circle, not far from rich ore fields in Sweden. This has long made Narvik a target of opportunity for foreigners.
 Hitler viewed the port as an important conquest because it could provide Nazi Germany with an ice-free harbor from which to ship iron ore to build his war machine. The British had similar ideas, and the stage was set for one of the first great naval battles of World War II.
 In April 1940, German warships sailed to Narvik. They were met by Norwegian and British ships, and the ensuing clashes left hundreds of sailors dead and the wrecks of more than a dozen destroyers scattered in the fjords.
 Narvik's war history is chronicled in a little museum next to the fish market that attracts visitors from around the world. But it, too, may be a victim of the crisis. Ulf Eirik Torgersen, the director, said the town told him his budget would be cut by 40 percent, which could mean closing.
 ''That would be a shame,'' he said, ''because this whole town is based on naval history and war history.''
 Nowadays, scuba divers prospect the World War II shipwrecks, part of the town's busy tourist trade. Like many other Norwegian towns, Narvik also gets hefty tax payments and other revenue from the nearby hydropower plant. That wealth is what got it into trouble.
 In 2004, Narvik and a number of other towns took out a large loan, using future energy revenue as collateral. They invested the money, through Terra Securities, in the Citigroup debt vehicle, which offered a better return than traditional investments. In June 2007, as the subprime problems were brewing, Narvik shifted some money from that investment into an even more complex one, again through Terra Securities.
 Within weeks, as the market deteriorated, that investment declined in value, and Narvik got a letter from Terra Securities, demanding an additional payment of $2.8 million. Mr. Hermansen said Terra's brokers never told him that he would be liable for such payments.
 The chief investigator of Norway's financial regulator, Eystein Kleven, said Terra Securities' Norwegian-language prospectus did not mention such payments, or other risk factors. Citigroup's term sheet did provide information on risks, but Narvik got a copy only after it had signed the agreement.
 ''This is the most serious matter we have dealt with in the stock market in the last 10 years,'' Mr. Kleven said.
 Even if the Norwegian prospectus had been complete, it is not certain that Narvik would have shunned the investment. Ms. Kuvaas, for one, said she did not read the prospectus before voting to authorize it -- a decision that was made when she was in the government but not yet mayor. She said the town trusted Terra Securities, with which it had worked since the late 1990s.
 To local residents, the bigger question is why Narvik would gamble its future energy revenue on exotic investments.
 ''We're upset with our politicians because they should have known better,'' said Eileen Jacobsen, 34, a kindergarten teacher. ''If this was a private person who did this, people would say, 'Hello?'''
 Ms. Jacobsen, who has a son in kindergarten, said she worried that the town would cut back on resources. Fourteen adults look after 54 children at the kindergarten. But, even without the crisis, Narvik has 40 children on a waiting list for kindergarten, something that is considered almost a right in Norway.
 With candles burning in the windows and lights strung on the streets, Narvik and its residents seem determined not to let the losses spoil the season. But late at night, in the Narvik Guten pub, the sadness is palpable. ''I really love this town,'' said Per Ellingsen, 45, a carpenter who recently returned home after years away. ''I'm afraid this is going to set us back 10 years.''

HEADLINE: BOOKS OF STYLE; Recycling Everything (Yes, Even the '70s)

BYLINE: By LIESL SCHILLINGER

 BODY:
THE GREAT FUNK
 Falling Apart and Coming Together (on a Shag Rug) in the Seventies.
By Thomas Hine.
 256 pp. Sarah Crichton Books. $30.
 COOL GREEN STUFF
 A Guide to Finding Great Recycled, Sustainable, Renewable Objects You Will Love.
 By Dave Evans. 
 256 pp. Clarkson Potter.
 $14.95.
 WITH gasoline topping $3 a gallon, it's easy for anyone who was of moviegoing age when ''Saturday Night Fever'' hustled onto the screen to remember the '70s -- when gas lines stretched along roadways, when President Carter exhorted Americans to turn down their thermostats, and when the Christmas gift everyone craved was a giant comforter with snaps to keep you toasty in your underheated house.
 In ''The Great Funk,'' Thomas Hine, the author of ''Populuxe'' (about postwar American tastes), reminds us that the '70s weren't just about bell-bottoms, free love and ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' They were a time of hedonism, moralism and really, really ugly carpets.
 With almost 300 photographs, ''The Great Funk'' offers undeniable nostalgic and ironic appeal, and so much shag that it is surprising the pages don't sizzle with static electricity. Leafing through it, you feel as if you had uncovered an ancient Newsweek from a dusty crate in an attic -- pages pop with leisure suits and handlebar mustaches, people in tight pants or no pants, E.R.A. activists, ''Charlie's Angels,'' Donny Osmond and Richard Nixon, all tucked in among period ads of ''Gee, Your Hair Smells Terrific!'' or the bulbous AMC Pacers.
 But Mr. Hine's book is more than a photo chronicle; it is a wide-ranging, somewhat morose consideration of the way we lived then and how that era still shapes us. For instance, he writes, the '70s was a time when unprecedented numbers of women entered the workforce, not only as a sign of ''liberation,'' but as a survival strategy -- so their families could maintain a middle-class life as wages stagnated and inflation skyrocketed. (And here we thought everyone was just zoning out in their beanbag chairs, watching ''Love Boat'' and drinking Tang as their Chia pets grew.) 
 Mr. Hine may have a darker take on the decade than most. He sees portents of malaise not only in Vietnam, Three Mile Island and the Iran hostage crisis, but also in flowery bedrooms (decorated to ''shut out reminders of an ugly world''), harvest-gold fridges (''the colors of the musty, cheap motel'') and in his personal bugbear: disaster movies. Films such as ''Earthquake,'' ''The Towering Inferno'' and ''The Poseidon Adventure'' were popular in the '70s, Mr. Hine suggests, because moviegoers liked the idea that after disaster comes redemption. ''A little catastrophe, the movies tell us, can be good for the soul,'' he writes.
 Soul-schmoul: people don't like to think about the gravity of their situation if they can help it, and with the start of the Reagan era, optimism and denial returned. Still, at least one good thing came out of the shag years: environmental awareness, a movement that has gathered new strength lately.
 IN ''Cool Green Stuff,'' '70s idealism is transformed into chic, covetable objects that turn the somber task of saving the planet into the lighthearted activity of decorating your loft or adorning your civic-minded body. 
 The book's creator, Dave Evans, Dumpster-dived the globe to find trash reconceived as treasure. Discarded aluminum can tabs are crocheted into a cyborglike shoulder bag that would look good on R2-D2's arm; junked computer keys are strung into a high-tech beaded clutch; and a visionary Indiana seamstress fuses colored trash bags onto old blankets and sews them into slick jackets called ''Plasticoats.'' Yes, the possibilities of ''Trashion'' are endless.
 Claassen & Partner in Berlin pierces vintage boots with holes like a Jell-O poke cake, gives them an electrical cord, fills them with ''energy-saving light bulbs,'' and turns them into $1,280 lamps. And before you throw your coffee grounds down the disposer, know that Rawstudio in Britain can convert the mulch into sleek coffee tables and sell them for $600 each. Another British company melts hubcaps into sculpture, like a flying fish for $800. 
 Mr. Davis even shows that eco-guilt need not stop at the grave. Did Grandma like to feed the birds before she died? Nadine Jarvis, a product designer, can mingle her ashes with birdseed and mold them into a feeder.
 ''The person is reincarnated through the life of the bird,'' Ms. Jarvis writes on her Web site. It may be a little hard to wrap your mind around, but nobody ever said it was easy being green.

HEADLINE: Insurgents and Corruption Threaten a Road Vital to Afghanistan's Future

BYLINE: By C. J. CHIVERS

DATELINE: SALAR, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The ruined Afghan police truck smoldered on the highway in the village bazaar, flames rising from its cargo bed. The village was silent. Its residents had hidden themselves before an American patrol arrived. 
 The remains of a second truck, a tanker, sat on its wheel rims 100 yards to the north. To the south, another patrol was removing two other freshly burned tankers from the highway, clearing the lanes so traffic could pass.
 The Americans examined the police truck. Holes marked where bullets had passed through. The front passenger door was gone; a rocket-propelled grenade had struck and exploded there. 
 This vehicle graveyard here on Highway 1, roughly 50 miles south of Kabul, the Afghan capital, symbolizes both the ambitions and frustrations in Afghanistan six years after the Taliban were chased from power. 
 Highway 1 is the country's main road, the route between Kabul and Kandahar, the country's second largest city. It lies atop an ancient trade route that, in theory, could connect Central Asia and Afghanistan with ports in Pakistan, restoring Afghanistan's place as a transit hub for something besides heroin.
 The highway, which has been rebuilt with $250 million from the United States and other nations, accommodates a daily flow of automobiles, buses and ornately decorated cargo carriers, which the soldiers call jingle trucks. The Afghan and American governments say the road's restored condition is a tangible step toward a self-sufficient Afghanistan.
 But Highway 1 remains bedeviled by danger, extortion and treachery. Police corruption and insurgent attacks sow fear and make traveling many sections of the road a lottery. The risks limit its contribution to the economy and underscore the government's weakness beyond Kabul. 
 Training indigenous security forces to police the road honestly is one of the primary long-term goals of the American and NATO forces in outposts along the route. In the short term, the goal is to keep traffic flowing with a minimum of graft and attacks.
 ''Right now, freedom of movement is our main task on Highway 1,'' said Lt. Col. Timothy J. McAteer, commanding officer of the Second Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry, a unit of the 82nd Airborne Division that operates in two provinces bisected by the highway, Wardak and Ghazni.
 The road is different in many ways from its recent past. But in some ways it is the same.
 In 2001, after more than two decades of war, Highway 1 was almost impassable. It had been washed out by floods, ground apart by tank treads and bombed in repeated military campaigns. The husks of looted cars and deserted Russian armor lined its shoulders. In places it was mined or littered with unexploded rockets, shells and bombs.
 Armed men set up roadblocks and chased victims on motorcycles and trucks. The 230-mile journey from Kabul to Kandahar, assuming the trip was not delayed by robbery or breakdown, often took more than 12 hours.
 The road is now paved, with two lanes, wide shoulders and bridges over gullies and streams. Convoys of pickup trucks, newly purchased vehicles for the police, roam its length. Most bombs and mines have been removed.
 But although stretches of the road are now generally safe, several sections remain plagued by violence. Some attacks are Taliban guerrilla operations, several officers said. Others are the sort of crimes that have afflicted Afghan trails for centuries. 
 ''You go back in history and people made money here by hitting caravans,'' Colonel McAteer said. ''Now they hit buses and jingle trucks.''
 The colonel said that within two or three years, the Afghan police might be competent enough to secure the road. Since last year, American financing for police equipment and training has sharply increased. Their improvement has become a priority.
 For now, Capt. Matthew R. Fogarty, an intelligence officer, and Capt. Matthew T. Hagerman, an officer in the operations section, described three threats. 
 The first, they said, are police officers themselves, who set up impromptu checkpoints and shake down passing drivers and their passengers. There are three legal toll points on Highway 1 in the battalion's area, they said. The police typically set up five to seven more each day -- and pocket what they collect.
 Afghan police officers and supervisors are scheduled to receive significant pay raises in January; Afghan government officials and their American mentors say they hope the raises will reduce the shakedowns.
 The second threat, the officers said, comes from criminals, some of whom masquerade as police officers and order drivers to pull over. They sack vehicles and seize their goods. 
 ''They pretend to be A.N.P., because they can get someone to stop with a Kalashnikov and half a uniform,'' Captain Hagerman said, using the initials of the Afghan National Police.
 The third threat comes from insurgents, who make checkpoints but also ambush patrols. As the insurgents steal, the officers said, they warn Afghan drivers not to carry cargo for NATO forces and passengers not to work on military bases. 
 Taliban fighters have killed drivers who haul cargo for NATO or sliced off their noses and ears before setting them free.
 At times the different groups collaborate, as apparently happened when a bus with 23 South Korean missionaries was hijacked in Ghazni Province in July. ''The Koreans got hijacked by basically one dude with a Kalashnikov,'' Captain Hagerman said. 
 The Taliban killed two hostages before releasing the rest. 
 Once the hostages were safe, their captors -- thought to be about a dozen men -- were targeted by the American military. ''So far, all but two of those involved have been hunted down and arrested or killed,'' Captain Hagerman said. ''It was important to send a message: You want to kidnap people? We are going to find you, and there is going to be a price.'' 
 But concentrating military resources in one district means others receive less attention. In other areas, including around Salar, insurgents prey on traffic with near impunity.
 On a recent patrol, a platoon from Second Battalion's Company D entered Salar and found it silent. Every business was shuttered. 
 Three coalition patrols and a police convoy were ambushed here in recent days. The attackers had fired grenades and swept the road with machine-gun fire, two survivors said, then escaped and mingled with civilians in Salar. 
 The paratroopers watched nervously, expecting to be ambushed, too. ''This is where jingle trucks go to die,'' said Staff Sgt. Anthony Cassetta, as his vehicle passed the burning truck.
 During an ambush at night, the paratroopers saw gunmen run to a compound on the far side of a stream. The soldiers did not called in an airstrike, unsure that no civilians were inside.
 Capt. Aaron W. White, the company commander, wanted to search the compound. As he gathered about a dozen paratroopers, an Afghan police convoy stopped. The police commander greeted the Americans. 
 Approaching the compound would require the paratroopers to cross several hundred yards of open ground, exposed to anyone who might fire on them. Captain White asked the police officers to join them. 
 The police commander refused and led the convoy away. Captain White allowed himself a smile. ''I should have told them we were searching for money -- a cache of money,'' he said. ''That would probably have worked.''
 He ordered the paratroopers into the field. They crossed the terraced cropland, descended into the stream bed and followed it to the compound. 
 An Afghan woman, who said her namewas Shafiqa, appeared and unlocked the compound's metal door. The paratroopers rushed inside. No one was home. 
 Shafiqa insisted that the Taliban did not operate here. The paratroopers found a military-style parka hidden under leaves. Captain White held it up. Shafiqa's story changed. 
 ''All the time, Taliban come here!'' she shouted. ''We tell them, 'Go away from this area.' If they attack on anybody, you know, they will bombard our houses.'' 
 The captain said, ''This is the place.'' 
 He thanked her and led the patrol back to Highway 1. Sgt. Ryan Gloyer, a squad leader, said Shafiqa's behavior was typical of the protection that insurgents received in a land where the police were weak. ''It's kind of like a mobster mentality,'' he said. ''They're afraid to give anybody up.''

HEADLINE: Truckers in Maine, Feeling High Costs of Diesel Fuel, Urge State to Intervene

BYLINE: By KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: DAMARISCOTTA, Me., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Truckers across Maine are mobilizing against the rising price of diesel fuel, lobbying politicians to provide relief from high costs they say are crippling their businesses and causing some to stop driving. 
 Hundreds of truckers, many of them who haul timber, pulp and other products from the state's logging industry, have signed petitions and attended meetings urging state and federal officials to suspend taxes on diesel fuel, lift road weight restrictions to allow for easier hauling to and from logging plants, and re-evaluate other aspects of the trucking industry. 
 The effort has been led by the Coalition to Lower Fuel Prices in Maine, which was formed last month to help combat the rising cost of diesel, which is about $3.60 a gallon. Dozens of truckers, most of whom are independent operators, attended a meeting here Saturday morning to tell federal and state representatives how prices are affecting them. 
 ''The cost of diesel is putting us out of business one day at a time, one truck at a time,'' said Larry Sidelinger, the owner of Yankee Pride Transport here in Damariscotta. 
 Gov. John Baldacci on Friday signed a civil emergency declaration granting some relief to logging truckers. 
 The declaration expedites weekly reimbursements of the state's 10-cent off-road diesel tax to logging truckers and urges the federal government to waive weight limits on roads leading to Bangor. Logging truckers must currently drive back roads to the mills, adding miles to their trips. 
 Governor Baldacci, a Democrat, will urge the legislature to pass emergency legislation to expedite tax refunds on forest products when it reconvenes in January. 
 ''The logging industry has demonstrated that this has hit them very hard and in a very specific way,'' said John M. Kerry, director of the state office of energy independence and security.
 The logging industry contributes more than $10 billion to Maine's economy each year. 
 Tom Cushman, the owner of Maine Custom Woodlands, a logging company in New Gloucester, said many logging truckers were unable to absorb a rise in fuel costs because their contracts were drafted once a year. He is paying for diesel out of his profits. 
 ''Every time the price of diesel goes up a dime, it's like adding another person to the payroll,'' Mr. Cushman said. 
 Many are pleased with the declaration but are worried that it does not cover the thousands of truckers who haul other products. Meeting organizers said they would continue to push for a temporary suspension of the state's diesel tax, which is about 26 cents per gallon. 
 Mr. Kerry said the state had considered suspending the tax but was exploring other options because the tax pays for road repair and safety.
 Truckers here who do not work for loggers said they needed help, and quickly. They are paying not only for diesel but also for home heating oil. Maine leads the nation in oil heat use, with 80 percent of households using the fuel. 
 ''It's killing us,'' said Melissa Wesley of Woolwich, Me., who operates a long-haul truck with her husband. The couple has used all of their savings on diesel and heating fuel, she said, as the price of filling up the tank of the truck has risen by $700 over seven years, she said. 
 ''We can't afford to go broke,'' Ms. Wesley said, because of a hefty mortgage and payments on their truck. 
 George True, owner of George True and Son in Chelsea, Me., said prices were among the worst he had seen in nearly 40 years of trucking.
 Mr. True said his insurance agent told him that nine truckers canceled their policies last month because they had to go out of business. Were his equipment not paid for, Mr. True said, he would likely be out of business too. His income has dropped nearly $10,000 because of fuel costs in the past two years, he said. 
 ''There just isn't any money left. Fuel is going up and up,'' Mr. True said. 
 Belinda Raymond, who started the coalition with her husband Albert, a logging trucker, said the group planned to drive a convoy to Washington to push the issue. 
 ''We're not going to stop,'' said Ms. Raymond. She added that numerous supporters had volunteered to help subsidize fuel costs for the trip, which is likely to take place before Christmas. ''These are people's lives we're talking about.''

HEADLINE: Requiem for a Red Lobster: A Novel of Downsizing

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

DATELINE: WETHERSFIELD, Conn., Nov. 28 

 BODY:
Stewart O'Nan sat down for lunch at a Red Lobster along a strip-malled highway here and wondered if the waitress would try to entice him into ordering not just one, but two drinks before his meal. She didn't. 
 ''Their manual tells them to try,'' he said, having found one on eBay last year while researching ''Last Night at the Lobster,'' his 10th novel. The book, published by Viking in early November, is set in a fictional Red Lobster in nearby New Britain, and follows the restaurant's fractious crew on its last day before corporate headquarters closes the branch for good.
 Having swiped menus, scrutinized dining patterns and interrogated workers in Wethersfield and other locations while writing the book, Mr. O'Nan, 46, became steeped in Red Lobster trivia. A supervisor at a branch in Ashtabula, Ohio, told him that managers were not allowed to leave alone, and never through the back door. When the waitress came to take his order at the lunch in Wethersfield, he inquired about whether the flounder was fresh. It wasn't. He knew that about half the inventory was frozen, but took a chance and asked. (He ended up ordering fresh tilapia instead.) 
 ''Last Night at the Lobster'' is packed with such details as it meticulously chronicles the efforts of Manny DeLeon, the restaurant's manager, to get through the final day with some dignity. The novel contains nuanced portraits of the tensions between the workers, Manny's rueful confusion over an affair -- now over -- with a waitress and his profound sadness as his work of the past several years comes to an abrupt end. 
 The novel's most dramatic plot points include a vomiting toddler, a slashed leather jacket and a power failure as a snowstorm rages outside. ''It is a very quiet piece,'' Mr. O'Nan said. ''But I think it gets a lot of life into it, considering it's only 140 pages or so.''
 Writing in The Los Angeles Times, Susan Salter Reynolds described ''Lobster'' as ''a Zen koan of a book -- Manny's life in all its integrity echoing out across a wintry mall in a Rust Belt American town.'' In The New York Times Book Review, Nathaniel Rich wrote that ''it is an impressive achievement that Manny's misplaced affection for Red Lobster is not risible, but tragic.'' 
 Such praise has accompanied Mr. O'Nan throughout his career, which began with ''In the Walled City,'' a collection of stories published in 1993. His first novel, ''Snow Angels,'' was released a year later, and he has kept up a prolific pace, producing a book every year or two, including two works of nonfiction and two volumes he edited. ''Snow Angels'' has been made into a movie starring Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell, to be released early next year.
 Aside from ''Faithful,'' an account of the 2004 Boston Red Sox season that he wrote with Stephen King, a broad readership has eluded Mr. O'Nan, as has a loyal publisher. According to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of retail sales, none of his last three novels sold more than 6,000 copies in hardcover; and in the past 14 years he has worked with seven publishing houses.
 Part of the reason, Mr. O'Nan acknowledged, may be that he experiments with genre, form and tone. He has written thrillers, horror and historical fiction, and followed a novel of postmodern irony with straightforward realist fiction. ''No two consecutive books that I have worked on have been alike,'' he said.
 Jonathan Galassi, publisher of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which released Mr. O'Nan's last two novels, ''The Night Country'' and ''The Good Wife,'' said: ''He's a very uncompromising writer who expresses his particular vision of the world very straightforwardly. It wasn't easy for us to connect him with readers, that's all.''
 Farrar Straus turned down Mr. O'Nan's manuscript for ''Lobster.'' Publishing politics may also have played a role. Three years ago, when Mr. O'Nan was a judge on the fiction panel for the National Book Award, he told The New Yorker that Tom Wolfe had not been nominated for his novel ''I Am Charlotte Simmons'' because ''the guy's not a novelist.'' Mr. Wolfe is published by Farrar Straus, and Mr. O'Nan said he suspected his comments did not go down well. Mr. Galassi said that had nothing to do with the decision. ''I do think it was inappropriate for him to say that,'' Mr. Galassi added, but ''I don't need to be vindictive.''
 Mr. O'Nan's new publisher, Viking, hopes that with ''Lobster'' he will find a larger audience. ''This one is shorter, frankly,'' said Josh Kendall, Mr. O'Nan's editor, ''and the conceit of the novel with the political overtones of blue-collar downsizing felt apt and somewhat fresh.''
 Mr. O'Nan remains philosophical. ''You always want more readers for the book,'' he said. ''I don't think you can worry too much about that as you are writing.'' 
 The success of ''Faithful'' means that Mr. O'Nan can now make his living as a writer, although he still drives a 1995 metallic copper pearl (translation: orange) Mitsubishi Eclipse that rattles on the highway. Mr. O'Nan, who grew up in Pittsburgh, is the son of an engineer and an economics professor. He studied aerospace engineering at Boston University and became a structural engineer on Long Island. 
 While working, he took manuscripts to the office and set himself the goal of writing at least one sentence a day. After five years, his wife urged him to quit and take up writing full time. An M.F.A. in creative writing from Cornell followed. By 35, Mr. O'Nan had been named to Granta's list of Best Young American Novelists.
 ''Lobster'' was inspired by a local newspaper article about people who showed up at a Red Lobster in Torrington, Conn., after church one Sunday and discovered it had closed without notice. ''That little article made me think it was this loss of a little world and I just started daydreaming about it,'' Mr. O'Nan said.
 After lunch, a waiter delivered a brownie sundae to an elderly woman -- a ''cottonhead'' in the book -- and serenaded her with a surprisingly melodic rendition of ''Happy Birthday.'' ''That gets to the heart of it,'' Mr. O'Nan said. ''It's America. This is where folks live. There is nothing ironic or silly about it.''

HEADLINE: Yanks Give Twins Deadline on Santana

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

DATELINE: NASHVILLE, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
The Yankees insist that they want an answer from the Minnesota Twins by Monday night or they will back out of trade talks for the ace left-hander Johan Santana. The Yankees have offered Phil Hughes, Melky Cabrera and a midlevel prospect, and they believe that should be enough.
 ''This is not a bluff; it's just reality,'' the senior vice president Hank Steinbrenner said in a telephone interview Sunday night. ''It's a fact. The Yankees will not be used to jack up the price on people -- whether by agents or other teams -- ever again. That's over.'' 
 The Yankees told the Twins late Friday that they would include Hughes, the 21-year-old ace-in-waiting, but the Twins have not accepted the offer. They are lukewarm about Cabrera and would prefer Boston's Jacoby Ellsbury as their new center fielder, but the Red Sox will not trade Ellsbury and pitcher Jon Lester unless the Twins expand the deal, possibly to include closer Joe Nathan.
 That is unlikely, and it emboldens the Yankees' stance. If they back out and the Red Sox do not cave in to the Twins' demands, Minnesota will seem to have no trade partner, considering that Santana would require a contract extension of at least six years and $120 million to approve the deal.
 ''I don't want to continue this dog-and-pony show, playing us against the Red Sox,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I'm not going to participate in that. This is our best offer. Minnesota knows it's our best offer. Everybody knows it is.
 ''We need to get this done. If we don't, I certainly won't be upset about keeping Hughes and Cabrera. I definitely won't. I don't think Minnesota wants to be stuck negotiating with just one team.''
 The Yankees believe the Twins may keep Santana, something Minnesota has never discounted. The Twins traded last week for an impact hitter, outfielder Delmon Young, and they could hope he sparks their sluggish offense while Santana and a healthy Francisco Liriano lead a strong rotation.
 The Twins would risk losing Santana, who may block any midseason effort to deal him, but if he leaves as a free agent after 2008, they would get draft picks as compensation. Those can often prove to be valuable; when the Yankees lost reliever Tom Gordon after the 2005 season, they used their compensatory picks on pitchers Joba Chamberlain and Ian Kennedy.
 The Yankees have refused to part with Chamberlain in any deal, and the Twins wanted Hughes instead of Kennedy, whom the Yankees initially offered. The Oakland Athletics want Hughes and Kennedy for their All-Star starter, Dan Haren, an idea the Yankees would reject.
 Steinbrenner said the Twins and the Yankees had not haggled over the third player in their potential trade, because Minnesota had not accepted the premise of a deal centered on Hughes and Cabrera. But if the Twins asked for Kennedy or a comparable prospect -- a group that includes Dellin Betances, Alan Horne, Austin Jackson and Jose Tabata -- the Yankees would pass.
 ''How can I go any higher?'' Steinbrenner said. ''What do they want -- Hughes, Kennedy and Cabrera? I can't do that kind of thing. It's crazy. It's suicidal. In the past 20 or 30 years, teams have always asked more from the Yankees than they have of anybody else, and that's going to stop. I've made the best offer Minnesota is going to get, and the fact is, it's an offer we can go away happy and they can go away happy.''
 Even if they pull out of talks for Santana, the Yankees could still trade for him if the Twins come back to them. That is how it worked in the winter after the 2004 season, when the Yankees backed out of talks for Arizona's Randy Johnson, citing unrealistic trade demands, only to acquire him in January because the Diamondbacks had nowhere else to send him.
 The reason was simple economics. The Yankees were the only team with the resources to pay Johnson, who, like Santana, had approval over any deal. As frustrated as Steinbrenner is with the Twins, he remains very high on Santana.
 ''I do want Santana, and the fact is that this is their best offer,'' Steinbrenner said. ''I think it's probably the best offer they're going to get from anybody. I don't know what Boston's going to do, but that won't determine what I do.''

HEADLINE: Hospice Care: When the Dying Live On

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''In Hospice Care, Longer Lives Mean Money Lost'' (front page, Nov. 27) nicely captures the dilemma of hospice care providers trapped between their ethical obligations to care for dying patients and the economic reality of financial penalties for doing just that. 
 When the pecuniary disincentives are serious enough, a provider can find him or herself in an untenable situation, caught between competing goods, patient care and financial viability. 
 The use of economic tools to direct health care decisions at the bedside should ensure that the financial incentives are aligned with moral obligations. In this way, physicians caring for the most vulnerable at life's end can maintain a fiduciary relationship with their patients. 
 Elizabeth Nilson, M.D. New York, Nov. 27, 2007 The writer is an assistant professor of public health and medicine, Division of Medical Ethics, Weill Cornell Medical College.
 To the Editor:
 As your article points out, living and dying frequently don't follow an agreed-upon timeline. As a hospice and palliative care physician, I've always taken that to mean that we should find a way to provide excellent care whether it comes one day before death or 500 days before death. 
 Even as we refine our ability to prognosticate, it will never allow us to give a patient the unwelcome news that ''you have six months to live'' with anything that approaches certainty. And although the Medicare hospice benefit does not require such certainty, it may be interpreted that way by patients, families and even health care providers.
 We don't use prognostic information as a precondition for other types of medical care, and we should not for hospice care either. This does not mean we should ignore prognostic information. Rather, it should be one of many factors we consider as we work to ease the burden that serious illnesses place on patients and their families.
 Joshua Hauser, M.D. Chicago, Nov. 27, 2007 The writer is in the Palliative Care and Home Hospice Program at Northwestern University.
 To the Editor:
 Your article looks at one of the most complex regulatory issues confronting the hospice community. There is no simple solution to the hospice payment cap issue. There is one very simple point that must be emphasized: No person in need of hospice care should encounter unnecessary barriers to quality care at the end of life.
 The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recognizes the importance of hospice and has worked to increase awareness of the benefit and to encourage physicians to speak, in a timely manner, with their patients and their families about hospice. 
 The National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization has long argued that hospice programs doing the right thing by caring for eligible patients and families should not be financially penalized through the cap. 
 We have proposed a thorough study of the hospice cap that would help providers, regulators and legislators understand what is working, what is not and what the implications for alterations to this admittedly flawed mechanism would be. 
 J. Donald Schumacher President and Chief Executive National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization Alexandria, Va., Nov. 27, 2007
 To the Editor:
 You mention in your thoughtful review that some doctors may be diagnosing patients as terminal before it is their time to die. While it is certainly possible some physicians make this mistake, it seems more likely that with limited choice, hospice is simply the best care option for impoverished, terminal patients. 
 Given improved end-of-life care and high medical costs, the need for a bridge-to-hospice program is clear. Fining rural hospice programs to death may leave needy patients without essential care providers, and would likely result in patient transfers back to the dreaded and expensive hospital. 
 Research has shown that home hospice delivers higher quality of life alongside cost containment. Less intensive but adequate bridging programs would likely do the same.
 It would be prudent for Medicare officials to contemplate the consequences of their actions before eliminating important care for our nation's elderly. 
 Aaron Remenschneider Cambridge, Mass., Nov. 28, 2007 The writer is a medical student.

HEADLINE: Japan Urges China to Let Yuan Rise More Quickly

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Japanese finance minister, Fukushiro Nukaga, urged Chinese leaders at a meeting in Beijing to allow their currency to appreciate at a faster pace, joining calls from governments in Europe and the United States. 
 Mr. Nukaga and five other Japanese ministers met with Chinese officials, including Vice Premier Zeng Peiyan, on Saturday.
 ''I have asked China to consider letting the yuan rise at the fastest possible pace,'' the minister told reporters after the so-called High-Level Economic Dialogues. ''The Chinese side responded that it will deal with the issue with flexibility.''
 European officials visiting China last week said a stronger yuan would help tame the country's inflation, now running at its highest rate in a decade, and shrink the trade surplus. China's Premier Wen Jiabao said China would stick with a policy of ''gradualism.''
 Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers met in Washington in October and singled out China, saying it should make the yuan more flexible to help resolve global trade imbalances.
 The yuan has risen about 10 percent against the yen and 12 percent versus the dollar since China scrapped a peg to the United States currency in July 2005. The Chinese yuan, which is now linked to a basket of currencies, has fallen about 7 percent against the euro.
 Japan welcomed China's policy of ''improving flexibility of the Chinese currency,'' according to a joint statement released late Saturday in Beijing.
 The talks were organized last April.

HEADLINE: Southern California Ports Move to Curb Emissions From Shipping Industry

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The breeze coming off the Pacific ought to clean up the smoggy interior of Southern California. But it does just the opposite, picking up tons of shoreline air pollution from the tens of thousands of diesel engines on trucks and ships at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
 But the ports -- the neck of the funnel for American imports from Asia -- are embarking on a multibillion-dollar program being watched all over the world to repair, replace or clean up engines. 
 Through the program, California is extending its official reach into shipping, one of the hardest-to-regulate industries, in hopes of reducing the pollution that local officials say causes stunted lung development in children, lost workdays and chronic lung diseases in adults, and aggravation of an epidemic of asthma. The shipping industry, with few alternatives, appears ready to cooperate.
 ''We're not going to have kids in Long Beach contract asthma so someone in Kansas can get a cheaper television set,'' said Bob Foster, the mayor of Long Beach. 
 Beginning next Sept. 30, the adjacent ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles will bar any truck built before 1989, and by 2012, any truck built before 2007. The ports are magnets for older trucks, sold off by major carriers as they become unreliable, that ply routes of just a few miles between the docks and distribution centers. The port is served by about 16,000 trucks, mostly owned by their drivers, 2,000 to 3,000 of them built before 1989, the year antipollution equipment first began to appear on trucks. 
 More ambitious yet, the ports plan to ''cold iron'' ships in the harbor, requiring on some ships the on-board power generation equipment to be shut down, and supplying them instead from the shore-side power grid. 
 At the Long Beach port, BP is preparing to plug in a ''6,000-volt extension cord'' to feed incoming tankers, each of which uses as much electricity to unload its cargo as it takes to run half a dozen shopping centers for the same length of time. On the Los Angeles side, several container ships are already powered from shore sources.
 This is an expensive alternative; the port of Long Beach has spent $15 million to electrify a single dock, and estimates are that wiring a ship to accept shore-side power costs more than $1 million. Los Angeles says it is wiring its berths for about $3 million each. Ports in Europe and elsewhere are considering doing the same because ships burn relatively dirty diesel fuel in port, and in many places are the last uncontrolled major pollution sources. 
 ''There's been a clear message from the communities and the City Council saying, 'you guys can't grow until you've addressed the air pollution,''' said Art Wong, a spokesman for the port of Long Beach. ''So we can grow, but we grow green.''
 Mr. Wong said the port had plans for about $2 billion in expansions that have been blocked because of air pollution limits, and the Port of Los Angeles had even more.
 James J. Corbett, an associate professor at the University of Delaware College of Marine and Earth Studies, said that pollution from ships -- in port or offshore -- was a significant cause of lung disease. Ports like Los Angeles and Long Beach cannot regulate ships at sea, he said, but ''this is a step within the power, technically, economically and jurisdictionally, of the ports themselves.'' 
 The California Air Resources Board is scheduled to vote in early December on regulations modeled after the ones here that would cover the whole state.
 But the devil is in the details. Some skeptics say the shore-based utilities will not be able to deliver enough electricity on days of peak demand. And the trucking part of the program is complicated. The two ports have agreed to ban old trucks, and plan to vote soon to impose extra fees on incoming containers -- perhaps $30 or $40 a container for 5 to 10 years -- to raise $1.5 billion to $2 billion. But they have not agreed on how to subsidize the truckers, mostly small operators, or assure that the new trucks stay at the port or that the old ones are actually retired.
 S. David Freeman, chairman of the Los Angeles Harbor Commission, said the next step ''is raising the money to help the small guys adjust and go from dirty to cleaner.''
 Mr. Freeman said the Los Angeles port was also working on battery-powered trucks and other low-pollution innovations.
 Thomas Bonilla is an owner-operator whose 1988 Peterbilt truck embodies all the problems, pitfalls and promises in the program.
 It has just over 30,000 miles on the odometer, but only because it has rolled over; the actual mileage is 1,030,000, Mr. Bonilla said. ''If I keep it well, it will go, probably, forever,'' he said.
 Mr. Bonilla, one of the many owner-operators who work the ports, paid about $16,000 for his truck when he bought it three years ago, and put another $8,000 into it: $1,200 for new fuel tanks, for instance, and $1,800 for a paint job. 
 ''I understand about the pollution,'' he said. But a new truck would cost $120,000 to $140,000, which he said he did not have, and many of the new trucks burn more fuel than older ones. 
 Mr. Bonilla, towing a 20-foot bright red container for Hamburg Sud, the shipping company, said he did not know what he would do after the ban is imposed next fall. He said he might look for a different line of work, but in any case, the truck ''will be working somewhere else,'' in all probability still in Southern California, polluting the same air.

HEADLINE: In Macho Argentina, a New Beacon for Gay Tourists

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Vinod Sreeharsha contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BUENOS AIRES 

 BODY:
Home to the sexy tango and strapping meat-eaters, this South American capital has long been thought of as a bastion of macho attitudes. But a new hotel here is adding to the city's growing image as a bastion of gay-friendliness.
 The Axel Hotel, a Spanish import that opened in November, has come to symbolize Buenos Aires's increasingly aggressive effort to court gay dollars and euros. It is Latin America's first luxury hotel built exclusively with gay customers in mind. 
 That Buenos Aires would be chosen for such a marketing experiment is a result of a marked change over the past several years in the acceptance of gay men and lesbians in Argentine society. This city of three million people has come a long way from the years of military dictatorship, when being openly gay could lead to jail. Five years ago this was the first major Latin American city to legalize same-sex unions, and this summer it was host to a World Cup for gay soccer players, a first in the region.
 ''There is so much more freedom these days,'' said Mauricio Urbides, a 28-year-old fashion designer, who sipped red wine with two male friends at the hotel recently. ''You see gays on television here, in government. Just 15 years ago it was a completely different situation.''
 The three friends were among a mixed crowd of homosexuals and heterosexuals who laughed as Kyra and Sharon, drag queens from Barcelona, Spain, poked fun at Argentina's president-elect, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, and sang a Marilyn Monroe-inspired ''Happy Birthday to You'' to a male guest.
 In other parts of the world, like the Castro district in San Francisco, gay people have struggled recently to maintain a cultural presence in the face of gentrification. Buenos Aires has no traditional gay neighborhood, but acceptance of gay people has slowly grown. The first gay bar here opened in 1983. In 1992 President Carlos Menem signed a decree promising equal legal protection for gay men and women.
 Argentine social mores began loosening in the 1990s, when the pegging of the peso to the dollar gave Argentines more spending power, allowing many to travel abroad. ''People traveled and found there were other ways of living that were completely different than what they were used to,'' Mr. Urbides said.
 After Argentina plunged into economic chaos in late 2001, discrimination based on sexual orientation seemed to many like a petty concern. ''When people are eating out of garbage cans it really doesn't matter if you are gay or not,'' said Osvaldo Bazan, a journalist and the author of ''History of Homosexuality in Argentina From the Conquest of America to the 21st Century.'' 
 The devalued currency made Buenos Aires a relative bargain for Western tourists, including many who are gay and like the city's European sophistication. In recent years marketers have more aggressively sought to promote the city as a gay tourist destination. Gay tango bars and wine shops have sprouted up, and a new ''friendly card'' helps travelers and local residents alike to get discounts at gay-friendly shops and restaurants.
 Travel industry experts estimate that about 20 percent of the tourists here are gay -- 300,000 a year -- and they spend $600 million here annually.
 Even as tourism has been flourishing, so, too, has local gay activism. It was young gay rights advocates who successfully pushed to legalize same-sex unions, despite resistance from the Roman Catholic Church. At the end of November the lower house of Congress in Uruguay, Argentina's neighbor, legalized homosexual unions there, too. If the Senate approves the law, Uruguay would be one of only six countries with such a law. Advocates in Argentina, meanwhile, are pushing Congress to extend health benefits to gay couples.
 Argentina's more liberal treatment of sexual orientation on television has also stoked acceptance. Florencia de la Vega, who is transsexual, made a splash when she played a transvestite in the 2004 soap opera ''Los Roldan.'' In 2005 the dating show ''12 Corazones -- Especial'' featured gay men who kissed on camera.
 Yet some visitors still complain of homophobic treatment, said Marcelo Suntheim, secretary of the Community of Homosexuals in Argentina, an activist group. He said the group received three complaints this year from gay couples who said hotel concierges in Buenos Aires ''asked them not to kiss in the lobby because children were present.''
 So some local residents say they hope that the Axel will offer another place where same-sex couples can feel more comfortable. The hotel, which has billed itself as ''hetero-friendly,'' is the second gay-themed hotel to be built by Juan Julia, an entrepreneur from Barcelona, where the first Axel opened three years ago. 
 The 48-room Axel promotes itself as a place for fun, complete with a glass-bottomed rooftop pool, and free condoms. ''We provide everything for you to have fun,'' Mr. Julia said. ''Be safe, but have fun.''
 He said he hoped the hotel became popular not only with tourists, but also with local Argentines who would see it as a place to socialize. 
 ''The majority of the gay community is looking more and more for hetero-friendly places,'' instead of exclusively gay places, said Luciano Fus, a 29-year-old translator who watched the drag queen show. ''But this will be another after-work spot.''
 Mr. Urbides said he would ''definitely come back.'' He smiled. ''Especially if the hotel brings Madonna back to Buenos Aires, or better yet, if it brings Cher here.''

HEADLINE: Innovating Our Way to Financial Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The financial crisis that began late last summer, then took a brief vacation in September and October, is back with a vengeance.
 How bad is it? Well, I've never seen financial insiders this spooked -- not even during the Asian crisis of 1997-98, when economic dominoes seemed to be falling all around the world. 
 This time, market players seem truly horrified -- because they've suddenly realized that they don't understand the complex financial system they created. 
 Before I get to that, however, let's talk about what's happening right now.
 Credit -- lending between market players -- is to the financial markets what motor oil is to car engines. The ability to raise cash on short notice, which is what people mean when they talk about ''liquidity,'' is an essential lubricant for the markets, and for the economy as a whole.
 But liquidity has been drying up. Some credit markets have effectively closed up shop. Interest rates in other markets -- like the London market, in which banks lend to each other -- have risen even as interest rates on U.S. government debt, which is still considered safe, have plunged. 
 ''What we are witnessing,'' says Bill Gross of the bond manager Pimco, ''is essentially the breakdown of our modern-day banking system, a complex of leveraged lending so hard to understand that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke required a face-to-face refresher course from hedge fund managers in mid-August.''
 The freezing up of the financial markets will, if it goes on much longer, lead to a severe reduction in overall lending, causing business investment to go the way of home construction -- and that will mean a recession, possibly a nasty one.
 Behind the disappearance of liquidity lies a collapse of trust: market players don't want to lend to each other, because they're not sure they'll be repaid.
 In a direct sense, this collapse of trust has been caused by the bursting of the housing bubble. The run-up of home prices made even less sense than the dot-com bubble -- I mean, there wasn't even a glamorous new technology to justify claims that old rules no longer applied -- but somehow financial markets accepted crazy home prices as the new normal. And when the bubble burst, a lot of investments that were labeled AAA turned out to be junk. 
 Thus, ''super-senior'' claims against subprime mortgages -- that is, investments that have first dibs on whatever mortgage payments borrowers make, and were therefore supposed to pay off in full even if a sizable fraction of these borrowers defaulted on their debts -- have lost a third of their market value since July.
 But what has really undermined trust is the fact that nobody knows where the financial toxic waste is buried. Citigroup wasn't supposed to have tens of billions of dollars in subprime exposure; it did. Florida's Local Government Investment Pool, which acts as a bank for the state's school districts, was supposed to be risk-free; it wasn't (and now schools don't have the money to pay teachers).
 How did things get so opaque? The answer is ''financial innovation'' -- two words that should, from now on, strike fear into investors' hearts.
 O.K., to be fair, some kinds of financial innovation are good. I don't want to go back to the days when checking accounts didn't pay interest and you couldn't withdraw cash on weekends. 
 But the innovations of recent years -- the alphabet soup of C.D.O.'s and S.I.V.'s, R.M.B.S. and A.B.C.P. -- were sold on false pretenses. They were promoted as ways to spread risk, making investment safer. What they did instead -- aside from making their creators a lot of money, which they didn't have to repay when it all went bust -- was to spread confusion, luring investors into taking on more risk than they realized.
 Why was this allowed to happen? At a deep level, I believe that the problem was ideological: policy makers, committed to the view that the market is always right, simply ignored the warning signs. We know, in particular, that Alan Greenspan brushed aside warnings from Edward Gramlich, who was a member of the Federal Reserve Board, about a potential subprime crisis.
 And free-market orthodoxy dies hard. Just a few weeks ago Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, admitted to Fortune magazine that financial innovation got ahead of regulation -- but added, ''I don't think we'd want it the other way around.'' Is that your final answer, Mr. Secretary?
 Now, Mr. Paulson's new proposal to help borrowers renegotiate their mortgage payments and avoid foreclosure sounds in principle like a good idea (although we have yet to hear any details). Realistically, however, it won't make more than a small dent in the subprime problem.
 The bottom line is that policy makers left the financial industry free to innovate -- and what it did was to innovate itself, and the rest of us, into a big, nasty mess.

HEADLINE: OPEC's Tough Call: Raise or Hold Oil Supply

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
After a year of dizzying gains for energy markets, a rapid fall in oil prices lately is posing a dilemma for OPEC, the oil-producing cartel.
 Should OPEC make industrialized countries happy by increasing the oil supply, a move that would probably send prices down further? Or should it keep production at a steady level at a time of economic turbulence, when demand could easily taper off? 
 As they prepare to meet in Abu Dhabi this week to set output levels for the winter, officials from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are mindful of the many uncertainties that complicate their task. Oil prices flirted with $100 a barrel just two weeks ago, but fears of slowing economic growth have since pushed them down by more than 10 percent. Oil futures settled at $88.71 a barrel, down $2.30, on Friday, after their steepest weekly decline in more than two years.
 This year, as the oil markets have grown more volatile and unpredictable, OPEC officials and energy analysts have noted an increasing disconnection between the price and supply of oil. They attribute the large price swings more to financial speculation than to market fundamentals, and say that the price surge in recent months seemed increasingly at odds with the outlook for the United States economy. 
 ''There is absolutely ample supply,'' Ali al-Naimi, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said Friday at an energy conference in Singapore. ''The price movement has nothing to do with the fundamentals of the market.''
 Saudi Arabia, the cartel's de facto leader, is wary of increasing supplies this winter. At the conference, Mr. Naimi repeated his view that there was a ''mismatch'' between today's high prices and oil supplies. ''Anyone that tells you otherwise is wrong,'' he said.
 OPEC members are worried that today's sky-high prices have the potential to reduce consumption. But the members are also unsure whether they need to raise their output, since doing so at a time when the economy slows might hasten a sharp price drop, which is what producers fear most.
 ''The economic situation has finally dawned on the energy markets,'' said John Kilduff, an energy analyst at MF Global, a brokerage of exchange-traded futures and options. ''OPEC is right to be concerned about falling into a production trap if they respond too aggressively.''
 One option that will be discussed at Wednesday's meeting is a possible increase of 500,000 barrels a day in the group's overall output, which now stands at about 30.6 million barrels a day. Some OPEC members, including Nigeria, have voiced support for such a move, but Saudi Arabia would probably not back it.
 ''It's a very fine line they are trying to tread,'' said David Kirsch, an analyst at PFC Energy, a consulting firm in Washington. ''They really have to be concerned about the downside risks to the market. The big fall in prices really took a big production increase off the table. It confirmed that the fundamentals do not support high prices.''
 Yet OPEC could still be forced to act, particularly if oil prices rebounded sharply in the days ahead of the meeting. Among the wild cards are renewed tensions in Northern Iraq between Turkey and Kurdish separatists, and Iran's tough stance on its nuclear program.
 As a group, OPEC's 13 members account for 40 percent of the world's daily oil exports, making them the only producers capable of raising their output in a meaningful manner. Together, they now have about 2.5 million barrels a day of spare capacity, according to analyst estimates, mostly in Saudi Arabia. This gives the Saudi kingdom, the world's top oil exporter, the most clout to set the tone within OPEC.
 Some OPEC insiders are particularly concerned about the risks associated with slowing demand next year, especially following the credit and housing market crisis in the United States, which consumes roughly a quarter of the world's oil. Globally, oil demand is expected to grow between 1.5 million and 2 million barrels a day next year. 
 At the same time, new supplies are slowly making their way on the market. New oil and natural-gas liquid production from OPEC nations could reach 2 million barrels a day next year, and another 1.1 million barrels a day are expected to come from non-OPEC sources, like Russia or Norway, according to estimates by Deutsche Bank. Some OPEC specialists say these factors could substantially alter the balance between supply and demand after years of market tightness.
 At a recent meeting in Riyadh, OPEC leaders cited a variety of reasons for the spike in oil prices. Those included a weak dollar, refining shortfalls in the United States, runaway demand in Asia and speculative investments in commodities.
 Abdalla Salem el-Badri, OPEC's secretary general, said that oil producers were not happy with current prices because they might lead to lower demand in the long term.
 ''We know what high oil prices mean for us,'' Mr. Badri said in a recent interview. ''We really have no interest in high oil prices. And we really have no interest in low oil prices. We want stable prices.''
 But he indicated that OPEC was not in a rush to increase supplies until bottlenecks in the refining industry, especially in the United States, were resolved.
 ''We will add more oil if we know oil will go to the refineries, but we won't add if they go to commercial stocks,'' Mr. Badri said, referring to longer-term inventories of oil.
 The meeting last month in Riyadh among OPEC's heads of states also highlighted new signs of tension within the organization. Some countries, led by traditional price hawks like Iran and Venezuela, said they considered current price levels as fair. They criticized the dollar's weakness and suggested that OPEC should uncouple the price of oil from the United States dollar.
 The weakening value of the dollar, which erodes the purchasing power of oil producers, means that OPEC has fewer incentives to seek lower oil prices. On Friday, the euro was at $1.4677 after touching $1.4967 recently, the unified European currency's strongest level since its debut in 1999.
 ''A weaker dollar means that OPEC is likely to be more aggressive in its pursuit of higher rather than lower prices,'' Frederic Lasserre, the head of commodity research at Societe Generale in Paris, said in a recent report.
 Industrialized nations would like to see OPEC increase its output. Nobuo Tanaka, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, which represents 26 oil-consuming nations, said, ''The current price level is sending a message to producers: We would wish for some additional barrels sooner rather than later.''
 Since 2000, OPEC's policy has been to fine-tune its supplies to align closely with oil demand but without allowing oil companies and refiners to build too many oil inventories. That policy of careful management has helped the cartel raise prices following the oil collapse of the late 1990s.
 But the policy isn't foolproof. The last time OPEC tried to act to push prices down, it had little impact. After its last meeting, in September, OPEC members agreed to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day. That measure failed to curb prices. 
 ''The high level of disagreement and potential tension shown at the previous output discussions in September suggests that there is absolutely nothing cut-and-dried about the forthcoming negotiations,'' Barclays Capital said in a research note last week.

HEADLINE: Suspected of Fixing, Davydenko Is Also in Need of Repair

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON. 
E-mail: hjaraton@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Portland, Ore. 

 BODY:
 The sport of professional tennis is elusive as water, forever on the move to the next tour stop, playing seasons flowing like a river from one state through another. How, exactly, do you police what you can't pin down?
 Take the now notorious, although possibly by happenstance, Nikolay Davydenko. Born 1981 in Severodonezk, Ukraine, he moved to Volgograd, Russia, to live and train with an older brother at age 11, then to Germany at 15 to reap the commercial benefits of the West. He was granted Russian citizenship at 18 and now, at 26, he lists the tax haven Monte Carlo as his permanent residence. 
 Where will he go now that his nightmare season has ended or, in de facto tennis time, gone dark for December? Not Disney World.
 ''It is a relief for me that the season's over and that I remained fourth in the rankings,'' Davydenko said Saturday at Memorial Coliseum, ''and I'm not going to hear anything from the press in all of December because I'll be in Thailand, where they can't get at me.''
 Conversely, investigators from the Association of Tennis Professionals will reportedly be combing through Davydenko's telephone records for connections to organized crime in the aftermath of online betting irregularities related to a match he retired from in the third set against 87th-ranked Martin Vassallo Arguello last summer in Sopot, Poland.
 ''Well, in point of fact, it's lawyers and managers who are handling this, so it's their affair,'' Davydenko said, preferring to remain the inconspicuous tour grinder, a Pac-Man on the prowl for computer points, but for now still the center of a storm blowing through the sport. 
 The flag-waving version of men's tennis dropped into the great and gray Northwest for a few days, left with a deserving new Davis Cup champion (the United States) but still enshrouded by the Davydenko fog and recent admissions by some men's players that they had been contacted by people attempting to fix their matches.
 The Russians didn't help themselves or the sport by benching Davydenko, the highest-ranked tour player on either team here for the first, and only, day of meaningful singles competition. 
 The Russian coach, Shamil Tarpischev, had his reasons. Statistically Davydenko was a combined 0-11 against Andy Roddick and James Blake; logically, with the exception of his semifinal run at the United States Open, Davydenko has played like a burnout case since the controversy erupted.
 But the strategy unfolded badly when Davydenko's replacement, Dmitry Tursunov, failed to take a set from Roddick. An air of inevitability enveloped the final -- not a good thing for a sport trying to abort the gestation of belief that the competition might occasionally be rigged. 
 ''The result depends a lot on where you're playing,'' Tarpischev said. ''And so if the draw falls to a team that's playing good on the harder surfaces, then the U.S. has a very good chance.''
 This unwitting indictment of the Davis Cup format (how about a uniform surface?) also raised the question of why Tarpischev didn't invite the admittedly enigmatic Marat Safin, the winner of two Grand Slam tournaments on the faster hard courts.
 Tarpischev instead went with players who prefer clay, tossed Davydenko into Saturday's doubles match against the world's best, Mike and Bob Bryan, where he looked lost and forlorn, a worldwide outcast and Davis Cup reject in the company of his countrymen.
 Why wouldn't he be depressed after being hounded on tour this fall, fined $2,000 (later rescinded) for not trying hard enough in a loss in St. Petersburg, Russia, of all places, and cautioned by a chair umpire to fix a serve in disrepair while being trounced by Marcos Baghdatis in Paris?
 Is it possible that the amalgam of tennis governing bodies wouldn't be devastated if the ATP investigation implicated Davydenko enough for him to be made an example of? His ranking notwithstanding, he was not exactly a household name before last summer. He is no Grand Slam draw.
 We also know how little sympathy the sporting West can have (see figure skating, 2002 Winter Olympics) when dealing with Russians. Was the German Tommy Haas the victim of a stomach virus or something more sinister when he was stricken on the last day of the Davis Cup semifinals in Moscow last September and had to pull out? The Germans accused the Russians of poisoning Haas, K.G.B.-style, but the accusations, investigated by the International Tennis Federation, were unproved.
 The sport operates in an expanded and increasingly complex environment, new stars emerging from Eastern Europe, countries with developing economies, and where the potential for underworld growth parallels free-market expansion.
 ''It's true, we are dealing with less-sophisticated areas of the world, and in that context it makes this more difficult,'' said Arlen Kantarian, the chief executive of the United States Tennis Association. ''But this issue at the end of the day is not Western or Eastern, it's about honesty and integrity, and it's worldwide.''
 Next stop, the Australian Open in January. ''We'll see what comes next,'' an ever-mobile Davydenko said on his way to seeking respite and refuge in Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: Nevada Learns to Cash In on Sales of Federal Land

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY and GRIFFIN PALMER. 
Jesse McKinley reported from Las Vegas, and Griffin Palmer from New York.

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS 

 BODY:
When it opens in 2009, the Clark County Shooting Park will be something to behold, through a scope or otherwise: hundreds of acres devoted to all things gun and bow, complete with a rifle range, a skeet center and an R.V. ''host area.''
 The coming Craig Ranch Regional Park, due in 2010, should be impressive too, with plans calling for an amphitheater, an aquatics center and sand volleyball courts, all wound around native gardens and wetlands. 
 Much of the financing for the projects has not come from familiar sources, like local taxes, bond issues or private donations. Instead, they are being paid for through the sales of public lands owned by the federal government.
 Tens of thousands of acres of federal lands in the Las Vegas area have been sold under an unusual law pushed through Congress nearly a decade ago by the Nevada delegation. The sales have grossed nearly $3 billion and counting. 
 Because of a stipulation created by the Nevada legislators, the money has not been deposited into the general federal Treasury, but rather put in a special Treasury account to be spent almost exclusively in Nevada on a something-for-everyone collection of projects. 
 The money has bought environmentally sensitive land and paid for conservation projects, a central purpose of the law and its amendments, as well as improvements in national recreation and refuge areas. But it has also been allocated to such nuts-and-bolts governmental services as education and water projects, and a variety of local perks, including boat ramps, nature trails and community parks complete with tennis courts, dog runs and barbecue pits. 
 Supporters say the law, which authorized competitive auctions, has been a godsend for a region dealing with rampant population growth, limited room to grow, scarce water and facilities overwhelmed by their own popularity. But critics see it as having created a limitless federal bank account that has encouraged and subsidized unbridled growth at the expense of taxpayers from the 49 other states, all while Nevada continues to draw new residents as a low-tax state disinclined to pay for such projects itself.
 Even some ardent fans of the law say the infusion of cash has led to overreaching on the part of some municipalities in Clark County, the mother ship for three growing cities: Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Henderson.
 ''We've gotten a bit greedy,'' said Michael L. Montandon, the mayor of North Las Vegas, which has had $176 million worth of projects approved, including $85.3 million for Craig Ranch. ''When your neighboring cities are asking for five times what you are, it tends to make your staff run around looking for projects.''
 To gauge the law's impact since its passage in 1998, The New York Times analyzed data from the United States Bureau of Land Management, the landlord for the federally owned lands. The analysis covered the more than 29,000 acres sold under the law as of Nov. 1, as well as the $2.3 billion in expenditures allocated to projects as of Aug. 31 by the Department of the Interior, which oversees distribution of the money. 
 The examination found the following:
 More than $1 billion in proceeds from the federal land sales have been allocated for parks, trails and nature areas that often amount to public amenities -- many of which elected officials say they would not have been able to pay for otherwise. The projects have enhanced property values, and benefited big-name developers, including Focus Property Group, the American Nevada Company, the Del Webb Corporation and the Olympia Development Group, all of which have bought large parcels of arid public lands and turned them into elaborate housing tracts.
 Nevada's schools, which have long sought more money from state lawmakers who resisted raising taxes as enrollment mushroomed, have received $150 million from the sale of the federal lands. The interest on that money has paid for expenses including teachers' salaries, utility bills and textbooks, which in other states would usually be underwritten by local property taxes. 
 The 1998 law uses the same legal framework as a 1920s land act under which the Clark County School District has bought some 685 acres through noncompetitive direct sales for an average of $10 an acre since 2004 to provide land for public schools.
 The Southern Nevada Water Authority, the agency that has long provided cheap water to the valley's two million residents, has received $285 million from the federal land sales, which it has used on a variety of water treatment, testing and transport projects, including facilities at drought-plagued Lake Mead. Plans for revenue from future land sales, water officials say, could include work on a pipeline to import water from 250 miles away.
 The acquisition and protection of environmentally sensitive land in private hands was a central element of the law's purpose, but allocations for those purchases have accounted for only about 15 percent ($346.1 million) of the $2.3 billion in approved spending. Moreover, there has been a net loss of protected land: thus far, some 34,468 acres of public land have been sold or exchanged, while a little more than 20,000 acres of environmentally sensitive land have been bought, though federal officials say other big deals are pending. 
 Spending on conservation projects, a focus of an amendment to the law in 2002, has also lagged behind other construction-heavy categories. Some $180 million has been allocated for continuing projects like programs to fight litter and dumping, studies of off-road vehicle and water strategies, and wild horse and burro management. 
 Still, some expenditures designated as conservation have been so broadly defined that they resemble traditional pork. Among them are a mobile fire education trailer ($132,000), an interagency Web site ($269,000), and several plans devoted to safety programs for the region's abandoned mines ($3 million).
 Millions of dollars from the sale of federal lands has been set aside to meet federal requirements -- typically the responsibility of local governments -- to offset environmental damage from the city's sprawling growth. Under the act, $53 million has been allocated to help communities in Clark County and the Nevada Department of Transportation to conform with requirements of the Endangered Species Act when development encroaches on native habitats. 
 Critics argue that the sales help pay for the infrastructure that then supports more expansion.
 ''Fundamentally, we're talking about selling public lands which belong to all Americans and giving the proceeds back to local counties for what would ostensibly be conservation projects,'' said Myke Bybee, public lands representative for the Sierra Club in Washington. ''But those projects,'' Mr. Bybee said, are not always ''in keeping with conservation.'' 
 That said, in Nevada the law is widely seen by Republicans and Democrats alike as paying off for most everyone at the table, a rarity in a gambling town. Among the winners are developers -- who now have access to lands long deemed off-limits -- and municipalities, which have added dozens of new recreational amenities, thousands of new residents to tax rolls, and improved the quality of life, all without raising taxes.
 ''This bill has been across the board incredible for the entire state, for quality of life, for economic development, for managing growth,'' said Senator John Ensign, a Republican, who was the bill's author while serving in the House of Representatives. ''And for doing things to make Nevada a better place.''
 The law's original boundary for eligible federal land sales was expanded by Congress in 2002, and some groups, including the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, are lobbying to expand it even farther. The allowable area has grown by about 40 percent, or 22,000 acres more than the original 52,000 approved by Congress.
 Spreading the Wealth
 More and more local officials now want a piece of the land pie. In recent years, Congress has authorized the sale of up to 135,000 acres of public land in White Pine and Lincoln Counties in eastern Nevada. Another later law was enacted in 2000 that requires 80 percent of proceeds from federal land sales be spent in the states where the land is located. And there are similar proposals in other Western states, including land hand-overs to localities in central Idaho and land sales in Washington County, Utah, another fast-growing desert area.
 Moreover, local authorities are getting ever bolder in using the proceeds from the federal land sales for expenses not traditionally covered by money from federal taxpayers. More recent bills, authorizing the sales in eastern Nevada, funnel 10 percent of federal proceeds back into law enforcement, fire protection and transportation, traditionally the bailiwick of local governments.
 Efforts to redirect at least some of the proceeds from the sales of federal lands into the general federal Treasury have repeatedly been beaten back by the politically connected Nevada delegation, which is now headed by the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, a Democrat. In recent years, the Bush administration twice failed in efforts to take back some of the payout for the Treasury.
 In many ways the law, formally known as the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998, has created a new model for managing much of the federally owned land in the West, which encompasses more than 80 percent of the state of Nevada and huge chunks of Utah, Idaho, Wyoming, Arizona, California and Oregon. That model provides a faster way of moving public lands into private hands, and encouraging growth into inhospitable places, in this case, the Mojave Desert. 
 That local and federal governments work together on such deals is remarkable considering the historic tension between federally owned public lands and the all-American desire for private property. The centuries-old debate has resonated from the high-mindedness of Manifest Destiny's westward push in the early 1800s to the frenzied scramble of Civil-War-era homesteaders to the defiance of the Sagebrush Rebellion of the 1970s and '80s, in which ranchers and local officials in the West wanted federal lands transferred to local governments or sold to private owners. 
 In each case, the central question has been what exactly do America's national lands represent: Are they expendable, tradeable, and now, salable resources meant to be made private for the sake of progress and individual gain? Or are they public treasures to be protected at all costs, even when they are essentially arid wastelands? 
 In the Las Vegas area, the answer has increasingly been to sell. The first of a wave of omnibus lands bills passed by a Republican-led Congress, the Nevada law of 1998 was viewed as a pragmatic compromise by environmental groups eager to guarantee the purchase and exchange of fragile habitat.
 Subsequent laws affecting other parts of Nevada -- which brought environmental groups, land owners and others into negotiations -- have coupled land sales with the designation of hundreds of thousands of acres as wilderness. Those wilderness designations, which ban development, were trumpeted by local lawmakers and welcomed even by those who worried about land sales. 
 ''We had a decision to make: Do we pursue this opportunity to protect these special places or do we not?'' said Jeremy Garncarz, the associate director of wilderness support at the Wilderness Society. ''And we made the decision to pursue the opportunity to protect these places.''
 But as the 1998 law has played out, some of its early supporters among environmentalists have also soured on it. The Office of Management and Budget, an arm of the White House, assessed the program in 2004 and said that while it had been ''fairly well run,'' its revenues were ''increasingly being dedicated to low-priority activities.'' 
 Original Intent
 ''The original concept was to allow private, environmentally sensitive land to be bought more readily,'' Jeff Van Ee, a longtime Nevada environmentalist who helped lawmakers draw up the law. ''But over the years, what we've seen is the money going all over the place, and too much money going to projects that should be funded through more conventional means.''
 Sales at auction have accounted for the vast majority of the law's proceeds, with more than $2.7 billion in sales from 13,000 acres, much of it situated on the edge of cities and primed for development. In a federal-local dance officially known as joint selection, municipalities nominate land for sale once they have determined their infrastructure can support them, said Steve Tryon, assistant field manager for the Las Vegas office of the Bureau of Land Management.
 ''The cities of Las Vegas and North Las Vegas and Henderson are kind of driving the show,'' he said of the selection process, also mentioning that Clark County was very active.
 Mr. Tryon said the 1998 law had increased the use of sales provisions in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976, resulting in more than 14,000 acres sold via direct sale to developers, localities and individuals who owned property adjacent to federal lands. Those sales grossed only a small fraction of the auction sales, bringing in only $114 million.
 Nevada lawmakers say it is unfair to view expenditures under the law as a raid on the federal Treasury since the federal government is the largest landowner in Nevada and should be expected to contribute to the state's economic well-being, just as big private land owners do in other states. 
 Senator Reid also said that the improvements, including the money spent on parks, trails and natural areas, were on facilities that the general public could use. ''All the money is used on public land,'' he said. ''It doesn't go onto the Las Vegas Strip.''
 Before the 1998 public lands law, the government often converted land to private hands through land exchanges. The deals were regularly criticized by lawmakers and taxpayers, who thought the government gave too much, and wilderness lovers, who thought they got too little. 
 Land sales, through acts like the 1980 Santini-Burton Act (which sold small tracts of Las Vegas-area land to finance land purchases in the Tahoe basin), were also laborious and the take often meager. A report in September 2001 by the General Accounting Office found that the Bureau of Land Management had sold 79,000 acres between 1991 and 2000 and received just $3 million. 
 Under the 1998 act, the sales have grossed nearly 1,000 times that figure in the same amount of time -- with less than half as much land. One reason is timing: the auctions began just as the Las Vegas real estate market heated up. 
 The proceeds took the law's architects by surprise. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 1998 that the sales would gross some $350 million over seven years. But developers spent more than twice that on a single day in November 2005, when 2,887 acres brought a record $783 million in bids. The majority of auction offerings have been parcels of 10 acres or less. But by 2002, a few large swaths of public lands, more than 100 acres each, were starting to attract bids. At auctions in 2004 and 2005, three bidders bought a combined 10 square miles of land for $1.7 billion for master-planned communities. These developments, often with tens of thousands of units, effectively convert desert into suburbia, complete with parks, artificial lakes, and preternaturally green golf courses. 
 One of those master builders is John Ritter, chief executive of Focus Property Group, who called the act ''a tremendous success,'' adding that the fact that sale proceeds would be spent near the communities his company built was an added bonus. 
 ''It's a well-thought-out way to release land,'' said Mr. Ritter, whose company paid $557 million for 1,940 acres at an auction in 2004. 
 Boat Ramps and Toilets
 As quick as money flowed in to the special account, it flowed out. All spending requires authorization by the secretary of the interior from money held in an interest-bearing account, with recommendations from a four-member committee representing four major agencies that receive money from the act, the National Park Service, the United States Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
 Purchases receiving a green light have included a handsome array of land considered environmentally sensitive, which can be recommended by any interested group in the state, including nonprofit organizations and private landholders.
 Among the highlights are the planned purchase of Incline Lake near Lake Tahoe, an $83 million project headed by the United States Forest Service, which plans to open it to the public. 
 But other approved projects read like a Christmas list drafted in Carson City, the state capital: $50.3 million for erosion control and fire prevention programs at Lake Tahoe; $28.8 million in improvements to the picturesque and increasingly popular Red Rock Canyon conservation area; $49.4 million for trails and other amenities at the Springs Preserve, a new environmentally friendly tourist attraction in downtown Las Vegas; and $495,900 for 30 ''premier'' toilets, complete with ''flush technology and solar lighting'' at nearby Lake Mead. 
 This summer, ground was also broken on a tract of low-cost housing in southern Las Vegas, land sold to nonprofit developers at 5 percent of its appraised value.
 More than $400 million has also been allocated for building projects on federal lands for the four agencies represented on the executive committee. The law has also been amended six times, and 10 federal agencies, including the Highway Administration and the Army Corps of Engineers, now receive money through it.
 Many projects have been focused on Lake Mead, on water pipes, boat ramps and restrooms, as well as pleasantries like picnic tables and campgrounds. But the land sales have also helped federal agencies subsidize basic infrastructure needs, including phone lines, housing, equipment shelters, road construction, fire stations, parking lots, fencing and power supply.
 A report last year by the Office of Management and Budget also raised questions about some of the spending, saying too much money went to ''purely local projects, which do not reflect the highest priorities of the nation.'' 
 Easing the Burden
 Sure enough, the biggest category of approved spending by far has been the urban and suburban projects nominated by local governments, which quickly caught on that the sales of lands on their outskirts could be used to improve life in the heart of their cities. Local officials say that is only fair, arguing that the opening of the lands -- and subsequent population growth -- increases the stress on local governments to provide services and infrastructure.
 The public expenditure, said Erik Pappa, a spokesman for Clark County, in an e-mail message, ''relieves some of that burden by providing funding for amenities to improve our quality of life.''
 Amendments to the original law have also opened up more categories of spending, including up to $300 million to be set aside for restoration programs in the Lake Tahoe basin, and new counties and groups eligible for money, including fire-safe councils and the Washoe Indian tribe. Some money has also started to be allocated for projects in California, as part of fire prevention programs in the Lake Tahoe region, which includes both states.
 In 2006, $476 million was allocated to parks, trails and natural areas throughout the state, a category that has included such cherries as a $1.4 million softball complex in Caliente, a $10 million Las Vegas park with boccie and shuffleboard courts and a $1.5 million planning grant for picnic grounds in Alamo. 
 P. Lynn Scarlett, the deputy secretary of the interior, defended her agency's performance, saying the Bureau of Land Management ''has very vigorously and carefully selected projects'' for the various categories approved by Congress. Ms. Scarlett also said that the disparity between land sold and land bought would most likely equalize as pending purchases of tens of thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive land went through.
 For now, with the real estate market here and nationally in a tailspin, the flow of new financing has slowed. Likewise, sales at auctions so far this year have brought in only $20 million. 
 At the most recent auction, on Nov. 1, the average price per acre topped $500,000, though only one parcel -- of 31 offered -- sold. In the early days, an acre typically fetched less than $100,000. 
 Both developers and local politicians have blamed the auction system for inflating land values in the Las Vegas Valley, and some groups have started to push for the boundary to be expanded even farther to lower those costs. 
 Steve Hill, a major concrete supplier and the chairman of the governmental affairs committee of the Las Vegas Chamber of Commerce, said the lack of available land was making it hard for housing projects to make financial sense, a situation made worse by the mortgage crisis. As such the law was unintentionally encouraging the growth of far-flung suburbs throughout Southern Nevada, Mr. Hill said. Because Las Vegas is encircled by federal lands, these suburbs are forced miles away. 
 ''There are those that feel that land constraint is part social engineering, but the idea that we're going to squeeze people outside the disposal boundary and push them 50 miles away has social and environmental consequences as well,'' he said. ''It would be like saying, you can live on the island of Manhattan or you have to live 50 miles away.''
 Defenders of the growth of Las Vegas, which is expected to devour its available land by 2017, say the city is in fact very dense, not sprawling. They often refer to the ''Manhattanization'' of the city, with more and more vertical developments planned, making even more urgent the demand for public parks and other amenities. 
 ''I believe in 100 years they'll be studying this as a great piece of public policy,'' Mr. Montandon, the North Las Vegas mayor, said of the 1998 law. ''I think it will go right up beside Robert Moses building New York.''
 Meanwhile, plans for similar land sales are moving forward elsewhere in the West. A bill to sell land in fast-growing Washington County in southwestern Utah stalled in Congress last year. But its author, Senator Robert F. Bennett of Utah, said he would introduce another version this year.
 Both of Nevada's senators, Mr. Ensign and Mr. Reid, are circumspect about the spoils or the concept being expanded elsewhere.
 ''Nevada is doing just fine,'' said Mr. Reid, who posed at the ground-breaking for the $64 million shooting range in October 2006. ''But I'm not going to be trying to be a missionary for people doing this in other states.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: PLANNED SPORT SHOOTING PARK: $64 million RECEIVED FROM FEDERAL LAND SALES This land in far northwest Las Vegas Valley will be the site of an elaborate sport shooting park, slated for completion in 2009. More than a square mile will be devoted to indoor and outdoor ranges, including tactical shooting, rifle, pistol, skeet, trap and archery ranges. Plans also call for a secure firearms shipping and receiving armory and a 1,000-vehicle parking lot. The complex will also include 2,100 acres used as a wildlife and native plant preserve
FLUSHING TOILETS AT BOULDER BEACH: $495,000 RECEIVED FROM FEDERAL LAND SALES At Boulder Beach on Lake Mead, lake levels can fluctuate 50 to 75 vertical feet. Federal officials have set aside $495,000 for 30 solar-lighted, flushing toilets that can be moved as water levels change
THE LAS VEGAS SPRINGS PRESERVE: $49 million Land auctions are deeply embedded in the history of Las Vegas. This exhibit at the Las Vegas Springs Preserve's Origen Experience portrays the May 15, 1905, auction known as the birth of modern Las Vegas. Revenue from auctions of land in the Las Vegas Valley are a main financing source for parts of the preserve. Officals have budgeted $49.4 million for the 180-acre complex of museums, galleries, trails, gardens and exhibits. The Bureau of Land Management calls the preserve ''perhaps the richest and most unique cultural and biological resource in Southern Nevada.''

HEADLINE: Effort to Combat Internet Piracy Gains Strength in France

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Before the French election last spring, the rock 'n' roll musician Johnny Hallyday endorsed the man who went on to become president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy.
 Now Mr. Sarkozy is returning the favor -- not directly to Johnny Hallyday, but to a French cultural industry that seems increasingly fearful about its future.
 Last month Mr. Sarkozy outlined an aggressive proposal to crack down on Internet piracy of music and movies. Under the plan drawn up by a government-commissioned panel, Internet service providers have put aside their objections to cooperating with copyright owners in the fight against illegal file sharing. 
 If legislation to enact the plan is approved, the service providers will work with a new, independent authority to identify pirates and warn them to stop. People who ignore the warnings can face suspension, and eventually termination, of their Internet accounts.
 ''This is really one of the first occasions when service providers have assumed responsibility for the content that goes over their networks,'' said Paul Jackson, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''Generally, they have maintained that they are just like an online postal service and that file sharing is not their problem.''
 While the agreement in France is the most striking departure from that way of thinking, analysts say that Internet providers may have to soften their positions elsewhere, too, under pressure from governments or the courts.
 In Britain and Sweden, for example, government-sponsored reports have urged Internet providers to sit down with media companies and come up with a solution to online piracy.
 In the United States, one service provider, Comcast, has acknowledged slowing down file-sharing activity on its network, though not blocking it outright. But Comcast has said this was part of a policy of ''network management'' intended to keep traffic moving, since file sharing takes up significant amounts of bandwidth.
 In Belgium a court ruled last summer that an Internet service provider, Scarlet, should be required to filter out illegal online exchanges of music via peer-to-peer networks. The court gave Scarlet until the end of this year to install the necessary safeguards; Scarlet has appealed.
 The French proposal stops short of requiring filtering, which is aimed at halting illegal sharing before it starts, but it calls for experiments with the technology to do so within two years.
 In return for persuading the service providers to crack down, French media owners agreed to remove some of the digital strings they have typically attached to their works. That could allow service providers to enhance their digital music stores and other online content offerings, generating more revenue from them.
 Music industry groups agreed to remove so-called digital rights management protection from music recorded by French record labels and sold online, allowing customers to transfer songs to more than one music player -- something that some record companies have already been doing. Movie companies agreed to shorten the lag time between the release of French films on DVD and their later appearance on video-on-demand systems.
 The plan, drawn up under the guidance of Denis Olivennes, chief executive of the electronics, movie and music retailer FNAC, is the latest in a series of French efforts to deal with media piracy.
 Persistent violators, for instance, already face the threat of fines and up to three years in prison. But only about 50 people have been prosecuted and few convicted under these laws, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, a trade group for the record companies.
 Other initiatives aimed at supporting French cultural industries, including a proposal to create a ''global license'' that would permit unlimited digital media consumption in return for a monthly fee, have foundered for lack of support.
 By contrast, the Olivennes plan seems to have broad support, with France Telecom, the movie company Gaumont, copyright protection societies and others endorsing it.

HEADLINE: The Limits of 21st-Century Revolution

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
 President Hugo Chavez has narrowly lost his latest attempt to push forward a revolutionary socialist agenda. His oil-rich country, still bent on humbling the United States, is an instructive place from which to view the world, so here are eight rules of modern political life as seen from Venezuela:
 1.) Trade trumps politics. Even as Chavez has been calling President Bush ''the devil,'' U.S.-Venezuela commercial ties have blossomed. This is the Western Hemisphere's equivalent of the Taiwan-China relationship: political enemies engaged in booming business. Bilateral trade will be about $47 billion this year, up from 2006, with Venezuelan exports to the U.S. reaching $37 billion (overwhelmingly oil), and imports totaling close to $10 billion. Chavez derides the ''little Yankees'' but can't get enough American cars and clothes for his ''21st-century socialism.'' Such links dilute danger. 
 2.) Globalization breeds nationalism. Global financial flows and technology limit the real power of politicians, who compensate with what's left: national identity. Chavez's last speech in an unsuccessful campaign to turn Venezuela into a state with a formally socialist constitution had nothing to say about the ideas involved, but much to say about ''our real enemy, the American empire,'' anticolonialism, Bolivarian glory and alleged threats from the Central Intelligence Agency or CNN. The radicalization of political discourse matters more than its content, as the 2004 U.S. election campaign also suggested.
 3.) Oil centralizes power. Venezuelan oil fetches a lower price than most because it's harder to refine, but Chavez is still pocketing between $4 billion and $6.7 billion a month, depending on whom you believe. Give anyone in an opaque, rather than open, society more than $100 million a day and he might start to rave about ruling until 2050, as Chavez has. ''The tendency of the petrostate is to recentralize, petrify and personalize power,'' said Margarita Lopez Maya, a political scientist who long supported Chavez but is now disillusioned. From Moscow to Luanda to Caracas, this has been the case.
 4.) Anti-U.S. networks are here to stay. Chavez is throwing his one-pipeline-state petrodollars around to cultivate bonds beyond comrades in Cuba, Nicaragua and Bolivia. Ties with Iran, Russia, China, Argentina, Ecuador and Caribbean states are intensifying. Never mind if it takes three weeks to ship oil to China and three days to the United States: Chavez wants to parlay his petrorevenue and pseudorevolution into a global anti-American role. Moscow is selling him arms; Beijing is selling whatever it can. These trends will continue beyond Bush. High oil prices will tend to accentuate the long-term erosion of American dominance.
 5.) Ideologies are now served a la carte. Chavez makes common cause with the Cuban Revolution. But he parades under banners of Jesus Christ and calls Christ the ''first revolutionary.'' So much for Communism's dismissal of the opium of the people. The Venezuelan leader talks a lot about women's rights, but abortion remains illegal. Just as Chinese Communism can be capitalist, and Russian democracy look Leninist, Chavez's Cuban-inspired socialism can be Catholic: what counts is power preservation.
 6.) Democracy is tested. Chavez has held several referendums and elections since coming to power nine years ago, although none as close as yesterday's. When opposition TV stations are curtailed, when birth certificates and national identity cards are bought for a few hundred dollars, when tens of billions of dollars go missing in the national budget, when the judiciary is subservient and corruption a way of life, democracy is challenged. Chavez's concession of a narrow defeat is reassuring, but his readiness to build an open and accountable society is still open to question. Russian ''sovereign democracy'' and Chavez's ''socialist democracy'' need new transparency above all. 
 7.) Utopias live. Decades of neglect of Venezuela's poor by ruling elites opened the way for Chavez's ''revolution,'' with its promise of socialist cooperatives, improved health care and education, and ''people's power.'' In some areas, like health and education, he has delivered. But ''El Comandante'' has also tried to extend a controlled system for his greater glory. It benefits his crony capitalists in a make-believe economy of price controls, exchange-rate controls and unsustainable subsidies. When the crash comes, the poor will suffer and have no recourse. But the thirst for utopian illusion seems undimmed by 20th-century cataclysm, and the appetite for an anti-Bush is so voracious that the Chavez-as-Che concoction resonates, empty as it is.
 8.) TV trumps all. In the bars of Caracas, people watch N.B.A. basketball and their beloved baseball. Johan Santana, the brilliant Venezuelan pitcher now apparently close to a move to the Yankees, is a national hero. At the U.S. embassy, visa applicants must wait until April for appointments. Flights to and from the United States are packed, malls full of U.S. brands. Consumers have ever more choices, politicians ever fewer. It's unlikely even Chavez can turn back the clock far enough to change that.

HEADLINE: Climate Talks Take On Added Urgency After Report

BYLINE: By PETER GELLING and ANDREW C. REVKIN; Peter Gelling reported from Jakarta, and Andrew C. Revkin from New York.

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Thousands of government officials, industry lobbyists, environmental campaigners and observers are arriving on the Indonesian island of Bali for two weeks of talks starting Monday that are aimed at breathing new life into the troubled 15-year-old global climate treaty.
 A heightened sense of urgency surrounds the meeting in light of a report issued last month by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which detailed the potentially devastating effects of global warming in the panel's strongest language yet. 
 But few participants expect this round of talks to produce significant breakthroughs. At most, they say, it will result in new commitments to negotiate to update the original treaty by the end of 2009.
 ''The bulk of attention will be on the future,'' said Yvo de Boer, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the organization administering the treaty. ''My hope is that we can formally launch negotiations and form an agenda for those negotiations that will lead to a long-term policy response to climate change.''
 The original treaty, signed by almost all nations in 1992, set voluntary goals for curbing the emission of greenhouse gases, which mostly come from burning fossil fuels and forests, and which have been linked by scientists to global warming. But few of those goals have been met.
 Five years later, the Kyoto Protocol, a much-praised 1997 addendum to the original pact, set mandatory limits on emissions, but only for the three dozen industrialized countries that ratified it, and only through 2012. Since it took effect in 2005, emissions have continued to rise in many of those countries. 
 ''We would be in big trouble if we can't reach an agreement to move forward by the end of the conference,'' Mr. de Boer said. ''The science is clear. We now need a political answer.''
 By far, the biggest obstacle to forging a new accord by 2009 is the United States, analysts say. Senior Bush administration officials say the administration will not agree to a new treaty with binding limits on emissions. 
 Instead, President Bush recently proposed that the world's biggest countries work toward a common, long-term goal set decades in the future, without specific targets or limits, and more immediate goals set by individual nations using whatever means they choose.
 In his latest statement on climate change last Wednesday, Mr. Bush said, ''Our guiding principle is clear: we must lead the world to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions, and we must do it in a way that does not undermine economic growth or prevent nations from delivering greater prosperity for their people.''
 Paula Dobriansky, the under secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, said in a recent interview that any new agreement should involve all the world's major economies. ''We feel very strongly about having a global framework here,'' she said. ''In order to have a global framework there has to be an effort here to determine how one can engage all the players. In order to do that there has to be some flexibility in this.''
 The United States will soon stand alone among industrialized nations in its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, with the new Australian prime minister, Kevin Rudd, having said in no uncertain terms that his country would now ratify it.
 ''The Bush administration is the only government in the world that is opposed to mandatory emissions reductions being included in a new treaty,'' said Philip Clapp, the deputy managing director of the Pew Environment Group, based in Washington. ''The question is, will they block others from moving forward.''
 While most developing countries -- including China, which is poised to overtake the United States as the largest source of greenhouse gases -- have agreed to negotiate treaties that require richer nations to reduce emissions, they remain opposed to taking on such mandatory limits themselves. 
 By contrast, adherents to the Kyoto pact, led by the European Union, are eager to extend and even broaden current emission restrictions. One reason is that Kyoto nations are already buying and selling credits -- already worth several billion dollars a year -- for cutting greenhouse gas emissions under the so-called cap-and-trade system. Such trade could collapse if the restrictions are not extended.
 ''Negotiations in Bali cannot afford to fail,'' said Adam Nathan, director of communications for the Carbon Markets Association, an international industry trade association. ''It is vitally important that ministers meeting in Bali do not let the date for a new global agreement slip beyond 2009, as this will send a weak signal to the carbon markets.''
 The growing call for financial aid to help the developing countries most threatened by the negative effects of a warming climate -- like harsher droughts, floods and disrupted water supplies and agriculture -- is expected to be a central issue at the Bali talks.
 The recent United Nations Human Development Report pointedly criticized the world's industrialized powers for not living up to existing commitments under the original Framework Convention. So far, only $26 million has made it through financial pipelines ostensibly intended to funnel billions of dollars for climate-adaptation assistance, the report said.
 The United States also plans to press for commitments by rich countries to spend more to refine and deploy nonpolluting energy technologies, including systems for capturing carbon dioxide emitted by power plants, and for all countries to change trade and tariff policies to speed the diffusion of such technologies to places where they are needed most, like China.
 For ordinary residents here in Indonesia, a political solution cannot come soon enough. The WWF, the global conservation organization formerly known as the World Wildlife Fund, says Indonesia is highly vulnerable to climate change. Drought, floods, landslides and rising sea levels are part of daily life here.
 ''To Indonesians, these problems are becoming commonplace,'' said Farah Sofa, national director of Walhi, Indonesia's leading environmental watchdog group. ''It's really bad. Governments should be our protectors. They have to find a way forward.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela Hands Narrow Defeat To Chavez Plan

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jens Erik Gould contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Monday, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Voters in this country narrowly defeated a proposed overhaul to the constitution in a contentious referendum over granting President Hugo Chavez sweeping new powers, the Election Commission announced early Monday.
 It was the first major electoral defeat in the nine years of his presidency. Voters rejected the 69 proposed amendments 51 to 49 percent. 
 The political opposition erupted into celebration, shooting fireworks into the air and honking car horns, when electoral officials announced the results at 1:20 a.m. The nation had remained on edge since polls closed Sunday afternoon and the wait for results began. 
 The outcome is a stunning development in a country where Mr. Chavez and his supporters control nearly all of the levers of power. Almost immediately after the results were broadcast on state television, Mr. Chavez conceded defeat, describing the results as a ''photo finish.'' 
 ''I congratulate my adversaries for this victory,'' he said. ''For now, we could not do it.''
 Opposition leaders were ecstatic. ''Tonight, Venezuela has won,'' said Manuel Rosales, governor of Zulia State and the opposition's candidate in presidential elections last year.
 In recent weeks, members of previously splintered opposition movements joined disillusioned Chavez supporters in an attempt to defeat the referendum on constitutional changes. The plan would abolish term limits, allow Mr. Chavez to declare states of emergency for unlimited periods and increase the state's role in the economy, among other measures.
 The defeat slows Mr. Chavez's socialist-inspired transformation of the country. Venezuela, once a staunch ally of the United States, has become a leading opponent of the Bush administration's policies in the developing world. It has also taken the most profound leftward turn of any large Latin American nation in decades. 
 The referendum followed several weeks of street protests and frenetic campaigning over the amendments to the Constitution proposed by Mr. Chavez and his supporters. It caps a year of bold moves by the president, who forged a single Socialist party among his followers, forced a television network critical of the government off the public airwaves, and nationalized oil, telephone and electricity companies.
 In Caracas on Sunday, turnout in poorer neighborhoods, where support for Mr. Chavez is strong, indicated that the referendum was drawing a mixed response. Lines were long in some areas and nonexistent in others.
 ''The whole proposal is marvelous,'' said Francis Veracierta, 52, a treasurer at a communal council here, one of thousands of local governing entities loyal to Mr. Chavez that he created this year. After awakening to predawn fireworks, she said she joined a line at 6 a.m. to vote at a school in Petare, an area of sprawling hillside slums here.
 ''The power is for us in the community,'' said Ms. Veracierta, wearing a red shirt, red cap and belt with Che Guevara's face on it. She said she credited Mr. Chavez's government for giving her a $3,800 loan to start a small clothing business.
 Some of Mr. Chavez's populist proposals, including an increase in social security benefits for some workers, have been praised even by his critics. 
 Turnout in some poor districts was unexpectedly low, indicating that even the president's backers were willing to follow him only so far. Some Chavez supporters expressed concern that if they voted against the measures they might be retaliated against. Turnout of registed voters was just 56 percent. 
 There was no line in front of the voting center at the Cecilio Acosta school in Petare on Sunday morning, as a few dozen people who had already voted milled about the street. Some volunteers working the voting machines sat idle, waiting for more voters to arrive. Other voting centers in Petare had lines outside, but they were less than half a block long.
 ''I'm impressed by the lack of voters,'' said Ninoska Gonzalez, 37, who sells cigarettes on the street. ''This was full last year.'' She described herself as a ''Chavista'' who voted for the president in last year's presidential elections, but said she voted against his proposed changes on Sunday.
 ''I don't agree with some articles,'' Ms. Gonzalez said. Asked about the measure to pay social security benefits to workers in the informal economy like her, she said, ''That's a lie.''
 Confusion persisted Sunday over the amendments, with a major complaint among the president's supporters and critics that they had too little time to study the proposals.
 Unlike in past votes here, this time the government did not invite observers from the Organization of American States or the European Union, opening itself to potential claims of fraud.
 The voting seemed to unfold largely without irregularities, though there were isolated reports of fraud and violence in parts of the country. Recounts are allowed under Venezuelan law, but would have to be approved by the Supreme Court, which is controlled by Mr. Chavez's supporters.
 In recent weeks, Mr. Chavez has adopted an increasingly confrontational tone with critics abroad, who have been multiplying even in friendly countries with moderate leftist governments like Brazil and Chile.
 In the days before the referendum, Mr. Chavez recalled his ambassador from Colombia and threatened to nationalize the Venezuelan operations of Spanish banks after Spain's king told him to shut up during a meeting. Mr. Chavez said he would cut off oil exports to the United States in the event of American interference in the vote. 
 The United States remains the largest buyer of Venezuela's oil, despite deteriorating political ties, but that long commercial relationship is starting to change as Mr. Chavez increases exports of oil to China and other countries while gradually selling off the oil refineries owned by Venezuela's government in the United States.
 Venezuela's political opposition, normally divided among several small political parties, found common cause in calling on its members to vote against the amendments. An increasingly defiant student movement also protested here and in other large interior cities against the proposed charter.
 In a move that alarmed the opposition, electoral officials over the weekend revoked the observer credentials of Jorge Quiroga, a former president of Bolivia and an outspoken critic of Mr. Chavez. Mr. Quiroga accused security forces here of following him after his arrival in Caracas. ''They've taken my credential but not my tongue,'' Mr. Quiroga said.
 Mr. Chavez, whose followers already control many powerful institutions -- the National Assembly, the federal bureaucracy, the national oil company, the Supreme Court and all but a handful of state governments -- relied on an unrivaled political machine to gather support for the measures.
 Uncertainty over Mr. Chavez's reforms, meanwhile, has led to accelerating capital flight as rich Venezuelans and private companies rush to buy assets abroad denominated in dollars or euros. The currency, the bolivar, currently trades at about 6,100 to the dollar in street trading, compared with an official rate of 2,150.
 Venezuela's state-controlled oil industry is also showing signs of strain, grappling with a purge of opposition management by Mr. Chavez and a retooling of the state oil company to focus on social welfare projects while aging oil fields need maintenance.
 Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, says it produces 3.3 million barrels a day, but OPEC places its output at just 2.4 million barrels. And private economists estimate that a third of oil production goes to meet domestic consumption, which is surging because of a subsidy that keeps gasoline prices at about seven cents a gallon.
 Still, Mr. Chavez already has unprecedented discretionary control over Venezuela's oil revenues, valued at more than $60 billion a year. ''Because of its oil, Venezuela has global reach in OPEC and the rest of Latin America,'' said Kenneth R. Maxwell, a professor of Latin American history at Harvard University.

HEADLINE: Congress, Returning From Break, Has Much Work to Finish Before the Next One

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Democrats intend to put more focus on economic issues as Congress returns this week for a packed December agenda while President Bush and Republicans push for release of money for the war in Iraq without conditions.
 After months of impasse, Congress has considerable work to try to finish in just a few weeks, including financing nearly every federal agency, deciding how to suspend a potential middle-class income tax increase and dealing with major questions on surveillance, agriculture, Pentagon and energy policy.
 House Democrats, sensing increasing unease about the economy, have planned a Friday session with Wall Street executives and other financial experts to discuss the mortgage crisis, tightening credit and other problems. 
 ''The attention and efforts of Congress must be focused on the strains Americans are feeling: the spiraling price at the pump and for home heating, the real consequences of the mortgage foreclosure crisis and the falling purchasing power of their paychecks,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said Sunday.
 The Senate returns Monday and the House follows on Tuesday, with Democrats hoping to move quickly on an energy bill. The measure would increase fuel economy standards for the first time in more than a decade and provide a legislative accomplishment heading into 2008.
 But Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, a leading Republican voice on energy policy, took exception to the proposal, accusing Democrats of striking a deal among themselves and including an objectionable provision to require utilities to use a set amount of renewable fuels.
 ''That is no way to pass legislation and is another in a long list of reasons why Congress has lost the faith and trust of the American people,'' said Mr. Domenici, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
 Republicans say Democrats are facing a legislative logjam because they have spent too much of the year on fruitless efforts to force a change in Iraq war policy.
 ''Congressional Democrats have neglected their duty on the 12 spending bills, they're threatening to neglect their duty to our troops in the field and to our security at home, and they're also about to slap millions of Americans with a middle-class tax hike better known as the A.M.T.,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, referring to the alternative minimum tax.
 Both parties want to block the tax to prevent an estimated 20 million taxpayers from falling under the levy, which was created to ensure that high-income Americans paid some taxes. But the parties have disagreed about how to accomplish that.
 The House approved a plan that would have replaced the revenue by eliminating tax breaks for private equity funds and other financial entities, but the Senate blocked it. The Internal Revenue Services has warned that confusion over the repeal could delay tax refunds and complicate the filing season.
 Congress also has to find a way to resolve a fight with the White House over 11 spending bills that finance every federal agency but the Pentagon. Mr. Bush has insisted he will not approve any domestic spending above his limits. Democrats offered to cut the difference in half, to $11 billion, but the administration refused.
 Congress will have to take some action by mid-December, when a stopgap spending bill expires, to avoid a shutdown of government agencies. 
 Congress and the White House are also in a dispute over money for the war in Iraq. The House has approved $50 billion in interim financing, but it sets a goal of December 2008 to withdraw most combat troops. That was blocked in the Senate, and Mr. Bush and Republicans have been trying to put pressure on Democrats to release the money without strings, saying a delay could force Defense Department layoffs.
 The job of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, will be more difficult because four Democrats seeking the presidential nomination will be largely absent as they campaign for the first votes, in Iowa and New Hampshire early next month.
 Besides the tax and spending issue, Congress has to dispose of a major farm bill, the annual Pentagon policy bill, a trade deal with Peru and a terrorist surveillance measure, though the present wiretapping legislation extends into February. The fate of a children's health insurance program is also unsettled, as Democrats have sent Mr. Bush a second version he has promised to veto.
 ''Our plate will be full,'' Mr. Reid said in remarks circulated Sunday.

THE GREAT FUNK 
 Falling Apart and Coming Together (on a Shag Rug) in the Seventies
 By Thomas Hine 
 Illustrated. 241 pages. Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $30. 
 Hardly anyone has a good word to say about the 1970s, a decade associated with Nixon and Watergate and Vietnam, rising unemployment, growing gas shortages and soaring crime rates. On much of the cultural front, things were equally bleak: Rock 'n' roll was giving way to disco and heavy metal; happy, psychedelic hippie clothes were being replaced by leisure suits and hot pants; the Beats and Black Mountain poets were losing ground to ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' and ''Love Story.'' It was a time when shag rugs and shag haircuts were shagadelic, a time when pet rocks, platform shoes and polyester were primo. Think of avocado-colored refrigerators, yellow smiley faces and silvery disco balls. 
 In two recent books, Philip Jenkins (''Decade of Nightmares'') and Andreas Killen (''1973: Nervous Breakdown'') created similarly depressing portraits of the 1970s as an era of weakness, confusion and malaise. Thomas Hine, the author of ''The Great Funk,'' doesn't disagree: He, too, sees the '70s as a time when the bright postwar promises of the American dream began to sour in a serious economic downturn, and the baby boom generation found its shiny expectations slamming up against unforeseen limits. 
 But Mr. Hine also sees the '70s as a period of great individuality, resilience and experimentation -- an era when women, gay people and ethnic minorities began to embrace identity politics; a time when disillusion fed a healthy skepticism of authority. 
 Mr. Hine's Janus-faced approach to his subject makes for a lumpy book in which there is a lot of on-one-hand, on-the-other-hand sort of rumination. On one hand: ''Some who hate the '70s lament that its mistrust of authority has never been overcome, and that Americans will never achieve national unity again.'' On the other: ''The country needed to evolve, and lots of people ignored the experts and found their own ways, some of which remain important in the 21st century.''
 Not only are Mr. Hine's sociological observations ponderous and cliched, they can also be muddle-headed and perplexing. This is partly because Mr. Hine has leapfrogged over the '60s in his scholarly musings, and in this volume he's bizarrely inclined to conflate the '60s and '70s. For instance, he writes, ''The '70s undid the '50s , and to a great extent the '50s deserved to be undone.''
 Apparently Mr. Hine is doing this because his most famous book -- the delightful ''Populuxe'' (1986) -- immortalized the 1954-1964 era as a time of optimism and hope, and he wants this volume (which covers the years from 1969 to 1981) to serve as a kind of bookend to that volume. The problem with juxtaposing the Populuxe era of progress with the Great Funk era of stagflation and disappointment, however, is that it sidesteps the momentous era of the '60s, which embodied tumultuous social and cultural change. It also fails to take into account the many transformative events of the '60s -- from the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to the protests against the Vietnam War, from the flowering of rock 'n' roll to the ascendancy of the counterculture.
 When Mr. Hine stops trying to serve up social commentary and focuses instead on design and popular culture, the results are a lot more persuasive -- and a lot more entertaining. Mr. Hine, who for many years was architecture and design critic of The Philadelphia Inquirer, has a keen eye for how people dress and decorate their homes, and he uses that gift here to give us some interesting and sometimes very funny asides about how people in the '70s chose to present themselves to the world. 
 He suggests that synthetic fabrics like Quiana (''a kind of nylon made by DuPont that was marketed as an affordable and convenient substitute for silk'') and Ultrasuede (a synthetic used most famously by Halston) became popular in the '70s because ''new ways of standing, lounging, dancing and living seemed to call for new fabrics,'' and people were ''looking for visual appeal, novelty and ease of care.'' 
 He notes that as people sought ''new and innovative kinds of informality'' in the '70s, uniforms underwent a lot of changes: Many nuns traded their traditional garb for simpler habits, while some baseball teams exchanged their uniforms for weird, double-knit get-ups that made them look ''like inhabitants of a minor planet on a 'Star Trek' episode.'' 
 Mr. Hine also observes that as more and more people postponed marriage, and an increasing number of Americans began living alone, the pet rock became a popular fad, satirizing while pointing up ''a widespread reluctance to take any responsibility or to make any commitments.''
 Whereas the Populuxe era celebrated sleek, modernist designs as a symbol of progress, Mr. Hine says, ''the clean, uncluttered look of midcentury confidence'' was soon overtaken by a more cluttered look, as people, seeking refuge from a hostile world, sought to transform their homes into cozy nests. 
 ''Patterns became bolder,'' he writes, ''and people felt free to juxtapose two, three or five bold patterns. Moreover, geometric patterns gave way to irregular ones, based on plants and other natural forms. Smoothness gave way to texture, as ceilings became nubby, and carpets became shaggy. Rooms that had previously demanded to be polished now offered themselves to be stroked.'' 
 The seeds of the '80s and the new millennium, of course, were also planted in the '70s, as computer geeks began inventing the machines that would transform the world, and cubicle culture started to take over offices across the land. The anxieties of the '70s would yield to a yearning for reassurance embodied, for many voters, in the person of Ronald Reagan, and the '70s aesthetic of fragmentation and improvisation would be replaced by a new craving for formality, ostentation and control. 
 People ''went from worrying too much to barely thinking at all,'' Mr. Hine says, and an awareness of the precariousness of life would be supplanted by a new acquisitiveness and ambition. The leisure suit gave way to the old-fashioned business suit, accessorized with a power tie.
 Mr. Hine says the end of the '70s can be pinpointed: The decade ended in January of 1981, on the day that the hostages in Iran were released, and Ronald Reagan took the oath of office and became the 40th president of the United States. The age of yuppies and MTV and tax cuts had begun.

HEADLINE: Bringing an Energy Bill Home

 BODY:
Congress is now within reach of a breakthrough energy bill that would reduce both America's dependence on foreign oil and its emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. House passage later this week is virtually certain. Senate approval depends on whether the majority leader, Harry Reid, and the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, can corral a half-dozen votes among moderate Republicans to resist a threatened filibuster. 
 Success would earn them the gratitude of a country that badly needs a rational energy strategy. 
 The bill's centerpiece, negotiated over the weekend by House leaders, is the first meaningful increase in fuel efficiency standards for cars and light trucks, including S.U.V.'s, in more than 30 years. The provision would raise average fuel economy standards from 25 miles per gallon today to 35 miles per gallon in 2020. It would eventually save about 1.1 million barrels of oil per day, one-half of current imports from the Persian Gulf. 
 A similar provision was approved by the Senate last summer. That the House has now accepted it is a tribute to the persistence of Ed Markey of Massachusetts, an unrelenting champion of fuel efficiency; the negotiating skills of Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker; and a statesmanlike willingness to compromise on the part of John Dingell, the powerful Michigan Democrat who realized that it was no longer plausible to defend all of Detroit's demands in the face of $90 a barrel oil.
 The bill includes several other important provisions. One calls for a big increase in the production and distribution of advanced forms of ethanol from sources other than corn. With strong environmental safeguards, this provision could reduce both oil consumption and greenhouse gases. 
 Another critical provision -- the renewable electricity standard -- would require utilities to generate 15 percent of their power by 2020 from a combination of improved efficiency and renewable energy sources like wind and solar. 
 This is the most vulnerable part of the bill. Senator Pete Domenici, an influential Republican voice on energy issues, is vowing to fight it, even though he has voted for similar provisions before and his own state of New Mexico has embarked on an aggressive renewable electricity program. 
 The White House is also opposed and has hinted that President Bush would veto the entire bill if the renewable electricity provision survives. Torpedoing this bill would make it harder to address the problem of global warming, while leaving this country ever more dependent on foreign oil. Mr. Bush and Mr. Domenici should not stand in the way.

HEADLINE: Stuck on Coal, and Stuck for Words in a High-Tech World

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Human progress, Loren Eiseley wrote in 1954, has largely been a climb up ''the heat ladder'' from one energy source to the next. Each has been more convenient or potent or economical than the last. No one lugs firewood to warm a high-rise apartment building in Chicago.
 But the climb has stalled. The potential of the atom has been sharply limited by safety and security questions and fusion's persistent hurdles. Sunlight, identified as far back as Thomas Edison's time as the ultimate energy source, is still costly to transform into electricity on a large scale. 
 As a result, 21st-century civilization is still stuck on a 19th-century rung -- the coal step on that heat ladder -- while two billion people in Africa and other struggling regions still cook meals on smoldering dung and sticks, with a million-plus dying young each year from lung ailments as a result. Many in such places would love nothing more than a lump of coal.
 And now science says we can't afford to stay where we are much longer. 
 The huge projected expansion in coal burning over the next few decades, mainly in China and India but also in the United States and parts of Europe, will (without new technology) produce a buildup of long-lived carbon dioxide sufficient to warm the atmosphere, erode ice sheets and raise and acidify seas for many centuries. (Burning oil matters too, of course, but that is seen as a more tractable issue by many experts.)
 It's no wonder that scientists immersed for decades in this problem are running out of metaphors in pressing the public to act -- whether the choice is a surge of research on nonpolluting energy technologies, a rising ''tipping fee'' for continued greenhouse-gas emissions, or a combination of these and other steps.
 James E. Hansen, the top NASA climate scientist, has been lauded and criticized in recent days for accusing society of willfully ignoring a tragedy unfolding in plain sight in the same way millions of people did as the Holocaust swept Europe. As I noted last week in a post to the blog Dot Earth, he likened coal trains that serve high-emitting power plants to ''death trains.'' In response, Dr. Hansen distributed an essay apologizing for, and justifying, his language and calling for better ideas. 
 ''It is hard for me to think of a different, equally poignant example of the foreseeable consequence faced by fellow creatures on the planet,'' Dr. Hansen wrote. ''Suggestions are welcome.''
 One interesting experiment intended to cast the climate problem in a new way can be found at DeSmogBlog.com, where people are invited to write ''100-Year Letters'' discussing climate with their great-grandchildren.
 Keep in mind that sociologists studying global warming don't hold out much hope that any language -- if not accompanied by a big kick from nature -- can motivate people to embrace the need to leave the comfort zone of coal. 
 In a 2006 paper in the journal Climatic Change, subtitled ''Why Global Warming Does Not Scare Us (Yet),'' Elke U. Weber of Columbia University listed various reasons why people fail to absorb messages on long-term risks. 
 The reasons include established sociological concepts like the ''finite pool of worry'' hypothesis, in which daily struggles swamp even life-threatening long-term risks (not finding the time to replace worn tires) and ''single-action bias,'' exemplified by a 1991 study finding that radiologists looking for tumors or other problems in X-rays tend to halt their search after discovering the first one, leaving additional problems undetected.
 As a journalist, of course, it would be hard for me to abandon the notion that language can help society meaningfully address the entwined energy and climate challenges. I'll be posting some fresh efforts by experts to describe the situation and offer solutions. You can post yours, as well, at nytimes.com/dotearth.

HEADLINE: For Brazilians, Now It's Home That's a Land Of Plenty

BYLINE: By NINA BERNSTEIN and ELIZABETH DWOSKIN

 BODY:
Like hundreds of thousands of middle-class Brazilians who moved to the United States over the last two decades, Jose Osvandir Borges and his wife, Elisabeth, came on tourist visas and stayed as illegal immigrants, putting down roots in ways they never expected.
 After packing up their plasma-screen TV, scholastic trophies and other fruits of 12 prosperous years in the Ironbound in Newark, the couple and their American-born daughter, Marianna, 10, were scheduled to fly back to Brazil for good this morning. They expect their son, Thiago, 21, to follow in a year or two, despite his reluctance to leave the only land that feels like home. 
 ''You can't spend your entire life waiting to be legal,'' said Mr. Borges, 42, reflecting on a hard decision born of lost hopes, new fears and changing economies in both countries since he arrived in 1996. By law, the couple faces a 10-year bar on re-entering the United States, even as visitors.
 That decision -- to give up on life in the United States -- is being made by more and more Brazilians across the country, according to consular officials, travel agencies swamped by one-way ticket bookings, and community leaders in the neighborhoods that Brazilian immigrants have transformed, from Boston to Pompano Beach, Fla. 
 No one can say how many are leaving. But in the last half year, the reverse migration has become unmistakable among Brazilians in the United States, a population estimated at 1.1 million by Brazil's government -- four to five times the official census figures. 
 To explain an often wrenching decision to pull up stakes, homeward-bound Brazilians point to a rising fear of deportation and a slumping American economy. Many cite the expiration of driver's licenses that can no longer be renewed under tougher rules, coupled with the steep drop in the value of the dollar against the currency of Brazil, where the economy has improved. 
 ''You put it all together, and why should you stay in an environment like that if you have a place like Brazil, where there's hope, a light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train to run you over?'' said Pedro Coelho, a businessman in Mount Vernon, N.Y., who is known as the mayor of Brazilians in Westchester County. ''Are they leaving? Yes, by the hundreds.''
 In Massachusetts, says Fausto da Rocha, the founder of the Boston-area Brazilian Immigrant Center, his compatriots -- many here illegally -- are leaving by the thousands, some after losing homes in the subprime mortgage crisis. In New York and New Jersey, travel agents and others who sell airline seats say that one-way bookings to Brazil have more than doubled since last year, to about 150 daily from Kennedy International Airport, and that flights are sold out through February. 
 And at Brazil's consulate in Miami, which serves Brazilians in five Southeastern states, officials said a recent survey of moving companies and travel agencies confirmed what they had already surmised from their foot traffic: More Brazilians are leaving the region than arriving -- the reversal of an upward curve that seemed unstoppable as recently as 2005, when Brazilians unable to meet tightened visa requirements were sneaking across the United States-Mexico border in record numbers. 
 It is too soon to say whether the reverse migration of Brazilians puts them in the vanguard of a larger trend among immigrants, or underscores their distinctiveness. Like Mr. Borges, who said he was poorly paid as a university teacher of religious studies in his native city of Curitiba, they generally come from more urban and educated classes than other major groups of illegal immigrants from Latin America, studies show. Many returning now have been investing their American earnings in Brazilian property. 
 But their own explanation for the surge back to Brazil contradicts conventional wisdom on both sides of the immigration debate.
 For years, advocates of giving people like the Borgeses a chance to earn legal status have argued that illegal immigrants will only be driven further underground by enforcement measures like raids or denying them driver's licenses. Advocates of harsher restrictions and penalties have argued that illegal immigration is now growing independently of the ebb and flow of the American economy. Returning Brazilians defy both contentions.
 Faced with diminishing rewards and rising expenses in the United States, long separated from aging relatives in Brazil, ''people say, 'Is this worth it, being illegal, being scared?''' said Maxine L. Margolis, a professor of anthropology at the University of Florida in Gainesville who has written extensively on Brazilians in the United States.
 There are regional variations, but the pattern is consistent. In South Florida, the expiration of a driver's license is often a turning point for families already caught short by the slump in housing construction, said Sister Judi Clemens, a pastoral assistant with Our Lady Aparecida Mission, which serves five different Brazilian communities in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Miami. She noted that until seven years ago, Brazilians with tourist visas could get Florida licenses valid for eight years, but they are all expiring now and cannot be renewed.
 ''There's no public transportation here in Florida, so people drive to work in fear and trembling,'' worried that a traffic stop could mean months in immigration detention, she said. ''A lot of people have just simply said, 'I've had enough.'''
 In Massachusetts, where there is more public transportation, a spate of high-profile immigration raids, coupled with home foreclosures, have played a key role in the exodus, said community leaders like Mr. da Rocha, a legal resident who came in 1989. ''I believe we lost 5,000 Brazilians only this year,'' he said. ''The landlords are going to face a crisis soon.''
 While Brazil does not yet offer the job opportunities of Ireland, which has drawn back emigrants in droves, neither is it an economically bleak or war-torn country. And like Italian immigrants early in the 20th century, who typically planned to return to Italy -- half of them eventually doing so -- many Brazilians arrived with the intention of going back as soon as they met their financial goals. 
 But like the Borges family, they soon changed their timetable.
 ''We came here to save enough money to buy a house'' in Brazil, Mr. Borges said, recalling the early weeks when the family slept in a friend's basement and he worked in construction for the first time. They expected to return to Brazil after two years. 
 Instead, he found his inner entrepreneur. He started a plumbing and construction business that soon employed upward of seven compatriots, paid taxes and helped build name-brand hotels in three states.
 But in 2005, as the construction boom began to go bust, larger companies, prompted by labor unions, started to demand working papers, he said. And when his crew could not produce them, they were let go. 
 As the housing market faltered, weekly earnings in his business shrank from a high of $6,000 to barely $2,000, he said. Expenses like gas and rent rose, making it harder for him and Ms. Borges, who cleaned houses in New York, to pay off loans for the farm they were buying in Brazil. 
 The dollar, which once bought four Brazilian reals, dropped to a historic low of 1.7 reals in May. Then in June came their personal tipping point: the collapse of the bipartisan bill in Congress that would have offered them, and millions of other illegal residents, a path to legal status.
 ''After the law didn't pass, it was like all the hope went away at once,'' said Mr. Borges, who had traveled, with other members of St. James Catholic Church in Newark, to rallies supporting the bill in Trenton and Washington. 
 In past years, he allowed, he spent $26,000 on dubious and doomed efforts to secure a green card. Now, he hopes to make a living by processing sugar cane for ethanol on his Brazilian farm. ''If we had papers, we'd stay forever,'' said Ms. Borges, 41, who has been active in their children's public schools. ''We love this community.''
 Proudly, they showed off the trophy that Marianna won in third grade in an anti-littering poster contest, for a design that is now featured in shop windows throughout the Ironbound.
 It is in such neighborhoods, where Brazilians brought fresh bustle to faded storefronts or abandoned factories, that the departures are being felt most keenly.
 ''I'm scared,'' said Francine Melo, the owner of the travel agency in Newark where Mr. Borges bought three one-way tickets for $1,708. ''I make my living through these people.''
 Another of her last-time customers, Norma dos Santos, a former house cleaner, said she felt she had no choice. Seven years after overstaying her visa, she said, she does not drive to work or pick up her children at school for fear that a traffic stop could put her in immigration detention.
 ''It's just getting harder and harder to stay here without documents,'' she said.
 Still, she is uncertain that she is doing right by her American-born children, a newborn and a 2-year old boy. 
 ''I'm worried they'll grow up and ask me, 'How could you have left America?''' she said.

HEADLINE: German Bank Acts to Help Its Programs Tied to U.S. Mortgages

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
In an effort to limit fallout from the subprime lending crisis in the United States, the German bank WestLB said on Monday that it would guarantee full liquidity to several of its investment vehicles that had put money into asset-backed securities.
 WestLB, based in Dusseldorf and one of the regional German banks, or Landesbanken, has two major programs, known as Harrier Finance Funding and Kestrel Funding, that borrow money by selling short-term commercial paper to investors. They then invest the proceeds in higher-yielding securities, including ones backed by American mortgages. 
 WestLB also has three other similar investment vehicles, known as conduits. All five will have the option of drawing up to 25 billion euros, or $36.6 billion, as the short-term paper comes due.
 ''This will ensure that there is no compelled liquidation of the assets in the SIVs,'' said Armin Kloss, a WestLB spokesman, referring to structured investment vehicles. ''We are also convinced that the assets that Kestrel and Harrier have could be more highly valued, but that the market is not ready for that.''
 WestLB said in August that ''less than 5 percent'' of its investments was subprime-related, Mr. Kloss said. But trading in asset-backed securities has largely stopped, so a forced sale now would cost the bank dearly.
 Like other banks and many politicians, WestLB is betting that the market will recover.
 Joaquin Almunia, the European Union commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, warned Monday against new rules aimed at ameliorating the crisis. Any regulatory response to the crisis must be ''considered and measured,'' he said.
 ''It is too early to reach firm conclusions on what has gone wrong in risk management in the financial sector and whether regulatory initiatives are needed,'' Mr. Almunia said in Brussels.
 Structured investment vehicles are at the heart of the financial crisis unleashed by the deteriorating United States mortgage market. Questions about the losses from bad SIV investments have shaken credit markets and pushed up short-term interest rates as banks hoard liquidity to guard against surprise losses.
 HSH Nordbank, based in Hamburg, is taking a similar step to that of WestLB, covering all of the 3.3 billion euros that its vehicle, called Carrera Capital, has issued. The step has helped secure its stable credit ratings with Moody's Investor Service and Standard & Poor's.
 ''What we're trying to do is avoid a write-down,'' Reinhard Schmid, an HSH Nordbank spokesman, said. ''We can do that with liquidity.''
 Two German banks, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and SachsenLB, needed an outside rescue in August when their speculation in subprime-related securities went awry. But those problems far outstripped what much more stable banks like WestLB and HSH Nordbank are facing. IKB Deutsche and SachsenLB set up funds that were triple or quintuple the size of their capital on hand.
 The British bank HSBC said last week that it would spend $35 billion to bring two vehicles it ran directly onto its books, effectively turning the bank into their guarantor of liquidity.
 A similar principle underlies the so-called SuperSIV -- formally known as the Master Liquidity Enhancement Conduit -- proposed by Citigroup, the largest sponsor of such vehicles in the world. Together with Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup is proposing that up to $80 billion be devoted to buying up mortgage-backed securities and holding them until the market relaxes.
 The banks are aiming to have the fund operational by early next year.

HEADLINE: New Hall of Famer Stirs Both Sides in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN; Daryl Khan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Forgive? Perhaps not. Forget? Um, forget about it.
 But half a century after Walter O'Malley ripped the heart out of Brooklyn by moving the Dodgers to Los Angeles, quite a few Brooklynites seemed grudgingly willing to congratulate Mr. O'Malley on his posthumous election yesterday to the National Baseball Hall of Fame.
 ''Yeah, he deserves it,'' David Avery, 50, said as he stood near what was once center field in Ebbets Field and is now the front courtyard of the Ebbets Field Apartments in Crown Heights. ''It's overdue.'' 
 Yesterday's vote, by the Hall of Fame's veterans' committee, was a bit of a twist of the knife, to be sure. Mr. O'Malley's great accomplishment, after all, was to take Major League Baseball to the West Coast, allowing it to become a truly national sport. This left a few ruffled feathers back in Brooklyn. 
 But revisionist history has been relatively kind to Mr. O'Malley, who owned the Dodgers from 1950 to 1970. Many historians maintain that Robert Moses, still at the height of his city-shaping powers in the late 1950s, forced Mr. O'Malley's hand by refusing to use eminent domain law to acquire land for Mr. O'Malley to build a new domed stadium along Atlantic Avenue to replace the undersize Ebbets Field.
 Others say Mr. O'Malley forced Mr. Moses to force his hand by making unreasonable demands for land and snubbing Mr. Moses's offer of a stadium in Queens. They say he was just looking for an excuse to move to Los Angeles, where he knew he could make a lot more money.
 In the end, some Dodger diehards said yesterday at Farrell's bar in Windsor Terrace, Mr. O'Malley was a businessman who made a smart decision. 
 ''Walter O'Malley was a genius as far as I'm concerned,'' said Tom Mitchell, who was 12 when his beloved Dodgers abandoned him. ''That was the biggest decision of his life, and he did the right thing.''
 A few feet down the bar, Jim Flaherty, 70, agreed. ''He broke a lot of people's hearts. But he was a pioneer.''
 Sure, the Dodgers' departure may have hastened white flight and other harbingers of the borough's economic decline in the 1960s and '70s. Mark Naison, a Fordham University professor of African-American studies and a Brooklyn native, called the team ''one of the few threads that connected the growing black population of Brooklyn with the declining ethnic white population of Brooklyn.'' 
 But those days are gone, too. Brooklyn is hardly down on its heels anymore. It has survived, and thrived, quite well without Mr. O'Malley's Dodgers. 
 Just across Atlantic Avenue from where Mr. O'Malley wanted to build his stadium, the developer Bruce Ratner is developing a $4 billion complex, the Atlantic Yards, featuring a basketball arena. It might not be too popular in some parts of Brooklyn, but anyone who rooted for Mr. O'Malley to get his way would be hard pressed to spit in the face of Mr. Ratner's plan.
 The decline of anti-O'Malleyism in Brooklyn can be traced even more directly to simple demographics: There are just not that many people around to hate him anymore. According to census statistics, more than 85 percent of today's 2.5 million Brooklynites were either not yet born or living outside the United States when the Dodgers packed up after the 1957 season.
 ''I think in 2007, it's perhaps time that we get over it,'' said Eric McClure, a civic activist in Park Slope who was born in 1963.
 One wag who posted to the City Room blog of The New York Times yesterday had the same thought. 
 ''Get over it Brooklyn,'' he wrote. ''It's been 50 years. When I lost my dog Blinky, I got over it. Man, I loved Blinky.''
 So let us now praise Walter O'Malley, 1903-1979, all-around New Yorker: son of a Bronx textile salesman, student at Jamaica High School in Queens, Fordham law school graduate, successful bankruptcy lawyer during the Depression author of a well-read 1931 guide to the city's building code. 
 Michael Shapiro, a Midwood son and author of a book on Dodger history, ''The Last Good Season,'' offered his opinion. ''Walter O'Malley, I'm going to get hung for saying this, deserves to be in the Hall of Fame,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''Shoot me.''
 Of course, there will always be a few sore sports. Mr. O'Malley is in the Hall of Fame. Gil Hodges, the 1950s Dodgers' sainted first baseman, is not. The Dodgers are gone. Life isn't fair.
 Pudgie Walsh, 73-year-old Brooklyn sports legend and founding coach of the Brooklyn Mariners semipro football team, chose his words slowly and carefully when informed of Mr. O'Malley's ascension.
 ''What a horrible, horrible day in the history of Brooklyn,'' Mr. Walsh said.

HEADLINE: Forecasters Say Madison Avenue Will Escape a Recession, Just Barely

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
GROWTH in advertising spending in the United States is slowing considerably, according to several forecasters whose predictions are closely followed. But they believe the continuing strength of ad spending online -- as well as the stimulative effects of the elections and the Summer Olympics -- should keep the industry from suffering a recession in 2008.
 In other words, although you may want to fasten your seat belt for a bumpy flight, you will probably be able to leave the motion-sickness bag in the pocket of the seat in front of you.
 ''The U.S. ad climate is tiptoeing toward the edge of recession, but staying slightly positive,'' said Lee Westerfield, a senior analyst at BMO Capital Markets. 
 ''An advertising recession has already been under way for the likes of newspapers, radio and magazines,'' Mr. Westerfield said, listing three traditional media that have been hit hard by the rise of online advertising.
 ''Internet media spending remains the bright spot in the midst of a cyclical downturn,'' he added, along with advertising next year for the presidential, Congressional and gubernatorial elections, which could reach as much as $3 billion.
 Mr. Westerfield is predicting that ad spending in this country will show 2.6 percent growth in 2007 over 2006, rather than 3.4 percent as he had previously forecast. For 2008, he is estimating a gain of 3.6 percent from this year, compared with the 4.3 percent he had formerly predicted.
 Two other well-regarded forecasters reduced their estimates for American ad spending growth yesterday at the opening session of the 35th annual global media and communications conference sponsored by UBS.
 Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and director for forecasting at Universal McCann, reduced for a third time his prediction for ad spending growth this year, compared with 2006.
 Mr. Coen, whose agency is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, is now calling for a slim gain in 2007 of 0.7 percent, to $283.9 billion, compared with previous predictions for gains of 3.1 percent, made last June; 4.8 percent, made in December 2006; and 5.8 percent, made in June 2006.
 The standout medium by far, in Mr. Coen's forecast, is the Internet, where ad spending this year will rise 20 percent from 2006. By comparison, he estimated there would be declines this year in ad spending for media like local newspapers, down 8 percent; national syndicated television, down 8 percent; and local radio, down 6 percent.
 An increase this year of 0.7 percent in total American ad spending would represent the smallest yearly gain since the industry recovered from its 2001 recession. Those increases have ranged from 2.4 percent in 2002 to 7.4 percent in 2004; the increase in 2006 from 2005 was 3.9 percent.
 An increase of 0.7 percent would also mean that ad spending as a percentage of American gross domestic product would decline in 2007 to a weak 2.05 percent, from 2.14 percent in 2006.
 Still, ''we don't think there will be a recession'' for Madison Avenue, Mr. Coen said in his presentation. ''But advertising is being crunched down.''
 He is also crunching his forecast for next year. Last June, Mr. Coen predicted American ad spending in 2008 would be 5 percent higher than in 2007. Yesterday, he revised his estimate downward to an increase of 3.7 percent, to $294.4 billion, which would represent an anemic 2.04 percent of the gross domestic product expected for next year.
 Again, the standout medium for ad growth will be the Internet, Mr. Coen predicted, up 16.5 percent from 2007. In contrast, national newspapers will fall 1 percent, he estimated, and local radio will be flat with this year.
 ''We don't see a great deal of improvement immediately ahead,'' Mr. Coen said, which ''doesn't make me very optimistic about 2008.''
 ''On the other hand,'' he added, ''there are the elections and the Olympics.''
 The Summer Games will stimulate demand for advertising space and time not only in the United States but in scores of other countries as well.
 ''People are underestimating the potential'' gains for ad spending that will result from the Olympics, said David F. Poltrack, chief research officer at the CBS Corporation, who also made a presentation at the conference yesterday.
 (It should be noted that Mr. Poltrack is upbeat even though it is NBC, rather than his network, that owns the rights to present the Summer Games to American viewers.)
 The Olympics benefit the medium of television not only by ''generating incremental dollars,'' Mr. Poltrack said, but also by ''taking inventory out of the market,'' thus tightening the supply of commercial time across the medium.
 The decision to hold the Olympics for the first time in China -- where ad spending growth rates are among the most robust of any nation -- is expected to amplify demand further, as marketers based in Europe and North America seek to familiarize the Chinese with their brands and the marketers based in China play to a global audience.
 Steve King, worldwide chief executive at ZenithOptimedia, a media agency that is part of the Publicis Groupe, referred in his presentation to the boost from the Games -- along with the robust American political spending in a year in which a president is elected -- as ''the quadrennial effect.''
 The Olympics will pump an additional $3 billion into the world's advertising economy next year, Mr. King forecast, compared with an additional $1 billion in ad spending he expects from a popular European soccer tournament, called Euro 2008.
 ''Take out the quadrennial effect,'' Mr. King said, ''and '08 growth would be close to '07.''
 For 2008, Mr. King is predicting an increase in worldwide ad spending of 6.7 percent from 2007, bigger than the 5.3 percent gain he is forecasting for this year compared with 2006. 
 In the United States, the growth in ad spending next year will lag behind the rest of the world, Mr. King said, increasing 4.1 percent from 2007. (That estimate includes $2 billion in spending for political ads.) 
 Mr. King, like Mr. Coen and Mr. Westerfield, trimmed his prediction for American growth in 2007 compared with his previous estimates. Mr. King is now calling for a gain of 2.5 percent from 2006; his previous forecasts were for increases of 3.7 percent, made last summer, and 4.2 percent, made last fall.
 ''It's quite a strong markdown from our forecast a year ago,'' Mr. King said, adding. ''The housing downturn and the credit squeeze are definitely having an impact in the short term.''
 Again, the Internet is the bright spot for American media performance in Mr. King's data as well as Mr. Coen's. Mr. King said he expected online ad revenue to climb 29 percent in 2007 from 2006, and an additional 19 percent in 2008 from 2007.
 Mr. Coen acknowledged the quadrennial effect in his forecasts for ad spending overseas, which are more bullish than his predictions for the domestic market.
 ''There is a better outlook in other parts of the world than we see in the United States,'' Mr. Coen said, particularly in countries like Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Poland and Russia.
 For 2007, ad spending outside the United States is expected to grow 5.7 percent from 2006, to $341.4 billion, Mr. Coen said. For 2008, ad spending overseas will increase 5.3 percent from 2007, he added, to $359.5 billion.
 Mr. Coen's totals for worldwide ad spending for 2007 are $625.3 billion, up 3.4 percent from 2006, and $653.9 billion for 2008, up 4.6 percent from 2007.

HEADLINE: Financial Shares Lead Market Lower

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shares fell yesterday, led by financial services stocks, on concerns that the economy's expansion will erode amid troubles in the mortgage industry.
 Last week, the Dow Jones industrial average made its biggest weekly point gain in more than four years, rising nearly 391 points, or 3.01 percent. But that advance proved short-lived after two Federal Reserve officials expressed concern yesterday about the subprime mortgage crisis and its impact on banks and brokerage firms.
 Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, said in a speech that he was concerned that home foreclosures might worsen as overall economic growth slowed. Janet L. Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, called growth in the final three months of the year ''only very meager,'' and warned that housing problems could spill over into consumer spending. 
 Besides a flagging economy, investors appeared unsure about a government-sponsored rescue of the mortgage industry. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in a speech that the White House was moving closer to an agreement to help thousands of homeowners avoid mortgage defaults by temporarily holding their interest rates steady.
 Lincoln Anderson, chief investment officer and chief economist at LPL Financial Services in Boston, said investors were uncertain about where stocks would head after last week's gains and were awaiting economic readings. The November employment report, due Friday, could indicate the direction of consumer spending, for example.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 57.15, or 0.43 percent, to 13,314.57.
 Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 8.72 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,472.42, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 23.83, or 0.90 percent, to 2,637.13.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.80, or 1.02 percent, to 759.97.
 Investors also considered a report from the Institute for Supply Management that showed the pace of growth in the manufacturing sector slowed marginally in November.
 Light crude oil rose 60 cents, to $89.31 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange ahead of an OPEC meeting later this week.
 Shares of Citigroup fell 24 cents, to $33.06, while Bank of America fell 66 cents, to $45.47.
 Vivendi said it planned to acquire a controlling stake in Activision to combine it with Vivendi Games and create a rival to Electronic Arts. Activision and Vivendi valued the combined company at $18.9 billion. Activision jumped $2.82, or 12.7 percent, to $24.97.
 MetLife, the insurance and financial services company, predicted its operating profit would rise in the fourth quarter and full year because of strong results from its business as well as ''unusually strong'' investment results. MetLife fell 81 cents, to $64.78.
 Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive of Ford Motor, promised yesterday that the automaker would meet the tougher federal fuel-economy regulations Congress wants to impose by 2020 without having to abandon any of its lower-mileage truck or sport-utility vehicle lines. But the company also said that it would cut production in the first quarter of 2008, and its shares fell 26 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $7.25.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 24/32, to 103 9/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 3.85 percent, from 3.94 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: In Iran, Group Of 'Mothers' Criticizes Nuclear Policy

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
More than 500 Iranian women calling themselves ''mothers of peace'' have signed a letter to senior officials expressing their fear that there will be a war over Iran's nuclear program. 
 The letter refers to the economic sanctions already imposed by the United Nations Security Council and the increasing United States military presence in the Persian Gulf as evidence that Iran could be moving toward a military confrontation with the United States. The letter warns the Iranian authorities that the signatories are not willing to support the government in its insistence on continuing its nuclear program.
 ''We, mothers of peace, want to express our deepest concerns over the country's critical situation,'' said the letter signed by 521 women, which was posted on www.motherspeace.blogfa.com and other major political news Web sites. 
 ''We are worried about the prices that we and our children will have to pay during a period of such insecurity,'' the letter added. 
 It is highly unusual for an Iranian citizens' group to question publicly the country's nuclear policy and acknowledge the effects of the economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations on people's lives. The group announced its formation in November as a movement seeking peace and freedom.
 President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has repeatedly brushed off the sanctions as insignificant and has said that the Iranian people are willing to resist any type of international pressure related to the country's nuclear program. He has even called senior officials who have criticized his nuclear policies ''traitors.'' 
 The government says its program is for peaceful energy purposes, while the United States has contended that its purpose is to develop nuclear weapons.
 Among the signatories were political activists as well as homemakers and artists. According to the Web site, 300 more women have signed the letter, in addition to the original group, and even more are adding their names online.
 ''We have not forgotten the bitter days of war,'' the letter said, referring to the war with Iraq from 1980 to 1988. ''We are still mourning the loss of our loved ones, and we watch the suffering of the disabled and see the names of our martyrs on the streets.''

HEADLINE: Tension at the Edge of Alaska

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: BARROW, Alaska 

 BODY:
Each summer and fall, the Inupiat, natives of Alaska's arid north coast, take their sealskin boats and gun-fired harpoons and go whale hunting. Kills are celebrated throughout villages as whaling captains share their catch with relatives and neighbors. Muktuk, or raw whale skin and blubber, is a prized delicacy.
 But now, that traditional way of life is coming into conflict with one of the modern world's most urgent priorities: finding more oil.
 Royal Dutch Shell is determined to exploit vast reserves believed to lie off Alaska's coast. The Bush administration backs the idea and has issued offshore leases in recent years totaling an area nearly the size of Maryland. 
 Those leases have received far less attention than failed efforts to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, but they may prove to be far more important. By some estimates, the oil under the Alaskan seabed could exceed the reserves remaining in the rest of the United States, though how much might ultimately be recoverable is uncertain.
 Shell is eager to find out. It tried to make headway this summer, only to be stopped by an unusual alliance of Inupiat whalers and environmental groups who filed a suit in federal court.
 They argue that noisy drilling off the Alaska coast could disrupt migration routes for the bowhead whales, making it impossible for the Inupiat to capture their allotted share of about 60 animals per year. A court hearing is scheduled for today to consider whether the company can move forward, though a ruling is not expected for months.
 Native communities are not unalterably opposed to oil production -- on the contrary, many rely on oil for their livelihoods. The North Slope Borough, a countylike governmental unit the size of Minnesota where most of Alaska's 10,000 Inupiat live, gets the bulk of its $98 million budget each year from taxing onshore oil operations. 
 Native corporations also derive a large part of their business from serving the oil industry in Prudhoe Bay. Community leaders are caught between a desire to preserve traditional whaling and the economic necessity of permitting the oil industry to move into new areas.
 ''It's a hell of a dilemma,'' said Edward S. Itta, the mayor of the North Slope Borough, who is opposed to Shell's drilling plans. ''Without a doubt, America's energy needs are way up, and something's going to happen up there. It's a way of life against an opposing value. This way of life has value; nobody can put it in dollars and cents.''
 The oil resources off Alaska's coast amount to some 27 billion barrels, according to government estimates, about the same as the original reserves of the giant Prudhoe Bay field discovered in 1968. That would be enough to satisfy America's total oil consumption for three years if every last drop could be pumped, which is unlikely. 
 It is a tantalizing bonanza for the Bush administration, which has strongly backed exploration to make up for a decline in domestic oil production; for oil companies, which are scouring the world to find new supplies; and for Alaskan authorities, who need to keep the trans-Alaska pipeline flowing. 
 Returning to the Sea
 Oil off Alaska's coast is hardly a new discovery. Soon after petroleum was found under the North Slope 40 years ago, companies began to suspect there might be oil under the Beaufort Sea and beyond. 
 Shell was one of the early pioneers of Arctic exploration in the following decades but it abandoned the region along with other companies after the oil price collapse of the mid-1980s. Five years ago, as the company sought new places to drill, Shell geologists dusted off their old seismic surveys. They identified a spot called Hammerhead, where the company had first drilled in 1985. They renamed it Sivulliq, meaning ''the first one'' in Inupiat, and decided to drill there. The area, about 15 miles offshore in 110 feet of water, is just opposite the western coast of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. 
 Shell moved aggressively to secure offshore holdings after 2005. The company paid about $80 million for leases in the Beaufort Sea, outspending its competitors.
 ''If you look at the Arctic, this is an incredibly important energy resource for the United States,'' said Marvin Odum, Shell's executive vice president for the Americas. ''Going in with paced development is the right way to go.''
 Mr. Odum says Shell is respectful of native rights and can safely drill in the Beaufort Sea without disturbing whales or whalers. The company offered to shut drilling operations during the whaling season and said it would monitor migration routes with the latest equipment, including unmanned aerial drones. 
 In February, Shell obtained its drilling permit from the Minerals Management Service, a government agency in charge of overseeing oil and gas production in federal waters. That allowed it to bring in a small armada of ships and emergency craft to prepare for the drilling season, which lasts 90 to 120 days in the summer, when the Beaufort Sea is largely free of ice.
 But in April, environmental groups sued the agency, which is part of the Interior Department, asserting it had not taken adequate account of the risks any oil spill would pose to whales and other species. 
 The plaintiffs, later joined by the North Slope Borough and the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, won an injunction in July from a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, which ordered Shell not to drill while the case was under review. In September, the company lost an important ruling, effectively ending this year's drilling efforts.
 Both sides will present their arguments today, and the court is expected to rule before the next drilling season. 
 Mr. Odum, whose responsibilities at Shell span the Western Hemisphere, spent three days this summer as an observer on a hunt that captured two whales. The experience, he said, gave him a ''visceral understanding'' of whaling's importance to native people, who refer to themselves interchangeably as Inupiat or Eskimos.
 ''The issue is how do we do this together in a way that does not interfere with the whale hunt,'' Mr. Odum said. The company repainted one of its larger boats from bright orange to white and blue to make it less annoying to whales. It also reached an agreement with whalers on right of passage during the whaling season.
 Despite the delays, Shell believes that its exploration program will be allowed to resume next year. In a bid to reach out to the Inupiat, the company says it spent several million dollars in community development projects on the North Slope; it declined to provide a specific figure. It gave $250,000, for example, to a science and engineering program at the University of Alaska geared toward native students.
 But the company's opponents argue that Shell moved into Alaska too aggressively, surprised the Inupiat with the scale of its operations and did a poor job of reaching out to them. ''This lawsuit was a way of getting everyone's attention and to get our concerns addressed,'' said Mr. Itta, the mayor.
 New Wave of Development
 Not everyone here sees Shell as a threat. Richard Glenn, vice president of the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the biggest Eskimo-run business, says the oil industry is vital to indigenous communities. The corporation runs a series of energy and construction businesses, and redistributes more than $200 million a year in profits to the Eskimos. ''To say that the oil and gas industry succeeds does not mean that our culture fails,'' Mr. Glenn said.
 The controversy on the North Slope is the most visible sign of a new wave of oil development in Alaska.The Interior Department has been auctioning rights in the Beaufort Sea for five years, and it plans more sales there .
 Environmentalists are concerned about what they see as the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in Alaska. They said they saw no contradiction in their support for native rights, including whaling rights, and their long-term effort to protect whales and other species.
 ''The bowhead whale is an icon of cultural identity for the Inupiat people,'' said Rachel James, a campaigner at Pacific Environment, one of the groups suing the government. ''Our concerns are over human rights issues, access for subsistence users to resources, and the protection of endangered species.''
 The bowhead whale -- Balaena mysticetus -- is a member of the right whale family. Its skull is so powerful that it can crash through two feet of ice to reach the surface to breathe. Its numbers were greatly reduced in the era of commercial whaling, but it has made a modest recovery, and hunting by the Inupiat is not considered a threat.
 From the Inupiat perspective, the big fear about oil drilling is that the inevitable noise will drive whales so far offshore they will be impossible to hunt with the limited traditional gear that villagers use. 
 Whale Meat in the Kitchen
 In Barrow, signs of the whales can be found everywhere. Their curved skulls are displayed in front of public buildings and along the town's coastline. The high school mascot is a smiling harpoon-wielding whaler. 
 ''This is a community that depends on the Arctic Ocean for survival,'' said Charles F. Hopson, a member of Barrow's whaling commission.
 The other day, an Eskimo named Lewis Brower took out a hunting knife, opened his refrigerator and lopped off a big chunk of raw whale meat. He cut a sliver for his 2-year-old daughter, Lauren, who gulped it between sips from a bottle. 
 ''Nothing tastes like it,'' Mr. Brower said.
 Mr. Brower's home, at the end of a wind-swept street, is decorated with pictures of whaling campaigns. He explained that a few weeks previously, he spent 12 hours helping butcher a 47-foot-long whale that was landed by Mayor Itta's crew. It was carved on the beach and divided among village families. The captain's wife cooked a big dinner for the entire village that evening.
 Mr. Brower, whose family has had 32 years of uninterrupted success catching whales, is concerned that these traditions, which have united villagers and helped them survive for centuries, might get lost in an offshore drilling boom.
 ''They're coming to our lands and disturbing our ancestral way of life,'' he said. ''How would you feel if I drilled in the middle of the New York Harbor?''

HEADLINE: Ford and G.M. Plan To Trim 2008 Output

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting from Dearborn, Mich.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
General Motors and Ford Motor Company, struggling to keep turnaround plans on track, both said Monday that they would cut production in the first quarter because of slowing sales.
 At General Motors, which had fared the best of the three Detroit automakers lately, sales dropped 10.9 percent in November. Chrysler's sales also declined, by 2.1 percent, with lower truck sales overshadowing a 43 percent rise in passenger car sales.
 Ford eked out a 1.3 percent gain, after 12 consecutive monthly sales declines, but largely because of more lower-profit bulk sales to commercial and government fleet operators. Dealership sales were down 3 percent in November. 
 For the second time this year, Detroit accounted for less than half of the United States market, according to Autodata, which tracks industry statistics.
 By contrast, all three major Japanese automakers not only increased sales during November, but all reported their highest sales ever for the month.
 ''The domestic companies were so heavy into trucks and it's only now that they're bringing out new product that has more appeal,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of Autodata. ''Certainly if you're a manufacturer who's heavily reliant on selling pickup trucks and a lot of S.U.V.'s, the market is terrible.''
 G.M. said it expected to produce 950,000 vehicles from January through March, down 11 percent from the same period in 2007. Ford said it planned to build 685,000 vehicles in the first quarter, a 7 percent decline.
 Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said on Monday that the automaker would continue watching the flagging economy and ''adjust our production according to market demand.''
 G.M., whose sales had increased in the three previous months, attributed November's drop to a cutback of sales to rental car companies, as well as low inventories of full-size trucks and sport utility vehicles. It said new models, particularly the Cadillac CTS and Chevrolet Malibu sedans, were selling more quickly than expected.
 But the Detroit automakers are finding it difficult to fight both the economic environment and the negative public perceptions that have plagued them for decades.
 ''There's an inherent advantage for Japanese brands in this environment,'' said Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis at Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers. ''For consumers who have to get a car right now, Toyota or Honda has the image of being a much safer bet in this type of environment. They may not want to try a domestic product that hasn't proven itself yet.''
 G.M. executives said that they expected the housing market to pick up in the second half of 2008 and that the industry would finish that year in better shape.
 ''We think it will be the reverse of this year where we'll run better in the second half of the year than we do in the first,'' said Mark R. LaNeve, G.M.'s North American vice president of sales and marketing.
 G.M.'s chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, told analysts last week that he expected total sales in the United States next year to be 15.7 million, ''with more downside than upside.'' G.M. had assumed annual sales of about 17 million when formulating its restructuring plan several years ago.
 The industry is on pace to sell about 16 million vehicles this year.
 Although the slowdown has hurt Detroit more than its Japanese rivals, it has caused some discomfort for Toyota, which has reported sales declines several times this year. On Monday, Toyota executives acknowledged that it could fall short of its own goal for the Tundra pickup, a vehicle of critical importance to the company.
 Through November, Toyota has sold 177,336 of the Tundra and appears unlikely to reach 200,000, the mark it had set for itself. ''It's still our goal, but it's going to be close,'' said Bob Carter, the Toyota division's general manager.
 For most other carmakers, those numbers would be considered successful, but Toyota has conditioned the market to expect overachievement, and failing to reach 200,000 would be a significant disappointment.
 Mr. Carter said Toyota was otherwise pleased with its performance in the deteriorating market. Its sales rose 0.3 percent in November.
 ''There's a lot going on, but at the same time we have good employment levels and historically low interest rates,'' he said.
 Toyota pulled ahead of Ford this year to become the second-largest seller of vehicles in the United States market. It is on pace to finish the year at least 200,000 vehicles and nearly 1.5 percentage points of market share ahead of Ford's three domestic brands.
 Ford is preparing to sell two of its European brands, Jaguar and Land Rover, and could announce a buyer as soon as this month, Mr. Mulally said Monday.
 ''We will probably have something to announce by the end of this year, or toward the first part of next year,'' Mr. Mulally told reporters at Ford headquarters after a ceremony to sign a new four-year labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union.

HEADLINE: U.S. Senses a Rise in Activity By Al Qaeda in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
American military and intelligence officials are detecting early signs that Al Qaeda may be increasing its activities in Afghanistan, perhaps even seeking to return to its former base of operations, a senior Defense Department official said Monday.
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates arrived in Kabul late Monday for meetings with government leaders and military commanders to discuss how to speed economic and political development at a time of increasing violence.
 The senior Defense Department official, aboard Mr. Gates's plane, said, ''We are seeing early indicators that there may be some stepped-up activity by Al Qaeda.'' No details were offered. 
 The official cautioned, ''It's pretty hard to pull trends out of a few indications,'' but added that even tentative evidence of increased Qaeda activity in Afghanistan ''is something we are concerned with.''
 The official spoke on standard rules of anonymity to discuss intelligence on Al Qaeda and Mr. Gates's agenda before the secretary's third trip to Afghanistan during his first year in office.
 Mr. Gates, in brief comments before landing in Kabul, said he was interested in how combat operations could be better woven into a ''comprehensive development strategy'' to include accelerated economic and political development.
 ''One of the clear concerns we all have is that in the last two or three years there has been an increase in the overall level of violence,'' Mr. Gates said, adding that the rise in attacks and bombings was notable in southern Afghanistan, which had served as the Taliban's spiritual base.
 ''I am not worried about a backslide as much as I am about how we continue the momentum going forward,'' he added.
 Officials said Mr. Gates also planned to assess whether the recent political turmoil in neighboring Pakistan had given greater freedom of movement to Taliban and Qaeda forces in tribal areas along the Afghan border.
 Pentagon and military officials said the higher number of attacks and roadside bombings could be attributed to increased money for the insurgency from foreign sources and profits from domestic poppy production. The officials also attribute the increase in violence to the sanctuary provided in tribal areas of Pakistan that has allowed the Taliban and Al Qaeda to regroup.
 Mr. Gates spent most of Monday in Djibouti, in eastern Africa, to inspect one of the most unusual missions in the American military. The operation, called Task Force Horn of Africa, has not captured or killed a single terrorist or foreign fighter, yet it is viewed by Pentagon officials as a model military deployment.
 The task force's mission is to apply the ''soft power'' Mr. Gates advocated in a Nov. 26 speech at Kansas State University, when he said American counterterrorism efforts required not only combat operations, but also a broader range of economic development and diplomacy.
 American combat personnel in Djibouti train regional armed forces to strengthen their own counterterrorism abilities. Combat engineers build schools and hospitals and dig wells in an effort to promote stability and prevent terrorists from taking root.
 In his first trip to Djibouti, Mr. Gates visited Camp Lemonier, a former French Foreign Legion compound that is home to the 2,000 troops in the task force and support missions. The operation is already shaping the way the Pentagon will organize its efforts in coming years.
 The American military is organizing a new Africa Command, the first American combatant command dedicated solely to Africa. The lessons learned from the operation in Djibouti will shape the command's emphasis on defense as well as on diplomacy and development, according to senior Pentagon officials.
 The mission was first devised to trap terrorists expected to flee Afghanistan along traditional smugglers' routes down the Persian Gulf, into the Arabian Sea and past the Horn of Africa.
 But the overlapping ground, maritime and air patrols across the region appear to have deterred the use of that route.
 American intelligence and military officers say Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups continue to move through the region, with small numbers believed to be operating in ungoverned parts of Somalia, Sudan, Ethiopia and Yemen.

HEADLINE: U.S. Intelligence Finding Says Iran Halted Its Nuclear Arms Effort in 2003

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
A new assessment by American intelligence agencies released Monday concludes that Iran halted its nuclear weapons program in 2003 and that the program remains frozen, contradicting a judgment two years ago that Tehran was working relentlessly toward building a nuclear bomb. 
 The conclusions of the new assessment are likely to reshape the final year of the Bush administration, which has made halting Iran's nuclear program a cornerstone of its foreign policy.
 The assessment, a National Intelligence Estimate that represents the consensus view of all 16 American spy agencies, states that Tehran is likely to keep its options open with respect to building a weapon, but that intelligence agencies ''do not know whether it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons.'' 
 Iran is continuing to produce enriched uranium, a program that the Tehran government has said is intended for civilian purposes. The new estimate says that the enrichment program could still provide Iran with enough raw material to produce a nuclear weapon sometime by the middle of next decade, a timetable essentially unchanged from previous estimates. 
 But the new report essentially disavows a judgment that the intelligence agencies issued in 2005, which concluded that Iran had an active secret arms program intended to transform the raw material into a nuclear weapon. The new estimate declares instead with ''high confidence'' that the military-run program was shut in 2003, and it concludes with ''moderate confidence'' that the program remains frozen. The report judges that the halt was imposed by Iran ''primarily in response to increasing international scrutiny and pressure.''
 It was not clear what prompted the reversal. Administration officials said the new estimate reflected conclusions that the intelligence agencies had agreed on only in the past several weeks. The report's agnosticism about Iran's nuclear intentions represents a very different tone than had been struck by President Bush, and by Vice President Dick Cheney, who warned in a speech in October that if Iran ''stays on its present course, the international community is prepared to impose serious consequences.'' 
 The estimate does not say when intelligence agencies learned that the arms program had been halted, but officials said new information obtained from covert sources over the summer had led to a reassessment of the state of Iran's nuclear program and a decision to delay preparation of the estimate, which had been scheduled to be delivered to Congress in the spring. 
 The new report came out just over five years after a 2002 intelligence estimate on Iraq concluded that it possessed chemical and biological weapons programs and was determined to restart its nuclear program. That estimate was instrumental in winning the Congressional authorization for a military invasion of Iraq, but it proved to be deeply flawed, and most of its conclusions turned out to be wrong. 
 Intelligence officials said the specter of the 2002 estimate on Iraq hung over their deliberations on Iran even more than it had in 2005, when the lessons from the intelligence failure on Iraq were just beginning to prompt spy agencies to adapt a more rigorous approach to their findings.
 The 2007 report on Iran had been requested by members of Congress, underscoring that any conclusions could affect American policy toward Iran at a delicate time. The new estimate brought American assessments more in line with the judgments of international arms inspectors.
 Last month, Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported that Iran was operating 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges capable of producing fissile material for nuclear weapons, but he said inspectors had been unable to determine whether the Iranian program sought only to generate electricity or to also to build weapons.
 Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the Senate majority leader, portrayed the assessment as ''directly challenging some of this administration's alarming rhetoric about the threat posed by Iran'' and called for enhanced diplomatic efforts toward Tehran. Democratic presidential candidates mostly echoed Senator Reid, but also emphasized that Iran's long-term ambitions were still a great concern to the United States.
 In interviews on Monday, some administration officials expressed skepticism about the conclusions reached in the new report, saying they doubted that American intelligence agencies had a firm grasp of the Iranian government's intentions.
 The administration officials also said the intelligence findings would not lessen the White House's concern about the prospect of a nuclear-armed Iran. The fact that Iran continues to refine its abilities to enrich uranium, they said, means that any decision in the future to restart a nuclear weapons program could lead Iran to a bomb in relatively short order. While the new report does not contrast sharply with earlier assessments about Iran's capabilities, it does make new judgments about the intentions of its government.
 Rather than portraying Iran as a rogue, irrational country determined to join the club of nations that possess a nuclear bomb, the estimate says Iran's ''decisions are guided by a cost-benefit approach rather than a rush to a weapon irrespective of the political, economic and military costs.'' 
 The administration called new attention to the threat posed by Iran this year when Mr. Bush suggested in October that a nuclear-armed Iran could lead to ''World War III.'' Mr. Cheney also said that month that as Iran continued to enrich uranium, ''the end of that process will be the development of nuclear weapons.''
 Yet even as Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney were making those statements, analysts at the Central Intelligence Agency were well under way toward revising the earlier assessment about Iran's nuclear arms program. Administration officials said the White House had known at the time that the conclusions about Iran were under review but had not been informed until more recently that intelligence agencies had reversed their 2005 conclusion. 
 In September, officials said, Gen. Michael V. Hayden, the C.I.A. director, and his deputy, Stephen R. Kappes, met with Iran analysts to take a hard look at past conclusions about Iran's nuclear program in light of new information obtained since 2005. 
 ''We felt that we needed to scrub all the assessments and sources to make sure we weren't misleading ourselves,'' said one senior intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
 The estimate concludes that if Iran were to restart its arms program, it would still be at least two years before it would have enough highly enriched uranium to produce a nuclear bomb. But it says it is still ''very unlikely'' Iran could produce enough of the material by then. 
 Instead, the report released on Monday concludes that it is more likely that Iran could have a bomb by the early part to the middle of the next decade. The report states that the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research judges that Iran is unlikely to achieve this goal before 2013, ''because of foreseeable technical and programmatic problems.''
 The estimate concludes that it would be difficult to persuade Iran's leaders to abandon all efforts to get nuclear weapons, given the importance of getting the bomb to Iran's strategic goals in the Middle East. 
 Intelligence officials presented the outlines of the intelligence estimate two weeks ago to several cabinet members, along with Mr. Cheney. During the meeting, officials said, policy makers challenged and debated the conclusions. The final draft of the estimate was presented to Mr. Bush and Mr. Cheney last Wednesday.
 Officials said they now planned to give extensive briefings to American allies like Israel, Britain and France. Israel intelligence officials for years have put forward more urgent warnings about Iran's nuclear abilities than their American counterparts, positing that Iran could get a nuclear bomb this decade. 
 Intelligence officials had said just weeks ago they were ending the practice of declassifying parts of intelligence estimates, citing concerns that analysts might alter their judgments if they knew the reports would be widely publicized. 
 But in a statement on Monday, Donald M. Kerr, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, said that since the new estimate was at odds with the 2005 assessment -- and thus at odds with public statements by top officials about Iran -- ''we felt it was important to release this information to ensure that an accurate presentation is available.''

HEADLINE: Facing Tough Times, Spitzer Prepares for Budget Battle

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Declining enrollment in Medicaid will produce the first drop in state spending on the program in almost a decade, Albany budget officials are estimating.
 But the decrease -- a boon for the Spitzer administration in its efforts to reduce New York's historically burdensome health care costs -- is a rare bit of good fiscal news, as Gov. Eliot Spitzer and the Legislature prepare for battle over how to fill a budget gap estimated at $4.3 billion. 
 The chance of a recession lurks in the background, and with it, the likelihood of further drops in tax revenue. Next November's elections loom just down the road, weakening lawmakers' incentive to compromise on spending. And Mr. Spitzer has already forsworn raising taxes. 
 As was the case last year, some of the sharpest elbowing will probably come over health care spending, along with state aid to schools. ''Health care will clearly be one of the flash points in the budget,'' said Paul E. Francis, the governor's budget director, in an interview last week.
 Mr. Spitzer's efforts to cut the state's payments to hospitals and nursing homes last year provoked a showdown with the state's powerful alliance of hospitals and health care unions, including an episode in March in which Mr. Spitzer dressed down hospital association and union executives in the audience during a speech in Midtown. 
 The executives responded with millions of dollars in blistering television and radio advertisements. The governor obtained most of the savings he sought, but at some cost to his popularity with the voters. 
 And after enduring months of scandal over efforts to tarnish the state's top Republican, followed by public outrage over his plan to issue driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, Mr. Spitzer will begin his second year with a pronounced deficit in his own political capital.
 ''I think that on both sides there is a genuine desire to have a more civil debate than there was last year,'' Mr. Francis said. ''But at the same time, I think they are clearly going to be forceful in protecting their workers.''
 Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said there had already been extensive talks with the administration as well as the Legislature. The association's members, he said, were bearing the brunt of the current budget's health cuts as well as the pain of hospital closings recommended last year by a state commission. ''I say to myself, 'Why should this industry be targeted for any cuts? It's already done its share,''' Mr. Raske said.
 The hospitals and the health workers' unions are likely to find a sympathetic ear among Senate Republicans, a key ally in past budget fights. 
 The Senate and the State Assembly seem in broad agreement with the administration over the threats posed by the crumbling real estate market and layoffs on Wall Street. But the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, recently suggested that the state could tap one-time revenue sources, like cash reserves, to meet any potential budget gap. 
 ''We know it's going to be a tough year. We know it's going to be an election year,'' said Robert B. Ward, the deputy director of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a nonpartisan research organization in Albany. ''When you put those two things together, you sometimes end up with what we call 'creative solutions.'''
 Elizabeth Lynam, the deputy research director of the Citizens Budget Commission, a group that generally advocates lower spending, said the outlook for the approaching negotiations ''doesn't sound very promising.'' 
 The commission was among several groups that criticized the budget enacted this year, which totaled about $121 billion.
 Though cuts to health care spending will be necessary again, Mr. Francis said, they are likely to be distributed differently.
 Even before negotiations begin during the next legislative session, moreover, Mr. Spitzer will need to act on outstanding issues from the last one, like renewing the state's horse-racing franchise, imposing new restrictions on campaign financing and approving capital spending.
 Mr. Francis said specific dollar cuts and spending targets would remain in flux until Mr. Spitzer officially proposes a budget next year. He also said that continued turmoil on Wall Street -- which supplies as much as a fifth of all state tax revenue -- might make things worse. ''This is a difficult budget year,'' he said. ''You have to be willing to accept less.'' In the coming fiscal year, he said, the governor would rather have a budget that kept spending in check than one that met the April budget deadline.
 Putting aside capital projects, which the administration has argued should be considered separately from the state's annual operating expenses, Mr. Francis says the administration will seek a budget that keeps spending growth at 5.3 percent or lower.
 That is well above the rate of inflation but in line with the rate of long-term personal income growth, a less stringent measure that Mr. Spitzer and his aides argue is a better barometer of spending discipline.
 ''We expect that the Legislature will find additional savings to pay for any additional spending they propose,'' Mr. Francis said.

HEADLINE: Calculating Energy Bill's Real Figures

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; John M. Broder contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
Gas mileage would go up under the compromise reached by Congressional leaders last week, but not as high as the trumpeted numbers. And despite the tougher 35 m.p.g. standard, a growing population of drivers would push up total fuel use, as well as greenhouse gas emissions -- but not as rapidly as would occur without the legislation.
 Those are some of the conclusions of auto policy experts, who were still struggling on Monday to determine exactly what the proposal would do, even as President Bush threatened to veto the energy legislation, still under negotiation, that includes these provisions. 
 The fleet average for vehicles in the 2020 model year would be set at 35 miles per gallon, versus about 25 miles per gallon for cars and light trucks today. Both numbers, though, come with a familiar caveat: actual mileage may vary.
 In fact, the actual performance falls short of the current standard by about 20 percent, as would be true as well of the higher standard if the proposal becomes law. 
 Manufacturers will be encouraged to keep selling cars that can burn rich mixtures of ethanol with gasoline, even where there is no place to buy it. The compromise phases out the credit for building ''flex fuel'' cars more slowly than current law does. 
 The compromise establishes a combined standard for cars and light trucks, as opposed to the current system, while also shifting the structure of the rule from a simple average of all car models or all light truck models to an ''attribute based'' system.
 That approach establishes an incentive to build every vehicle, whether a compact or a behemoth, to be as fuel efficient as possible. The standard would be set according to the vehicle's ''footprint,'' its wheelbase and track width.
 In the last few years, the Bush administration had vehemently opposed raising the car standard -- which had not been changed since 1985 -- unless it was given the authority to switch to the footprint system. 
 Light trucks were already on a footprint standard, and the Transportation Department was setting regular, if modest, increases in the standard. But a federal court threw these out last month as not being strict enough.
 The White House on Monday said that the energy bill compromise agreed upon by Congressional leaders failed to satisfy President Bush on a number of points, including the way automobile mileage was measured and regulated.
 Allan B. Hubbard, the director of the White House national economic council, said that Mr. Bush would veto the bill unless what he called ''regulatory uncertainty and confusion'' were removed by requiring the Environmental Protection Agency and the Transportation Department to settle on a single mileage-measuring system.
 On another issue separate from the auto mileage rule, Mr. Hubbard said that Mr. Bush could not accept a mandate that electric utilities generate 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. At the same time, Mr. Hubbard complained that the bill's provision for production of alternative fuels like ethanol do not go as far or as fast as the White House wants. 
 Even if the bill becomes law, the fuel-economy improvement that it calls for will probably not be great enough to prevent some increase in American fuel consumption because of the expected growth in the number of cars on the road and miles traveled.
 In 2020, the combined total of gasoline and ethanol use would be slightly higher than it is today, according to David Friedman of the Union of Concerned Scientists, on whose calculations the Democratic leaders relied.
 What that requirement would mean for car buyers is not completely clear. A much larger number of vehicles are likely to rely on hybrid power systems combining an internal combustion engine and an electric motor, while more fuel-efficient diesel engines would also proliferate. Plug-in hybrids, relying more on power from the electricity grid, are likely to be on the rise.
 Mr. Friedman predicted that by 2020, when the higher standard is to be fully phased in, many more cars are likely to have automatic transmissions with more gears, or a continuously variable transmission, which would translate power from the engine to the wheels with less of a loss. 
 ''The technology is there to increase mileage,'' said Scott Gerber, a spokesman for Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat who helped engineer the compromise. Many more small cars and hybrids will be built, Mr. Gerber added, but ''you're also going to have S.U.V.'s.''
 ''That market is not going to go away, because people like S.U.V.'s.'' 
 At General Motors, Greg Martin, a spokesman, expressed concern about what the changes would do to vehicle prices. 
 ''We have a product plan well under way that will offer more technology and alternative fuel choices now and in the future,'' he said. ''What is unclear, however, is the economic equation, or the price-value judgments, that consumers make in any vehicle purchase.'' 
 At Environmental Defense, John DeCicco, a senior fellow, said: ''I think of necessity we're going to see a slowing down of the horsepower war. They're going to have to take some of that efficiency going forward and allocate it to fuel economy.'' 
 Among the unknowns, of course, is the price of the gasoline that will be saved. If the price is high, either because of market forces or increased taxes, government standards may only have a modest role in promoting smaller or higher-efficiency vehicles, because consumers will already be seeking out fuel efficiency and automakers will have a strong incentive to meet that demand on their own. 
 In the end, the biggest impact of the legislation would come from ending the distinction between cars and light trucks, which include S.U.V.'s, minivans and pickups, eliminating the incentive for companies to move customers into the generally bigger, more profitable S.U.V.'s. Current law sets a floor of 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 22. 2 miles a gallon for light trucks.
 The new system continues to count cars and trucks differently, but requires the government to make sure that the whole fleet reaches the 35 miles per gallon average. If it does not, the Transportation Department must make the car or light truck standard tougher.

HEADLINE: As Clock Ticks, Congress and White House Stand Firm

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush and Congressional Democrats were at a stalemate Monday over federal spending, taxes, domestic surveillance and the war in Iraq, and neither side made a move to negotiate, even though lawmakers have just a few weeks left to wrap up work for the year.
 With Congress back at work after a two-week recess, Mr. Bush and the Democrats spent the day lobbing verbal grenades at one another. Mr. Bush appeared in the Rose Garden to chide lawmakers for failing to finish their work, and his aides said he would do so again at a news conference on Tuesday -- a rare departure for a White House that typically keeps its news conferences a secret until an hour before they occur. 
 ''They have just two weeks to go before they leave town again,'' Mr. Bush said. ''That's not really a lot of time to squeeze in nearly a year's worth of unfinished business.''
 At the Capitol, Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, responded by calling Mr. Bush's arguments ''pretty weak,'' and accusing the president of being intransigent. ''If not for the stubborn refusal of the president and his Republican enablers to work with us,'' Mr. Reid said, ''we would accomplish a lot more.''
 There was little evidence that either side was trying to ease the war of words. 
 The White House said there were no immediate plans to invite Congressional leaders in to talk to the president, and Mr. Reid said he had not spoken to Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, since before Thanksgiving. Mr. Bolten, a former budget director who has respect on Capitol Hill, has helped resolve previous White House budget battles with Congress.
 Tony Fratto, Mr. Bush's deputy press secretary, said Jim Nussle, the budget director, was taking the lead in negotiations over spending. But Mr. Nussle has not met with Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, since Sept. 19, Mr. Obey's aides said, when the pair had drinks on the terrace of Mr. Obey's office overlooking the Washington Monument. The meeting was fruitless.
 The impasse recalls one of an earlier era, between President Bill Clinton and Congressional Republicans at the end of 1995. That dispute ended with a government shutdown -- an outcome Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats say they intend to avoid. But with both sides digging in their heels, strategists said Monday they did not know how the disagreements would be resolved.
 ''It's a huge game of chicken and I'm certain the president is not planning to back down,'' said Charlie Black, a Republican strategist close to the White House. Mr. Bush, Mr. Black said, has ''the zest for this combat.'' 
 But Democrats have a zest for combat as well, and are calculating that the public will be paying more attention to issues like the mortgage crisis than to Mr. Bush's attacks on them. 
 ''This country has bigger problems than the president's manufactured confrontation with the Congress,'' said Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, chairman of the House Democratic caucus. Mr. Emanuel warned of a ''Bush recession'' on the horizon, a signal that the Democrats plan to make the economy a major issue in their 2008 races.
 Some of the disagreements over legislation are complicated by internal disputes among the Democrats themselves.
 Most immediately, for instance, Congress needs to figure out how to prevent the alternative minimum tax, aimed at wealthy families when it was passed in 1969 but never indexed to inflation, from becoming an even greater burden on the middle class. House Democrats want to end certain tax breaks, including those for wealthy private equity fund managers, to compensate for the $50 billion revenue loss that would result from fixing the alternative minimum tax problem. But the White House is opposed, and there is reluctance among some Senate Democrats to end the tax breaks. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, for instance, is said to be uneasy about singling out private equity fund managers.
 On the war, Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve nearly $200 billion in emergency spending. Democrats are proposing $50 billion, which would pay for military operations for a few months, but want to impose a timeline for troop withdrawals. 
 Mr. Bush warned Monday that such a timeline would ''threaten the security of our country,'' adding, ''It's unconscionable to deny funds to our troops in harm's way because some in Congress want to force a self-defeating policy.''
 On spending, Democrats have yet to finish work on 11 of the 12 measures that pay for the day-to-day operations of the government. But even if they do pass the bills, Mr. Bush has threatened to veto most of them, because lawmakers want to spend $22 billion more than the White House has proposed. Senator Reid has said Democrats are willing to meet the White House halfway, and cut $11 billion from their measures, but Mr. Bush has refused.
 The fight over war spending could complicate matters. The Senate Appropriations Committee was said to be working on a catchall bill that would combine the 11 remaining measures into one so-called ''omnibus'' bill. 
 Mr. Bush has said he wants separate bills. But Mr. Fratto left the door open to an omnibus bill, refusing to say whether the president would veto such a measure. ''We can't talk about what the president may or may not sign unless we know what's in it,'' Mr. Fratto said.
 Yet even as the bill was being prepared, the senior Republican on the committee, Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi, was sending signals that he would not support the package unless it included the money Mr. Bush wants for Iraq and Afghanistan.
 Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said he also wanted the war spending issue resolved by the end of the year as part of an omnibus bill. As for timing, Mr. McConnell would not offer a prediction. ''Obviously we don't have any consuming desire to be here until Christmas Eve,'' he said. ''We're working on it.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The People We Have Been Waiting For,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Dec. 2):
 Mr. Friedman provides an uplifting look at efforts around the country to combat global warming and rightly asserts that the next few years are a pivotal time for the future of this planet. The next president of the United States will be uniquely situated to affect this process.
 Although Congress appears to be poised to adopt more stringent fuel economy standards at home, global warming is an international problem that can be solved only through a broad global effort. The next president has the opportunity to make this hope a reality through the development of the successor to the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. 
 This is likely our last chance to mitigate the worldwide effects of global warming. The United States cannot afford to elect another president who doubts the realities of human involvement in climate change.

 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman highlights the Vehicle Design Summit group that is trying to design a car with 200 miles-per-gallon energy equivalency. I would just like to support the argument that these are ''the people we have been waiting for.'' 
 This group of students is truly remarkable, and they are a privilege to teach. Not only are they technically proficient, but they leverage their technological skills with leadership skills. They have come to understand their environment -- with deep knowledge of the technologies, markets, customers and competitors they face.
 They have the ability to listen and persuade key stakeholders, resulting in cooperation and financing from corporations and universities worldwide. They have a vision of a more sustainable future, and invent new ways of organizing a globally distributed organization. 
 They are working to design their organization using X-teams, a new form of adaptive, flexible, efficient teams that develop networks of external relationships. They adapt our theories and concepts and move them into practice almost immediately. 
 While many look at the enormousness of the global problems we face, this group invents new solutions and leads others in new directions. Yes, these are the people we have been waiting for.

 To the Editor:
 I wanted to thank Thomas L. Friedman for highlighting M.I.T.'s student-run Vehicle Design Summit, which is taking an open-source, globally collaborative approach to developing a 200 m.p.g.-equivalent car. 
 I'm a first-year M.B.A. student at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth who's informally advising the team on project management, and I have been blown away by these students' enthusiasm, pragmatism, ingenuity and sheer ambition. 
 I was skeptical at first of the idea of hundreds of engineers from around the world collaborating to build a hyper-efficient car prototype that not only works but is also production-ready; yet after meeting with them I now know that it is going to happen, and much more quickly than I expected.
 As Mr. Friedman hinted at in his column, these are the kids we've been waiting for to change the world, and they're already doing it as undergrads! I'm immensely proud to say I know them, and I am eagerly watching from the sidelines to see what they do next!

HEADLINE: Rate Freeze Said to Offer Limited Aid

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's effort to help borrowers in danger of defaulting on their subprime mortgages could help only a small number of those who took out such loans, industry analysts said Monday.
 Though administration officials have yet to agree on crucial details with mortgage lenders and the securities industry, a similar effort in California is likely to help about 12 percent of borrowers in the state with adjustable-rate subprime loans, according to estimates by Barclays Capital.
 About two million people have subprime mortgages with monthly payments that are likely to jump sharply in the next year or so as their introductory teaser rates expire. 
 On Monday, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said he hoped to reach agreement this week with lenders and institutional investors on a plan to temporarily freeze the teaser rates for certain qualified borrowers. 
 Speaking at a housing conference here organized by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Mr. Paulson said he wanted to ''develop a set of standards'' for modifying subprime loans that the industry could use to speed up decisions on the hundreds of thousands of borrowers at risk of losing their homes.
 But industry analysts and executives were skeptical about the government's ability to produce a high-speed approach to handling thousands of cases with a few simple principles.
 ''There is no cookie-cutter approach that can be taken to this,'' said Bert Ely, a longtime banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''This is going to be a mess.''
 To qualify for help, Mr. Paulson said, borrowers would have to be current on their payments and would have to be able to keep making payments at the introductory rates. Borrowers would not qualify if they were able to either manage the higher payments or refinance with a cheaper mortgage.
 Under the approach Mr. Paulson outlined, deciding who would qualify for a loan modification would require a close assessment of each borrower asking for help. The easiest issue to determine would be whether a borrower has stayed current on monthly payments. The loan-servicing company would then have to estimate how much the payments were likely to increase once the teaser rate expired. 
 Analysts estimate that payments on many subprime mortgages will increase 30 percent or more.
 To decide whether a person qualifies for an extension of the teaser rate, a lender or a loan-servicing company would have to analyze the borrower's monthly income and expenses to determine if he or she could realistically make the higher payments.
 ''The risk is that you could be modifying loans for people who don't need it,'' said Sharon Greenberg, director of mortgage strategy at Barclays. ''There's only so much you can do without talking to the borrower.'' 
 As a result, Ms. Greenberg said, loan-servicing companies would have little choice but to look at the details of a person's monthly expenses, down to items as specific as cable television and grocery bills.
 She predicted that the California loan-modification program, supported by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, would lead to very little change from what big mortgage lenders were already doing.
 John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said the rate freeze would help, but that its impact would depend on the extent to which Wall Street investment firms pushed the idea among investment funds that held mortgage-backed securities.
 ''It's going to be only a limited help if you don't have the absolute commitment of Wall Street to reach into those structured investment vehicles and get their approval,'' Mr. Taylor said.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Paulson's decision to push banks and Wall Street firms toward a blanket approach on subprime loans represented a big shift from his previous views and from the Bush administration's hands-off approach to financial markets. 
 Mr. Paulson emphasized that the new plan would not entail spending tax money. He also made it clear that the Treasury Department was pushing mortgage lenders and the investment funds to act decisively.
 ''We are leading the industry to develop a systemic means of efficiently moving able borrowers into sustainable mortgages,'' he told the housing forum. He strongly suggested that he expected all mortgage-servicing companies to support the new standard for modifying loans.
 ''I hear the tone of a mandate,'' Mr. Ely said. ''It's government-mandated collusion.''
 It remains unclear how tough the implied mandate will be, and administration officials have not even hinted at consequences for companies that do not go along. 
 Mr. Paulson did not disclose how long the temporary rate freeze would last, and that has been a crucial point of disagreement in talks among the government, loan-servicing companies and the groups representing investors in mortgage-backed securities. In recent days, the discussion appears to have centered on a freeze of three to five years.
 Mr. Paulson also announced that the administration was proposing a temporary expansion of authority for states and localities to issue tax-exempt mortgage revenue bonds. 
 The federal government already allows states to issue such bonds to help reduce costs for first-time home buyers. The new proposal would temporarily allow states to issue bonds for money to help people refinance out of subprime mortgages.
 That idea quickly reverberated on the presidential campaign trail. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who recently called for a five-year freeze on subprime loan rates, said Mr. Paulson's idea was similar to one she had proposed.
 ''This is an excellent idea that the administration should have adopted two months ago when I proposed it,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Red Crescent Says 25,000 Iraqi Refugees Have Returned

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY; Abeer Mohammed and Mudhafer al-Husaini contributed reporting from Baghdad, and an Iraqi employee of The New York Times from Kirkuk.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
At least 25,000 Iraqi refugees have returned to their beleaguered homeland from Syria since mid-September, according to preliminary estimates released Monday by the Iraqi Red Crescent. The figure represents a fraction of the estimated 1.5 million Iraqis who fled to Syria in recent years to escape the sectarian violence and ethnic cleansing in Iraq. 
 The agency said the recent widespread drop in violence in Iraq had drawn some refugees back, though it added that many had also run out of money. Recent visa restrictions were forcing people back too. 
 The vast majority of the returning refugees, roughly 20,000, came back to the capital, Baghdad, where their well-being is far from assured. The agency said many had found squatters in their homes and had had to seek sanctuary elsewhere, leading to a rise in the number of people displaced within Iraq.
 The Iraqi government has estimated that a much larger number of Iraqis was returning from Syria. It put the number at 60,000 for September and October, which included all Iraqis who crossed the Syrian border during that time.
 The refugees are finding an altered landscape, with neighborhoods largely ethnically homogenous, reshaped by sectarian strife. Unemployment also hovers at roughly 40 percent, and corruption is rampant, with many people paying bribes to obtain jobs. 
 In a news release on Monday, Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki blamed the government of Saddam Hussein for the widespread corruption. 
 ''We inherited the corruption from previous regimes, and in this new era, the administrative and financial corruption is still going on,'' he said. But 2008, he said, would be the year that a ''war on corruption'' would be declared. 
 ''And also a war on those ignorant and lazy people who do not properly carry out their duties,'' Mr. Maliki said.
 The American military has cautioned that the Iraqi government is ill-prepared to handle the myriad issues faced by returning refugees, among them securing shelter, food and aid. 
 And the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has warned that Iraq is too unstable for large-scale repatriation. Many Baghdad neighborhoods are still unsafe for United Nations workers to visit, according to an agency spokeswoman, a fact that is stymieing efforts to gauge how the returnees are faring. 
 ''Generally, refugees are the best judges of when it is time to go back,'' the spokeswoman, Sybella Wilkes, said from Damascus. ''We think it's a very tenuous situation that can change, but we're ready to support people that make that decision.''
 The Iraqi government is paying each family that returns from abroad 1 million Iraqi dinars, or about $821, roughly enough for four months of rent in a middle-class Baghdad neighborhood. 
 Sporadic violence flared throughout the country on Monday. Maj. Gen. Fawzi Hussein Mohammed, a Sunni adviser to the minister of the interior, was shot and killed in Khadra, a Sunni-dominated neighborhood on the western outskirts of Baghdad. 
 Five off-duty Iraqi soldiers were kidnapped southwest of the northern oil city of Kirkuk. The authorities later found the bodies of four of them. They had been tortured, and the whereabouts of the fifth soldier was unknown. 
 The group had been abducted on its way to a wedding party for a brother of one of them.

HEADLINE: Health Insurance for All, Only if Everyone Pays?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mandates and Mudslinging'' (column, Nov. 30): Paul Krugman dismisses Senator Barack Obama's points about health insurance mandates as ''echoing right-wing talking points'' on health care. Really? 
 It was two pragmatic Republican governors, Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, who proposed mandates as cornerstones of their respective health reform plans. 
 In California, resistance to that approach has come primarily from unions and Democrats. Although I have favored the mandate component of Mr. Schwarzenegger's plan, Mr. Obama raises valid points about the practicality of immediate mandates as the path to universality. 
 In California, there are real questions about whether the insurance that people would be required to buy and able to afford, even with subsidies, would be worth having. Massachusetts has already had to grant waivers to many. 
 In addressing this issue, carrots may prove more effective than heavy-handed sticks. John Walkmeyer 
 San Ramon, Calif., Nov. 30, 2007
 To the Editor:
 As a devoted reader who agrees with Paul Krugman 99 percent of the time, I urge him to rethink his stand on health insurance mandates.
 Consider:
 We mandate car insurance because of the damage a half-ton of hurtling steel can do to others, but we don't mandate that a car owner insure himself. 
 If health insurance coverage were mandated, it would be like setting up a parallel taxation. While a single-payer system would be far more efficient, it now seems even more unattainable. 
 If Senator Barack Obama points out why Republicans will defeat the plans of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton or John Edwards, he's not ''echoing right-wing talking points'' but rather anticipating Republican criticisms. 
 We shouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, particularly when perfect will be defeated. Good policy is useless if it's also bad politics. 
 Mr. Krugman's policy recommendations may have some merit, but his political advice, in this case, is flawed.

HEADLINE: Now And Forever

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Most of the time we pretend it's not there: The staggering financial cost of the war in Iraq, which continues to soar, unchecked, like a rocket headed toward the moon and beyond.
 Early last year, the Nobel-Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz estimated that the ''true'' cost of the war would ultimately exceed $1 trillion, and maybe even $2 trillion.
 Incredibly, that estimate may have been low. 
 A report prepared for the Democratic majority on the Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate warns that without a significant change of course in Iraq, the long-term cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan could head into the vicinity of $3.5 trillion. The vast majority of those expenses would be for Iraq.
 Priorities don't get much more twisted. A country that can't find the money to provide health coverage for its children, or to rebuild the city of New Orleans, or to create a first-class public school system, is flushing whole generations worth of cash into the bottomless pit of a failed and endless war.
 ''The No. 1 reason that the war in Iraq should end,'' said Senator Charles Schumer, chairman of the joint committee, ''is the loss of life that is occurring without accomplishing any of the goals that even President Bush put forward.''
 But ''right below that,'' he said, is the need to stop squandering incredible amounts of money that could be put to better use -- helping to ''make people's lives better'' -- here at home. That colossal and continuing waste, he said, ''should cause anxiety in anyone who cares about the future of this country. I know it causes me anxiety.''
 President Bush's formal funding requests for Iraq have already exceeded $600 billion. In addition to that, the report offers estimates of the war's ''hidden costs'' from its beginning to 2017: the long-term costs of treating the wounded and disabled; interest and other costs associated with borrowing to finance the war; the money needed to repair or replace military equipment; the increased costs of military recruitment and retention; and such difficult to gauge but very real costs as the loss of productivity from those who have been killed or wounded.
 What matters more than the precision of these estimates (Republicans are not happy with them) is the undeniable fact that the costs associated with the Iraq war are huge and carry with them enormous societal consequences.
 Far from seeking a halt to the war, the Bush administration has been considering a significant U.S. military presence in Iraq that would last for many years, if not decades. There has been very little public discussion and no thorough analysis of the overall implications of such a policy.
 What is indisputable, however, is that everything associated with the Iraq war has cost vastly more than the administration's absurdly sunny forecasts. The direct appropriations are already roughly 10 times the amount of the administration's original estimates of the entire cost of the war.
 Senator Schumer and other Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee have been trying (not very successfully, so far) to get other policy makers and the public at large to focus on the sheer insanity of pumping hundreds of billions -- if not trillions -- of public dollars into a failed venture with no end even remotely in view.
 There are myriad better ways to use the many millions of dollars that the U.S. spends on Iraq every day. Two important long-term investments that come to mind -- and that would put large numbers of Americans to work -- are the development of a serious strategy for achieving energy independence over the next several years and the creation of a large-scale program for rebuilding the aging American infrastructure.
 To get to those, or any number of other important initiatives, the country's leaders will have to somehow get past their bizarre reluctance to end this debilitating war. 
 I asked Senator Schumer how soon he thought U.S. forces should leave Iraq. He said: ''You start withdrawing in three months and be out in a year. In my view, there would be a small force left -- 10,000 or 15,000 -- to deal with any Al Qaeda camps that might be set up. But that's it.''
 His words were echoed in another context by Senator Jim Webb, a Virginia Democrat (and also a member of the Joint Economic Committee), who said on ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday that ''it's not in the strategic interest of the United States'' to have a long-term military presence in Iraq.
 Youngsters who were just starting high school when the U.S. invaded Iraq are in college now. Their children, yet unborn, will be called on to fork over tax money to continue paying for the war.
 Seriously. How long do we want this madness to last?

HEADLINE: Candidates Hold to Their Stances on Iran

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Dec. 3 

 BODY:
The campaigns of the leading Democratic candidates seized Monday on an intelligence report showing that Iran had halted its development of nuclear weapons, saying the findings justified their more cautious approach to Tehran.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's national security director, Lee Feinstein, said the report's findings ''expose the latest effort by the Bush administration to distort intelligence to pursue its ideological ends.'' He added that the report ''vindicates'' Mrs. Clinton's approach, which he described as ''vigorous American-led diplomacy, close international cooperation and effective economic pressure, with the prospect of carefully calibrated incentives if Iran addresses our concerns.''
 In fact, in September Mrs. Clinton, Democrat of New York, voted in favor of a Senate measure declaring the Iranian Revolutionary Guards ''proliferators of mass destruction,'' a vote that was condemned by her rivals in the Democratic field. After the vote, her aides issued a statement saying, ''The Revolutionary Guards are deeply involved in Iran's nuclear program.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton's rivals used the release of the report on Iran on Monday to condemn the Bush administration, as well as to once again attack Mrs. Clinton's vote on declaring the guards a terrorist organization. That vote, they suggested, was evidence of her hawkishness on Iran. 
 ''The juxtaposition of this N.I.E. with the president's suggestion of World War III serves as an important reminder of what we learned with the 2002 National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq,'' said Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, in a statement. ''Members of Congress must carefully read the intelligence before giving the president any justification to use military force.''
 Republicans, who have been condemning Iran in the campaign, reacted more tentatively to the report, without backing away from their past statements about Tehran, including talk of military strikes and ''bombardments.''
 ''For years now, the Islamic Republic of Iran has defied and played games with every international effort aimed at persuading the country to halt enriching uranium,'' Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, said in a statement. ''Sanctions and other pressures must be continued and stepped up until Iran complies by halting enrichment activities in a verifiable way.'' 
 That was a shift in tone from his previous comments, but he did not say that he may have overstated the case against Iran.
 In October, speaking to the Republican Jewish Coalition, Mr. Giuliani said: ''As we all know, Iran is seeking nuclear weapons, and they're threatening to use them. If I'm president of the United States, I guarantee you we will never find out what they will do if they get nuclear weapons, because they're not going to get nuclear weapons.''
 Even before the report was released, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, had scheduled a speech in Iowa on how the United States could avoid war with Iran. He gave the most detailed reaction and rebuttal to those who were sounding increasingly hawkish.
 The new intelligence, he said in the speech, clearly shows that ''war is not inevitable.'' 
 Other Republican candidates echoed Mr. Giuliani in suggesting continued adherence to a muscular approach to Iran. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has talked more often about the theoretical challenge of a nuclear-armed leadership in Tehran than about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 When asked about the intelligence report at a news conference here, he did not back down from his past statements.
 ''I believe we are always strongest when we negotiate from a position of resolve,'' he said. ''The economic and diplomatic sanctions that I described make all the sense in the world.''
 As to his past language about the potential for a need to confront Iran, he said, ''Of course we will maintain our military options.'' 
 Neither Mr. Giuliani nor Mr. Romney seemed to address the idea that their past hawkish statements were based on intelligence that has proved flawed -- reminiscent of the intelligence about unconventional weapons that led to the war in Iraq.
 ''I have not said anything in that regard I regret,'' Mr. Romney said.
 Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, has taken a slightly different line on Iran than his rivals, often focusing on reports that it was supplying weapons to militias in Iraq that were being used against American troops.
 Mr. McCain said the release of the report was such a ''rare occasion'' that he would still ''have to try and make sense of it'' before commenting in depth. But he did say that Iran was still bent on the destruction of Israel and on interfering in Iraq, and that therefore the sanctions against Tehran were appropriate. Referring to the war in Iraq, he said, ''We were deceived by intelligence reports in that situation,'' and because of that, the public is ''justifiably skeptical.''

HELP FOR HOMEOWNERS Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said he hoped to reach agreement this week with lenders and institutional investors on a plan to temporarily freeze the teaser rates for certain qualified mortgage borrowers. But industry analysts said the effort could help only a small number of those who took out such loans. 
 DETROIT AUTOMAKERS STRUGGLE General Motors and the Ford Motor Company said that they would cut production in the first quarter because of slowing sales. At G.M., sales dropped 10.9 percent in November; Ford eked out a 1.3 percent gain, after 12 consecutive monthly sales declines. [C4.] 
 ESTATE BATTLE GETS DIRTY An unfolding drama over the estate of Seth Tobias, a wealthy investment manager, is providing a lurid account of fast money and faster living in the volatile world of hedge funds. Mr. Tobias's four brothers and his wife are locked in a legal battle over the estate, which is worth at least $25 million. [C1.]
 WHALERS VS. OIL DRILLERS Royal Dutch Shell wants to exploit vast reserves thought to lie off the coast of Alaska, a move that threatens the traditional way of life of the Inupiat, natives of Alaska's north coast. A court hearing is scheduled to consider whether the company can move forward, though a ruling is not expected for months. [C1.]
 MILEAGE RULES NO PANACEA Auto policy experts said that total fuel use, and greenhouse gas emissions, would probably rise under the compromise reached by Congressional leaders last week, despite the tougher 35 m.p.g. standard. [C1.]
 CANCER DRUG DISAPPOINTS An analysis by the staff of the Food and Drug Administration appeared to dim the prospects that Genentech's drug Avastin would win approval as a treatment for breast cancer. The drug did not help women with breast cancer live meaningfully longer, the agency staff said, and it caused significant side effects. [C2.]
 BUFFETT EXPECTED TO TESTIFY In court papers, federal prosecutors said for the first time that Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, was on the witness list in the trial of five insurance executives accused of helping the American International Group manipulate its finances through $500 million in false transactions. [C4.]
 FEARING SAMSUNG'S SCANDAL For weeks, the manufacturing giant Samsung has been battered by accusations of corruption. But because South Korea's economy is so heavily dependent on a handful of conglomerates like Samsung, Koreans fear that striking these behemoths too harshly may hurt their own economic well-being. [C4.]
 MYSPACE UNPLUGGED In an attempt to position itself as a destination for hearing and buying music, MySpace is inviting musicians to perform songs for a program called Transmissions. The Web site will show and sell videos of the performance. [C5.]
 GUARANTEEING LIQUIDITY The German bank WestLB said that it would guarantee full liquidity to several of its structured investment vehicles that had put money into asset-backed securities, including ones backed by American mortgages. [C5.]
 A CRUNCH FOR AD SPENDING Three analysts predicted that growth in advertising spending in the United States was slowing considerably, but they said the continuing strength of online ad spending should keep the industry from heading into a recession. Advertising: Stuart Elliott. [C6.]
 GROWTH IN MANUFACTURING A trade group said manufacturing had expanded in November as new orders and production improved, but it reported a decline in its employment index. [C7.]
 SURVIVAL GUIDE To ensure the survival of a Florida fund whose subprime-tainted holdings led to withdrawal of almost half its $27 billion in assets, BlackRock, the asset management firm hired to advise the state, recommended that the remaining holdings be split into two entities. [C7.]
 DRIVERS WANTED The $2.4 billion chauffeured transportation business in the United States is doing well, industry trackers say, a trend that is bolstering the limousine market overseas. [C8.]
 A SECOND CHANCE FOR IMUS Nearly eight months after being fired for making a racially and sexually disparaging remark about the Rutgers women's basketball team, Don Imus returned to radio and vowed to not say anything like it again. [E1.] 
 BUNKING UP Until recently, room sharing by business travelers was confined mostly to trips to seminars or training sessions. But a recent survey conducted for Orbitz for Business found that 24 percent of business travelers age 18 to 65 say they have been required to share a room with a colleague on a road trip. On the Road: Joe Sharkey. [C8.]
 MORE UNSCRIPTED TV FARE Broadcast television networks announced winter schedules weighted with reality programming, as original episodes of scripted comedies and dramas dry up because of the Writers Guild of America strike. [C9.]
 VERIFONE SHARES PLUNGE A record 46 percent slide in its stock erased nearly half of VeriFone's market value after the maker of electronic-payment equipment said accounting errors wiped out four-fifths of pretax profit for the first nine months of 2007. [C10.]

HEADLINE: In the New Japan, Rural Economies Wane as Cities Thrive

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: NOSHIRO, Japan 

 BODY:
The only outward sign of conflict here is the red flags of protest, but this small logging city on Japan's remote northern coast is seething. 
 A proliferation of national chain stores outside town has already forced the closing of about half of the city's once teeming central shopping district. Now, many in this normally restrained rural community see the megamall being built nearby, by a company based near Tokyo, as the final nail in the coffin of their economy.
 ''We don't want to fight, but we are desperate,'' said Seiji Yanagihara, an official with the Noshiro Chamber of Commerce, which opposes the mall. ''Tokyo is eating all the goodies, and not even leaving us with scraps from the table.''
 Japan's $4.7 trillion economy has expanded for the last five and a half years. Urban centers like Tokyo and Nagoya, the seat of the Japanese car industry, are thriving, as seen in the building boom decorating Tokyo's skyline with glittering new high-rises. 
 But in regions like Akita, the mountainous northern prefecture that is home to Noshiro, downtowns have emptied and factories have closed, and an exodus to Tokyo of youths seeking jobs has left behind towns that are predominantly for the elderly. 
 There is widespread concern here that these changes are turning Japan into a nation divided into winners and losers, split geographically between prosperous cities and the depressed rural areas. Many here attribute this growing disparity to Japan's embrace of American-style economic liberalization, begun in the 1990s to end the nation's decade of stagnation. 
 The measures to open up markets helped revive cities like Tokyo and lowered prices for Japan's long-suffering urban middle class. But elsewhere in Japan, they are seen as bringing unwelcome and wrenching change.
 And now, with recent signs of a coming economic slowdown in Japan, divisions could deepen. On Monday, Japan's top central banker, Toshihiko Fukui, warned of ripples from the housing downturn in the United States, one of Japan's largest overseas markets. He said he was particularly concerned about the impact on Japan's small and midsize companies, many of which are in rural areas.
 The new economic policies are blamed for undoing one of Japan's proudest achievements after World War II, the creation of an egalitarian society that was almost uniformly middle class. They have also eroded one of the pillars of Japan's postwar political stability, rural voters' stalwart support for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
 The changes began during Japan's doldrums, when the government tried to revive growth by slowly but steadily deregulating entire swaths of the economy, like banking, insurance and groceries. As seen in Noshiro, some of the biggest upheavals followed the lifting of restrictions on large stores, a step originally urged by Washington to admit American retailers. 
 As in the United States, this has filled the countryside with large shopping malls and strips of chain stores, some American but most domestic, at the expense of town centers.
 Rural areas also lost out in the 1990s because of the gradual dismantling of government-sanctioned price cartels, which had guaranteed jobs by protecting industries from ''excessive competition.'' As Japan's markets opened, a flood of cheaper industrial and textile products from China and other Asian countries gutted local economies, which still depend heavily on manufacturing. 
 Rural areas were hit hard again in the early 2000s, when Junichiro Koizumi, then prime minister, tried to unshackle the private sector by shrinking the government. Akita lost thousands of construction jobs as Mr. Koizumi made deep cuts in public works projects, which had been a way to redistribute Tokyo's tax revenue to the countryside. 
 The economic hardships have led to a growing sense of resentment that began to spill into national politics in July. 
 Angry rural voters handed the Liberal Democrats a crushing defeat in elections for the upper house of Parliament. This rural discontent has helped the opposition Democratic Party of Japan, which made closing Japan's regional economic gaps the central plank of its campaign. 
 Many opposition politicians now talk about halting or rolling back American-style liberalization to protect traditional ways of life. Many blame Washington for having pushed Japan into opening markets. Stung by defeat, the chastened Liberal Democrats and their new leader, Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda, have backed away from their support of economic liberalization and have begun emphasizing steps to fix regional disparities. 
 ''The elections were the first scream of distress by Japan's regions,'' said Daigo Matsuura, an opposition Democratic Party member from Akita who defeated the ruling party incumbent in July for a seat in the upper house. ''America pressured Japan into making these changes. The result was the birth of regional economic gaps.''
 Whatever the cause, the widening of these gaps is apparent in government statistics. Over the last decade, Tokyo's economy has grown 6.9 percent. Land prices in the capital are rising so fast that there is talk of a property bubble, and the city's population has grown by 900,000, to 12.7 million residents, at a time when Japan's overall population growth has flattened. 
 By contrast, Akita's economy and population have both shrunk by about 7 percent in the last decade, and land prices have been dropping for 15 years. Akita's average annual income has fallen to 2.3 million yen, or about $20,000, exactly half Tokyo's average. 
 Last year, after the restrictions on building large stores were lifted, Aeon, one of Japan's largest retail companies, proposed a 378,000-square-foot shopping center near Noshiro that would be the largest in northern Akita. The mayor and consumer groups in this city of 60,000 have supported the plan, saying it would bring more jobs and cheaper prices. But they face bitter opposition from the local business establishment, particularly merchants.
 Residents say it is the first time they have seen the community so divided. 
 Opponents have erected red flags saying ''Oppose Aeon!'' and are seeking a referendum on whether to allow the mall. The notion that a company, and particularly one from near Tokyo, can come in and compete with their businesses runs against the grain in rural communities like this one, where a tradition of harmonious coexistence has made the creation of economic winners and losers abhorrent.
 ''This is the first time that I've seen people here so up in arms,'' said Munenori Kitagawa, 64, owner of a women's clothing store he inherited from his father. 
 Mr. Kitagawa opposes the mall. ''We are fighting for our survival,'' he said. 
 For all of Japan, the question now is whether this sort of reaction will be strong enough to stop or reverse economic liberalization. The central government has already begun to tighten restrictions on large stores, and many in rural areas are calling for more public works. 
 But many in Tokyo and regions like Akita say Japan's soaring fiscal deficits make it impossible to return fully to the old ways, and many advocate opening markets further. 
 Some analysts and politicians fear that Japan is entering a period of political stalemate, with the government taking no significant steps in either direction.
 ''There is no more consensus on economic policy,'' said Heizo Takenaka, a former economic policy minister who earlier this decade was an architect of many of the changes.
 So far, regions like Akita have not adapted on their own to the changing economic environment. In interviews, local business leaders bemoaned their declining fortunes,but also quickly dismissed suggestions that they seek new opportunities in nearby emerging markets like China or Russia, which sits just across the narrow Sea of Japan from Akita. 
 Indeed, local leaders who have tried to make changes complain of running into a thicket of local interest groups and powerful bureaucrats in Tokyo -- both forces against altering the status quo. Norihisa Satake, the mayor of Akita city, the prefecture's capital, says he has hit such obstacles as he has tried to promote revitalization plans like expanding his city's port for large Russian ships, luring tourists from Tokyo or even holding a one-day jazz festival.
 ''It's hard to convince people that they need to adapt to economic changes,'' Mr. Satake said. ''It's as if they still want to use horse-drawn carts to compete in the age of the auto.''
 But in small ways, some in Akita are learning to adapt. 
 Arata Chinda, whose used-book store in Noshiro is one of only 10 shops left on a downtown commercial street filled with either shuttered storefronts or vacant lots, said sales at his store had fallen 90 percent in the last decade. But instead of giving up, he has found an alternative marketplace online.
 Mr. Chinda, 60, says he now supplements his income by selling used fantasy card games, which were popular in Akita, to collectors elsewhere in Japan. But he said he is the exception.
 ''It will take 10 or 20 years for this city to think of new ideas,'' he said. ''By that time, the downtown will be nothing but a ghost town.''

HEADLINE: Writers Find Haven On an Ivy Campus

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
College coaches have long scoured the country for supremely quick point guards who can transform a basketball team or fierce linebackers who can dominate a football game. Al Filreis is also perpetually on the lookout for talented high school students, although the ones he seeks do remarkable things with a pen or keyboard. He recruits writers.
 Dr. Filreis, an English professor at the University of Pennsylvania, is the faculty director of the Kelly Writers House, an unusual, largely extracurricular community of people passionate about writing: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, screenwriting, songwriting and myriad other forms. At an elite university filled with undergraduates preparing for professional and graduate schools -- and on a campus in which the Wharton School can literally cast the largest shadow -- the Writers House is an oasis for the arts set, for the unconventional, even the countercultural.
 The house, an old, three-story Tudor cottage on Locust Walk in the center of campus here, features an array of events. There are readings, both by aspiring undergraduates and by some of the country's most celebrated poets, nonfiction writers and novelists, including Richard Ford, John Updike and Cynthia Ozick. There are lectures, workshops, songwriters' performances, writing sessions with local high school students, and lunches, dinners and two-day seminars with writers. Some classes are also held on the comfortable couches and chairs in the Writers House. 
 ''For me, this is Swarthmore, Reed or Bard, here in the middle of a big research university,'' said Dr. Filreis, a bearded, often beaming professor of modern and contemporary poetry whose enthusiasm and avuncular demeanor seem to permeate the Writers House. ''This is a little bit of Bard. You can come in and people know who you are.''
 ''This is not just about writing,'' he said. ''That's almost incidental.''
 So what is the point? ''Apprenticeship, mentorship, internship,'' Dr. Filreis said. The goal, he added, ''is to enrich the undergraduates' lives outside the classroom.''
 When he took the keys 12 years ago to the badly run-down cottage, for decades the home of a university chaplain, the professor's intention was to create a loose-knit community of people who cared about the craft of writing and were willing to promote it. Today, people from across Penn's vast assortment of schools and disciplines -- nurses, engineers, business students, even a veterinarian -- take part in the center's programs. 
 But for what Dr. Filreis calls ''this free space, this sandbox, this incubator'' to survive and prosper, the Writers House requires an ever renewable corps of undergraduates. And so, after he quickly obtained a $1 million gift to renovate the house, Dr. Filreis set out to populate it. He began recruiting talent, and with no less effort or fervor than his colleagues in the athletic department.
 ''My line is, if you were a swimmer and you felt your backstroke was the best, the coach would be recruiting you,'' he said. ''Why can't I behave like the swim coach?''
 Dr. Filreis said he hears from at least 150 high school students a year. They typically learn about the Writers House through word of mouth, especially from alumni. Some also learn about the program through readings and fund-raisers that Dr. Filreis organizes several times a year in New York and other large cities.
 Sixty to 80 of these students turn out each year to be seriously interested in writing; many of them visit the Writers House, spending time, often with their parents, chatting with Dr. Filreis in his cozy garret office. He writes letters to the admissions office for a portion of them, advocating their selection. Last year he wrote about 25 such letters, and he said his success rate at helping them get in is high.
 ''The reason why admissions likes the Writers House is that this is a kid I'm going to take under my wing,'' he said. ''If you take this kid, she's going to succeed because I'm going to take care of her.'' 
 Students, like anyone else at the university, can decide how involved they want to be. Participation can vary from the shy poet who occasionally attends a reading at the house to the outgoing aspiring sportswriter who camps out on a green couch in an alcove off the living room nearly every afternoon and evening.
 Eric Karlan, a junior who was recruited by Dr. Filreis, is the couch's constant companion. ''I do all my homework here,'' he said during lunch one afternoon with a half-dozen other students in the dining room. ''If I don't show up for a couple of days, people call and say, 'Are you sick? Are you dead?'''
 ''It's more than a community,'' Mr. Karlan added, ''it's a family. Al is the bearded patriarch, and these guys are my brothers and sisters.''
 Not long after Mr. Karlan arrived at Penn, he told Dr. Filreis that he would like to start a literary magazine. Less than a month later, the professor persuaded a donor to endow the magazine, appropriately called The Green Couch.
 ''It's a very nurturing place,'' said Cecilia Corrigan, a junior who writes poetry and plays, and who was also recruited by Dr. Filreis. ''It was immediately so welcoming and individualized.''
 ''Here I've found the most amazing mentors,'' Ms. Corrigan said. ''You can connect with professors one on one.''
 Jamie-Lee Josselyn came to the university from a small town in southern New Hampshire, primarily because of the Writers House. Dr. Filreis was appointed her adviser, and before she had ever attended a class at Penn, she had been at his house for pizza with the other students he was advising.
 Once intensely shy, Ms. Josselyn said it took her two years to become deeply involved with the Writers House. She graduated in 2005 and never left, becoming Dr. Filreis's assistant. Now every morning before coming to campus, she works on a memoir of her mother, who died when she was 12.
 ''I wasn't able to say, 'I'm a writer,' when I first came to the Writers House,'' Ms. Josselyn said. ''We use the phrase a lot -- a place to stand. You need a place to stand.''
 A network of alumni supports the program and offers encouragement and professional advice to students. In addition, a number of well-known writers and poets who have spent time here have become unofficial alumni. This is all extremely gratifying, Dr. Filreis told a large gathering for a reading at the Louis K. Meisel Gallery in SoHo one evening in November that was organized by the Writers House. 
 But the larger point, he said in the quiet of his office the previous day, was that he and his students had created a community, and together they had enhanced the standing of the literary arts at a university better known for its economic forecasts. Dr. Filreis invoked the mentor who brought him to Penn 22 years ago, Robert Lucid, an English professor who died last December.
 ''If Bob were here,'' the professor said, ''he'd say what's really important is that Penn has been enlivened by these kids.''

HEADLINE: Drink and Be Merry: Wine Prices to Rise

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
THE signs, at best, have been wretched. The price of oil has shot up, and the dollar has plunged to new lows. For lovers of European wines in particular, it's a recipe for skyrocketing prices.
 So far, though, what has seemed inevitable has yet to occur. Price increases have been modest at best.
 But the bad news may simply have been delayed. In three to five months, many in the wine trade say, the pressure will become irresistible, and prices for European Union wines will rise.
 ''It's like a huge bubble that's about to burst,'' said Joshua Wesson, a founder of Best Cellars, a wine retail chain based in New York, which was recently acquired by the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company. 
 Importers and distributors of European wines say they have essentially held the line on prices for months, even though they have had to pay more as the dollar has sunk and their own profits have eroded. Their reason? The fickle nature of wine consumers.
 The beer and spirits industries are built on consumer loyalty to brand names, but aside from a few successful brands like Yellow Tail and Santa Margherita, wine consumers buy for different reasons, like price.
 ''When the price of your favorite Pouilly-Fuisse goes up you go to a different Macon,'' said Gary Vaynerchuk, director of operations at Wine Library, a big retail store in Springfield, N.J. ''The culture actually induces you to go out and try other things.'' With the holiday season accounting for an enormous percentage of annual wine sales, importers and distributors have been especially loath to raise prices significantly at this point in the year. But that's likely to change in 2008.
 ''They've held back because they haven't wanted to lose market share,'' said Mr. Wesson, who is now A&P's senior director for beer, wine and spirits. 
 ''That's good and wise of them,'' he said, ''because there's so much product out there and very little loyalty. But almost to a man and woman in the wine business, that ability to hold back price increases has to come to an end, because no one anticipated the dollar would be as weak as it has become.''
 How high might prices go? Bill Deutsch, chairman of W. J. Deutsch & Sons, which imports wines ranging from Georges Duboeuf to high-end Bordeaux like Chateau Leoville Barton, estimated that wines tied to the euro would increase in price by 10, 20 or even 30 percent.
 ''I think the prices that consumers have seen these past couple of years will be a fond memory in about three to five months,'' he said.
 Price rises, of course, are nothing new to wine consumers. The price of Bordeaux shoots up when critics laud a particular vintage, as they did the vintages of 2000, 2003 and 2005. In between they may come down, but rarely to pre-hype levels. Prices for Champagne and Burgundy have never been as high as they are now. But those sorts of increases result more from higher demand than from currency values.
 Domestically, prices for Napa cabernets have climbed steadily, as has the price of pinot noir, simply because consumer demand is so great. In fact, California vintners are so desperate for pinot noir that they are now turning to other countries for wine, which they bottle in California.
 ''We see bulk shipments coming in like crazy from southern France and everywhere that were previously all California,'' said Eileen Fredrikson of Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, a wine industry analyst in California. ''They need it, and they can't get it anywhere.''
 This use of European imports may raise the domestic price of pinot noir, which is already high because of the demand, but in the near future many other California wines may be seen as better values, especially in relation to European wines and those from Australia and New Zealand, which have also been buffeted by the fall of the dollar.
 ''This will be an enormous opportunity for California,'' Mr. Vaynerchuk of Wine Library said. ''All of a sudden a $7 Bogle to some people will seem attractive.''
 Of course, the American wine industry has problems too. The price of labor has climbed, and the rising price of oil affects the cost of transportation in the United States as well as in Europe, although shipping costs add more to the cost of a European wine.
 Producers of moderately priced European wines who depend on the American market will most likely be hurt once retail prices are increased in the United States. Looking ahead to that moment, David Bowler, a small importer and distributor in New York, said, ''It's definitely painful in areas like Pouilly-Fuisse and Loire Valley reds, which are not so popular to begin with.''
 Bigger companies with more financial wherewithal may be a little more cushioned. Mr. Deutsch, the importer of Yellow Tail, said his partner in Australia, Casella Wines, hedged its bets with currency purchases, so its prices will remain stable for the near future.
 Mr. Deutsch, who has been in the business for 47 years, said the only time he could remember similar pressures on wine prices was in the mid-1980s, when the dollar was also weak. But sales were affected only briefly.
 When wholesale wine prices rise, prices in restaurants can be expected to rise as well, though a bit of a lag may occur as restaurants sell off wine they bought when the dollar was stronger.
 Ronn Weigand, publisher of Restaurant Wine, an industry newsletter, said that restaurants were already stocking up on wines that would offer better value to consumers.
 ''The little wines of Portugal, of France and Italy, and especially the wines of Spain,'' Mr. Weigand said. ''I'm sensing nervousness not just about the economy but about the political situation worldwide.''
 Not everybody is mired in pessimism. Adam Strum, the editor and publisher of Wine Enthusiast Magazine, said he believes that wine is a better value today than ever before, because improvements in winemaking techniques and an increase in competition have kept prices fair. 
 ''The leap in quality that's being delivered in wine, and the competition -- those two factors offset the decline of the dollar,'' he said.
 Meanwhile, those who don't want to pay higher prices might consider building up a supply now, or looking for values elsewhere. One possible place to turn is Argentina, which is among the few winemaking countries whose currencies have lost ground against the dollar. Portugal continues to be a source of great values. Eastern Europe is rapidly rebuilding its wine industries, and wines from Slovenia, Hungary and the Czech Republic may be good values even if they are tied to the euro. 
 So may less celebrated areas of France, Italy and Spain, like Campania and Sicily, lesser areas near the Loire and the Rhone Valley or unknown Languedoc wines like picpoul.
 ''This is a sommelier's dream,'' Mr. Wesson said. ''They won't have to try so hard to convince anybody to try picpoul. I would be going long on picpoul.''

HEADLINE: Intercepting Iran's Take On America

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
There are two intelligence analyses that are relevant to the balance of power between the U.S. and Iran -- one is the latest U.S. assessment of Iran, which certainly gave a much more complex view of what is happening there. The other is the Iranian National Intelligence Estimate of America, which -- my guess -- would read something like this:
 To: President Ahmadinejad 
 From: The Iranian Ministry of Intelligence
 Subject: America
 As you'll recall, in the wake of 9/11, we were extremely concerned that the U.S. would develop a covert program to end its addiction to oil, which would be the greatest threat to Iranian national security. In fact, after Bush's 2006 State of the Union, in which he decried America's oil addiction, we had ''high confidence'' that a comprehensive U.S. clean energy policy would emerge. We were wrong. 
 Our fears that the U.S. was engaged in a covert ''Manhattan Project'' to achieve energy independence have been ''assuaged.'' America's Manhattan Project turns out to be largely confined to the production of corn ethanol in Iowa, which, our analysts have confirmed from cellphone intercepts between lobbyists and Congressmen, is nothing more than a multibillion-dollar payoff to big Iowa farmers and agro-businesses.
 True, thanks to Nancy Pelosi, the U.S. Congress decided to increase the miles per gallon required of U.S. car fleets by the year 2020 -- which took us by surprise -- but we nevertheless ''strongly believe'' this will not lead to any definitive breaking of America's oil addiction, since none of the leading presidential candidates has offered an energy policy that would include a tax on oil or carbon that could trigger a truly transformational shift in America away from fossil fuels. 
 Therefore, it is ''very likely'' that Iran's current level of high oil revenues will last for decades and insulate our regime from any decisive pressures from abroad or from our own people.
 We have to note that obtaining open-source intelligence in America has become more difficult, because traditional news shows have become more comedic and more comedic news shows more authoritative. 
 For instance, CNN's nightly business report is hosted by a man named ''Dobbs.'' Real journalists come on his show and present transparently propagandistic stories about immigration and trade and then he fulminates about them, much the way our ayatollahs used to do about ''Satanic Americans'' on late-night Iranian TV. So viewers have no real idea what's happening in the U.S. economy.
 Meanwhile, at 11 p.m., something called ''The Daily Show,'' which appears on Comedy Central, has fake journalists presenting what turns out to be the real news.
 Yes, our last I.N.I.E. in 1990 concluded that after the collapse of communism, America was on track to become the world's sole superpower and most compelling role model for Muslim youth -- including our own. We were wrong. We now have ''high confidence'' that America is on a path of self-destruction, for three reasons:
 First, 9/11 has made America afraid and therefore stupid. The ''war on terrorism'' is now so deeply imbedded in America's psyche that we think it is ''highly likely'' that America will continue to export more fear than hope and will continue to defend things like torture and Guantanamo Bay prison and to favor politicians like Mr. Giuliani, who alienates the rest of the world. 
 Second, at a time when America's bridges, roads, airports and Internet bandwidth have fallen behind other industrial powers, including China, we believe that the U.S. opposition to higher taxes -- and the fact that the primary campaigns have focused largely on gay marriage, flag-burning and whether the Christian Bible is the literal truth -- means it is ''highly unlikely'' that America will arrest its decline.
 Third, all the U.S. presidential candidates are distancing themselves from the core values that made America such a great power and so different from us -- in particular America's long commitment to free trade, open immigration and a reverence for scientific enquiry wherever it leads. Our intel analysts are baffled that the leading Democrat, Mrs. Clinton, no longer believes in globalization and the leading Republican, Mr. Huckabee, never believed in evolution. 
 U.S. politicians seem determined to appeal either to the most nativist extremes in their respective parties -- or to tell voters that something Americans call ''the tooth fairy'' will make their energy, budget, educational and Social Security deficits painlessly disappear.
 Therefore, we conclude with ''high confidence'' that there is little likelihood that post-9/11 America will, as they say, ''get its groove back'' anytime soon.
 Who needs nukes when you have this kind of America? 
 God is Great. Long Live the Iranian Revolution.

HEADLINE: Crossing a Threshold On Energy Legislation

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
A moment that has been a generation in the making arrives here this week, with Congress poised to act on the first bill to increase vehicle fuel efficiency significantly since 1975 and on the first economywide bill to address global warming since scientists raised the alarm in the late 1980s.
 A host of factors have brought Congress and the nation to the verge of resolving debates that for decades have produced only legislative logjams. 
 The inexorable rise in oil and gasoline prices has concentrated the public mind on the cost of foreign oil and the price of the gas-guzzling American car fleet. A parade of retired military officers have spoken out on the security threat posed by reliance on unstable regimes for America's economic lifeblood. 
 The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has issued four sobering reports on the ill effects of global warming and the high cost of delay in slowing the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Former Vice President Al Gore shared a Nobel Peace Prize with the United Nations panel for alerting the world to these dangers, in part through the Oscar-winning film ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' The Democratic takeover of Congress has thawed legislation that was frozen for years.
 Within the next few days, the House is expected to pass a package of energy measures, including a mandate that the American car and light truck fleet achieve a combined 35 miles per gallon by 2020, up from about 25 m.p.g. today. The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee is scheduled to act as soon as Wednesday on a bipartisan bill intended to slow and then reverse the nation's production of greenhouse gases.
 While the fate of both bills is uncertain, there is little doubt a threshold has been crossed.
 Automakers, bowing to a changed political and economic landscape, are now willing to support fuel efficiency standards that for years they said would be impossible to meet. After six years of near silence on the issues, President Bush this year has endorsed stringent new mileage rules, a sharp increase in production of renewable fuels and concerted international action on climate change.
 For years, efforts in Congress to impose strict fuel economy rules were stymied by a coalition of pro-business Republicans and auto-state Democrats unwilling to dictate to the Big Three carmakers. More recently, broad legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been stalled by opposition from electric utilities, coal producers, oil refiners and factory owners afraid of the costs of compliance.
 ''All that has changed,'' said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, who has been a frustrated advocate for automobile fuel efficiency and energy conservation legislation in his 15 terms in Congress. ''Things are now dramatically and in a telescoped time frame all coming together to address these issues that have been on a 30-year detour.''
 On a less cosmic scale, a change in the domestic political climate has been critical, too. When Democrats took control of the House and the Senate in January, they declared that energy legislation would be a top priority and set this month as an informal deadline for action.
 Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the senior member of the House and a longtime advocate for the auto industry, concluded this year that some form of fuel economy bill was coming. He warned top auto executives that he would do his best to protect the industry from unworkable measures but that they should begin to retool for a new, fuel-constrained era.
 Mr. Dingell waged a valiant fight with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on behalf of the auto industry last week and won important concessions. But the 35-m.p.g.-by-2020 standard stayed in the bill and is expected to become law.
 ''For almost 20 years, automakers and environmentalists have been locked into an often-vitriolic and rarely productive fight over fuel economy,'' said Jason Grumet, executive director of the bipartisan National Commission on Energy Policy. ''What has happened in the last couple of years is that you have had a number of additional and very potent voices join the discussion. The upheaval in the Middle East has crystallized recognition that these issues are much bigger than just how many jobs in the upper Midwest are affected. Other industry leaders, outside of the auto industry, are starting to express concern that the volatility of oil and gasoline prices are exposing a fundamental weakness in our economic competitiveness.''
 House leaders on Tuesday evening were still writing the energy legislation that will reach the House floor this week. In addition to incentives for a huge increase in production of biologically based fuels like ethanol, the package is expected to include a mandate that electric utilities produce 15 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2020. House leaders also plan to include $21 billion in new taxes on the oil industry and other interests to pay for the package.
 Some aides expressed doubt that the Senate could pass the renewable power mandate or the tax bill, both of which Mr. Bush has threatened to veto.
 Business interests are beginning a multipronged campaign to defeat the House energy bill and the Senate climate change legislation, claiming both will impose unacceptable costs on American industry. Electric utilities, manufacturers and the United States Chamber of Commerce began a series of print and television advertisements against the measures late last week.
 Bill Kovacs, the chamber's vice president for environment and regulatory affairs, said the bills would do little to increase domestic production of energy supplies and would make it hard for industries to compete against foreign companies with fewer regulatory or environmental shackles.
 Mr. Kovacs said that opposition to these measures cut across partisan and regional lines, depending on where power lines or wind farms are located, for example, or whether increased ethanol production results in higher food or fuel costs. 
 But advocates for the bills can and do make the same argument, saying that support for increased fuel economy and measures to combat global warming are now bipartisan and nationwide.
 Senator John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, is a sponsor of the global warming bill. Mr. Warner opposed weaker legislation when it was proposed two years ago, but said recently that he had changed his mind because of two factors: ''science and my grandchildren.''

HEADLINE: Canada Bank's Rate Cut May Not Help Exporters

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The unexpected decision by the Bank of Canada on Tuesday to cut its key interest rate by a quarter-point, to 4.25 percent, will probably do little to help exporters struggling to cope with a rising Canadian dollar, economists said. 
 In announcing the reduction, the Bank of Canada also reversed its previously optimistic outlook for the United States economy, citing concerns about the subprime mortgage problems. 
 ''Anticipated losses on U.S. subprime mortgages have worsened since mid-October, and are expected to persist for a longer period of time,'' the bank said in its announcement. ''In these circumstances, bank funding costs have increased globally and in Canada, and credit conditions have tightened further.''
 Jayson Myers, chief economist of the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters, a trade group, said the rate cut was an indication that the country's resource wealth did not provide an escape from the uncertainty in the United States.
 ''The Canadian economy is not freewheeling,'' Mr. Myers said. ''It's still very closely tied to the North American market.''
 Leading up to Tuesday's decision, the Bank of Canada was faced with conflicting situations. High oil and commodity prices have kept Canada's economy generally buoyant and arguably overheated in some regions, particularly energy-rich Alberta.
 But the rise of the Canadian dollar to parity and beyond with the United States dollar has squeezed manufacturers in Ontario and Quebec, whose exports are often priced in American currency. That has led to political pressure on the bank as well as a request from auto-parts makers to the government for 400 million Canadian dollars in emergency financing.
 Still, many economists had predicted that the bank would not cut its rate on Tuesday.
 Although the central bank appeared relatively unconcerned about the dollar's high level in its rate announcement, the currency did give it leeway for its interest rate cut. The bank said October's inflation rate of 2.4 percent was below its expectations, a factor it attributed to price cuts on imported merchandise.
 After the announcement, the Canadian dollar fell to 98.78 cents from a close of 99.98 cents on Monday. While that is a large swing in currency market terms, it will not provide significant benefit to exporters. A year ago, the Canadian dollar traded at 87 cents.
 ''The rate cuts do not reverse things for our members,'' Mr. Myers said. ''Their cash flow is under tremendous pressure because of the dollar, so it's difficult to get financing.''
 Douglas Porter, the deputy chief economist of BMO Capital Markets, a unit of the Bank of Montreal, said he anticipated at least one more rate cut.
 But he added that even a second cut was unlikely to bring exporters the currency relief they want.
 ''Perhaps it will take some of the edge off the currency and reduce the chances it will go to $1.10 soon,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Other Countries' Students Surpass U.S.'s on Tests

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Students in the United States are lagging behind their peers in other countries in science and math, test results released Tuesday show. 
 The test, the Program for International Student Assessment, was given to 15-year-olds in 30 industrialized countries last year. It focused on science but included a math section.
 The 30 countries make up the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
 The average scores for American students were lower than the average scores for the group as a whole.
 In science, American students had an average score that was lower than the average in 16 other countries. In math, they did even worse, posting an average score that was lower than the average in 23 other countries.
 The test was also given to students in about two dozen countries or jurisdictions that are not part of the industrialized group.
 When compared with the broader group, the American students fell in the middle of the pack in science and did somewhat worse in math.
 Finland's 15-year-olds did the best on the science test, followed by students in Hong Kong and Canada. Students in Finland, Taiwan, South Korea and Hong Kong were the top performers in math.

HEADLINE: Plan to Build Reactors Is Running Into Hurdles

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
For the first time in three decades, companies are getting ready to build nuclear reactors in the United States. They intend to do so under streamlined procedures meant to avoid the long delays and cost overruns that crippled the industry last time around.
 But with early jockeying under way to win government approval for this new generation of plants, ominous signs are emerging that the plans may not go smoothly.
 In recent years, at a time when nuclear construction was in the deep freeze, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the industry created a method that was supposed to simplify future planning and construction. Under it, manufacturers were to win advance government approval for a handful of reactor designs, and power companies would specify later where they would put new reactors of each type. 
 This cookie-cutter approach was meant to ensure that companies would not have to rip out concrete and pipes in the middle of construction to satisfy ever-changing requirements from Washington. That was one of the biggest problems when the industry foundered in the 1980s. 
 Now, Congress has thrown its support behind a new round of nuclear construction, and many people in the electric industry are eager to get going. Three companies have filed applications for licenses to build and operate five reactors.
 But one company marched in with more than a dozen significant changes to a previously approved design. Two picked designs that have yet to win final government approval. And waiting in the wings is a fourth company that has ordered parts for a design that has not even been submitted to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. 
 ''The good news is that there is a real need for power,'' said Marvin S. Fertel, vice president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association. ''The bad news is that now we've convoluted'' the steps for getting plants approved.
 Gregory B. Jaczko, one of the federal agency's three commissioners, said it might not have enough staff members to do now what it did in the 1970s and '80s -- supervise the construction of a couple of dozen types of reactors. The commission has been hiring rapidly to prepare for a nuclear renaissance, but officials there were counting on standardization, if not quite mass production, as a way to manage the workload.
 Handling applications for incomplete designs will be an additional burden on staff members that could slow approvals, he said. ''I don't think we've gotten to what the commission envisioned back in the late '80s and early '90s when we embarked on this,'' Mr. Jaczko said. A second commissioner, Peter Lyons, said, ''There is no application coming in today that is exactly following the process.'' 
 Industry executives acknowledge the problem but say they are beginning this round with designs that are far more developed than the ones begun in the 1970s. They contend that the rush to build before plans are complete is unavoidable. 
 The Constellation Energy Generation Group is in a partnership to build a reactor in Maryland using a design pioneered in Finland and France, a design not yet certified in the United States. ''The need for lower-cost electricity and environmentally acceptable electricity from nuclear has experienced so much momentum'' that the company needs to move rapidly, said Michael J. Wallace, the generating group's president.
 Ideally, certification of the reactor design would occur before the company goes forward with its plans, he said. But that would slow things down by as much as three years, and Constellation wants to have the plant on line by 2015, Mr. Wallace said, adding, ''The reality is we could use the plant on line in 2011.'' 
 The industry is painfully aware of a track record of haste making waste. In the 1960s and '70s, it broke ground on scores of reactors with plans only 20 or 30 percent complete, and later had to rip out steel and concrete as designs and safety requirements changed during construction, adding vast costs. 
 The industry and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission say they are determined to avoid that if there is a new round of construction. In the 1990s, the commission reorganized its licensing procedure to try to move design questions to the forefront -- before construction.
 But NRG, of Princeton, N.J., applied in October to build two reactors of a type known as advanced boiling-water reactors at a site in Texas. The design was approved by the nuclear commission in 1997, but NRG wants permission for 16 design changes. 
 The Tennessee Valley Authority and a consortium of companies in the nuclear business applied to build a Westinghouse design at Bellefonte, Ala., the site of two abandoned reactor projects. The Westinghouse design was certified in 2006, but the company is amending it, closing gaps and making changes requested by customers.
 On Nov. 28, the power company Dominion, of Richmond, Va., applied to build a new reactor adjacent to two existing reactors at its North Anna power station in central Virginia. The site itself won early approval from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but Dominion chose a reactor design not yet approved by the agency. A company spokesman, Jim Norville, said, ''We anticipate it will be certified well before we break ground.''
 Mr. Jaczko said that by now, ''the designs should have been finalized.'' But they are still ''evolving,'' he said, and design questions may linger even as the commission begins to consider approval of particular sites. 
 Power company executives share his concern, although they say they are far better prepared for construction now than in the last round.
 Other problems are emerging in the budding nuclear renaissance. The industry had hoped to limit the number of cookie-cutter designs to two or three, but there are five already, and more on the way. 
 And if the industry succeeds in winning approval for as many new reactors as it wants -- 31 and counting -- the capacity of nuclear suppliers is likely to be strained. By most estimates, they can fabricate enough parts for only three or four reactors a year, and the United States will be competing with other countries that want to build nuclear plants. 
 Some of the most important parts can be cast only by a single foundry, Japan Steel Works. ''The global supply chain is going to be the pacing item,'' Mr. Wallace said.
 Mr. Fertel, of the trade association, said that any company that wanted to have a reactor on line by 2015 would need to have ordered some parts by now. Even in the best case, some plants on the industry wish list will take as long as 2020 to be built, he said.
 As of now, the industry cannot even build the simulators it needs for the complex, time-consuming task of training new nuclear operators. ''You can't build it till the design is firmed up,'' Mr. Wallace said. 
 David Leonhardt, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is on assignment.

HEADLINE: Medical Center to Support Tuition Fund in Pittsburgh

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will contribute up to $100 million to help pay college tuition for eligible high school seniors who graduate from the city's public schools, medical center officials said Tuesday.
 Besides bolstering its civic image, the medical center, a nonprofit system of 19 hospitals that dominates health care in Western Pennsylvania, is seeking to help stem six decades of population loss from Pittsburgh, which was once a dominant industrial hub. 
 ''If it's something that can improve the region and the city, it's something that appeals to us,'' said Jeffrey Romoff, president and chief executive of the medical center, which this year reported an annual ''excess margin'' of $618 million on $6.8 billion in revenue. 
 The medical center will make an immediate $10 million contribution to Pittsburgh Promise, a fund created a year ago by the public school district that was based on a similar program created in 2005 in Kalamazoo, Mich.
 An additional $90 million will act as a challenge grant, with the medical center contributing $2 for every $3 the district raises from other sources.
 Pittsburgh Promise, whose endowment goal is $250 million, was criticized throughout the city because Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and the schools superintendent, Mark Roosevelt, announced it a year ago with great fanfare but without pledges from any donors. The only pledge forthcoming was for $10,000, from the teachers' union.
 As if to drive home the lack of commitment, the district lost more than 1,100 students this year, dropping to 28,000.
 ''This is just what the program needed to make it a reality,'' Mr. Ravenstahl said of the medical center's contribution. ''It's an economic development tool and one we'll use in trying to transform our neighborhoods.''
 Beginning next spring, any of the district's 2,000 seniors, regardless of family income, who have attended public school here for at least the last four years, graduate with a 2.0 grade point average, and attend a public or private college in Pennsylvania will be eligible for $5,000 from the fund to pay for any tuition expenses not covered by other aid. 
 The district estimates the program could cost $3 million the first year, and more in future years as more students take advantage of it. The program is also seen as a way to retain middle-class families who have been leaving the district when their children reach high school.
 Starting next school year, graduating seniors must achieve a 2.5 grade point average to qualify. By 2012, as the fund matures, the scholarship amount will grow to $10,000, and students will have to pass a graduation exam to be eligible for the maximum award.
 A critical difference between the programs here and in Kalamazoo is that Pittsburgh will require students to apply first for any other aid for which they are eligible. And to help drive more students into the program, Pittsburgh will begin counseling students about their college financial opportunities in sixth grade -- changes the medical center proposed after Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Ravenstahl first approached the organization six months ago.
 ''We know this will require a fundamental change between schools and families and kids if it's going to work,'' Mr. Roosevelt said. 
 In Kalamazoo, a city of 72,000 that lost nearly 5,000 residents from 2000 to 2005, the program, with an anonymous group of donors, has already reaped benefits in just two years.
 The school district of about 10,000, which was losing about 350 students a year, gained 1,000 new students in the 2006-7 school year, the first full year after the program was created, and added 200 more this school year, said Bob Jorth, executive administrator of Kalamazoo Promise.
 Home values in the economically struggling city also increased in the first year, Mr. Jorth said, rising 7 percent in the first year, at a time when home values fell 7 percent across Michigan -- further proof that the ''all carrot, no stick'' program is working, he said. 
 ''People understand that education is the way out,'' Mr. Jorth said, ''and they kind of feel like this is their chance.'' 
 Mr. Roosevelt said he decided in late 2005 that he needed something like Kalamazoo's program, after he oversaw the closing of 22 schools because of declining enrollment.
 ''We were looking at the demographics, and I realized without an intervening event, this was going to happen again in eight years,'' Mr. Roosevelt said. ''I didn't want to do that again.''

HEADLINE: Iran Hails U.S. Report That It Ended Bid for Nuclear Arms

BYLINE: By NAZILA FATHI

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Iran on Tuesday welcomed a major American intelligence report's conclusion that it was not developing a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
 ''It is natural that we welcome it,'' Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told state-run radio. ''Some of the same countries which had questions or ambiguities about our nuclear program are changing their views realistically.'' 
 The report, a National Intelligence Assessment released Monday, concluded that Iran halted a clandestine nuclear weapons program in 2003. Iran contends that its effort to develop nuclear materials is intended only for civilian uses. 
 Mohsen Aminzadeh, a former deputy foreign minister, said that the report could suggest that the United States wants to pursue a diplomatic resolution to Iran's case.
 ''The announcement that Iran has had no weapons activities since 2003 is very important,'' he said. ''It shows that the U.S. is showing flexibility and wants to find a solution.'' 
 However, some analysts viewed the report with skepticism, expressing fear that the West might increase economic pressure on Iran as the threat of a military confrontation with the United States diminishes.
 ''It might be good news because it shows a military strike by the U.S. might be off the table,'' said Saeed Leylaz, an economist and political analyst in Tehran. ''But I don't see how it can be positive for people's economic situation when it stresses that pressure and sanctions have worked.''
 Iranian authorities were surprised last week when Chinese state banks refused to lend money to Iranian businessmen. They did so after the United States and United Nations renewed calls for international banks to limit dealings with Iran as part of sanctions tied to its nuclear program. 
 The leader of the Iran-China Joint Chamber of Commerce, Assadolah Asgaroladi, said Monday that Chinese state banks had refused to open letters of credit for Iranian businessmen in the past week, the daily newspaper Etemad Melli reported.

HEADLINE: Then There Were 2: Turtles' Fate Shows Threat to China's Species

BYLINE: By JIM YARDLEY; Ma Yi contributed research.. 
Ma Yi contributed research.

DATELINE: CHANGSHA, China 

 BODY:
Unnoticed and unappreciated for five decades, a large female turtle with a stained, leathery shell is now a precious commodity in this city's decaying zoo. She is fed a special diet of raw meat. Her small pool has been encased with bulletproof glass. A surveillance camera monitors her movements. A guard is posted at night.
 The agenda is simple: The turtle must not die. 
 Earlier this year, scientists concluded that she was the planet's last known female Yangtze giant soft-shell turtle. She is about 80 years old and weighs almost 90 pounds. 
 As it happens, the planet also has only one undisputed, known male. He lives at a zoo in the city of Suzhou. He is 100 years old and weighs about 200 pounds. They are the last hope of saving a species believed to be the largest freshwater turtles in the world. 
 ''It's a very dire situation,'' said Peter Pritchard, a prominent turtle expert in the United States who has helped in trying to save the species. ''This one is so big and it has such an aura of mystery.''
 For many Chinese, turtles symbolize health and longevity, but the saga of the last two Yangtze giant soft-shells is more symbolic of the threatened state of wildlife and biodiversity in China. Pollution, hunting and rampant development are destroying natural habitats, and also endangering plant and animal populations. 
 China contains some of the world's richest troves of biodiversity, yet the latest major survey of plants and animals reveals a bleak picture that has grown bleaker during the past decade. Nearly 40 percent of all mammal species in China are now endangered, scientists say. For plants, the situation is worse; 70 percent of all nonflowering plant species and 86 percent of flowering species are considered threatened.
 An overriding problem is the fierce competition for land and water. China's goal of quadrupling its economy by 2020 means that industry, growing cities and farmers are jostling for a limited supply of usable land. 
 Cities or factories often claim farmland for expansion; farmers, in turn, reclaim marginal land that could be habitat. Already, China has lost half of its wetlands, according to one survey.
 For the Chinese scientists and conservationists trying to reverse these trends, the challenge begins with trying to convince the government that protecting wildlife is an important priority. For centuries, Chinese leaders emphasized dominance over nature rather than coexistence with it. Animals and plants are still often regarded as commodities valued for use as medicine or food, rather than as essential pieces of a natural order.
 ''The whole idea of ecology and ecosystems is a new thing in the culture,'' said Lu Zhi, a professor of conservation biology at Peking University. 
 Scientists say China's status as a leading center of biodiversity makes the threatened state of wildlife a global concern. Many of China's species are concentrated in the mountainous southwestern region -- sometimes popularized in the West as Shangri-La -- as well as in Tibet, Hainan Island and along the North Korean border. Endangered indigenous animals include the giant panda, several varieties of pheasants and monkeys, and a range of small mammals including shrews and rodents.
 ''China is one of a small handful of countries, maybe a dozen, that has remarkably high numbers of species, and a remarkably high number of species that are not found anywhere else,'' said Jeffrey A. McNeely, chief scientist for the World Conservation Union. 
 Nearly every major international conservation group has established a China office to promote different wildlife protection initiatives. The group WildAid has sponsored a public education campaign featuring billboards with the Chinese basketball star Yao Ming. ''Endangered species are our friends,'' Mr. Yao said at a news conference last year in Beijing.
 China has a large system of nature reserves, mostly in the country's more remote western regions, though financing levels are far below those even in other developing countries. No Chinese protection program is considered more successful than the robust effort to save the panda. Roughly 2,000 pandas now live in panda reserves. Other captive breeding programs have helped pull the Chinese alligator and the Tibetan antelope away from the brink of extinction.
 But these successes, which involve animals of symbolic national importance, are modest compared with the number of species that are neglected and edging closer to extinction. Last year, the Yangtze River dolphin, a freshwater mammal known as the baiji, was declared extinct. 
 ''So many species are neglected,'' said Dr. Lu, who also heads the China affiliate of Conservation International. ''Look at the baiji. The extinction was announced and what has been done? Nothing. People felt pity.''
 Then, alluding to the Yangtze giant soft-shell, also known as the Rafetus swinhoei, she added: 
 ''This turtle will be next.''
 Surviving History's Tides
 Fifty-one years ago, a traveling circus performed at the new zoo in Changsha, the capital of Hunan Province in southern China. For a cash payment, the circus left behind a large female turtle. Zookeepers slipped the turtle into a large pond, where for a half-century it hibernated in winters and poked its pig-like snout above the water's surface every spring. The walls of the zoo became the equivalent of a time capsule. 
 Outside, the convulsions of modern Chinese history were scarring an already damaged landscape. Under Mao, national campaigns were waged to kill birds and other animals perceived as pests. Widespread famines in the late 1950s and early 1960s drove desperate people to hunt or gather anything deemed edible, even tree bark.
 Since the 1980s, the pressure has come from the rapid push for economic development. In recent years, turtle experts identified the Yangtze giant soft-shell as dangerously close to extinction. Inside the Changsha Zoo, zookeepers had no idea that experts were scouring China for the species. In fact, they knew very little about their female turtle. ''We just treated it like a normal animal,'' said Yan Xiahui, deputy director of the zoo. 
 The species was first identified as distinct in the 1870s. A British diplomat in Shanghai sent a specimen to the British Museum, where it was beheaded and pickled in a jar. Some experts debated whether it was part of another species, and for years it received little attention.
 ''It proceeded to be ignored by the world as if it didn't exist for roughly 100 years,'' said Dr. Pritchard, the American expert, who has seen the specimen in the British Museum. 
 With its wide, flat shape and leathery dorsal shell, the giant Yangtze males can weigh more than 220 pounds; females are usually smaller. By the 1990s, a prominent Chinese herpetologist, Zhao Kentang, had realized the significance of the turtle and tried in vain to persuade different zoos to bring the turtles together for breeding. 
 By 2004, after conducting field surveys in China and Vietnam, herpetologists concluded that six of the turtles were still alive. Three were in Chinese zoos in Beijing, Shanghai and Suzhou; two others lived in a Buddhist temple in Suzhou; and a sixth lived in a famous Vietnamese lake in the center of Hanoi.
 Negotiations began toward a breeding agreement. By 2005, the turtle in the Beijing zoo had died. Questions also emerged about whether the Hanoi turtle was actually the same species. A leading Vietnamese expert argued it was not. Monks at the Buddhist temple considered their turtles religious icons and did not want to move them. Last year, a deal was finally reached between the Suzhou and Shanghai zoos.
 ''Then in October, the one in Shanghai died,'' said Xie Yan, the China program director for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which has been instrumental in guiding the discussions. ''It was horrible news.''
 In January, herpetologists gathered in Suzhou for a conference about the turtle. Every zoo in China had been issued an urgent circular asking for any information about their large turtles. Officials at the Changsha Zoo responded. The Wildlife Conservation Society sent two experts to Changsha. 
 ''We were very happy because it was a female and had just laid eggs last year,'' said Lu Shunqing, one of the experts, noting that the eggs were unfertilized. 
 The discovery of the Changsha turtle was critical. In August, one of the turtles in the Buddhist temple died. Experts visited the temple and found no proof that the second turtle existed. That left two undisputed Yangtze giant soft-shells: the female in Changsha; the male in Suzhou. Neither had commingled with the opposite sex in decades, if ever. And, more problematic, neither zoo was willing to let its turtle go.
 Restoring Diversity
 Biodiversity, a linguistic marriage of biology and diversity, describes the variations of life within a particular setting, or ecosystem. That ecosystem could be a single pond or the entire earth. Implicit is the idea that the ecosystem is sustained by the coexistence and interaction between plants, animals and other life forms. 
 Few, if any, of the world's modern economic powers, including the United States, have industrialized without taking a dire toll on plants and animals. In China, the Communist Party's top-down, authoritarian system has presided over a destruction of nature. Now, with environmental problems threatening the economy, the party is trying to engineer a top-down reconstruction.
 Environmental construction, a government term, is now a high priority. Yet the results are not always synonymous with biodiversity. Since 1998, China has banned the domestic timber trade and started a nationwide reforestation program. China is now one of the few countries in the world where forest cover is expanding. Yet many scientists say these new forests are more like plantations than habitat.
 Often, the new forests include only one or two different tree species and are far inferior to natural forests as incubators for other species. Unintended results can occur. In Beijing, officials planted millions of ''female'' poplar trees without realizing that the females produced higher amounts of pollen. Workers have had to dig up thousands of the trees, as floating springtime pollen often seems as thick as snow.
 Restoring animal populations is also complicated. Turtles, which are both revered and consumed in China, were decimated in the wild by pollution and hunting. Traders quickly pushed into Southeast Asia, India and even the United States to meet demand.
 ''In conservation terms, it became a crisis,'' said Dr. Pritchard, the American expert. ''It was first noticed six or seven years ago. The China market had become packed with turtles not from China.''
 In fact, Chinese markets teemed with animals, or animal parts, from around the world. Today, conservationists express particular concern about the illegal trade in tiger parts. China has signed an international treaty banning domestic trade of tiger parts, but tiger conservation groups say the illegal demand in China is a major reason for the decline of tigers around the world. 
 Meanwhile, conservationists worry that officials may one day reopen the tiger trade to appease Chinese businessmen who had run tiger breeding farms to produce parts for Chinese traditional medicine.
 Turtles, meanwhile, have made a comeback with the emergence of breeding farms. Captive breeding also is now a popular government response for certain endangered species. But many conservationists worry that too little emphasis is placed on restoring habitat so that animals can be returned to the wild. More than 10,000 Chinese alligators have been bred, but reintroducing them to the wild has largely failed. 
 Conservationists say environmental policies need to better take biodiversity into account. Reforestation, for example, was largely an effort to stop soil erosion, which contributed to floods, and to stall desertification, the conversion of the land into a desert. The idea of creating a true forest was not a priority. 
 Meanwhile, economic development still dominates. China's richest source of biodiversity is a ''hot spot'' in southwestern China along the Nu River designated by Unesco as a World Heritage Site. Even so, provincial officials are trying to build a system of dams through the region. Local officials also have tried to redraw the boundaries for the World Heritage Site in order to create room for mining. 
 Conservationists are trying to speak the language of economics to build political support for protecting habitat. Rice demand is growing rapidly, even as farmland is dwindling. For decades, Chinese scientists have used wild rice species to develop hybrids that increase production. Now, development and farming are encroaching on wild rice habitat areas in coastal southern China.
 ''If we let it go unchecked,'' Dr. Lu, the Peking University professor, wrote in a report about biodiversity, ''Chinese wild rice will become extinct in fifteen years.''
 Success Far From Certain
 Extinction remains a far more immediate possibility for the Yangtze giant soft-shell. Next year, scientists will make a search in southwestern China in hopes of finding another Yangtze giant soft-shell in the wild.
 In September, the Changsha and Suzhou zoos finally reached a deal. Neither wanted to move its turtle. But each agreed that scientists could attempt artificial insemination next spring. Each also signed a contract entitling a certain number of offspring for each zoo -- potential stud turtles for future captive breeding programs.
 Gerald Kuchling, a herpetologist overseeing the procedure, said success was far from guaranteed. Several years ago, a tortoise in Hawaii died after a similar procedure. In May, Dr. Kuchling conducted an ultrasound examination of the ovaries of the female turtle in Changsha. For years, she has laid unfertilized eggs in springtime, though zookeepers say the number has steadily diminished, to about 20.
 ''The main problem is really to get a viable sperm sample from the old male without harming him in any way,'' said Dr.. Kuchling, who added that using small electric shocks is one common method for eliciting a sample. Manual massage is another.
 In Changsha, zoo officials moved the turtle into a private pool for better security and monitoring. But experts are concerned that zookeepers are now warming the water inside the pool during winter, even though it spent decades in the colder pond outside. They also are concerned that the pool has no mud to allow the turtle to hibernate.
 Under China's system, the Ministry of Agriculture has oversight of the turtle. So far, the ministry has agreed to provide 200,000 yuan, or about $27,000, though none of the money has arrived. Asked for an interview in October, the ministry declined. But ministry officials later contacted the zoos and persuaded them to sign a new deal.
 It was decided that the Changsha turtle will be transported to Suzhou next year. A special breeding pool is supposed to be built. First, scientists will try artificial insemination. If that fails, the two elderly turtles will give it a go the old-fashioned way. 
 The fate of a species hangs in the balance.

HEADLINE: Curtains Rise Again

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: TRAVERSE CITY, Mich., Dec. 1 

 BODY:
When the director Michael Moore moved to northern Michigan from New York City in 2002, the marquee of the State Theater on Front Street here had been dark since 1978. It was a sullen space in this Great Lake city's central business district. 
 Last month, the marquee woke up with a splendid billboard of blinking lights and a triumphant message. The message said ''Mission Accomplished!'' as Mr. Moore and hundreds of residents celebrated the opening of the nearly 11,000-square-foot State Theater as a year-round art-house movie theater. 
 The $850,000 renovation of the State Theater, which dates to 1916, when it opened as the Lyric, was led by Mr. Moore. He coaxed an army of volunteers and professional electricians, carpet installers, carpenters and other craftsman to execute the project in just six weeks.
 Though it was a highly impressive endeavor by an Academy Award-winning director in his adopted community, it was not unique. The State is one of some two dozen historic movie and performing arts theater restorations occurring this year in small cities around the nation, according to the League of Historic American Theaters in Baltimore. 
 Just as with the State Theater, which is owned and managed by the two-year-old Traverse City Film Festival, founded by Mr. Moore, almost all of the other restorations have been undertaken by nonprofit organizations. 
 Restoration groups say the rescues of beautiful old theaters reflect dual desires: a devotion to movies and live drama, dance and concerts; and adding value to downtown economies. 
 ''Historic theaters have been bellwethers,'' said David W. Fleming, executive director of the 104-year-old Colonial Theater in Pittsfield, Mass., which reopened for live entertainment and occasional movies last year after a $21.5 million restoration. 
 ''As they deteriorated in the 1950s and 1960s, old theaters closed and they were rightly seen as the death knell of downtown. The opposite also works, and that's what we're seeing here and across the country. Theater restorations are sparking downtown revivals,'' Mr. Fleming said.
 Last year, Mississippi State University completed a $30 million project to convert the 1889 Grand Opera House in Meridian, Miss., into a performing arts and conference center. The opera house, which was also a vaudeville and movie theater, had not been used for decades. It was on the second floor of a 150,000-square-foot five-story building on a block of shuttered stores. 
 The project, called the Riley Center, has increased traffic to neighboring stores and restaurants, and stabilized the downtown economy.
 In many cases, restoring old theaters represents the cultural equivalent of a civic barn raising that takes years of preparation. 
 In Culpeper, Va., Gregory M. Yates, a local developer, spent $300,000 in 2004 to buy another State Theater, an 11,000-square-foot building that closed in 1993.
 Now there is a $10 million capital campaign to restore the 69-year-old theater for movies and live performances. Construction could start in the spring, and the theater opening is scheduled for the fall of 2009.
 ''It will change downtown completely,'' said Raven Yates, Mr. Yates's sister, a professional fund-raiser who is heading the capital campaign. ''It will grow the businesses in the blocks closest to us. Having a theater means restaurants and shops will be open longer hours. They'll do more business.''
 Indeed, downtown merchants and city leaders in Traverse City have been surprised by the crowds of ticketholders that are eating out, shopping and watching movies at the State Theater since it opened on Nov. 17. 
 It turns out, though, that Traverse City has become something of a Midwest movie mecca, largely because of Mr. Moore. 
 Born in Flint and raised in Davison, the 53-year-old documentary filmmaker and author once managed a weekend film series at the Flint campus of the University of Michigan, which he briefly attended.
 In 2005, three years after he and his wife, Kathleen Glynn, settled north of Traverse City, Mr. Moore worked with two prominent local artists -- the writer Doug Stanton and the photographer John Robert Williams -- to found the Traverse City Film Festival. The first festival that year attracted 50,000 people. The third five-day festival last August drew 80,000. 
 This year, Mr. Moore and his co-founders decided to expand their project and gain control of the State Theater to show movies year-round. The State was owned by Rotary Charities, a local philanthropy that had spent $1.45 million since the early 1990s to preserve the structure and restore an adjoining building as part of an unsuccessful project to develop a regional performing arts center.
 Last summer, Rotary turned over the deed of the theater to the film festival under a performance agreement that requires it to be open more than 300 days a year by 2012. Mr. Moore said he expected to meet this requirement within the next year.
 Mr. Moore's design concept was to duplicate the look and feel of the theater in 1949, when, after a fire at the old Lyric, the theater changed owners and opened with a new name, the State. He commissioned Glenn Wolff, a Traverse City artist, to paint two murals: one depicting the State marquee in 1949, and the other the Lyric Theater from early in the 20th century. 
 The floor of the entrance is white, black and red inch-square tile. In the main theater, which has 540 seats, draping gold and red curtains hang alongside Romanesque columns to improve the acoustics. The balcony was significantly enlarged.
 Patrons can lean way back in their red theater seats to gaze on a fiber-optic ceiling, designed by a local astronomer, that is a replica of the Milky Way over northern Michigan. 
 Mr. Moore also incorporated a 60,000-watt Dolby sound system, a supersize screen and the latest projection-booth technology.
 He said that along with helping to revitalize Traverse City's downtown, he had one more goal: providing a great place to see movies. ''I've been in enough theaters watching my own movies to see how poorly they are exhibited,'' he said, ''how terrible the conditions for watching a movie can be, the decorum, the cellphones ringing.''
 He paused a moment and then looked up. ''This is going to be a BlackBerry-free zone,'' he declared, smiling.

HEADLINE: Putting a Curious Eye on a High School Ranking System

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
Samuel G. Freedman is a professor of journalism at Columbia University. His e-mail is sgfreedman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
That venerable sage, the funk musician Rick James, once said, ''R&B stands for rhythm and business.'' His aphorism is worth remembering while paging through this week's issue of U.S. News & World Report, which includes the magazine's first ranking of high schools.
 Whatever this list represents in terms of journalism or public service, it must be understood also as an exercise in business, in extending the U.S. News brand, in helping it survive in a financial and technological climate hostile to news magazines. Having devoted annual issues to ranking colleges, graduate schools and hospitals, U.S. News has now brought the same approach to secondary education.
 The magazine's executives frankly acknowledge their economic motivations. In a recent interview, the publisher, Kerry F. Dyer, and the editor, Brian Kelly, referred to the high school ranking as part of a ''franchise.'' 
 But Mr. Kelly also rose to the journalistic defense of his magazine, speaking of the ''church-state separation'' between the editorial and business functions. Of the college ranking, which U.S. News began in 1983, he said, ''The origin was not as a commercial tool but journalistic curiosity.'' 
 The executives also said that they hoped the ranking would inspire a public conversation about what makes a good school. But the ranking raises a more fundamental, disturbing issue. The ranking is a centerpiece of what we might call the Anxiety Industry, the same booming market that includes test-prep classes and private college-admissions consultants. Nobody should feel exactly sanguine about that reality.
 ''I thought it's admirable the way the rankings were done,'' said David F. Labaree, the associate dean of the Stanford University School of Education. ''But if U.S. News's niche is rankings, that's a little disquieting. It's in the magazine's interest to push rankings into every sector to expand its niche. And that exacerbates the rankings mania that's harming education at all levels.''
 You could dismiss Mr. Labaree as an egghead purist, except that people who make their living coldbloodedly analyzing the marketplace speak in similar terms about the magazine's interest in ranking high schools.
 ''U.S. News has made the decision to basically pin its business model on rankings,'' said Mark M. Edmiston, a managing director of Admedia Partners, an investment banking company. ''They've basically given up the battle of competing with Time and Newsweek directly and carved out this niche of being the ranker.''
 In a capitalist society, of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with selling information for profit. As both a journalist and a journalism professor, I have to root for serious publications to succeed rather than fail. Peddling academic rankings is not peddling rumors about Britney Spears.
 Nor can you blame U.S. News for filling the vacuum left by the absence of any meaningful federal standard for comparing schools. The No Child Left Behind law let each state set its own standards for academic proficiency. The wildly variable benchmarks, especially in chronically weak states, too often subscribed to the Limbo Rock Rule: How low can you go?
 The factors the ranking used appear sensible and supple -- overall student achievement, academic performance of the most disadvantaged students, college readiness as reckoned by results on Advanced Placement tests. 
 The resulting lists of 100 ''gold medal'' schools include plenty of knock-me-over-with-a-feather nonsurprises, like Stuyvesant and Boston Latin. The top-rated school, Thomas Jefferson in Alexandria, Va., admits only a fraction of applicants from a five-county area and has extensive financial support from regional high-tech companies. There are also some intriguing discoveries like Hidalgo High School in southern Texas, a heavily immigrant, entirely Hispanic school with a 94 percent graduation rate.
 AND yet -- and yet -- it is hard not to get a little queasy hearing Mr. Dyer explain how the ranking is the magazine's franchise so that, he said, when you think high school ranking, you think U.S. News, not only the particular issue of the magazine but also the Web site content and spinoff books. It is the formula U.S. News has perfected with its college ranking.
 ''What's amazing,'' Mr. Dyer said, ''is how the average consumer knows that at 12:01 a.m. on a Friday in August, the college rankings are being released.''
 Indeed, Mr. Dyer continued, within 72 hours of the release this year, the U.S. News Web site received 10 million page views. Generally, it has about 500,000 views a month for the year that the ranking and related content stay online.
 Eighty percent of the visitors, Mr. Dyer said, directly enter the ranking section of the Web site rather than arriving through the magazine's home page, where they might have read something about politics or the arts. Such single-minded pursuit of data is considered desirable in the media business; the term of approval for such a coveted trove of information is a ''vertical.''
 Even in the antiquated form of print on paper, the U.S. News college ranking is a proven draw. A typical college-ranking issue, Mr. Dyer said, sells 45,000 copies on the newsstand, 50 percent more than a routine issue. In book form, U.S. News sells hundreds of thousands of copies a year of its various college guides. And every year, there is a new crop of fretful high school seniors and high-strung parents.
 ''This,'' Mr. Dyer said, ''is a continually renewing market.'' 
 Mr. Kelly, the magazine's editor, added, ''These things are annuities.''
 The high school issue carried roughly 45 pages of advertising, about 25 percent above the seasonal average, Mr. Dyer said. America Online put the U.S. News list on its home page. On the three days that the ranking and 2,000 pages of supporting material were posted on the magazine's Web site, it received five million page views, including 500,000 unique visitors. 
 Mr. Kelly said expanding the ranking into high schools was ''not an ad-sales consideration but a branding consideration.'' Isn't an advertiser, though, primarily attracted by the brand?
 A few days before the issue with the high school ranking was released, Mr. Dyer was riding on a commuter train into Manhattan, and overheard two fathers talking about where their children were applying to college. It was, for the publisher, a confirmation that U.S. News was offering the right product.
 ''We've expanded the footprint of the brand,'' he said. ''We have more people interacting with content than in the history of the magazine. And that, as Martha Stewart would say, is a good thing.''
 Too bad Rick James, who died in 2004, isn't around to offer a more skeptical opinion.

HEADLINE: 2 Airlines to Cut Back Plans For Increases in Capacity

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines will scale back seating-capacity plans for next year on mounting concern over high oil prices and a weakening United States economy. 
 Delta said yesterday that it would cut domestic capacity as much as 5 percent in 2008 and projected that higher fuel costs would wipe out its operating profit this quarter.
 Southwest, the largest discount carrier, still plans to increase overall capacity in 2008, but it reduced its projected growth for a third time, to a range of 4 to 5 percent.
 United States carriers have increased ticket prices seven times since Sept. 1 to combat a 48 percent surge this year in the price of jet fuel. The latest attempt by five of the largest airlines, including Delta, was rolled back this week after some rivals decided against an increase.
 Shares of Delta, based in Atlanta, dropped 97 cents yesterday, or nearly 5 percent, to close at $18.61. Southwest, based in Dallas, rose 6 cents, to $13.80.
 Delta's operating profit as a percentage of sales will be zero to a negative 2 percent, down from a forecast in mid-October of 3 to 5 percent, its chief financial officer, Edward H. Bastian, said at a Calyon Securities airline conference in New York yesterday.
 Delta said it was seeking $400 million in savings next year to compensate for the decline, and would ''considerably'' reduce seating capacity by returning some leased planes, Mr. Bastian said. It intends to cut domestic capacity in 2008 by 4 to 5 percent, while adding 15 percent to international flights, he said.
 Southwest, which slowed its expansion plans in October and June, will receive 7 to 9 new aircraft in 2008, down from original plans for 34.

HEADLINE: Senate Votes To Approve Trade Deal With Peru

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The Senate gave overwhelming final approval Tuesday to a trade agreement with Peru, as most Democrats joined nearly all Republicans in handing President Bush an unusual victory but leaving prospects unclear for other trade deals.
 The 77-to-18 vote sends the bill to President Bush for his signature. 
 The administration expressed hope Tuesday that the Peru vote might pave the way for approval of deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea that Mr. Bush seeks before he leaves office in 2009. But in the current climate of anxiety over trade, that appears unlikely. 
 ''With the strong votes by both chambers of Congress,'' said Susan C. Schwab, the administration's top trade negotiator, ''we are sending a strong signal to the world that the United States is regaining its bipartisan footing on trade policy and is a reliable ally to countries that are building political and economic freedom.''
 Trade between the United States and Peru is only $8 billion annually, less than a half a percentage point of the total United States trade volume. But the accord has far-reaching political consequences.
 As it had in the House, the Peru deal exposed a rift among Democrats, with 29 Senate Democrats voting yes and 17 voting no. In the House, where the vote last month was 285 to 132, 109 Democrats were in favor and 116 opposed. 
 Also as happened in the House, Democratic supporters said they were comfortable with the deal because the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, negotiated concessions from President Bush in May extending protections for workers and the environment in Peru. Democratic supporters also said that the deal opened up markets for American exports.
 Other Democrats, and many Republicans, argued that it was important to shore up relations with a crucial ally in Latin America, especially to lure them away from the socialist anti-American leadership of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela.
 The administration makes the same argument for passage of the Colombia deal.
 ''There is a growing division in Latin America today,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee. ''We ought to help countries like Peru that are not going the direction of Venezuela.'' 
 Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the vote was a ''very significant'' breakthrough for trade.
 But Democratic critics argued that the worker and environmental protections stand little chance of being enforced by the administration and that the Peru deal was another example of free trade policies that they argue have cost three million jobs in the last six years and caused a stagnation of wages for the middle class. 
 ''One of the major reasons that the middle class in the United States is shrinking, poverty is increasing and the gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider is in fact due to our disastrous, unfettered trade policy,'' said Senator Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont.
 While none of the four Democratic senators running for president voted Tuesday, they were divided in their positions on the Peru deal. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Barack Obama of Illinois were in favor of it, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut were opposed.
 Senator John McCain of Arizona, the only Republican absent, also because of the presidential campaign, supports the accord. 
 Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader, voted no. 
 Echoing an argument made by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Democratic critics of the Peru deal also say that the pact with Colombia would be even worse because its government has not done enough to crack down on the murder of labor organizers there. The Panama deal is snagged because a legislative leader there has been charged with murdering an American soldier.
 The South Korea trade deal is regarded as having the least chance of passage because of opposition from ranchers to Korean trade barriers to American beef and from the American automobile industry, which fears competition from inexpensive Korean cars and trucks.

HEADLINE: Ex-I.M.F. Director Is Named Lazard Investment Executive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Lazard, the investment bank run by Bruce Wasserstein, said yesterday that it had hired the former managing director of the International Monetary Fund as a top executive for its investment banking unit. 
 Rodrigo de Rato, who served as the economic minister of Spain under President Jose Maria Aznar, resigned from the I.M.F. in October, two years before his term was to expire. He is scheduled to start as a senior managing director at Lazard on Feb. 1 and will be based in London and Madrid.
 Mr. de Rato said in an interview that the investment bank approached him last month, after he had resigned from the fund. He has known several Lazard bankers since his days in Spain's Parliament in the 1980s.
 ''I saw it as a suitable place for me, and I had a high opinion about its quality of work,'' Mr. de Rato said. ''My experience as a policy maker in Europe and as a servant of the fund brings a mix of technical knowledge and policy issues to Lazard.''
 Mr. de Rato, a veteran of Spanish politics, was appointed to the I.M.F. in 2004, after he had been passed over for the leadership of the Popular Party in the Spanish elections that year. During his three-year tenure at the fund, the shortest of any I.M.F. leader's, he pushed for the fund to be more active in monitoring countries before economic crises arose.
 Mr. de Rato will work closely with Lazard's Spanish office, led by Pedro Pasquin, according to Steven J. Golub, Lazard's vice chairman.
 Mr. de Rato said that although Spain's economy had grown faster than that of the European Union as a whole in recent years, corporate deal-making in the country is only now picking up.
 He is also expected to provide a more global view for Lazard. Mr. de Rato -- who pushed for bigger roles for countries like China in the I.M.F. -- said that globalization and the credit crisis now roiling financial markets would be pivotal issues in the coming year. 
 ''Globalization is a source of not only opportunities but of challenges, and financial markets will go through certain turmoil right now,'' he said. ''We're in the middle of a credit crisis that will produce important shifts in the financial environment worldwide.''
 In hiring Mr. de Rato, Lazard is continuing its efforts to expand outside the United States. The firm acquired an Australian advisory firm this year, announced plans to open an office in Switzerland and became partners with an Austrian bank. 
 Lazard has made some high-profile hires this year. The firm lured two longtime investment bankers, Ken Costa of UBS and Kazuki Kusaka of Lehman Brothers, to take leading roles in its London and Tokyo offices.

HEADLINE: Much of Suit Aimed at Indian Cigarette Sales Is Dismissed

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
A federal judge has dismissed all but one charge in a lawsuit, filed last year by a supermarket mogul who hopes to be the next mayor of New York City, that challenged two Long Island Indian tribes over their longstanding practice of selling tax-free cigarettes from reservation smoke shops. 
 John A. Catsimatidis, whose holdings include the Gristedes supermarket chain, claimed in the suit that the two tribes illegally undercut his business, and he sought to force Indian retailers to buy cigarettes from wholesalers at the taxed price. He also asked for $20 million from the two tribes' cigarette retailers, the amount he claims he has lost.
 Leaders from the tribes, the Shinnecock and Unkechaug Indian nations, responded by moving to have the claims dismissed.
 In a decision rendered on Friday and announced yesterday, Judge Carol Bagley Amon of Federal District Court in Brooklyn dismissed the claim that the non-tax sales ''created, fostered and nourished a thriving black market in illegally discounted cigarette sales'' and also dismissed charges of corrupt business dealings and unfair competition.
 Harry Wallace, chief of the Unkechaug nation and a lawyer who owns a smoke shop on a reservation in Mastic, said yesterday that his tribe was pleased with the ruling.
 But Judge Amon did not dismiss the entire suit, finding that advertisements calling the cigarettes tax-free were misleading because cigarette sales are not actually tax-free under state law, and that they were ''likely to mislead the consumer into believing that he or she need not pay taxes on purchased cigarettes.''
 Mr. Catsimatidis said he would persevere with the suit. ''Everyone has to pay their taxes, and Indians must charge tax on cigarettes when they sell to non-Indians,'' he said.
 The state sets minimum price levels for retailers and imposes a sales tax of $1.50 a pack. But historically, the state has not collected cigarette taxes from tribes within its borders because they are considered sovereign nations, so Indian-owned smoke shops have long sold cigarettes at far lower prices than non-Indian competitors.

HEADLINE: For Struggling Black College, Hopes of a Big-Screen Revival

BYLINE: By LAURA BEIL

DATELINE: MARSHALL, Tex. 

 BODY:
When the light at University Avenue is green, drivers can pass Wiley College without a glance. There was a time, however, when this small black liberal arts college here caught the attention of a nation: in the 1930s, Wiley's polished team of debaters amassed a series of victories over white competitors that stunned the Jim Crow South.
 The college would go on to groom civil rights leaders like James Farmer Jr. and Heman Sweatt, whose lawsuit against the University of Texas Law School in the 1940s helped pave the way for public school integration. Yet Wiley itself, like many black colleges, has struggled for survival ever since, and even reached the brink of collapse. This year, professors and staff members accepted unpaid furloughs. One employee could not share a recent report with trustees because his department could not afford copy paper.
 Now Wiley is looking for a Hollywood ending. 
 On Dec. 25, ''The Great Debaters'' will appear in theaters with Denzel Washington as its director and star, and Oprah Winfrey as producer. The film depicts Wiley's most glorious chapter: 1935, when the black poet and professor Melvin B. Tolson coached his debating team to a national championship.
 No one knows whether the story will raise the college's fortunes, but Wiley, which has not been able to support a debate team for decades, is suddenly feeling the glow of celebrity. Enrollment has soared past 900 for the first time in at least 40 years. The administration building was given a face-lift, compliments of the moviemakers, who also manicured the campus with new greenery. There are hopes to revive the debate program, and in a movie tie-in, Wal-Mart is to endow a Melvin B. Tolson Scholarship Fund with $100,000. 
 Today, callers to the institution are greeted with a cheery recorded reminder: ''Home of the Great Debaters.'' Jamecia Murray, a junior from Logansport, La., has joked to prospective students that ''you could wake up in the morning and see Denzel Washington out your window.'' 
 Movies can have an impact on schools that lingers for years. Garfield High School in Los Angeles, made famous by ''Stand and Deliver'' in 1988, was able to recoup quickly when its auditorium burned last May. By October, the school had received more than $100,000 in donations, largely from those who remembered the film. ''Garfield itself has become synonymous with the movie,'' Nadia Gonzales, a school district spokeswoman, said.
 But celebrity can be unpredictable. While ''Fame,'' in 1980, brought the High School of Performing Arts in New York City a bumper crop of applicants, many students resented the portrayal of drug use and premarital sex. 
 In many respects, Wiley's story is the larger narrative of historically black institutions whose graduates lived to see landmark achievements in the 1960s, including passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. But after securing the opportunity for bright young students to attend any institution they wanted, many black colleges stalled. 
 Texas had 11 black colleges in 1954. Three are now gone, another is on probation for academic and other problems, and a fifth operated during most of the 1990s without accreditation.
 Wiley's woes reflect 130 years of racial and economic tumult. The Methodist Church founded Wiley in Marshall, in the northeast corner of the state, which has always aligned with the Deep South more than the Old West. Harrison County, home to Wiley, once held the largest slave population in the state, and antebellum culture cast a shadow on race relations well into the 20th century.
 By the time Mr. Tolson arrived in 1923, Wiley had emerged as an elite institution for the black middle class. The son of a Missouri preacher, Mr. Tolson had a soul fed by the Harlem Renaissance. He was both feared and loved, inspiring, as one biographer wrote, ''devotion bordering on adulation in many who knew him well.'' He remained at Wiley 24 years, publishing his most heralded work of poetry a year before his death in 1966.
 Wiley's 1935 victory over the University of Southern California (the opponents in the film are from Harvard) inspired people long denied dignity in white society. But the film omits one reality: even though they beat the reigning champions, the Great Debaters were not allowed to call themselves victors because they did not belong to the debate society, which did not allow blacks until after World War II. 
 The most renowned member of the debate team was a teenage James Farmer Jr., who would go on to found the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942. He would later use his Wiley-honed skills in debates against Malcolm X, an unflinching orator. ''I debated Malcolm X four times and beat him,'' Mr. Farmer told an interviewer in 1997. ''I'd think, 'Come off it, Malcolm, you can't win. You didn't come up under Tolson.'''
 In 1960, college students in Marshall were jailed for the first large sit-in in Texas. Within five years, the federal government would require integration.
 But as black students and faculty members were courted by white institutions, the college's identity became less clear. ''I don't think anybody could have calculated what integration would really do,'' said Bob Hayes, a United Methodist bishop in Oklahoma whose father became president of Wiley in 1971. 
 Wiley's football program, which had five national champion teams, disbanded in 1969. Two years later, the Methodist Church dispatched the Rev. Robert Hayes Sr. to Marshall to dissolve the college entirely. ''The bishop said, 'Go give it a decent funeral,''' recalled Mr. Hayes, who now lives in Houston. 
 But the elder Mr. Hayes, a Wiley graduate, could not bring himself to close his alma mater. A commanding preacher with a silky baritone, he convinced town bankers not to call in loans. Until he left in 1986, Mr. Hayes kept the doors open, even while enrollment dipped below 400. Robert Sherer, a history professor for 14 years beginning in 1975, recalls that he ''got constantly in trouble with the dean by failing too many students. Every student they lost was a major financial hit.''
 Heightening a sense of instability, a succession of five presidents passed through Wiley between 1986 and 2000. Lawns grew weedy. Buildings aged. In 2000, trustees recruited Haywood Strickland, president of Texas College in nearby Tyler, as president. He restored stability, but his tenure has not been completely smooth. In 2003, The Marshall News Messenger reported that despite an official biography that lists ''doctoral training'' at the University of Wisconsin, and publicly taking the title ''doctor,'' Mr. Strickland in fact has no earned Ph.D. 
 ''I was unaffected by it,'' Mr. Strickland said of the report, adding that he did not believe he had misrepresented himself.
 The college has run deficits for much of his tenure -- 2006 ended $1 million in the red -- but administrators predict finishing the 2008 financial year in the black. There are plans to establish the campus's first endowed chair, named after Mr. Tolson. The poet's home, next to campus, now sports a sign in the yard advertising its place in history. 
 For his part, Mr. Washington had not previously heard of the debaters or even the college, but he said, ''I'm aware of the strength of these historically black colleges, and what they've done for millions of African-American men and women over the years.'' His son graduated from Morehouse College, which recently raised $118 million. 
 While historically black colleges constitute only 3 percent of American higher-education institutions, they graduate about 24 percent of all black college students. Some prefer a campus like Wiley, so personal that faculty members will track down a student who misses class. ''To teach in schools like this demands some missionary-like spirit,'' said Solomon Masenda, an English professor who joined the faculty almost 20 years ago. ''You fall in love with it. I cannot explain it.''
 Deborah Phillips credits the college with identifying her daughter Ashley's strengths. Ashley Phillips arrived in Marshall unsure of what she might accomplish. Last month, Ms. Phillips was crowned Miss Wiley. By next year, she plans to be in medical school, with Wiley's biology program as her foundation. 
 On a crisp November morning, her mother watched Homecoming paraders toss candy from convertibles on University Avenue. ''Here,'' Mrs. Phillips said, ''you're a student who dreams.''

HEADLINE: Clinton Attack on Obama Overlooks Some Realities

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has been attacking Senator Barack Obama's health care plan, saying that while her proposal would provide universal coverage, his would leave out 15 million people. 
 ''I don't think we should start by giving up on 15 million Americans,'' Mrs. Clinton said Monday in Clear Lake, Iowa, adding, ''That's why my health care plan covers everyone.''
 Mr. Obama would require all children but not all adults to get health insurance. Mrs. Clinton would mandate that everyone obtain coverage. Both plans intend to lower the cost of health insurance so employers would be more willing to provide it and virtually all individuals could afford it.
 But while Mrs. Clinton is right that Mr. Obama's plan would leave out millions, she is being misleading in implying that her own plan covers everyone. Mandates rarely achieve 100 percent compliance. In addition, they are almost impossible to enforce.
 Because of those difficulties, Mrs. Clinton's own plan would probably leave out millions.
 Mandates have not worked with auto insurance. While all drivers are required to have it, 15 percent of the nation's drivers have none, according to the Insurance Research Council.
 Mr. Obama's health plan could actually have a better compliance rate. The 15 million who would supposedly be left out equal about 5 percent of the population -- a smaller portion than are going without auto insurance, said Joseph Antos, a health policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a nonpartisan group. 
 ''If Obama's plan were to leave 15 million people without insurance, I think Senator Clinton's plan would certainly do the same, not because of a mandate but because of the fundamental problems of getting people to recognize that they should buy insurance and making them buy it,'' Mr. Antos said.
 The 15 million figure apparently originated in The New Republic. While experts say the article was well researched, the 15 million is an estimate; no one appears to have a better figure. 
 The experience in Massachusetts, which has enacted universal coverage with a mandate that everyone obtain health insurance, shows how difficult it is to force everyone to comply. About 20 percent of people in that state do not have health insurance even with the mandate. The average cost of a policy is $12,000 a year for a family and $5,000 for an individual. It is likely to take years before costs come down enough so that lower-income people can afford health insurance and are willing to pay for it.
 Austan Goolsbee, an economics professor at the University of Chicago and senior economic adviser to the Obama campaign, said the Clinton campaign should acknowledge that its plan would leave out at least as many as Mr. Obama's -- partly because Mrs. Clinton has not said how she would enforce her mandate.
 ''She has not suggested a penalty,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. ''If there's not a major penalty for skipping out on insurance, people will skip out on it.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
 An article on Wednesday about health care proposals offered by some presidential candidates referred incorrectly to Massachusetts residents who might be exempt from the state's mandated health insurance plan. The state has estimated that up to 20 percent of all uninsured residents could be exempt -- not 20 percent of all residents. (The percentage of residents who have no insurance is estimated at between 6 and 10 percent.)

HEADLINE: Shares Slip Further on Fear of Bank Debt

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Retreating oil prices and signs of strength in industries outside the financial sector could not keep the stock market from declining for a second day yesterday.
 Investors have entered December, usually a winning month on Wall Street, cautiously. Most expect to see lower interest rates when the Federal Reserve meets next Tuesday, but the size of the cut, if any, is under debate. 
 Meanwhile, JPMorgan downgraded major securities firms, warning that although further write-offs of bad mortgage debt might help the firms' stocks, longer-term concerns about their risk management might hurt overall valuation. JPMorgan lowered its earnings estimates for some of Wall Street's biggest players: Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.
 Shares fell for those investment banks and other financial companies, including Washington Mutual, Citigroup, Bank of America, the government-sponsored Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and JPMorgan Chase itself. The sector has been dragging on the broader market since summer.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 65.84, or 0.49 percent, to 13,248.73.
 Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 9.63, or 0.65 percent, to 1,462.79, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 17.30, or 0.66 percent, to 2,619.83.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.91, or 1.04 percent, to 752.06.
 Crude oil fell 99 cents, to $88.32 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid speculation that OPEC would raise production today.
 Wall Street is also anxious about the employment report for November that is expected Friday, particularly after last week's unexpectedly large increase in unemployment claims. The Labor Department report could indicate the direction of consumer spending, which is crucial to economic growth.
 ''There's a growing concern among investors that the economy is headed into recession,'' said Joseph V. Battipaglia, chief investment officer at Ryan Beck & Company. 
 Most on Wall Street expect the Fed to further reduce the target federal funds rate, which stands at 4.50 percent, but Mr. Battipaglia said, ''I don't believe the Fed action is going to give them a sparkling turnaround in the economy anytime soon.''
 Goldman fell $11.67, or 5.1 percent, to $215.22; Lehman fell $1.77, or 2.9 percent, to $59.61; Merrill fell $1.93, or 3.3 percent, to $57.13; Morgan Stanley fell $2.27, or 4.3 percent, to $50.01.
 Although other sectors have been performing better, there was not much news yesterday to lift Wall Street's mood.
 The Finnish cellphone maker Nokia fell $1.32, or 3.3 percent, to $38.92, after disappointing investors with its operating margin goals. 
 Automakers also declined for the second day after General Motors posted weak November sales data and said it was cutting production. G.M. was the biggest loser among the 30 Dow companies after falling 93 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $27.68.
 Bond prices gave back some of their recent sharp gains. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to 102 29/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 3.89 percent at 5 p.m., from 3.85 percent at the same time Monday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Passes Bill to Limit Greenhouse Gases

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
A Senate committee approved a broad bill on Wednesday night to address climate change, a major step toward passage of a measure that would for the first time slow and then reverse emissions of the gases that scientists blame for the warming of the planet. 
 The Environment and Public Works Committee split largely along party lines on the bill, which calls for a roughly 70 percent cut from 2005 levels by 2050 in the production of carbon dioxide and other climate-altering pollutants.
 The legislation would limit emissions for virtually all sectors of the economy, but would allow swapping of pollution permits among carbon emitters.
 Some of the permits would be granted free at the beginning of the program; others would be auctioned, with the money used to develop clean technologies and aid the poor in paying the higher energy bills such a system would be likely to entail.
 The so-called cap-and-trade plan is modeled on a successful system for sulfur dioxide and mirrors some aspects of a carbon-trading program in Europe.
 The committee, which approved the measure by an 11-to-8 vote, worked through dozens of amendments over nearly 10 hours of hearings on Wednesday.
 The legislation, which is opposed by a powerful array of forces including utilities, oil companies and manufacturers, faces an arduous path through the full Senate and then in the House. Little action is expected before the first of next year.
 Senators Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, and John W. Warner, Republican of Virginia, sponsored the measure. They said it was a historic first step toward dealing with a problem that will require prompt action by the United States, which, along with China, is the world's largest producer of greenhouse gases.
 Democratic lawmakers and various environmental groups hailed the passage of the bill, while saying it could and should be strengthened.
 ''This bill is a strong framework to address the most serious challenge of our time,'' said Lexi Shultz, Washington representative for climate policy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. ''But if it's really going to do the job it needs to get stronger. If we are to have a fighting chance to avoid the worst effects of climate change, the United States has to cut emissions by 80 percent from current levels by the middle of the century.''
 The bill's chief critic on the committee, Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, said the measure would impose an unacceptable price on American industry, homeowners and consumers and cost up to 2.3 million jobs over the next decade.
 Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who is chairwoman of the environment committee, called the vote the greatest accomplishment of her 30-year political career.
 ''This vote is a historic moment for my country,'' Ms. Boxer said in an interview after the vote. ''It is a signal that America is finally taking bold steps to avert a catastrophe for our children and grandchildren.''
 Ms. Boxer also noted that representatives of 190 nations are gathering in Indonesia this week to talk about steps to follow the Kyoto climate accords when they expire in 2012. She said the committee's passage of the bill sent a signal to that meeting that the United States was serious about meeting its responsibilities.

HEADLINE: OPEC Finds Price Range To Live With

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
When oil prices were approaching the milestone of $100 a barrel a few weeks ago, OPEC, the global oil cartel, expanded production and sought to jawbone prices down. In January, when prices were near $50 and falling, OPEC cut supplies to stem the decline.
 The two price points underline a new reality for global oil markets. OPEC officials appear ready to defend prices somewhere between those two levels, aware that higher prices do not necessarily send the world economy into recession. For American drivers, the implication is that gasoline could stay near or above $3 a gallon for a long time, analysts said. 
 Yesterday, after a breezy one-day meeting in Abu Dhabi, OPEC cemented the impression that it wanted to keep oil prices at levels that would have been unthinkable a few years ago, leaving its output goal unchanged. 
 Since abandoning a target of $25 a barrel long ago, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has not said where it would like to see prices go. Analysts say the group's new target price is $70 to $80 a barrel. 
 ''OPEC's floor price keeps rising,'' said Jan Stuart, an energy economist at UBS in New York. ''You have to assume that's a strategy. Their actions speak louder than their words.'' 
 Many oil-producing countries want higher prices to develop their economies. Oil companies argue that higher prices offer some benefit to consumers because they call forth additional supplies, especially from higher-cost sources of oil like the tar sands of Canada. Some environmentalists argue that high prices encourage energy efficiency. 
 Oil prices are set in a global market, but exporting countries exercise a big influence by deciding how much oil to pump. The delicate balancing act for them is to find a price low enough that it does not hurt economic growth in the industrial economies, but high enough to pay for the rising aspirations of their own people.
 At Abu Dhabi, OPEC faced a difficult decision, given fears of a slowdown in the American economy. In that context, adding more oil might have pushed prices far below the group's comfort level. Last week, oil prices dropped more than 10 percent, the steepest weekly decline in more than two years. 
 Still, OPEC signaled that it was more concerned with slowing economic growth than with high prices. It rejected calls from oil consumers, including the United States, to lift output. Saudi Arabia, the key producing nation because it has the most flexibility to shift output, had initially said the group might consider increasing output by 500,000 barrels a day, but backed down amid the opposition of other OPEC members. 
 At the end of a volatile trading session, crude oil for next-month delivery settled yesterday at $87.49 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, down 83 cents. Prices initially gained more than $2 after the OPEC announcement, rising above $90, but fell back later in the day after the Energy Department said that domestic fuel supplies rose last week. 
 OPEC said its members would meet again in February to review their decision and fine-tune supply levels. After that, it is scheduled to meet in March. The group's 13 members, recently augmented by the addition of Ecuador and Angola, account for some 40 percent of world exports.
 OPEC said the reason prices rose to nearly $100 a barrel in recent weeks had little to do with supply and demand but was a result of trading by commodity investors and hedge funds, as well as geopolitical instability.
 ''We have enough stocks in the market,'' Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the secretary general, told reporters. ''There is no reason for the price of oil to go to $100 a barrel.''
 The cartel's policy since 2000 has been to adjust supply levels to track closely with demand, without allowing oil companies and refiners to build inventories. That careful management of supplies helped it raise prices after a price collapse in the late 1990s.
 This year, OPEC pared its production in a bid to push down the level of commercial oil stocks in developed economies. Saudi Arabia, which was particularly concerned about higher-than-average supplies, helped engineer production cuts totaling 1.7 million barrels a day. 
 While OPEC's real daily production dropped by only about a million barrels after the cuts, the strategy succeeded in forcing refiners to draw on inventories. From October 2006 to October 2007, supplies of oil and refined products in the United States, Europe and Japan dropped by 138 million barrels, according to Lawrence Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation.
 By September, prices were spiking, and OPEC tried to adjust by increasing production 500,000 barrels a day. But the limited new output had little effect on prices, which were also being driven higher by speculation and fears over conflicts in the Middle East. Oil, which has risen 44 percent this year, settled as high as $98.18 a barrel on Nov. 23.
 ''They have fully achieved their objective,'' Mr. Goldstein said. ''In fact they have more than succeeded. The current levels are making them uncomfortable.''
 Yesterday's outcome might set the stage for oil prices to rise again. ''Barring extremely negative economic outcomes,'' analysts at Barclays Capital said in a note, ''we see plenty of scope for prices to move back up and new highs to be tested.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: Living With High-Priced Oil: At the end of 2001, oil prices were around $20 a barrel. This week, they hovered around $90. Direct consequences of this huge jump include rising transportation costs and higher heating bills, but the impact is also being felt in less obvious ways: The cost of wheat flour has soared, as fields convert to corn to meet growing demand for ethanol. And products that are made from oil as diverse as plastic and lipstick are more expensive to make. Here, a look at life in a time of high-priced oil across the globe, the country, the neighborhood and the home. AMANDA COX AND AMY SCHOENFELD

HEADLINE: Tax Stalemate Threatens Chaos as Filing Season Nears

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and SUEVON LEE; David Cay Johnston contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
President Bush and lawmakers of both parties are finally in full agreement on something. All proclaim that middle-class taxpayers should be spared a surprise bill in the coming months posed by the alternative minimum tax. 
 But their inability to agree on exactly how to limit that tax is threatening to throw filing season into chaos and cost millions of Americans more in income taxes while fueling a political blame game over just who is responsible.
 The dispute goes to the heart of a Democratic pledge to pay for any tax cuts or offset new spending rather than add to the federal deficit. In a preview of tax showdowns to come, the fight pits the Democratic stance against a Republican refusal to raise taxes on one group as a way of cutting them for another or to offset the $50 billion cost of limiting the reach of the alternative minimum tax, since, the Republicans argue, it was never meant to collect so much revenue in the first place. 
 ''The effort to 'pay for' the A.M.T. is highly offensive to members of my side of the aisle,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who has balked at Democratic proposals to force a series of votes on competing options for circumventing the looming problem.
 Democrats say the maneuvering by Mr. McConnell and his allies leaves them wondering if Republicans truly want speedy enactment of relief from the tax. In the Democratic view, the Republican position that it should simply be set aside without a corresponding replacement of revenue is irresponsible. 
 ''Not only do I think that it is an intellectually bankrupt policy, I think it is an immoral policy,'' said the House majority leader, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland.
 The alternative minimum tax was adopted almost four decades ago, intended to prevent very wealthy Americans who enjoyed multiple tax breaks from escaping taxes altogether. But it was never indexed to inflation, and as a result it has been creeping up on a growing number of middle-income taxpayers.
 In recent years, Congress has agreed by this time to a one-year solution to prevent the tax from ensnaring more and more Americans. But with matters unresolved just weeks before filing for the 2007 tax year begins in earnest, millions of taxpayers face uncertainty, and the Internal Revenue Service is in a quandary. Treasury officials are warning that refunds could be delayed and that early filers could be forced to submit amended returns to account for any changes.
 The central problem is reprogramming I.R.S. computers. The agency's protocol calls for seven weeks to analyze changes in tax law, write the software code and test it, as well as notify all the tax professionals and others affected. Officials fear that a rush to make the changes in less time could result in error.
 Richard Spires, deputy I.R.S. commissioner, warns of a significant backlog in processing returns, as well as confusion for the taxpayer.
 ''There are a lot of people that file early and a lot of people that rely on getting those refund checks in that early February time frame,'' Mr. Spires said in an interview. ''If we're not able to process those returns for them, we believe it will have a significant impact on them.''
 A smooth start to the tax-filing season is already endangered, lawmakers and I.R.S. officials say. Any delay beyond this week will push the agency right up against the start of its seasonal rush. A delay in Congressional action until Christmas could stall an estimated 38 million tax returns and slow the corresponding $87 billion in refunds. 
 ''We are already in the soup, and it is a question of how bad it is going to get,'' said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the senior Republican on the Finance Committee, who urged a speedy resolution of the impasse. 
 New 1040 and 1040A tax booklets and instructions have already been printed. But 12 related tax forms, including one for the A.M.T. and others for a variety of tax credits, must be revised and put through a new printing cycle if Congress approves new legislation. The credits include those for education expenses and for child and dependent care expenses.
 For the 2006 tax year, nearly four million people were subject to the alternative minimum tax, including half of all taxpayers with incomes of $200,000 to $1 million, and 5 percent of taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000. Without any change, the tax is expected to hit as many as 23 million taxpayers at an average cost of $2,000, reaching people with incomes as low as $30,000 to $50,000, depending on circumstances.
 The Senate is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to move forward on a House-passed plan that would freeze the tax and replace the lost revenue by ending tax breaks for private equity funds, hedge funds and other partnerships. But Republicans oppose that approach, making it unlikely that Democrats will round up the necessary 60 votes.
 Leaders of both parties are confident that they will solve the riddle before the end of the year, particularly because lawmakers do not want to face voters next year after socking them with an unexpected tax. But Mr. Hoyer and some other House Democrats say they will never vote for a fix that is not paid for, and many Republicans say they will not vote for one that is. Unless someone relents, Mr. Grassley warned, tax time will be even more trying than usual.
 ''The old joke is that you better make certain that the light at the end of the tunnel isn't a train coming at you,'' he said. ''Unfortunately, the joke is on the American people when it comes to the upcoming tax-filing season. Because of the failure of the Congress to act, the taxpayers are going to feel like they have been hit by a freight train come April 15.''

HEADLINE: Institute Named for 'Sesame' Creator

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH JENSEN

 BODY:
In their pioneering work with the preschool show ''Sesame Street,'' Joan Ganz Cooney and her colleagues created a much-copied model that made children's television educational as well as entertaining. Today the program's producer, Sesame Workshop, will unveil a nonprofit research and production institute named after Ms. Cooney that will try to inject educational standards into digital media for older children.
 The Joan Ganz Cooney Center will initially focus on how computer and Internet games, cellphones and other digital devices on which children increasingly spend their time can be used to improve literacy among minority and economically disadvantaged 6- to 9-year-olds, Ms. Cooney said. In addition to producing its own new media projects, the center plans to open its work to outside companies, with which it hopes to develop educational projects. It also plans to conduct and sponsor research intended to push the industry to think more broadly about how interactive technology can be used to speed children's learning. 
 The approach will be similar to the one that prompted the creation of groundbreaking shows like ''Sesame Street,'' which began broadcasting in 1969 and is still running, and ''The Electric Company,'' the 1970s series that is being revived by PBS and Sesame Workshop for 2009. 
 ''The same question that we asked 40 years ago is being asked,'' and the same results are hoped for, Ms. Cooney, 78, said in an interview at Sesame Workshop on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She is chairwoman of the executive committee of the nonprofit workshop's board. She stepped down in 1990 as president and chief executive of what was then known as Children's Television Workshop. 
 The success of ''Sesame Street'' spurred numerous commercial enterprises melding preschool children's entertainment and education, as companies like Nickelodeon and Disney saw the demand from parents. 
 ''Imitation is the fondest form of flattery,'' said Gary E. Knell, the president and chief executive of Sesame Workshop. But for early elementary-school students, ''it's sort of this vast wasteland, all entertainment, all the time,'' he said, and that is where the center hopes to make a mark. 
 While educational games and Web sites for schoolchildren are available, few are grounded in a detailed educational curriculum, said Michael Levine, an early childhood education research and policy expert who has been named executive director of the Joan Ganz Cooney Center. ''We are just about to see an explosion in the kinds of software that will be available on phones,'' said Dr. Levine, 50, who previously worked at the Asia Society and the Carnegie Corporation of New York and is a senior associate at Yale University's Edward Zigler Center in Child Development and Social Policy.
 Sesame Workshop uses research to determine what children can be expected to learn. By the time a workshop-produced show goes on the air, ''we know it's educational, there's no guessing about it,'' Ms. Cooney said, adding that the same needs to be known about new media projects. With content for older children, she said, some commercial producers have added educational elements ''to get brownie points, but there's no hard evidence that it's helping.''
 ''It can't hurt,'' Ms. Cooney continued, ''and I'm certainly glad to see the effort made but this will be far more disciplined in terms of being able to say, 'This will help children.'''
 Susan B. Neuman, professor of educational studies at the University of Michigan and a co-editor of the forthcoming book ''Multimedia and Literacy Development,'' said the new center's approach ''desperately is needed.'' She added that many companies are jumping into the digital new media world for elementary-school children without solid educational standards. ''There's so much junk,'' she said. ''When the quality is really poor, that potential is just wiped away.''
 The center's finances will be separate from those of Sesame Workshop. About $15 million has been raised toward a goal of a $20 million endowment to finance the center's work, Mr. Knell said. In addition to Sesame Workshop, the donors include Ms. Cooney's husband, Peter G. Peterson, the chairman and a founder of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, and the movie executive Harvey Weinstein, through Genius Products, a home entertainment company that distributes ''Sesame Street'' DVDs and is part-owned by the Weinstein Company. 
 The center's first report, which looks at the potential of digital media to encourage learning and examines where the industry is falling short, is being released today on the center's Web site (joanganzcooneycenter.org). Future research will examine the nation's fourth-grade reading slump, how new media can help students for whom English is a second language, and market barriers to the introduction of educational games. In addition Mr. Levine said he had had exploratory conversations with Verizon, Google, Scholastic, Nickelodeon and the Boston public television station WGBH, among others, about collaborations.

HEADLINE: Work With Me, Baby

BYLINE: By GUY TREBAY

 BODY:
FASHION is a stepchild, in photography no less than in other areas of the culture. The reach of the imagery it produces influences everything from trash television to presidential campaigns. Yet the slick work cranked out by the fashion machine is rarely taken seriously. 
 Museums relegate fashion picture shows to their basements. Art galleries disdain fashion photographs as work for hire. Auction houses have historically tended to accord fashion images second-class status, sneaking a few first-rate fashion pictures into sales of photography's certified masters. It's not hard to fathom why friction exists between practitioners of fine art and fashion photography. For every self-styled Cindy Sherman hoping to hit it big in the gallery world, there are scores of competent but doubtless overpaid journeymen (fees of $100,000 a day are not rare for top fashion photographers) toiling in advertising's lucrative fields. 
 ''For a long time in the quote unquote fine arts world, fashion was a dirty word,'' said Joshua Holdeman, international director of the photography department at Christie's. ''We're far enough away from the work now,'' he added, referring to the early examples from the canon, ''to realize it is a valuable cultural product that belongs in the pantheon of art history.'' 
 Signs of this seem to be everywhere. Last January, a show of pictures by five important contemporary fashion photographers was mounted at the National Portrait Gallery in London. Designating 2009 as the Year of Fashion, the International Center of Photography in New York recently announced an ambitious roster of shows celebrating the fashion image, beginning with a survey of contemporary work, moving through a retrospective of fashion images by Edward Steichen and Richard Avedon, and closing with the third I.C.P. Triennial, whose theme will be the cultural ubiquitousness of fashion imagery.
 And this week, fashion photography makes its debut at Art Basel Miami Beach, the annual trade fair that is to the art world what the Coachella festival in Southern California is to indie rock. In Fashion '07, an assembly of 20 contemporary photographers brought together by Marion de Beaupre, a curator and author, opened Dec. 2 at the Surfcomber Hotel. Part survey and part marketing trial balloon, the show also tests the premise that the traditional borders between fine and commercial art are now permeable. 
 ''As the market becomes so broad and there are so many people who have the means to collect,'' fashion pictures have been upgraded both critically and in the marketplace, Mr. Holdeman said. ''The imagery is easy to approach and accessible in price,'' he added, although accessible in this case may be a relative term. Prices for images by photographers like Serge Lutens, Max Vadukul and Willy Vanderperre are modest by Art Basel Miami Beach standards (generally under $10,000). But the Irving Penn platinum print a farseeing collector might have picked up at auction 10 years ago for under $8,000 would now command $350,000, Mr. Holdeman said. 
 A paradoxical dimension of the current lively interest in the field is that the innovative spirit and visual daring of the late '90s -- when many photographers were mining their personal lives as well as the weirder byways of pop culture, including pornography, and were also eschewing technological wizardry in favor of raw emotional response -- appears to have gone into retreat.
 Some in the industry point to the economy and the conservative tenor of most mainstream fashion magazines to explain this development. Some claim that a backlash against images condemned (by Bill Clinton, among others) for glorifying ''heroin chic'' in the mid-90s resulted in self-chastening throughout the industry. 
 Many note that the marquee names of the moment were already the establishment a decade ago. Where is the generation that ought by now to have supplanted stars like Jean-Baptiste Mondino, Ellen von Unwerth, Mario Testino or Nick McKnight? Who knows? 
 ''It's obviously a complicated issue,'' said Dennis Freedman, the creative director of W magazine, perhaps the most visually daring of mainstream American fashion publications. ''There are many photographers working today who have a lot to say, who have points of view, who have a voice that's intelligent and considered,'' he added. ''Unfortunately within the fashion world there aren't enough opportunities to create that meaningful work.'' 
 True, there was a period within the last decade, said Vince Aletti, a photography critic for The New Yorker and adjunct curator at the International Center of Photography, ''when every time I went to look at a fashion magazine, I was psyched.'' At the moment, he added, ''there is not much to jump out of your seat about.''
 There is little around quite as startling as the ''Fight Club'' pictorial that Steven Klein photographed for W, in which Brad Pitt posed covered with sweat and grime and so little else that the magazine's caption writers were taxed. There is little that seems so controversial as Mr. Klein's pictures of Justin Timberlake, which appeared just after 9/11, images whose borders were singed and whose pretty boy subject was shown with his nose caked in blood.
 Even Mr. Klein's pictures of a compulsive exhibitionist like Madonna, posed atop a table with her foot behind her head and her crotch thrust toward the viewer, seems to belong to another, more provocative time.
 ''The entirety of that Madonna sitting was very dark,'' Mr. Aletti said. ''And it couldn't have been further from the classicism and clean lines of Beaton and Horst.''
 Like the 20 photographers whose work is on view in Miami Beach, Mr. Klein sometimes gives the impression that he consults fashion history only rarely and cares little or nothing about clothes. This is illusion, of course, but one that Ms. de Beaupre, the curator of In Fashion '07, said helped set terms for a new kind of photographic engagement with the business of selling garments.
 With the notable exception of Steven Meisel, whose work mines an obsession with fashion's back pages, most fashion photographers of recent years have made it clear that their concerns lie mainly in ''material that has nothing to do with the history of fashion,'' as Mr. Aletti said.
 Enmeshed in both fashion's past and the cultural present, Mr. Meisel exploits an unabashed affection for fashion's surface obsession while simultaneously devising a sly form of cultural critique. ''I don't know whether a term like avant-garde works in this case,'' Mr. Aletti said. ''But, like a lot of people over the past few years, Meisel is really trying to do something creative and risky. He's really pushing photography.'' 
 Whether or not by intention, he is helping propel fashion photographs in the direction of art and in the process creating an alluring hybrid, one that sometimes supports an aesthetics of glamour and just as often parodies it. ''Fashion photography now is not about fashion alone,'' Ms. de Beaupre said. ''The material is of interest now because there is this strong creative and personal language,'' Ms. de Beaupre said, ''that belongs very much to our times.''

HEADLINE: Pessimism Is Growing in Executive Suites

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The chiefs are getting worried.
 Surveys of corporate chief executives and chief financial officers released yesterday showed sharp declines in optimism about the economy and business conditions, providing more evidence that the economy is slowing.
 Just 9 percent of chief financial officers said they were more optimistic about the economy in December than they had been three months earlier, a record low. ''We've never seen anything like that,'' said John R. Graham, a finance professor at Duke University, which conducted the survey with CFO Magazine. ''C.F.O. optimism is spiraling downward.''
 The monthly survey of chief executives found that 41 percent expected employment in the economy would decrease over the next three months, by far the largest such figure since the survey began in late 2002. Only 16 percent forecast an improvement in employment, with the rest expecting no change. As recently as July, only 12 percent forecast the employment situation would worsen. 
 ''C.E.O.'s have been clear over the past several months that they are worried about the economic climate,'' said Edward M. Kopko, the publisher of Chief Executive magazine, which conducted the survey of 533 chief executives who subscribe to the magazine. ''The recent dramatic drop in confidence may suggest that the worst is yet to come.''
 Overall, the C.E.O. confidence index fell for the fourth consecutive month, and was the lowest since May 2003.
 The sharp trend toward pessimism appears to have affected smaller companies more than larger ones, and to have the strongest impact at companies with the least-solid balance sheets. Mr. Graham said that a third of the 573 American C.F.O.'s said their companies had been hurt by the credit crisis, but that half of those with credit ratings of BBB, the lowest investment grade rating, or lower, said their companies had been hurt.
 The surveys were released a day after a more upbeat survey of 105 chief executives who are members of the Business Roundtable, a group of large American companies. That survey showed a small increase in confidence from the previous quarter, with 33 percent saying they expected their companies to increase hiring in this country in the next six months, while 22 percent expected to cut employment.
 The pessimism seems to be less pronounced for executives' own companies. Among the financial officers, 34.3 percent said they were more optimistic about their own companies than they had been three months earlier. But that was the lowest positive response to that question since it was first asked in 2002, and 36.6 percent said they had become more pessimistic.
 Among chief executives, slightly more said their companies were reducing capital spending than said they planned increases. But the C.F.O. survey showed an average increase of 4.1 percent planned for capital spending, higher than the 3.2 percent planned three months earlier.
 The financial officer survey asked, for the first time, if companies had experienced ''an increase in the number of employees taking loans or making hardship withdrawals from their 401(k) accounts?'' A total of 18.5 percent said they had, with the most-cited reason being the need to make mortgage payments.
 The credit crisis, which began in the subprime mortgage market, has spread to the leveraged loan market, which is a source of financing for many companies that lack investment-grade credit ratings. 
 ''The Fed has considerable interest in measuring the potential impact of the credit crisis on the overall economy,'' said Campbell R. Harvey, a Duke professor who founded the C.F.O. survey, ''and our survey provides the first direct evidence of the credit fallout.'' 
 He said that of the firms that said they had been affected by the credit problems, ''one-third will cut capital spending plans as a result of the conditions, and one-quarter indicate that hiring plans will be scaled back. These actions are detrimental to economic growth.''

HEADLINE: In Iran We Trust?

BYLINE: By VALERIE LINCY and GARY MILHOLLIN. 
Valerie Lincy is the editor of Iranwatch.org. Gary Milhollin is the director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 ON Monday the United States intelligence community issued what everyone agrees was blockbuster news: a report stating that in the autumn of 2003, Iran halted its nuclear weapons program. The National Intelligence Estimate has been heralded as a courageous act of independence by the intelligence agencies, and praised by both parties for showing a higher quality of spy work than earlier assessments.
 In fact, the report contains the same sorts of flaws that we have learned to expect from our intelligence agency offerings. It, like the report in 2002 that set up the invasion of Iraq, is both misleading and dangerous. 
 During the past year, a period when Iran's weapons program was supposedly halted, the government has been busy installing some 3,000 gas centrifuges at its plant at Natanz. These machines could, if operated continuously for about a year, create enough enriched uranium to provide fuel for a bomb. In addition, they have no plausible purpose in Iran's civilian nuclear effort. All of Iran's needs for enriched uranium for its energy programs are covered by a contract with Russia. 
 Iran is also building a heavy water reactor at its research center at Arak. This reactor is ideal for producing plutonium for nuclear bombs, but is of little use in an energy program like Iran's, which does not use plutonium for reactor fuel. India, Israel and Pakistan have all built similar reactors -- all with the purpose of fueling nuclear weapons. And why, by the way, does Iran even want a nuclear energy program, when it is sitting on an enormous pool of oil that is now skyrocketing in value? And why is Iran developing long-range Shahab missiles, which make no military sense without nuclear warheads to put on them? 
 For years these expensive projects have been viewed as evidence of Iran's commitment to nuclear weapons. Why aren't they still? The answer is that the new report defines ''nuclear weapons program'' in a ludicrously narrow way: it confines it to to enriching uranium at secret sites or working on a nuclear weapon design. But the halting of its secret enrichment and weapon design efforts in 2003 proves only that Iran made a tactical move. It suspended work that, if discovered, would unambiguously reveal intent to build a weapon. It has continued other work, crucial to the ability to make a bomb, that it can pass off as having civilian applications. 
 That work includes the centrifuges at Natanz, which bring Iran closer to a nuclear weapon every day -- two to seven years away. To assert, as the report does, that these centrifuges are ''civilian,'' and not part of Iran's weapons threat, is grossly misleading. 
 The new report has also upended our sanctions policy, which was just beginning to produce results. Banks and energy companies were pulling back from Iran. The United Nations Security Council had frozen the assets of dozens of Iranian companies. That policy now seems dead. If Iran is not going for the bomb, why punish it? 
 No company or bank will agree to lose money unless a nuclear threat is clear. Likewise, is it fair for the United Nations to continue to freeze the assets of people like Seyed Jaber Safdari, the manager of the Natanz plant, or companies like Mesbah Energy, the supplier of the reactor at Arak, because of links to a program that American intelligence believes is benign? One European official admitted to us that he and his colleagues were flummoxed. ''We have to have a new policy now for going forward,'' he said, ''but we haven't been able to figure out what it is.'' 
 This situation is made all the more absurd by the report's suggestion that international pressure offers the only hope of containing Iran. The report has now made such pressure nearly impossible to obtain. It is hardly surprising that China, which last week seemed ready to approve the next round of economic sanctions against Tehran, has now had a change of heart: its ambassador to the United Nations said yesterday that ''we all start from the presumption that now things have changed.''
 We should be suspicious of any document that suddenly gives the Bush administration a pass on a big national security problem it won't solve during its remaining year in office. Is the administration just washing its hands of the intractable Iranian nuclear issue by saying, ''If we can't fix it, it ain't broke''? 
 In any case, the report is an undoubted victory for Iran. Even if it opens the way for direct talks, which would be a benefit, it validates Iran's claim that efforts to shut down Natanz are illegitimate. Thus Iran will be free to operate and add to its centrifuges at Natanz, accumulate a stockpile of low-enriched uranium customary for civilian use, and then have the ability to convert that uranium in a matter of months to weapons grade. This ''breakout potential'' would create a nuclear threat that we and Iran's neighbors will have to live with for years to come.

HEADLINE: Ethanol Lobbyists Begin Drive to Use Richer Blend

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
With ethanol production threatening to grow faster than existing automobiles and service stations can absorb it, ethanol advocates began a push Wednesday to allow ordinary cars to run on blends of 20 or 30 percent ethanol, compared with 10 percent today. 
 Ethanol advocates said that such blends produced better fuel economy than ordinary gasoline. But automotive specialists outside the ethanol business expressed skepticism.
 The ethanol advocates said they had discovered a ''sweet spot'' at which fuel economy increased above the mileage using ordinary gasoline, a result they did not expect, because ethanol has about two-thirds of the amount of energy in each gallon as gasoline.
 ''Something about the combination at those percentages makes the car run more efficiently,'' said Ron Lamberty, vice president for market development at the American Coalition for Ethanol, a trade group.
 In tests this summer, a Chevrolet Impala built to use blends up to 85 percent ethanol, called a flex-fuel vehicle, got 15 percent better mileage on a 20 percent blend than on gasoline; with 30 ethanol percent, mileage was worse than the two other ways. 
 An ordinary Impala, not designed for blends over 10 percent, showed the best performance on straight gasoline. A Toyota Camry showed slightly better mileage on a 30 percent blend than on straight gasoline; a regular Ford Fusion also did slightly better on a 30 percent blend.
 The results puzzled some specialists. At General Motors, which has stressed its commitment to flex-fuel vehicles, a spokesman, Greg Martin, said engineers did not know why a mix with less energy content could make a car go farther. Mileage is mostly proportional to energy content, he said.
 ''There needs to be much more robust testing, especially in the areas of emissions and durability before midlevels are introduced into nonflex-fuel vehicles,'' Mr. Martin said. ''A rush to introduce new blends into the market without the time-proven due diligence could hurt both ethanol providers' and automakers' efforts.''
 With about 200 million motor vehicles in the United States and only about 6 million that are certified as operable on blends above 10 percent, the theoretical market is no more than about 14 billion gallons a year, according to government officials. 
 Markets in areas where ethanol is made would experience glut conditions first. Production is already about 6.5 billion gallons and is rising fast, said Alexander A. Karsner, assistant secretary of energy for renewable energy and conservation. 
 Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, appearing at a news briefing, said, ''In my state, we've got 16,000 or 17,000 flex-fuel vehicles.'' But ''we've got only 23 places where you can pull up and say, 'Fill it up with corn,''' he said. The solution, Senator Dorgan suggested, was to use higher ethanol blends in existing pumps and cars. 
 But five senators from states outside the Corn Belt sent a letter to President Bush this week urging caution. Ethanol-rich blends, they said, are corrosive for metals and plastics, and could hurt cars' durability and make them harder to start. 
 A 2001 study in Australia found that at 50,000 miles, a Hyundai Accent not made for ethanol but running on a 20 percent blend, had pollution emissions that violated standards there and were far higher than the same car running that many miles on gasoline.

PERSON: Robert O. Anderson 

HEADLINE: Robert O. Anderson, Oil Executive, Dies at 90

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Robert O. Anderson, an oilman whose Stetson-size accomplishments included building Atlantic Richfield into an industry giant; discovering oil in Alaska; becoming America's largest rancher, and giving generously to environmental causes, died on Sunday at his home in Roswell, N.M. He was 90.
 The cause was complications of a fall, his son Phelps Anderson said. 
 It was Mr. Anderson's insistence on drilling one more exploratory well on the North Slope in 1967 -- after a succession of failures -- that led to the discovery of what is still the largest oil field yet found in North America; it has produced billions of barrels of crude and accounts for a fifth of domestic oil production.
 ''It was like winning the Irish Sweepstakes, and the odds were about the same,'' Mr. Anderson said in an interview with Forbes in 1993.
 He told The Los Angeles Times in 1989, ''There's no question that if we hadn't made a discovery, it would have been the last well drilled on the North Slope for a good many years.''
 Mr. Anderson also led the seven-company effort to develop the Alaskan oil pipeline in 1974. In 1982, he negotiated the first American offshore drilling operation in China.
 Even two decades after his retirement and even after Atlantic Richfield was bought by BP seven years ago, Mr. Anderson stood out as perceptive, unpredictable and outspoken.
 He was an oilman who warned of global warming caused by fossil-fuel consumption in the 1980s, and more than once advocated higher taxes on his industry. He rescued two flailing publications, The Observer, a British newspaper, in 1977, and Harper's magazine in 1980.
 He was also a Reagan Republican who held many top nonelected posts in the Republican Party and favored nuclear power and a smaller federal government. Despite his large environmental philanthropy, he was once doused with a can of motor oil by an opponent of the Alaskan pipeline.
 He favored lively discussion and wide-ranging research, serving for many years as chairman of the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies, which convenes business executives and others to discuss world problems. He helped found the Worldwatch Institute in Washington to monitor global environmental trends, the International Institute for Environment and Development in London to study environmental and food issues and the John Muir Institute of the Environment in Davis, Calif.
 Mr. Anderson veered from corporate stereotypes, not least because he liked to wear a Stetson and bow tie. He bought and sold one of the most highly regarded makers of cowboy boots; a grain-trading operation; much of downtown Aspen, Colo.; and banks, steakhouses, ski areas and a bowling alley.
 Beginning in 1957, he assembled a farming and ranching enterprise exceeding a million acres, rivaled only by the renowned King Ranch. He, David Rockefeller and another partner once owned another million acres in Brazil.
 Mr. Anderson at his peak ran as many as 30,000 head of cattle and 12,000 sheep on ranches in three states. His collection of Arabian, thoroughbred and quarter horses was large and admired. He became one of the largest collectors of Indian art.
 Robert Orville Anderson was born in Chicago on April 13, 1917, to the Swedish immigrants Hugo A. Anderson and the former Hilda Nelson. Hugo was a prominent banker who, Robert said, was one of the first to lend money against proven but untapped oil reserves. The boy was entranced by his father's stories about oil-patch wildcatters, Kenneth Harris wrote in his biography, ''Wildcatter'' (1987).
 Robert attended the Laboratory Elementary and High Schools of the University of Chicago and went on to a two-year college program at the university, majoring in economics. During summers, he worked on pipelines in Texas. His goals shifted from architecture to petroleum, and he pored over geology and engineering books to educate himself.
 After graduating in 1939, he worked for the American Mineral Spirits Company, a subsidiary of Pure Oil. In 1941, his father helped him and his brothers buy a refinery in New Mexico. Mr. Anderson soon persuaded the Army Air Corps that he could deliver 91-octane fuel. His employees had never produced it, and there was a 31-day deadline. It was met, Mr. Harris wrote.
 Over the next 15 years, he bought and improved other refineries in the Southwestern states. He also began wildcatting for new fields, and in 1957 discovered the large Empire-Abo field in southeastern New Mexico. He was not always so lucky: he passed up a lease in Colorado offered for $90,000 that eventually yielded 400 million barrels of oil.
 ''Never look back in this business,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''If you do, you'll lose your nerve.''
 In 1963, Mr. Anderson merged his company into the Atlantic Refining Company of Philadelphia. Two years later, he was chairman and chief executive. He led the company through two mergers, the first with Richfield Oil of Los Angeles, forming Arco, and the second with Sinclair Oil. The combined company was the nation's seventh-biggest oil company.
 Mr. Anderson and Thornton F. Bradshaw, Arco's president, set a goal of becoming less dependent on foreign oil. The Prudhoe Bay find was a huge step in this direction. They also sought to balance Arco's production, transportation, refining and marketing operations. They disposed of half of the company's 20,000 gas stations.
 The company energetically sought out new sources of energy by investing in tar sands in Canada, oil shale in Utah and in coal reserves. In the 1970s, it argued for a comprehensive energy policy to support these expensive fuel sources.
 As part of an industrywide shopping spree in the 1970s, Arco bought Anaconda Copper. By the mid-1980s, low copper prices and inexperience in mining prompted Arco to sell Anaconda as part of a restructuring that was among Mr. Anderson's last initiatives at Arco.
 Mr. Anderson is survived by his wife of 68 years, the former Barbara Herrick Phelps; their daughters, Katherine Denton of Tucson; Maria Anderson, Julia Smith and Beverly Crane, all of Santa Fe, N.M.; and Barbara Kryder of Waban, Mass.; their sons, Phelps Anderson of Roswell, N.M., and Robert Bruce Anderson of Albuquerque; 20 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.
 After Mr. Anderson retired in 1986, he started Hondo Oil and Gas Company. A combination of bad luck in drilling, insistent creditors and oil-field accidents doomed the effort.
 ''No one should be in this business who isn't an optimist and who can't stand hard luck and adversity,'' he said in an interview with Forbes in 1993, at a moment when he hoped a wildcat well in Colombia might reverse his fortunes. ''No one knows that better than I do.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rally on Surprisingly Strong Jobs Data

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
A promising employment report lifted stocks yesterday, with the main indexes erasing two days of declines on renewed optimism about the outlook for the economy. But the Federal Reserve may face a more complicated landscape as it considers its next move on interest rates.
 Private payrolls grew by 189,000 jobs in November, far more than analysts had expected, according to Automatic Data Processing, an independent payroll company. 
 While the report is considered less important than the Labor Department's measure of job growth, which will be released tomorrow, the strong number took many in the market by surprise.
 ''That came out of left field, huh?'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at the research firm MFR. Economists had expected a gain of about 70,000 jobs for November. ''It's not a dead lock that we're going to get a good payroll number, but it certainly caused me to raise my estimates.'' 
 Investors agreed, sending the Dow Jones industrial average up almost 200 points in morning trading. The blue-chip index held on to most of its gains, closing at 13,444.96, a rise of 196.23 points, or 1.5 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 22.22 points, or 1.5 percent, at 1,485.01. The Nasdaq composite index was up 46.53 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,666.36.
 The government's report on November employment will be the last piece of important data before the Fed meets on Tuesday, when policy makers are expected to cut interest rates by at least a quarter-point. Fed officials have hinted that they are open to lowering rates to help avert a recession, but a sign of underlying strength -- like a big gain in jobs -- could persuade them to take a less aggressive stance.
 ''The economy might prove more resilient than a lot of the doomsayers have been saying,'' said Marc Chandler, who oversees currency strategy at the bank Brown Brothers Harriman. ''It's not like the U.S. economy is falling off the edge of the cliff.''
 Futures contracts on the Fed's actions showed investors pulling back yesterday from their expectations for a half-point decrease in interest rates. Still, the market sees a cut as certain.
 Some economists were skeptical of the A.D.P. report, which showed that job losses in manufacturing and construction, both hit hard by the housing downturn, had slowed to a trickle. Payrolls at financial firms appeared to increase.
 ''If you look at other evidence about the labor market, it points to weakening,'' said Mr. Shapiro of MFR, noting that sentiment surveys have suggested a bleaker employment outlook among consumers. ''There's something funky in these numbers, but they are what they are.''
 Joel Prakken, the chairman of the consulting company Macroeconomic Advisers, who developed the A.D.P. report, stood by his results. Referring to the job losses, he said: ''This is a much smaller decline than the average decline of the last 18 months. We could be approaching the end of that contraction.''
 Bargain hunting and lower energy prices may have also fueled yesterday's rally, analysts said. Two days of market declines offered lower prices for investors looking to buy in. The price of oil, which has driven fears of inflation and a spending slowdown, is down more than $2 in the last two days; it settled down 83 cents, at $87.49 a barrel yesterday in New York trading, nearly $10 below its high on Nov. 23. 
 A separate report yesterday showed that American workers were more productive in the third quarter, even as salary growth slowed. 
 A measure of worker efficiency increased 6.3 percent, the biggest quarterly gain in more than four years, up from a preliminary reading of 4.9 percent, the Labor Department said. Unit labor costs fell 2 percent, down from a preliminary 0.2 percent decline. 
 The rise in productivity -- and the deceleration in wage growth -- means that inflation may be less of a risk, which opens the door for the Fed to cut further.
 The Commerce Department also said yesterday that factory orders rose slightly in October, though a core measure -- purchases of nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft -- fell 2 percent, the first decline since June. 
 Activity at businesses outside of manufacturing dipped in November, and businesses appeared to be paying more for their goods, said the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group. Its activity index fell to 54.1 from 55.8 in October; readings above 50 indicate growth.

HEADLINE: Liking Clinton, but Acting Like Huckabee

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Gov. Jon S. Corzine plans to go to Iowa on Thursday to campaign for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, but when it comes to governing he is actually following a path blazed by another presidential candidate who lived in the Arkansas governor's mansion: former Gov. Mike Huckabee. 
 Even though Mr. Corzine is a liberal Democrat and Mr. Huckabee is a conservative Republican, the two have displayed similar reflexes on such issues as taxes, education and transportation. The parallels are so compelling, said Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers, that ''they're sort of like twins separated at birth.''
 Like Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Corzine revamped his state's school financing formula in the hope of complying with a court mandate. Like Mr. Huckabee, he raised the sales tax to plug a substantial budget gap, then traversed the state to generate support.
 Like Mr. Huckabee, Mr. Corzine expanded health insurance to cover tens of thousands of additional children.
 And just as Arkansas needs serviceable roads to accommodate the semis of Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods, so, too, does New Jersey need a healthy turnpike and public transit system to oil its economy. In that regard, Mr. Corzine is poised to follow Mr. Huckabee's lead, and in early January he intends to roll out his much-anticipated plan to issue bonds to help maintain the state's ailing transportation network.
 The two have even lost a good bit of weight while in office, though for different reasons. Mr. Huckabee drastically changed his eating habits and exercise regimen after learning he had diabetes, while Mr. Corzine underwent intense physical therapy after recovering from a nearly fatal car accident.
 Of course, the analogy can go only so far, especially when it comes to their divergent views on the war in Iraq, embryonic stem cell research and a panoply of other national issues. 
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Huckabee did not respond to an e-mail message and two voice mail messages seeking comment about the parallels.
 Lilo H. Stainton, Mr. Corzine's press secretary, said: ''We'd prefer the comparison to the other Arkansas governor from Hope. In his 12 years in office, Governor Clinton took on the establishment and made tough fiscal choices that put Arkansas on a more solid financial footing.''
 No matter whether Mr. Corzine is more like Mr. Huckabee or Bill Clinton, Mr. Baker said, their decisions reflect the kinds of tools that all governors, regardless of political philosophy, have at their disposal when confronted with fiscal difficulties.
 For instance, Mr. Huckabee accomplished two other things that Mr. Corzine has contemplated: raising the gasoline tax and imposing a bed tax on hospitals and nursing homes.
 Then again, Mr. Corzine still has two more years to go in his first term.

HEADLINE: Lenders Agree To Freeze Rates On Some Loans

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and VIKAS BAJAJ; Conrad D. Mulcahy contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
The Bush administration reached an agreement with the mortgage industry on Wednesday on a plan to freeze interest rates for up to five years for a portion of the two million homeowners who bought houses in the last few years with subprime loans.
 The plan, hammered out after weeks of talks among Treasury Department officials, mortgage lenders and Wall Street firms, would allow distressed borrowers who are current on their payments to keep their low introductory rates and escape an increase of 30 percent or more in their monthly payments when the rates expire. 
 Democratic lawmakers and presidential contenders quickly criticized the plan as being too timid and promoted more ambitious proposals of their own.
 The agreement, to be formally announced Thursday by President Bush, is expected to contain numerous limitations that would exclude many -- if not most -- subprime borrowers, according to industry executives who have seen it. It would exclude those who are delinquent on their payments -- about 22 percent of all subprime borrowers, according to First American LoanPerformance, an industry research firm.
 The plan is also expected to exclude any borrower whose introductory rate expires before Jan. 1. About $57 billion in subprime loans are scheduled to be reset at higher rates in the final three months of this year, according to estimates by First American LoanPerformance.
 Mortgage companies could also exclude borrowers whom they conclude are making enough money to afford higher monthly payments. Barclays Capital -- extrapolating from a similar program recently unveiled in California -- estimates that only about 12 percent of all subprime borrowers, or 240,000 homeowners, would get relief.
 ''From what I've heard, I don't see anything that leads me to believe we will see an increase in loan modifications,'' said Eric Halperin, Washington director of the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group that has studied the subprime problem.
 The plan is being announced as fallout from the mortgage crisis is seeping into the political sphere. Until recently, few candidates talked about subprime loans, and few bankers and traders on Wall Street paid much attention to mortgage-crisis declarations on the campaign trail. But with the meltdown growing worse, housing prices still plunging and many economists worrying about a recession, President Bush and his Democratic opponents are now racing to come up with answers.
 Democratic presidential candidates complained that the White House plan was overly narrow. 
 ''It seems that President Bush is going to give struggling homeowners far less than they need,'' Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said in a statement on Monday. ''With news accounts using terms like 'whittled down' and 'limited' to describe the scope of the Bush plan, it appears that the president is pushing a freeze for a very narrow group of borrowers.''
 Mrs. Clinton visited the Nasdaq stock market in New York on Wednesday and assailed Wall Street firms for the mortgage mess. She called for a 90-day moratorium on subprime foreclosures and a rate freeze that would apply to all borrowers current on payments and some who have fallen behind. 
 Despite the criticism, the Bush plan is a significant change in an initial reluctance to impose solutions. As recently as a month ago, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. argued that lenders should try to work out new terms on a case-by-case basis.
 But Mr. Paulson and federal banking regulators became increasingly impatient with the industry's failure to produce a systematic, rapid approach to evaluating borrowers. 
 Sheila C. Bair, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, proposed a comparatively radical plan to permanently freeze rates on all subprime loans. Mr. Paulson rejected that idea, but began to push for a standardized approach that would temporarily freeze rates for many borrowers facing upward adjustments on their monthly payments. 
 Administration officials emphasized that the rate freeze was only one part of a broader plan. Mr. Bush will also ask Congress to temporarily expand the authority of states and localities to issue tax-exempt mortgage-revenue bonds to help people refinance their mortgages.
 Treasury officials are also pushing the industry to come up with a streamlined way to help subprime borrowers refinance with a more conventional, lower-rate mortgage. 
 Subprime loans typically come with high interest rates, and were originally intended for people with poor credit histories. But some analysts say that more than a third of all subprime borrowers could have qualified for cheaper conventional loans at the outset. 
 But there was no sign on Wednesday that Mr. Bush's plan would contain new commitments by lenders to help people refinance. Absent any new approaches, borrowers would still be largely on their own to find better deals.
 Republican presidential candidates have seemed reluctant to propose government rescue plans, seeing them as a bailout. But they are feeling the heat nonetheless, and some are joining Mr. Paulson's effort to help people in danger of losing their homes.
 ''You don't want to reward speculators,'' said Senator John McCain of Arizona, who is running for the Republican nomination. ''You'd like to take each individual case on its own, but there's no time to do that. What's important is to stop the bleeding.'' 
 John Edwards, the Democratic presidential candidate and former senator from North Carolina, on Wednesday proposed a seven-year freeze in subprime interest rates, as well as a new fund to help distressed borrowers. Mr. Edwards also called for a change in bankruptcy laws that would give homeowners far more bargaining power in negotiating new terms. 
 Senator Barack Obama of Illinois jumped ahead of many of his Democratic presidential rivals in September with detailed recommendations that included a government rescue fund, changes in bankruptcy law and a new tax credit on mortgage interest for people who do not itemize their taxes and cannot currently deduct their interest payments.
 Adding to the political pressure, many of the states that are hardest hit by mortgage defaults and falling home prices are important election swing states. They include Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
 The first two voting states, Iowa and New Hampshire, have not been particularly hard hit by the housing crisis, but two of the states with early nominating contests -- Florida and Nevada -- have among the worst problems in the country.
 ''Even though foreign policy has been dominating the election for the past year, economics will pay a bigger role next year,'' said Howard Glaser, a mortgage industry consultant who worked in the Clinton administration and is an adviser to Mrs. Clinton's campaign. ''Not only will the specific mortgage and housing problems intensify, the ripple effects on the economy will also magnify.''

HEADLINE: Abbas to Seek Almost Twice As Much Aid From Abroad

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, will ask foreign donors to provide $5.8 billion in aid, through 2010, nearly double the current level.
 Mr. Abbas says he needs help with a huge deficit run up in years of strife, but he is also promising to curb spending and stimulate economic growth. 
 The Abbas government will give its development plan for 2008 through 2010 to officials from donor countries in Paris on Friday, before a high-level donor meeting there on Dec. 17.
 Seventy percent of the aid is to be used for continuing operating expenses, including $120 million a month for wages for public employees. Thirty percent is to be spent on development projects.
 The government hopes to decrease its deficit gradually, stimulate the economy, including private investment, and to become less and less dependent on aid, said Samir Abdullah, the Palestinian planning minister.
 ''Our ultimate goal is to end economic stagnation,'' he said, holding out hope for a balanced budget in six years, perhaps sooner if Israel moves fast to lift restrictions on trade and travel.
 The Paris conference is meant to build on the momentum from the Middle East conference last week in Annapolis, Md., where Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel pledged to resume peace talks and aim for an agreement by the end of 2008.
 However, the Palestinians are submitting a steep aid request amid considerable donor fatigue.
 Since the mid-1990s, foreign donors, led by Europe, have sent billions of dollars to the Palestinian territories to support peace efforts, but gains were largely wiped out in Israeli-Palestinian fighting. Critics also charge that large sums went to corrupt officials in previous governments.
 The decision by some nations to impose sanctions after the parliamentary election victory in 2006 by the militant Islamic group Hamas worsened the economic slide, as money was shifted from development projects to payments for welfare benefits. 
 In June, Hamas seized Gaza, ousting Mr. Abbas's troops, and Israel and Egypt virtually closed the territory's borders. 
 The Abbas government, governing from the West Bank, said it hoped to open a new chapter with the three-year plan.
 ''We are determined to bring an end to internal chaos and poverty -- and the occupation that continues to aggravate this situation,'' the report said, in a reference to the Israeli occupation. 
 ''We are determined to reverse the impact of decades of conflict and 'de-development,''' the report said. 
 It was unclear how much Gaza would benefit from foreign aid. The three-year plan commits only to providing humanitarian assistance and basic services until Gaza's borders reopen, presumably once Hamas is no longer in power there.
 Under the current arrangement, Mr. Abbas's government pays the salaries of 31,000 civil servants in Gaza who do not cooperate with Hamas, and covers Gaza's utility bills.
 Israelis Kill 2 Hamas Members
 JERUSALEM, Dec. 5 -- Israeli forces on Wednesday killed two members of Hamas and wounded four others as they prepared to fire a mortar shell into Israel, and killed at least one Palestinian security officer in Bethlehem after Israeli forces in civilian clothing were fired upon as they tried to carry out an arrest raid. 
 Israeli forces have killed 32 Palestinians in the past 10 days. Since January, Palestinians have fired over 2,000 rockets and mortar shells toward Israel from Gaza, Israel said.

HEADLINE: Democracy In the Americas

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
 I salute you, Hugo Chavez.
 Those are words I never thought I'd write. But nor did I think it possible that a Latin American strongman, issued from the barracks, accumulating power through threats, slandering opponents as ''traitors,'' buying support with $150 million a day in oil money, and bent on a socialist revolution, would accept a marginal electoral defeat.
 No, if it came to the humiliation of a 51 to 49 percent rejection of his proposal to end term limits and undermine private property rights and centralize authority, he would surely use a controlled Election Commission to tweak the numbers for Venezuela's glorious march to socialism. 
 And yet, there was a glum Chavez declaring in the unadorned language no totalitarian system can abide that: ''The people's decision will be upheld in respect of the basic rule of democracy: the winning option is the one that gets most votes.''
 The United States might ponder those words -- not just because of what happened in the presidential election of 2000; not just because the arithmetic of voting has proved unpalatable in Palestine; not just because of the past U.S.-abetted trampling of elected Latin American leaders in Chile and elsewhere -- but because democracy was alive and vital in Venezuela on Sunday in a way foreign to President Bush's America.
 I watched as ''Chavistas'' and their opponents exchanged arguments in the sun. The issue was grave -- a change of economic system under a comandante eyeing lifelong rule -- but civility prevailed. When the result came in the early hours Monday, supporters of the ''No'' campaign partied undisturbed.
 Venezuela's democratic credentials are robust for Latin America -- democracy has held since 1958 -- but pale by U.S. standards. Yet there was a directness, meaningfulness and civic responsibility about the proceedings that make the early running in the American election look pitiful.
 Bill Clinton's latest whining about press coverage of his wife, Mitt Romney's latest broadside on immigration, the various spins of the Iran intelligence volte-face, and the sterile who's-got-more-God competition between candidates, look like the machinations of a disoriented power.
 The United States needs a new beginning. It cannot lie in the Tudor-Stuart-like alternation of the Bush-Clinton dynasties, nor in the macho militarism of Republicans who see war without end. It has to involve a fresh face that will reconcile the country with itself and the world, get over divisions -- internal and external -- and speak with honesty about American glory and shame.
 Speaking of U.S. shame, I found myself thinking back as I watched the Caracas festivities to terrible scenes I witnessed in Santiago in 1986. Another Latin American strongman, a true dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, had responded with savagery to an attempted assassination.
 I wrote then in The Wall Street Journal of a kid called Alfredo Diaz who'd been beaten up by Pinochet's goons: ''He has very little hair. This month, soldiers slashed off most of it, then stuffed it in his mouth. His wrists are dotted with circular burn marks. The soldiers stubbed out their cigarettes on him. His face is cut and his eyes restless with fear. They finished by dumping him naked in a pond.''
 Diaz survived; more than 3,000 Chileans did not. In neighboring Argentina, more than 20,000 vanished as the junta's corpse-dumping helicopters did their business. These cold-war crimes involved U.S. complicity. Chavez's anti-Yankee rage, served up with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, has its Latin American resonance.
 Such dark chapters have never been acknowledged with sufficient forthrightness by a U.S. leader. It's time. Perhaps a president from a new generation would do so.
 The Americas are a better place today. Openness has done its work. Chavez's so-called revolution and other regional leftist rumblings reflect enduring social chasms, but Venezuela's democracy with brio shows the length of the road traveled.
 Let's be clear: Chavez is a caudillo. His ''socialismo'' equals ''Hugoismo.'' He's a menace. He's about to introduce a new currency, the strong bolivar, with monetary policy in chaos, inflation rising toward 20 percent, and his crony bankers pocketing millions by arbitraging the disparity between the official and black-market rates.
 Crime and drug-trafficking are thriving. He's still a believer in building socialism through local councils for which the Russian translation would be ''Soviets.'' He accused his opponents of a ''Pyrrhic victory'' and vowed not to change a ''comma'' of his rejected reforms.
 But his honoring of democracy's brittle wonders still merits a salute. Above all, however, I salute the Venezuelan people. Chavez said before the referendum that a ''no'' vote equaled a vote for Bush. Unperturbed, Venezuelans went ahead. And they gave a civic example from which Bush's battered and blathering democracy can learn.

HEADLINE: Bush and Iran: A New Landscape

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''U.S. Finding Says Iran Halted Nuclear Arms Effort in 2003'' (front page, Dec. 4):
 The National Intelligence Estimate has established that Iran halted its weapons program four years ago, and President Bush has been misleading us on Iran. I am appalled, once again. 
 How can we, the American people, allow the Bush administration to continue to ''massage'' its own intelligence assessment on Iran's extinct nuclear weapons program to prove that Iran must be pressured to suspend its weapons program? Excuse me? 
 I agree with President Bush that it is a warning signal, but the warning is that the last thing we, the American people, need is to be misled into another disastrous war based on blatant lies, overblown rhetoric, reckless hype and trumped-up intelligence. Congress must intervene quickly; we have lost too many men and women to the war machine. Nancy DePas
 Flushing, Queens, Dec. 4, 2007
 To the Editor:
 It should come as no shock to anyone who has actively followed the Iraq war that President Bush has chosen to mislead the American public about the status of Iran's nuclear weapons program. I have followed this war especially closely as my husband has served in Iraq twice, my friend's son has served twice, and my other friend's son died there. 
 President Bush has consistently demonstrated that he believes that belligerent words and actions make America safer, despite the now highly successful terrorist recruiting station known as Iraq. I am begging Congress, on behalf of my husband and our entire military, please do not let President Bush further abuse our fighting men and women. Condemn him for his brazen falsehood, and refuse to let our brave military be used against Iran. Wendy Chambers
 Alexandria, Va., Dec. 5, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Re ''An Assessment Jars a Foreign Policy Debate'' (news analysis, front page, Dec. 4):
 Your article about Iran's supposed abandonment of its nuclear arms program asked if the latest revelations will raise questions, again, about the integrity of America's beleaguered intelligence agencies. Having worked as an analyst at the National Security Agency, and had contacts with colleagues at the C.I.A., over the years, I can assure you that, in most cases, there is incredible pressure brought to bear on tailoring intelligence estimates to support White House policy initiatives. This was especially true during the Reagan years with regard to Nicaragua, and I suspect, with the current administration.
 The people who make up the intelligence community are dedicated, hard-working and patriotic individuals who honestly believe in their mission and strive to make a difference. I find it sad that critics, and this White House, in particular, seek to discredit their efforts in order to mask incompetence, wrongheadedness and misdirected zeal. The most pernicious advocate of this form of scapegoating is the office of the vice president. Manuel Michalowski
 Washington, Dec. 4, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Bush Insists Iran Remains a Threat Despite Arms Data'' (front page, Dec. 5): What's surprising about the response to this report is how eager people are to believe it. The same people who have discredited our intelligence on Iraq have, overnight, become ''believers'' in the same intelligence community.
 One might conclude that the reason for this transformation from cynic to believer is the report's usefulness to critics of the Bush administration. Unfortunately, this report is also useful to those whose economic relationship with Iran is better served by turning a blind eye to its hostility toward the West.
 Regardless of one's political affiliation, Americans, especially presidential candidates, should remain clear on who our enemies and friends really are. Iran is no friend of America. Andrea Economos
 Scarsdale, N.Y., Dec. 5, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran's nuclear program is good news for the United States and the international community. It removes the urgency for using force against Iran. It gives diplomacy a chance to work, which could lead to a thaw of our relations with this critical Muslim nation. 
 But most important, it saves us from making another mistake like Iraq.
 I remember sitting next to a top American envoy shortly after America's March 2003 invasion of Iraq. I asked him how the United States could justify that attack, since American troops failed to find weapons of mass destruction. 
 He could only reply, We will find them. 
 I am glad that this time we find out first before we again wage a war with incalculable financial and diplomatic consequences.

 To the Editor:
 Re ''Good and Bad News About Iran'' (editorial, Dec. 5):
 With your call for ''intensified pressures,'' you seem to join President Bush in spinning the National Intelligence Estimate's finding that Iran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003 into an argument for a continued hard line.
 But the truly worrisome fact is not that Iran is developing nuclear skills that could be applied to a bomb; it is that many countries are.
 Some, like India, Pakistan and Israel, have acquired nuclear arsenals and yet enjoy our support. The only long-term solution for nuclear proliferation is to lead a global effort to abolish nuclear weapons. 
 The United States cannot preach as long as it possesses the world's foremost nuclear arsenal, pursues nuclear bunker-busters, and threatens nuclear first use and attack on nonnuclear states. Nuclear abolition should be a top issue in the presidential campaign and a priority for a new administration.
 David Keppel
 Bloomington, Ind., Dec. 5, 2007
 To the Editor:
 In your editorial, you appropriately caution us not to be overly optimistic about a regime (Iran's) that has made a habit of misrepresenting facts about weapons programs and other issues.
 You seem to omit a caution for us not to give credence to any warnings from President Bush or anyone in his administration based on seven years' history of costly and deadly lies. One hopes that Mr. Bush might ''salvage his credibility with the American people and America's allies'' (do we still have any?) by talking with rather than bombing the Iranians. After all, they both speak the same language of deception.

HEADLINE: A Movie and Protesters Single Out Henry Kravis

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Bells will be ringing, and carolers will be greeting the Upper East Side neighbors of Henry Kravis this morning.
 It may be Christmastime, but the revelers are not there to embrace the holiday. They will be outside the apartment of Mr. Kravis, a founder of the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, for a sidewalk screening of the first of a series of short films crusading against private equity firms. Passers-by can catch the film on high-technology sandwich boards being worn by protesters.
 The movie, ''The War on Greed, Starring the Homes of Henry Kravis,'' is a tongue-in-cheek story -- think ''Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous'' meets ''Roger & Me'' -- detailing Mr. Kravis's homes and lifestyle, juxtaposed against the homes and incomes of working families.
 Directed by Robert Greenwald, the film starts by tallying Mr. Kravis's income: ''He made $450 million last year,'' the narrator says, ''which comes out to $1.3 million per day, or $51,369 per hour every hour of every day.'' Then it immediately cuts to an interview with Margaret Konjevod, a nurse at the Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
 What Mr. Kravis makes in an hour, ''that's what I make in a year, if I'm lucky,'' she says. ''I get $1.75 extra for working the night shift.''
 Today's protest is the latest indication that the reaction against the wealth created by private equity funds has become part of a populist movement. 
 The sentiment against private equity has clearly gotten the attention of the industry's titans. In a speech after Thanksgiving weekend, Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chairman of Blackstone Group, said the popular image of private equity was that of ''a destructive force with a short-term perspective, levering companies and stripping their assets to enrich a few nasty people (like me), who then don't even pay taxes on all that they get in such an unsavory manner.'' 
 He said, however, that ''I can promise you all that this is not true and that my wife and children were not ashamed to have me sit with them at the Thanksgiving table on Thursday.''
 That has not stopped groups from trying to embarrass the industry. The Service Employees International Union has been a persistent thorn in the side of private equity. The union has staged more than half a dozen protests and street theater events, ridiculing what it regards as the excesses of private equity.
 Over the summer, the S.E.I.U. staged a protest on Main Street in Southampton, N.Y., near another home of Mr. Kravis. Carrying parasols and dressed in seersucker suits, the protesters wore name tags like ''Rob Dapore'' and ''Ivy League Legacy'' and greeted passers-by with ''have a wonderful wealthy day.'' 
 On Halloween, the S.E.I.U. placed actors outside the Carlyle Group's offices in Washington. A character wearing a mask of Carlyle's co-founder, David M. Rubenstein (with the name tag ''Sugar Daddy'') handed out candy to ''lobbyists'' dressed as candy bars -- a ''King Size Paycheck'' bar and ''Loophole Savers.'' 
 Mr. Rubenstein has described the S.E.I.U.'s efforts as disingenuous, arguing that the organization is less interested in issues related to private equity as it is in stirring up attention to help add to its ranks. 
 ''It's really an effort to increase unionization, and not so much to worry about patients' health care,'' Mr. Rubenstein said at a conference last month, where S.E.I.U. members were outside handing out fliers about Carlyle's proposed acquisition of HCR Manor Care.
 Mr. Greenwald's movie, the first in a four-part series, is unrelated to the S.E.I.U. and came about, he said, because of what he read about the lavish lifestyles of private equity executives and the debate over the industry's tax treatment (private equity managers pay capital gains rates of 15 percent on much of their income, instead of the ordinary income tax rate of 35 percent).
 ''It hit me on the issue of taxes -- that really got to me,'' said Mr. Greenwald, whose production company is financed, in part, by advocacy groups. ''And then when I saw the numbers of what the guys make, I truly did not believe it. I thought they were a mistake.'' He said he decided to take on the issue of the inequality because ''I'm a New Yorker and this sort of egalitarianism is built in to many of us.''
 The first film, which will be shown at warongreed.org beginning today, tries to explain what Mr. Greenwald describes as the excesses and perils of private equity in a lighthearted way. Subsequent films, he said, would be more serious and look at effects on employees and customers, though he does not plan to suggest concrete solutions. 
 Some industry insiders may blanch at his attempt to simplify, or as he would say, ''boil down'' his message. In one voiceover, private equity is described as a firm that takes over ''public companies using primarily borrowed money.''
 ''To pay off this debt,'' the film says, ''they then sell off assets of the companies, fire thousands of workers and radically cut benefits of the remaining employees. It is the same product, in the same building, with the same customers as before.''
 Mr. Greenwald said he did not try to interview Mr. Kravis before releasing the film and had not consulted anyone in the industry. He said that he planned to reach out to Mr. Kravis and hoped that he would participate in future productions. He then suggested: ''If you don't participate, the story gets told without you.''
 A spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis declined to comment.
 Some may question the timing of the film. With the credit market all but frozen and some economists predicting a recession, the likelihood of instant riches in private equity appears unlikely. Indeed, a downturn in the economy may show how overleveraged some of these companies were, perhaps demonstrating his point, but perhaps too late.
 At the end of the film, working families are asked what they would do if they could have Mr. Kravis' 28-room apartment on Park Avenue for 24 hours. A young girl's answer: ''I would put everything on eBay in the apartment and then give it to charity.''
 Anne Elizabeth Noyes and Jenny Anderson contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Abbas to Seek Almost Twice As Much Aid From Abroad

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: RAMALLAH, West Bank, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, will ask foreign donors to provide $5.8 billion in aid, through 2010, nearly double the current level.
 Mr. Abbas says he needs help with a huge deficit run up in years of strife, but he is also promising to curb spending and stimulate economic growth. 
 The Abbas government will give its development plan for 2008 through 2010 to officials from donor countries in Paris on Friday, before a high-level donor meeting there on Dec. 17.
 Seventy percent of the aid is to be used for continuing operating expenses, including $120 million a month for wages for public employees. Thirty percent is to be spent on development projects.
 The government hopes to decrease its deficit gradually, stimulate the economy, including private investment, and to become less and less dependent on aid, said Samir Abdullah, the Palestinian planning minister.
 ''Our ultimate goal is to end economic stagnation,'' he said, holding out hope for a balanced budget in six years, perhaps sooner if Israel moves fast to lift restrictions on trade and travel.
 The Paris conference is meant to build on the momentum from the Middle East conference last week in Annapolis, Md., where Mr. Abbas and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert of Israel pledged to resume peace talks and aim for an agreement by the end of 2008.
 However, the Palestinians are submitting a steep aid request amid considerable donor fatigue.
 Since the mid-1990s, foreign donors, led by Europe, have sent billions of dollars to the Palestinian territories to support peace efforts, but gains were largely wiped out in Israeli-Palestinian fighting. Critics also charge that large sums went to corrupt officials in previous governments.
 The decision by some nations to impose sanctions after the parliamentary election victory in 2006 by the militant Islamic group Hamas worsened the economic slide, as money was shifted from development projects to payments for welfare benefits. 
 In June, Hamas seized Gaza, ousting Mr. Abbas's troops, and Israel and Egypt virtually closed the territory's borders. 
 The Abbas government, governing from the West Bank, said it hoped to open a new chapter with the three-year plan.
 ''We are determined to bring an end to internal chaos and poverty -- and the occupation that continues to aggravate this situation,'' the report said, in a reference to the Israeli occupation. 
 ''We are determined to reverse the impact of decades of conflict and 'de-development,''' the report said. 
 It was unclear how much Gaza would benefit from foreign aid. The three-year plan commits only to providing humanitarian assistance and basic services until Gaza's borders reopen, presumably once Hamas is no longer in power there.
 Under the current arrangement, Mr. Abbas's government pays the salaries of 31,000 civil servants in Gaza who do not cooperate with Hamas, and covers Gaza's utility bills.

HEADLINE: Doll's Village: Some See Restoration As Too Cutesy

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: AURORA, N.Y. 

 BODY:
After a five-year makeover at the hands of the founder of the American Girl doll collection, this village of white clapboard and faded brick on Cayuga Lake practically glows, with freshly painted homes, refurbished inns and markets selling dried organic cranberries and cheese made from sheep's milk.
 It was an act of philanthropy by the woman who began the popular line of historic dolls and books, Pleasant T. Rowland. Ms. Rowland, an alumna of Wells College here, gave $40 million to her alma mater to revitalize Aurora's diminutive downtown and to help reverse the college's declining enrollment. The money did just that, but not without earning Ms. Rowland enemies: a group of residents who resented her for making the historic village, in their eyes, too fancy and artificial, about as authentic as a dollhouse.
 ''The thing that a lot of people lament is that it has torn the village apart,'' said Anna Baxter, 29, who moved to Aurora from New York City with her partner, Rufus Bates, a furniture maker, to open Grove Gallery, where the paintings cost from $250 to $3,500. 
 On the outside, the village of 750 in the Finger Lakes region could not be more placid, with the white caps of Cayuga framing a timeless streetscape. But tensions fester, despite the dismissal of a lawsuit that sought to derail some of the work. On some of Ms. Rowland's visits to town from Madison, Wis., where she lives and presides over the Pleasant T. Rowland Foundation, some residents have cursed her to her face.
 One opponent, a local investment consultant, took to leaving his car parked in front of the college-owned Aurora Inn, an 1833 gem that was shuttered on and off before Ms. Rowland paid for a top-to-bottom renovation, or what critics call a shameful gutting. He covered the car with signs, including one that said, ''Pleasant Rowland: More trouble than she's worth.'' Bumper stickers protested that ''Aurora was Pleasant before.''
 Some of Ms. Rowland's supporters say she will never inhabit the rambling lakefront home, called Abbott House, that she bought for use as her personal residence. (The grants manager of the Rowland Foundation said that Ms. Rowland, who sold American Girl to Mattel in 1998 for $700 million, did not give interviews.)
 ''They persecuted her,'' said Jacci Farlow, a photographer and graphic designer here who has published a book of before-and-after pictures, ''Aurora in Just Five Years.'' 
 ''Pleasant was like an archangel come to town, a fairy godmother,'' Ms. Farlow said. ''We actually have thriving businesses now and places to hang out and places to eat. They spit at her. They shouted obscenities at her on the street.''
 For the college, which was founded by Henry Wells in 1868, the transformation of the downtown was a shot in the arm. The decision to admit men, starting in 2005, coupled with the upgrading of the village, stemmed the slide in enrollment, which had hit a low of 395. It is now up to 567; applications have almost tripled. 
 Ann S. Rollo, Wells's vice president for communications, said the college was ''extraordinarily pleased by the physical results,'' pointing out that the work Ms. Rowland paid for was more than cosmetic: some of the buildings required major structural improvements, including roofing, plumbing and wiring.
 The new downtown has helped attract not only students but also professors. ''We're on a regular cycle of recruiting new faculty and staff members, and for us to have a pretty neat little village is enormously helpful,'' Ms. Rollo said. ''When people choose to come here, it's far more than a job. It's a community and a lifestyle.''
 Ms. Rowland, a member of the class of 1962, renewed her interest in Wells in the early 1990s with a $2.5 million gift that helped beautify the public spaces on campus. But in 2000, with the college-owned businesses in town struggling with the upstate economy, Wells's president, Lisa Marsh Ryerson, reached out to Ms. Rowland.
 Her response was far-reaching, with a commitment to revamp a half-dozen college properties with the same high-end materials and eye for detail that put American Girl dolls at the top of holiday wish lists. Ms. Rowland also rescued the village's second major employer, a home furnishings company called MacKenzie-Childs, which was in bankruptcy.
 Independent of the Aurora Foundation, which was created to oversee the work, Ms. Rowland also bought two private homes, Abbott House and Leffingwell House.
 But what seemed to rankle some residents was her tinkering with the college-owned establishments, especially a cherished dive that is now a tasteful restaurant, the Fargo Bar and Grill. Some regulars bemoan the change in clientele that followed (families and tourists) and chastise the college for taking over its management.
 One longtime customer, Tudy Kenyon, 77, said, ''I hate change, and nothing changed till Pleasant came.'' Nibbling from a bowl of popcorn, Ms. Kenyon, a Wells alumna and hamster breeder, added, ''This place was just a small-town bar like you see in the movies, full of local people with beer and wine and just burgers.'' 
 In addition to the Fargo, Ms. Rowland's money transformed the once-faded Aurora Inn, which now offers some of the most elegant lodging in the state west of the Hudson. And it turned the neglected E. B. Morgan House, which the college had used to house guests, into a luxurious annex to the inn, sprinkled with the whimsical furnishings of MacKenzie-Childs.
 Ms. Rowland also paid for the replacement of the college-owned Village Market, which now has a mahogany facade, as well as upgrades to a tiny yellow building that the college leases to Bet the Farm, a wine and cheese shop.
 On her own, Ms. Rowland bought Mac's, a dim five-and-dime that sold notions and ice cream. She turned it into a bright luncheonette and gave it to the college last year. She also provided the college the money to buy the stately old post office building, which the college plans to lease as retail space.
 Ms. Baxter, originally from Alaska and a graduate of Harvard, said she was persuaded to relocate to Aurora, in part, by Ms. Rowland's initiatives. She and Mr. Bates, an Aurora native and Pratt Institute graduate, bought a four-acre property overlooking grapevines on the outskirts of town where Mr. Bates builds contemporary furniture in a 2,500-square-foot studio. They opened their art gallery last year.
 But a coalition of residents and Wells alumnae objected to the new-and-improved Aurora on the grounds of historic accuracy. The village, including the 350-acre Wells campus, is listed as a historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. The coalition filed suit, trying to stop the work on the Aurora Inn and demolition of the adjacent market until environmental reviews were done. The suit failed. 
 ''What we have is the facade of the original buildings,'' said Karen A. Hindenlang, a member of the coalition. ''They've been destroyed. You can't expect us to be thrilled with what's been built on top of the rubble.''
 The coalition won the support of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, a nonprofit organization that urged Ms. Rowland and the college, early on, not to tear down or gut structures in the historic district.
 ''The idea of stripping the interior of the Aurora Inn to put in a new interior that was 'faux-historic' was wrong-headed,'' said Roberta Lane, the trust's program officer and regional attorney for the Northeast. 
 Ms. Rollo, however, said that the inn had undergone renovations over the years and that ''not everything in there was historical or intact.'' Moreover, carpenters uncovered hidden fireplaces and replicated original moldings and mantels, she said.
 Since reopening in 2003, the Aurora Inn, where rates are $225 to $375 a night in peak season, has not become a cash cow for the college, but it is self-sustaining. Through the 1990s, the college supported the inn through annual infusions of $250,000 and more. ''Fortunately, it's no longer a drain on the financial resources of the college,'' Ms. Rollo said.
 While most of the students at Wells never knew the Aurora of old, some describe the village as an enchanting backdrop for their studies. 
 ''Once I got here,'' said Seyda Akyuz, a freshman from Syracuse, ''I started to notice my surroundings. The town is really pretty. I love walking through it.''

HEADLINE: Hope for Homeowners Lifts Wall Street

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street rallied once again yesterday as investors bet that companies hurt by the housing slump will benefit from a government plan to help financially stretched homeowners.
 The Dow Jones industrial average climbed more than 170 points after a nearly 200-point rise on Wednesday.
 Wall Street has been concerned about the fallout of the housing slump on consumers, and trading started a bit shaky yesterday when Target, the big retailer, said that November sales were bolstered by extra selling days and that December sales would fall short of its previous forecast. Its shares fell $4.56, or 7.6 percent, to $55.57. Shares of a rival, J. C. Penney, fell $1.01, or 2.2 percent, to $44.84 after reporting November sales that were below expectations. 
 Stocks eventually pushed higher, however. A weak consumer, though bad for corporate profits, supports the argument for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates when it meets Tuesday. A rate cut could help reinvigorate the slowing economy and loosen up the tight credit markets.
 Stocks got an extra lift when President Bush announced a plan allowing some homeowners facing foreclosure to not only freeze their interest rates for up to five years, but also to refinance their mortgages. The plan was created by the Treasury Department, mortgage lenders and banks, and could help about 1.2 million homeowners, Mr. Bush said.
 ''That's providing a glimmer of hope,'' said Jim Herrick, director of equity trading at Baird & Company. ''But there's some skepticism. Is this really going to be the panacea to the subprime market? That's the $64,000 question.''
 Foreclosures hit a record high in the third quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The fallout from the turmoil has weighed on the financial services sector this year, with banks and brokerage firms writing down about $80 billion worth of securities tied to mortgages.
 The Dow rose 174.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to 13,619.89. The blue-chip index is still 3.8 percent below its Oct. 9 closing record of 14,164.53, but it has risen nearly 6.9 percent in the week and a half since it incurred huge losses in early to mid-November.
 Broader stock indicators also extended their gains. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 22.33, or 1.5 percent, to 1,507.34, and the Nasdaq index rose 42.67, or 1.6 percent, to 2,709.03.
 Crude oil prices rose $2.74, to $90.23, a barrel in New York trading on a drop in inventories as refiners moved to meet heating oil demand.
 Bond prices fell as investors returned to stocks. The 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 101 31/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.01 percent from 3.95 percent.
 ''Investors are having a collective sigh of relief that this is a positive signal the housing crisis and credit crunch will not cause the end of this bull market,'' said Hugh Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisors.
 The stock market has been volatile since the summer, rising on signals that the worst of the credit problems were over and then dropping on hints that they could persist well into next year. 
 November was the worst month for the Dow in five years, and many investors have been uncertain about the chances for a December rally.

HEADLINE: Some Needing Mortgage Aid Won't Get It

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
When Jirina Koy heard that President Bush was announcing a freeze yesterday on mortgage interest rates, the Stockton, Calif., homeowner felt a flicker of hope.
 It was quickly extinguished. After calling a nonprofit housing assistance center, Ms. Koy learned that her mortgage, for all the trouble it was causing her, was not likely to be one of those qualifying for relief.
 Mortgage experts say there will be many borrowers like Ms. Koy. The exact guidelines of the rescue plan are still fuzzy, but it is clear that many of those who need aid the most will not get it. The number of households facing foreclosure in the next two years is estimated to exceed two million. 
 ''I'm glad someone's getting help, but I wish it were me,'' said Ms. Koy, 46, who works in the state unemployment office. 
 She has a so-called option loan, which gives her the choice of how much to pay every month. Heavy in debt, she usually chooses the minimum. The unpaid interest and principal is added to her mortgage balance, which means her loan keeps getting bigger.
 Ms. Koy's woes were compounded by an ill-advised refinancing two years ago. 
 ''I got all these calls from brokers all the time -- 'You could pay off debt, pay off the car loan, make extra money every month, blah blah,' '' she said. She took out $60,000.
 ''The only way that would have made sense is if I had cut up my credit cards and nothing else had come up,'' Ms. Koy said. ''But something else always comes up.''
 Ms. Koy's husband is disabled and has not worked for a decade. The couple's credit card debt is back up to $25,000, in part because of their daughter's medical bills. Their three-bedroom house is worth about $250,000, but they owe much more on it.
 Kimberley Williams, who owns a small bungalow in Los Angeles, might have a happier fate than Ms. Koy. She bought her home in February 2006, as the boom was peaking. 
 ''I felt that if I didn't get into the market, I wouldn't be able to afford a house in California,'' she said.
 In November 2006, Ms. Williams refinanced. Like Ms. Koy, she got money to pay bills, including paying off her car. But her monthly mortgage payment rose to $3,011. Next December, it will jump by several hundred dollars. 
 Ms. Williams, a registered nurse, does not regret refinancing, but is worried about possibly being forced to sell in a declining market -- or worse.
 ''Even people with good jobs making good money are facing foreclosure,'' said Ms. Williams, 43. She plans to apply for the freeze.
 While acknowledging that only a small number of stressed borrowers would be helped, Lori Gay, president of Los Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services, a nonprofit group, called the freeze ''a great beginning.'' 
 Michael Shea, executive director of Acorn Housing, another counseling agency, took a different view. ''We're disappointed that a year into this crisis the responses are so lacking in the bold leadership,'' he said. ''We really need an F.D.R.-like approach, and not Calvin Coolidge.''
 Real estate agents in high-foreclosure areas had different opinions about whether the freeze would have an effect on queasy markets.
 Jason Bosch, president of Home Center Realty in California's hard-hit Riverside County, was pessimistic.
 ''We were selling $300,000 homes to people who could only afford $175,000 homes,'' he said. ''Even if you freeze their payments, they still can't handle it.''
 In Sarasota, Fla., a real estate agent, Jim Willig, was hopeful that at least the freeze would put a brake on some of the inventory flooding the area.
 ''That's a benefit,'' said Mr. Willig, who owns seven rental houses, all of them worth less than he paid.
 Tom Gutierrez, bought his house in 2004, too early to qualify for the freeze.
 Mr. Gutierrez, a school bus driver who lives in West Covina, Calif., is negotiating a new loan. ''Many home buyers didn't do our homework,'' he said. ''Maybe some kind of education will help as well.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Agency's Slow Pace Endangers Foreign Aid

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
The Millennium Challenge Corporation, a federal agency set up almost four years ago to reinvent foreign aid, has taken far longer to help poor, well-governed countries than its supporters expected or its critics say is reasonable.
 The agency, a rare Bush administration proposal to be enacted with bipartisan support, has spent only $155 million of the $4.8 billion it has approved for ambitious projects in 15 countries in Africa, Central America and other regions.
 And the agency's slow pace is making it politically vulnerable at budget crunch time. Both the House and the Senate have slashed the Bush administration's 2008 budget request for the agency, but the Senate has gone a step further, pushing for a change that African leaders say threatens the essence of the agency's novel approach.
 Eyeing the unspent billions, the Senate has proposed that Congress provide no more than half the money up front for future five-year projects, which typically come with a price tag of $250 million to $700 million. Such projects are now fully financed at the start to make sure countries have the wherewithal to finish what they start. 
 Senator Patrick J. Leahy, the Vermont Democrat who heads the Senate appropriations subcommittee on foreign aid, said that Congress could be counted on to come up with the rest of the money if the countries fulfilled their end of the bargain. But, he asked, where else should Congress look for savings in its foreign aid budget? 
 ''Do we cut maternal health?'' he asked. ''AIDS? Malaria? Do we cut refugees? The only thing that's got a blank check is the war in Iraq.''
 Agency officials and the African leaders they assist said in recent interviews that the change would be a big step backward. American foreign aid often takes the form of modest, short-term projects that are planned in Washington and carried out by American contractors and charities. But under the agency's approach, poor countries with sound economic policies and strong track records of helping their people are chosen to conceive and carry out big undertakings themselves. 
 The Millennium Challenge Corporation's budget now makes up less than 10 percent of the United States foreign aid budget. 
 By changing how its projects are financed, ''then M.C.C. becomes like the World Bank and all the other countries using overseas development aid in stop and go fashion,'' said John A. Kufuor, the president of Ghana, who heads the African Union. ''The aid is spread so thin that at the end of the day the necessary difference is not made.''
 The Millennium Challenge Corporation's chief problem has been its sluggish record in getting projects beyond the planning stage to the point where contractors can actually build the roads, irrigation canals, power plants and clean water systems that poor countries say they need.
 Sheila Herrling, who follows the agency at the Center for Global Development, a nonprofit research group in Washington, says there are understandable reasons projects take time and suggests that the agency's current five-year timeline for each one may be too short.
 Poor countries, even relatively well-run ones, are not used to planning such complex developments and have needed more time than expected to get them off the ground, she said.
 Also, the infrastructure projects poor countries need are prone to corruption, and putting stringent accountability systems in place has consumed more time than expected.
 Development analysts have praised the agency for giving poor countries an incentive to make significant reforms to qualify for its big contracts, including improving education for girls, making it easier for individuals to operate on-the-books businesses. 
 But the agency itself must also shoulder some of the blame for the slow progress, Ms. Herrling said. Its decision-making has been too focused on putting together the projects, rather than on carrying them out. 
 ''It shouldn't have taken so long,'' she said. ''The agency needs to figure it out this year. They are part of the problem.''
 John J. Danilovich, the businessman and former ambassador who has led the agency for two years, recently reorganized it to concentrate on results with what he called ''laser focus.''
 ''We need to do better and we will do better,'' he said in an interview.
 Mr. Danilovich, a Bush appointee, has convinced Representative Nita Lowey, the New York Democrat who heads the House appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid, that he is serious. Mrs. Lowey said in an interview that the agency was still unproven. And she was disappointed on a visit to Ghana this year to find that its $547 million compact to develop a modern agricultural economy still was not very far along. But on the need for progress, she said, ''I do believe that Danilovich gets it.''
 The future of the Millennium Challenge Corporation is one of the many issues caught in the budgetary stalemate between the administration and Congress.
 The administration asked for $3 billion for the agency. In their foreign aid appropriations bills, the House provided $1.8 billion, the Senate $1.2 billion. Mrs. Lowey said she strongly opposed the Senate's proposal to provide no more than half the financing up front, an idea originally suggested by Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana. The House and Senate are expected to settle the issue by next week.
 If the agency gets the lesser Senate amount, under the current rules requiring the money up front, Burkina Faso, a West African country that has spent more than two years qualifying for and drafting its $560 million to $620 million plan, will get nothing, agency officials said. Tanzania and Namibia are ahead of it in line.
 Burkina Faso's prime minister, Tertius Zongo, said his country would be deeply disappointed if the money was not available. 
 ''We have done our part,'' he said. ''This is a partnership.''
 Burkina Faso has gone to great lengths to meet the agency's good governance standards. The agency gave it a $13 million grant to improve girls' education, which the country used to build, among other things, schools with day care centers so school-age girls do not have to stay home to look after their younger siblings.
 Identified by the International Finance Corporation as one of the most difficult places in the world to do business, Burkina Faso has also halved the number of days it takes to start a business, and reduced by a third the cost of registering property.
 In small, poor countries like Burkina Faso, every burp and hiccup of an aid agency like the Millennium Challenge Corporation is news -- and often front page news. David Weld, the agency's country director for Burkina Faso, said he did not know how he could face people there if Congress did not come through with enough money to help them.
 ''What type of message does that send to Burkina Faso, a country that has spent a huge amount of political capital and money on this process?'' he asked. ''What does that tell the Togos, the Nigers that want to become eligible? It tells them: Do everything like Burkina Faso, make all these reforms, spend millions of your own money, and then maybe at the end we might be able to sign a compact with you -- or maybe not.''

HEADLINE: It's Busy at the Top in the Hawaii Luxury-Home Market

BYLINE: By ALLISON SCHAEFERS

 BODY:
WHILE real estate transactions continue to slump in many places on the United States mainland, the strength of Hawaii's international pull has propelled its luxury sales ahead of last year's and has increased speculative development. 
 The recent $11.25 million sale of a new house in Kahala, a prestigious Honolulu neighborhood, is the latest evidence that the state's luxury home market is robust. And it came on the heels of a $15.9 million transaction in October that, so far, is Oahu's largest sale of the year. 
 While Hawaii has long drawn global interest, the international real estate market there has improved as developers are reinvesting in the state and the dollar has weakened against foreign currencies, said Donald Eovino, president and principal broker of Eovino and Associates, a real estate firm. 
 ''Hawaii is the Monaco of the West Coast for the affluent,'' Mr. Eovino said. ''Hawaii's international real estate market, this year, has the potential to be bigger than any year before.'' 
 The Canadians discovered Hawaii real estate in the 1960s, the Saudis arrived in the 1970s, and the Japanese came in the middle to late 1980s. They left after heavy speculation created a housing bubble that caused the market to turn. Now, the Japanese and Canadian buyers are back, real estate experts say, adding that there was greater demand for Hawaii from other areas of the Pacific, and from Europe, China, South Korea and other parts of Asia. 
 Although real estate activity overall has slowed by almost 10 percent on Oahu, transactions involving top-end homes increased 14 percent in the third quarter from the comparable period of 2006, said Scott Higashi, vice president of sales at the Prudential Locations agency in Honolulu. 
 In the first 10 months of 2007, 497 properties valued at $1 million or more were sold on Oahu, compared with 460 properties in the same period in 2006, said Harvey Shapiro, research economist for the Honolulu Board of Realtors. 
 The returning strength of Hawaii has been apparent for some time. In November 2006, the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Waikiki set a world sales record when it sold $700 million worth of residential units in eight hours, said Roxanne Loughery, senior vice president of marketing for S&P Destination Properties. ''We see Hawaii as one of our top international destinations,'' she said. 
 Sales of the Waikiki project, which were held simultaneously in Hawaii and Japan, moved so fast that Ivanka Trump, vice president of development and acquisitions for her father, Donald, almost missed getting a unit. ''About 40 percent of the buyers were from Hawaii and Asia, and the remainder came from all over the world,'' she said at the time. 
 The weakening of the United States dollar is drawing even more foreign interest. ''There's been a noticeable increase in international buyers within the last 60 to 90 days,'' said Chason Ishii, president of Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties in Honolulu. 
 WHEN the dollar exchange rate fell against the yen several months ago, Hawaii saw a wave of Japanese buyers, said Sachi Braden, owner of Sachi Hawaii, a company in Honolulu that specializes in selling to the high-end Asian market. ''Right off the top, they are looking at about a 5 percent savings,'' she said. 
 Similarly, more Canadian buyers are choosing to buy Hawaii real estate and capitalize on the best United States exchange rates they have seen in 30 years, Ms. Loughery said. ''Five years ago, a $1 million property in the U.S. would have cost a Canadian buyer $1.6 million to purchase. Now it will cost them just under $1 million,'' she said. ''We've seen a big change in the exchange rates in the last six to eight weeks, and everyone wants to go shopping.'' 
 Buyers from Alberta and British Columbia played heavily in the mix of investors who bought property last month when S&P Destination Properties began sales of Koloa Landing, a luxury resort condominium project on Kauai, Ms. Loughery said. ''We sold $76 million worth of real estate in just a few weeks,'' she said, adding that the planned sales of the Residential Suites at the Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua, on Maui next year are also expected to draw international attention. 
 The strengthening of the euro and more efficient flights have led Europeans to consider Hawaii, said Manu Spaur, broker/owner of ReMax Island Surf Realty on the Big Island of Hawaii, whose multilingual staff is working to develop the European market. 
 ''With the euro so strong, it makes it much more likely for Europeans to buy outside of their country,'' said Ms. Spaur, who was born in Germany and has marketed Hawaii in her homeland as well as in Greece and Turkey. European investment companies have also bought island real estate, she said. 
 In the near future, planned tourism and banking charges are also expected to draw more Hawaii real estate offers from buyers in South Korea and China, said Marsha Wienert of the Hawaii Tourism Authority.
 By 2008 or the first quarter of 2009, South Korea is expected to get visa waiver status, which will make the islands more accessible to its citizens, Ms. Wienert said.
 Hawaii officials also are seeking more relaxed rules for visitors from China. Chinese visitors would still have to obtain visas but they would be allowed to visit for pleasure, instead of requiring a business reason, as now, she said. ''There's no question that we'll have more international tourism and a lot more international investment as a result of these changes,'' Ms. Wienert added. 
 China and South Korea's robust growth, combined with changes in some banking restrictions will make it more attractive for investors to diversify by taking money abroad, said Steve Atherton, managing director in Hong Kong of Asia-Pacific operations for NAI Global, a commercial real estate business. 
 But experts have said that the appeal of Hawaii's luxury market goes beyond changes in currency or government monetary or tourism policies. 
 An example is the $15.9 million sale on Oahu. The buyers -- Jason Brand, president in Tokyo of Merrill Lynch Pacific Rim, and his wife, Malindi Fickle, an actress and movie producer -- are among a number of United States expatriates living in Asia and buying homes in Hawaii, said Mary Worrall, who represented the seller in the transaction. 
 ''HAWAII is very appealing to buyers like these because it is seen as a safe destination with fresh air and water and very little pollution,'' said Ms. Worrall, president of Mary Worrall Associates Sotheby's International Realty. 
 Demand from such buyers also has spurred a wave of reinvestment and high-end speculative redevelopment, Mr. Eovino said.
 A Japanese buyer recently paid $11.25 million, Oahu's second largest transaction this year, to buy one of Mr. Eovino's newly built homes on Kahala Avenue, a prestigious Honolulu address. And in January, Mr. Eovino sold property near Diamond Head for $11.1 million -- Oahu's third largest transaction of 2007. 
 ''There are other markets that are strong, but Hawaii has an advantage because it's more attractive than other destinations,'' said Mr. Atherton of NAI Global. ''After you go on a holiday to Cambodia, you aren't thinking about retiring there. However, it's just the opposite in Hawaii.''

HEADLINE: The Staggering Cost of a Long War

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In deploring our continued involvement in Iraq, Bob Herbert wrote in his Dec. 4 column, ''Now and Forever'': ''A country that can't find the money to provide health coverage for its children, or rebuild the city of New Orleans, or to create a first-class public school system, is flushing whole generations worth of cash into the bottomless pit of a failed and endless war.'' 
 Those are words to keep in mind as we choose a new president and Congress next year. The Bush administration's arrogance and disastrous misjudgment have highlighted the longstanding need for a change in our national priorities. 
 We should hope that our next president believes that the chief role of government is not to project military power abroad but to safeguard our liberties at home and provide the services for its citizens that make for a strong and healthy society. Rachelle Marshall

 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert wrote about the tremendous cost of the Iraq war that people are not talking about enough. Most of the Republican candidates and others keep saying that the surge is working, and therefore the war will be won. 
 But the truth of the matter is that even if American troops are able to hold down the violence, and who knows how long they will have to stay there to keep the violence down, the close to 4,000 American troops killed will not be brought back to life, the close to 30,000 troops seriously injured will not be made whole again, and the trillion dollars or more this will end up costing will not be returned. 
 This war is lost, and was lost a long time ago, because of the tremendous cost to America. The threat was nonexistent, and the payoff is not worth all of our precious resources.

 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert asks: ''Seriously. How long do we want this madness to last?'' 
 My answer: No longer! What I can't understand is why Congress -- and I'm throwing the blame to my fellow Democrats, too -- can't say no to the White House. Do not vote for any more budget bills that finance this futile, illegal and immoral war. Stop it now! 
 Doesn't the fact that President Bush has gotten every nickel he's asked for make you as sick as it does me? Who out there can even fathom a trillion dollars wasted? Wouldn't you rather rejoice that we had a trillion to spend on health care and education? To think that we could have! Sherrie Matza

 To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert bemoans the incredible waste of our resources in the Iraq war and endorses Senator Charles E. Schumer's advice to get our troops out of the country as early as possible. This echoes the opinion of many. It was a terrible mistake to begin the war, but we cannot just cut and run now that the damage is done.
 In an act that can be described as wanton madness, the United States made an unprovoked attack on the sovereign country of Iraq. In the war that followed, much of Iraq's infrastructure was destroyed and its government was eliminated. The country, without a functioning army, police force and government is vulnerable to internal violence and attack from foreign countries for the foreseeable future. 
 It is shameful to suggest that we can now withdraw our troops from the country, leaving the population to cope with the destruction we have wrought.
 John H. Sweeney
 Arlington, Mass., Dec. 4, 2007
 To the Editor: 
 What are the dimensions and duration of the United States' involvement in Iraq as contemplated -- and planned for -- by the Bush administration? An answer is at hand, though it has been largely overlooked by members of Congress and the news media.
 The State Department is currently overseeing the construction of the largest United States embassy in the world, by far. It occupies 104 acres, is 10 times the size of the second largest, in Beijing, is designed to be completely self-contained and to cost $1 billion a year to maintain. Its construction budget was originally $600 million, but the latest estimates place its cost at $1 billion. 
 Such a project is a clear indication that the United States' involvement in Iraq will be extended and extensive.

 To the Editor:
 In his column about the staggering costs of the war in Iraq, Bob Herbert writes that ''youngsters who were just starting high school when the U.S. invaded Iraq are in college now.'' I wonder if the war would be continuing in its current way if those children had been eligible for the draft. Michael Gibbons

HEADLINE: Senate Backs Freeze on Tax Without Cost Offsets

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Trying to find a way out of a sticky tax problem, the Senate on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to prevent the alternative minimum tax from hitting millions of middle-class Americans without replacing the $50 billion that would be lost.
 The move represented a bitter retreat for Senate Democrats who, in taking over Congress this year, pledged to pay for new tax cuts or programs rather than add to the federal deficit. But with Republicans refusing to go along, most Democrats joined them in endorsing a temporary fix of the alternative minimum tax without corresponding offsets rather than be held responsible for a surprise tax burden falling on 19 million taxpayers. 
 ''This is not my first choice on how to do so,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, before the Senate voted 88 to 5 for his proposal. ''This is my best choice on how to do so.'' 
 The Senate action does not necessarily resolve the dispute over the tax, which is threatening to complicate tax-filing season by requiring last-minute changes to Internal Revenue Service computers and tax forms. The House has approved differing legislation that would offset the fix on the alternative tax by closing tax loopholes on hedge funds, equity funds and other financial partnerships. 
 And some House Democrats, including Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, say they will not support any resolution of the tax problem that conflicts with their ''pay-go'' budget rules. 
 But Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, who is the majority leader, said Thursday night that it was his understanding the House would join in the Senate approach.
 Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, who is the chairman of the Budget Committee, opposed the Senate plan, saying that while it was proper to limit the reach of the tax, it was wrong to do so without replacing the money. ''It ought to be paid for,'' Mr. Conrad said. ''The revenue ought to be replaced by spending cuts or other revenue.''
 Republicans, who say Democrats should have addressed the alternative tax issue months ago, have repeatedly objected to efforts to compensate for changing the tax provisions. They argue that since the tax was not intended to produce such high levels of revenue when it was created, the money should not have to be replaced.
 ''They are all phantom funds,'' said Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the senior Republican on the Budget Committee, referring to the revenue that would be generated by the tax.
 Earlier Thursday, Republicans banded together to prevent the Senate from considering the House bill. That led to the later vote, in the Senate, on freezing the alternative minimum tax, which sent that proposal back to the House. 
 The alternative minimum tax was created almost 40 years ago to prevent affluent Americans with numerous deductions from escaping income taxes. But since it was not tied to inflation, it is reaching more and more people. 
 Experts say the tax cuts approved in the early days of the Bush administration have also pushed more people under the tax. The Treasury Department estimates that without a change in law, a total of 23 million people would have to pay the alternative tax on their 2006 taxes, at an average of about $2,000 each. The tax could reach some Americans earning $50,000 or even less.
 Mr. Reid said that he supported the ''pay-go'' concept embraced by Democrats but that he was left with few options because of the Republican ability to block any alternative minimum tax relief that complied with such budget rules. 
 ''We've tried every alternative possible to do this,'' Mr. Reid said. ''I believe in pay-go. I think that's where we should be.''

 Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.
 FRED ANDERSON AND WILLIAM PARKER (Tonight) Mr. Anderson is a tenor saxophonist rightly lionized in his hometown, Chicago; Mr. Parker is a bassist at the heart of the New York free-improv scene. The two musicians have worked together on many occasions, but with scarce documentation; ''Blue Winter'' (Eremite), a 2005 album with the drummer Hamid Drake, is their emblematic release. With any luck, the dialogue here should be incisive, imaginative and rich with soul. At 10:30, the Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; $15. (Nate Chinen)
 THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday) With its latest album, ''Prog'' (Do the Math/Heads Up), this trio ventures further along its audacious and disarming trajectory. The bassist Reid Anderson, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the drummer David King sound as boldly committed as ever, and their collision of masscult allusions and highbrow inventions still has the power to overwhelm. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $46. (Chinen) 
 CHRIS BOTTI (Monday through Thursday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a mass audience, as has his standard-laden repertory. He tends to get a shade more abstract in performance with his first-rate working band, which includes the guitarist Mark Whitfield, the pianist Peter Martin and the drummer Billy Kilson. (Through Dec. 25.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote .net; cover, $60 at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
 CARLO DE ROSA QUARTET (Sunday) The sharp and well-traveled bassist Carlo De Rosa showcases original material in this ensemble with the tenor saxophonist Mark Shim, the keyboardist Art Hirahara and the drummer Justin Brown. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, (718) 857-4816, brooklynlyceum.com; $12 cover; $10 in advance. (Chinen)
 ELI DEGIBRI (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Degibri is a tenor saxophonist with a bittersweet tone and an effortlessly modern approach. On Wednesday he plays in a trio with Gary Versace on organ and Jeff Ballard on drums; on Thursday he leads a band that includes the guitarist Mike Moreno and the drummer Johnathan Blake. Wednesday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Louis 649, 649 East Ninth Street, at Avenue C, East Village, (212) 673-1190, louis649.com; no cover.

At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

 SONNY FORTUNE QUARTET (Tonight and tomorrow night) A saxophonist with a robust sound and a restless style, Sonny Fortune leads his working band, with Michael Cochrane on piano, Chip Jackson on bass and Steve Johns on drums. At 8, 10 and midnight, Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $25, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen) 
 JIM HALL TRIO (Tuesday through Thursday) Jim Hall's economical style and deep harmonic command have made him a quiet hero of jazz guitar. He leads his working trio, with the bassist Steve LaSpina and the drummer Terry Clarke. (Through Dec. 16.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
 ROY HAYNES QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes has a career-spanning new box set, ''A Life in Time: The Roy Haynes Story'' (Dreyfus), that convincingly burnishes his living-legend stature. Still, it's no substitute for the experience of watching him propel this working band, in a fast and furious present tense. (Through Dec. 15.) At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $50 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

 VIJAY IYER (Tomorrow) A pianist given to restive energies and rhythmic conundrums, Mr. Iyer works here in two strong settings: Raw Materials, a longstanding duo with the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa (at 8 p.m.); and his responsively supple trio, with Stephan Crump on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums (at 10 p.m.). The Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)
 CHRIS LIGHTCAP'S BIGMOUTH (Tonight and tomorrow night) Chris Lightcap, a bassist equally at home in straightforward and subversive settings, teams up with the saxophonists Tony Malaby and Andrew D'Angelo; the pianist Craig Taborn; and the drummers Ted Poor (tonight) and Gerald Cleaver (tomorrow). At 9 and 10:30, Cornelia Street Cafe, 29 Cornelia Street, West Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; cover, $10, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)

At 9 and 10:30, Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, near Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)

 (Chinen)
 MICROSCOPIC SEPTET (Thursday) Last year the complete output of this high-spirited outfit was reissued by Cuneiform, thwarting any notion that jazz in the 1980s was strictly a conservative affair. Here -- on the heels of a European tour, and on the eve of a studio session -- the group plays previously unreleased tunes by its diabolical resident composers, the pianist Joel Forrester and the soprano saxophonist Phillip Johnston. At 8 and 10 p.m., Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $15, with $10a minimum. (Chinen)
 MONK IN MOTION (Monday) Ambrose Akinmusire, a fiercely gifted young trumpeter from Oakland, Calif., took first prize in this year's Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition.

 JASON MORAN (Tonight) As a pianist, Mr. Moran often weighs delicate lyricism against jagged polyphony; his solo recitals can be both discursive and intensely focused. Here he plays one set unaccompanied, and then tests the waters with two upstanding new acquaintances, the guitarist Mary Halvorson and the cornetist Ron Miles. At 8 and 10, the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)
 ANGELICA SANCHEZ QUINTET (Wednesday and Thursday) As a pianist and a composer, Angelica Sanchez seeks out the lyrical heartbeat within each turbulent storm.

 DAVID SANCHEZ GROUP (Tuesday through Thursday) David Sanchez is a tenor and soprano saxophonist equally conversant in the rigors of post-bop and the nuances of Latin folk music, notably from his native Puerto Rico. He has lately used guitarists in his band, to good effect; here he features Lionel Loueke, who brings a wealth of his own cultural influences to the table. (Through Dec. 16.) At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; cover, $25. (Chinen)
 RANDY SANDKE AND DICK HYMAN (Wednesday) The jazz tradition is a renewable resource for Mr. Sandke, a trumpeter, and Mr. Hyman, a pianist. Their duo interplay, best documented on a 2005 album called ''Now and Again'' (Arbors), leaves no avenues unexplored. At 8 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing near the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-2083, bargemusic.org; $35; $20 for students, . (Chinen)
 JENNY SCHEINMAN (Tuesday) Ms. Scheinman is the rare jazz violinist who embraces her instrument's folksier side without making concessions to genre. Her weekly gig involves a rotating cast of players; in this installment she has the guitarist Steve Cardenas and the drummer Rudy Royston. At 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen) 
 TENOR BATTLE (Tonight and tomorrow night) If the concept of a tenor battle sounds old-fashioned, so much the better: Grant Stewart and Harry Allen, the chosen combatants, are mutual connoisseurs of a throwback style. At 10 and 11:30, Smalls, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 675-7369, smallsjazzclub.com; cover, $20. (Chinen)
 YOSVANY TERRY GROUP (Tonight and tomorrow night) Yosvany Terry, a saxophonist and percussionist, chases post-bop ideals without abandoning the pull of his native Cuba. Presenting new work under the auspices of the Jazz Gallery's Composers' Series, he leads a band with Yunior Terry, his brother, on bass; Osmany Paredes on piano; and Jeff (Tain) Watts on drums. At 9 and 10:30, Jazz Gallery, 290 Hudson Street, at Spring Street, South Village, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; cover, $15; $10 for members.

 DOUG WAMBLE TRIO (Monday) Doug Wamble specializes in a rustic Southern sound, from the bluesy cry of his vocals to the quavering twang of his acoustic guitar. He teams up here with the blue-chip rhythm team of Ben Allison on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. At 7 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)
 BOBBY WATSON AND HORIZON (Tuesday through Thursday) The alto saxophonist Bobby Watson formed his first version of Horizon in the 1980s, ironing a sharp new crease into the legacy of Jazz Messengers-inspired hard bop. This iteration of the group has Terell Stafford on trumpet, Edward Simon on piano, Essiet Essiet on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. (Through Dec. 16.) At 7:30 (sold out) and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy's Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; cover, $30, with a minimum of $10 at tables, $5 at the bar. 
 (Chinen) 
 JOHN ZORN'S CELEBRATION OF LIGHT (Tonight and tomorrow night) John Zorn has worked with a handful of ensembles under the aegis of his klezmer-inspired Masada project; Bar Kokhba, a sextet, is the most refined of the bunch. Mr. Zorn conducts that ensemble here, leaning on the generous talents of the violinist Mark Feldman, the cellist Erik Friedlander, the guitarist Marc Ribot, the bassist Greg Cohen and the percussionists Cyro Baptista and Joey Baron.

The new work, ''Calculus and Politics,'' involves three women, three men, six stuffed swans and a skipping rope. But that's not all. On opening night Philip Glass will perform his own music for ''Dreaming Awake'' and the older solo ''Provenance Unknown.''

 YVONNE MEIER (Thursday) This Swiss-born choreographer has a devoted following, and rightly so. It's not everyone who can put men in ape suits and deer statues onstage and carry it off, as she did in last year's ''this is not a pink pony.'' A new work, ''Area 51,'' promises similar excitements: ''Circus meets thriller,'' the promotional materials say. ''Bizarre circumstances lead dancers into all kinds of predicaments.'' Ms. Meier will have the answers. (Through Dec. 15.) At 8:30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194; $15. (Sulcas)

HEADLINE: Not Just a Summer Romance

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
SUE AND JOE CANALE'S new beach house in Ocean City, N.J., handsomely sided in gray shingles and just steps from the Boardwalk, rises four floors above sea level. The view, they say, is always changing. Sometimes, whitecaps churn. Sometimes, the ocean is a fuzzy pink blanket. Sometimes, lightning flashes above the sea and reflects on the water.
 For nearly 20 years, the Canales, a couple from Huntingdon Valley, Pa., a Philadelphia suburb, owned another beach house on the property. About two years ago, they decided to tear it down and build another place. They wanted a house they could live in virtually all year. Mrs. Canale loves to entertain. Mr. Canale loves to ride his bike on the Boardwalk.
 ''We're from the boomer generation, and our theory with this place is to use it and enjoy it,'' said Mrs. Canale, a real-estate broker and appraiser. 
 The Canales have company in Ocean City -- and lots more than in the past. Second-home owners in this tidy family resort, 10 miles south of the Atlantic City casinos, are using their homes deeper into the fall, often through Thanksgiving and Christmas and sometimes well into the winter. A beach house is not just a place to catch a tan anymore. 
 ''It used to be that people closed them up in September -- closed them up and didn't come back until the next year,'' said Ann Richardson, an agent for ReMax in Ocean City. ''The idea of winter at the shore was just not that popular. People would say to me, 'You live here?' They couldn't imagine there was life here after Labor Day.''
 Now, heated condominiums and beach homes, like the Canales', are being built. Ms. Richardson said second-home owners in town, many from Philadelphia and its suburbs, have discovered that Ocean City also has access to the Internet, so it is possible to knock out some work while also enjoying a long weekend.
 What is happening in Ocean City is a reflection of what is happening in other second-home destinations, homeowners and real estate agents say. Discouraged by the rising cost (not to mention the hassle) of a winter jaunt to a warm island or a chilly ski slope, second-home owners are returning more often to their own getaways. And they find that they are getting more relaxation for their money.
 ''Instead of flying, or driving further afield, they can get to us for a tank of gas,'' said Suzannah Levett Zody, a real estate agent in Nashville, Ind., a small town of shops and galleries about an hour south of Indianapolis. ''They're spending two, three, four nights a week here. Why have a vacation home or a second home and fly off for two weeks to Hawaii? They can make more use of a place here, because it's at their fingertips.''
 Ms. Zody, a Nashville native who is also president of the Brown County Chamber of Commerce, remembers when most of the stores and restaurants in town closed in January and February, after foliage season. But in recent years, most stores stay open.
 That is also true in Ocean City. On a sunny Sunday last month, even though the temperature failed to hit 60 degrees, the Boardwalk near the Ocean City Music Pier was crowded. At midafternoon, there were no booths available at the Ninth Street location of the venerable Mack & Manco pizzeria.
 That location of Mack & Manco has been open year round for many years, but Mrs. Canale has noticed that several other local businesses have extended their hours, or are open on days when they used to be closed. Included are a taco joint, a bakery and Brown's Restaurant, a favorite of the Canale family for its hot doughnuts.
 At one time, you were lucky if the only thing in town that was open was the Wawa,'' Mrs. Canale said, referring to the chain convenience stores.
 There is also more to do in these second-home havens when the weather gets colder. About 300 miles northwest of Ocean City is Wellsboro, Pa., a community in the Appalachians that was, and still is, a hub for deer hunters. Hunting cabins squat along the roadsides all around town. But more of them are insulated, and residents do more than hunt.
 ''When I was growing up here, deer camp lasted for one or two weeks, and it was a camp -- the places were very rustic,'' said Scott Wilcox, an agent for Century 21 Wilkinson-Dunn, on Main Street in Wellsboro. ''Before, they were really quite primitive. Now people are hiking, biking, fishing and kayaking besides deer hunting.
 ''Plus, they love Wellsboro. A guy will come here and put up a deer stand, and his wife will go in town to go shopping.''
 Because they know people will be coming, officials in some second-home communities are adding more activities to the calendar. The late-fall weekends in a resort town like Fenwick Island, Del., just north of the state line from Ocean City, Md., are filled with a Caribbean Christmas party, house tours, parades, pet shows and a chilly dip in the Atlantic.
 ''People will put off their vacations until fall, and rent out their places in the summer,'' said Jerean Adkins, an agent for Long & Foster Real Estate, which has offices on Fenwick Island. ''Especially with the economy the way it is, they'll go to the beach house instead of going to Europe or a major trip. It's a getaway that breaks up the winter.''
 In using their second homes more, some owners are using them differently. Specifically, they like to keep them to themselves. Several second-home owners said they bought their places with the general idea of renting them out for a little extra money, but soon scuttled that plan.
 ''YOU want to get your money's worth out of it, and in order to do that, you want to use it yourself as much as possible,'' said Marty Breinlinger, a full-time resident of Elmira, N.Y., who owns a cottage on Seneca Lake, near Hector, N.Y. ''I would love to go up there every single weekend, if I could.''
 The Canales were landlords for one year and quickly became tired of cleaning up after renters. Mrs. Canale said she once found sand in her refrigerator. ''Summer landlord is not in my vocabulary,'' she said.
 The Canales simply wanted to own their summer getaway 50 years ago, when her husband, who worked as a dispatcher instructor for Amtrak until he retired in 1987, built a house with his father in Somers Point, N.J., on the other side of Great Egg Harbor from Ocean City.
 Eventually, the Canales had the means to build a beach house on a lot at the quiet northern end of Ocean City. The house was contemporary, like many in the neighborhood, but it was not exactly warm and cozy when the weather got cold. In addition, Mrs. Canale loves to cook, and the house was not ideal for dinner parties.
 ''She's not happy unless there are 15, 20, 30 people here,'' said Jane French, a neighbor. (The Canales had 17 people at the house for Thanksgiving.)
 SO they built their new place -- a five-bedroom duplex with a great room on the third floor that has a sweeping view of the ocean. (They sold the other half to a family who rents their side out six or seven weeks a year.) It took 16 months to build, but the house has everything they want, including a spacious kitchen and hardwood floors. And it's ringed by wide wooden decks.
 (It was on one of those decks where the Canales' 23-year-old son, Joey, proposed to Daria Kane on Oct. 6. She said yes, and they plan to marry in September.)
 Family members want to use their home as much as possible because they have made so many friendships over the last 20 years with their neighbors, including Ms. French. The Canales have volunteered for many municipal activities -- the Night in Venice boat parade and the baby parade among them -- and belong to the Ocean City Married Couples Club.
 ''We have no redeeming social value,'' Mrs. Canale said, ''but we enjoy each other's company.''
 Joey Canale has discovered that the fishing is terrific into the end of December, and the nearby beach, virtually deserted after Labor Day, is perfect for surf-casting. ''It's quiet and it's peaceful,'' he said, ''and I don't have to travel that much to get here.''
 He and Ms. Kane might go away this winter, but to hear him talk, everything they could want is at the beach house. They plan to celebrate New Year's Eve there, perhaps on the top-floor deck, watching fireworks after a cookout with friends. The deeper into the year they stay, the harder they find it is to leave.
 As his mother said, ''There's never a time you don't want to see the beach.''

 Full reviews of recent jazz concerts: nytimes.com/music.
 FRED ANDERSON AND WILLIAM PARKER (Friday) Mr. Anderson is a tenor saxophonist rightly lionized in his hometown, Chicago; Mr. Parker is a bassist at the heart of the New York free-improv scene. The two musicians have worked together on many occasions, but with scarce documentation; ''Blue Winter'' (Eremite), a 2005 album with the drummer Hamid Drake, is their emblematic release. With any luck, the dialogue here should be incisive, imaginative and rich with soul. At 10:30 p.m., the Living Theater, 21 Clinton Street, near Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 696-6681, visionfestival.org; $15. (Nate Chinen)
 THE BAD PLUS (Wednesday) With its latest album, ''Prog'' (Do the Math/Heads Up), this trio ventures further along its audacious and disarming trajectory. The bassist Reid Anderson, the pianist Ethan Iverson and the drummer David King sound as boldly committed as ever, and their collision of masscult allusions and highbrow inventions still has the power to overwhelm. At 8:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $46. (Chinen) 
 ANDY BISKIN (Thursday) Mr. Biskin, a clarinetist with a playful approach to repertory, features his own music in a quartet with the trumpeter Ron Horton, the bassist John Hebert and the vibraphonist Matt Moran. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)
 CHRIS BOTTI (Monday through Thursday) Mr. Botti's brooding trumpet style has won him a mass audience, as has his standard-laden repertory. He tends to get a shade more abstract in performance with his first-rate working band, which includes the guitarist Mark Whitfield, the pianist Peter Martin and the drummer Billy Kilson. (Through Dec. 25.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote .net; cover, $60 at tables, $40 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)
 KATIE BULL (Thursday) On her recent self-release, ''The Story, So Far,'' the singer Katie Bull engages confidently with musicians like the saxophonist Jeff Lederer, the pianist Frank Kimbrough and the drummer Harvey Sorgen, who join her here. At 6 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, near Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; no cover. (Chinen) 
 CARLO DE ROSA QUARTET (Sunday) The sharp and well-traveled bassist Carlo De Rosa showcases original material in this ensemble with the tenor saxophonist Mark Shim, the keyboardist Art Hirahara and the drummer Justin Brown. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Brooklyn Lyceum, 227 Fourth Avenue, at President Street, Park Slope, (718) 857-4816, brooklynlyceum.com; $12 cover; $10 in advance. (Chinen)

 LIBERTY ELLMAN'S AESTIVATION (Sunday) Liberty Ellman, an introspective guitarist and composer, leads a coolly adventurous ensemble, with Steve Lehman on alto saxophone, Jose Davila on tuba, Stephan Crump on bass and Gerald Cleaver on drums. At 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)
 WAYNE ESCOFFERY AND VENERATION (Friday and Saturday night) Wayne Escoffery, a charismatic tenor saxophonist, leads a capable post-bop crew consisting of the trumpeter Ryan Kisor, the vibraphonist Joe Locke, the bassist Joe Martin and the drummer Ali Jackson.

 ROY HAYNES QUARTET (Tuesday through Thursday) The redoubtable drummer Roy Haynes has a career-spanning new box set, ''A Life in Time: The Roy Haynes Story'' (Dreyfus), that convincingly burnishes his living-legend stature. Still, it's no substitute for the experience of watching him propel this working band, in a fast and furious present tense. (Through Dec. 15.) At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $50 and $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

 FRANK LOCRASTO GROUP (Friday) A young pianist-composer of modernity and promise, Frank LoCrasto rounds up some sharp compatriots: the saxophonist Logan Richardson, the guitarist Mike Moreno, the bassist Bob Hart and the drummer Tommy Crane. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Tea Lounge, 837 Union Street, near Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 789-2762, tealoungeny.com; suggested donation, $5. (Chinen)

 MICROSCOPIC SEPTET (Thursday) Last year the complete output of this high-spirited outfit was reissued by Cuneiform, thwarting any notion that jazz in the 1980s was strictly a conservative affair.

HEADLINE: Holding the Hungry Hostage

 BODY:
It is a travesty that the fates of some 35 million Americans who need food aid are tied to the farm bill, which comes up every five years. The House passed an inadequate version last summer, and the Senate has failed to advance its own. It is time to ask why feeding the hungry must include a trough for multibillion-dollar agribusiness. 
 As it has pressed to keep its subsidies, about $26 billion in the current bill, agribusiness has contributed $415 million to federal political campaigns since 1990, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The hungry don't have much of a lobby. But those who cannot consistently put food on the table need the help promised in the bill, including more than $4 billion in improvements in the food stamp program and for emergency assistance. If the aid remains in the farm bill, and if it remains in a logjam, aid would continue at current, inadequate levels.
 Food stamps regularly help 26 million people get something to eat. But the previous farm bill did not peg benefits to inflation, so as food prices have skyrocketed, families who were just barely getting by are now in a much worse place. Some 800,000 food stamp recipients -- disproportionately elderly or disabled -- are being told to make due on a minimum benefit of $10 per month. That amount has remained unchanged in 30 years.
 As The Times recently reported, food banks and soup kitchens across the nation are being depleted by demand so overwhelming that the needy are being turned away, or given help so minimal, it is hardly worth the energy expended to get it. 
 Washington needs to do better. The Senate could start by rallying around the sensible legislation sponsored by Senators Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana. It would replace crop supports with an insurance program to cover actual losses, and put the savings, potentially billions of dollars, to better use, including for food aid.
 Or the Congress could make a bold statement and begin to restructure funding. It could get money to food banks faster if it came out of any bill but the farm bill. 
 The Bush administration has correctly opposed the excesses of the farm subsidies program, but it could do more. It could finance additional and immediate food assistance by dipping deeper into money culled from customs receipts to support farm and nutrition programs. 
 Since their beginnings, hunger relief and nutrition programs have been inextricably tied to helping farmers. That may have made sense once. But as recent maneuvers on the farm bill have shown, it no longer works.
 Republicans -- by far the biggest beneficiaries of agribusiness largess -- are using the advantage of being a bare minority to try to attach a flurry of amendments on immigration, taxes and any other issue but the desperate one at hand. Farm state senators look the other way so a bill, warts and all, can get done.
 They need to put America's hungry first.

HEADLINE: Port Authority and Airlines Offer Plans to Ease Delays

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Trying to head off threats by the federal government to reduce flights at the three New York-area airports, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, along with airline industry executives and local transportation officials, unveiled 100 recommendations yesterday that are intended to unlock congestion and accommodate more traffic. 
 A task force created by the Port Authority said in a report that if 27 of its recommendations are put into effect quickly, airport delays, which are setting records, could be reduced by next summer and that if all of them are adopted, an additional 3.5 million passengers a year could pass through Kennedy International Airport without causing more delays. 
 The proposals were squarely aimed at keeping up with rising traffic at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports, which have had the worst on-time performances nationwide. They were also designed to deflect threats by federal transportation officials to reinstate flight limits at Kennedy if the airlines and the Port Authority, which runs the three airports, do not reduce delays. 
 ''I take them at their word,'' Anthony E. Shorris, the executive director of the Port Authority, said of the federal government's willingness to carry out its warning. ''Our concern is that they are willing to reduce the number of people going through New York's airports rather than deal with the people who want to come here.''
 Notably, the report does not call on the airlines to reduce the number of flights or fly larger planes instead of smaller regional jets, whose proliferation has been blamed in part for the sharp increase in delays.
 The report calls on the airlines to rework their schedules to avoid bottlenecks and urges the Port Authority and the airlines to improve communications with passengers about flight delays and get them off planes stuck on tarmacs.
 Most of the measures involve modifying air routes and runways to allow more planes to take off and land, procedures that are controlled mainly by the Federal Aviation Administration. Many steps have already been developed or are under review, and some would require more air traffic controllers. Others would entail actions -- like using three runways simultaneously instead of two at Kennedy -- that controllers have in some cases deemed unsafe.
 The Port Authority hopes that these nonbinding proposals, which were compiled by a task force that included a top F.A.A. official, are supported by the Transportation Secretary, Mary E. Peters, who is expected to give President Bush a list of suggestions in two weeks on how to reduce aerial gridlock in the New York area. 
 Since the aviation agency is already trying to put about half of the recommendations into effect and a representative from the agency was on the panel, known formally as the Flight Delay Task Force, at least some of the measures stand a good chance of being adopted. The real question, airline industry experts say, is how quickly the F.A.A. acts and whether those actions can keep up with demand for more takeoffs and landings.
 ''It takes a considerable amount of time to get things done in Washington,'' said Cass Howell, chairman of the aeronautical science department at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, in Daytona Beach, Fla. ''They have some very good people at the F.A.A., but the reality is with a bureaucracy as big as it is, and a strong controllers' union, and issues they have to comply with, they are not as efficient as they should be.''
 The airlines and the Port Authority have opposed federal transportation officials' proposals to limit flights during peak hours on the grounds that doing so would create more delays and harm New York's economy. According to participants on a committee that advises the Department of Transportation in Washington, the Bush administration has backed away from the idea of charging more for landing and taking off during peak hours and now favors auctioning off landing slots to the highest bidder, which the cash-poor airlines oppose.
 According to a federal official involved with the advisory committee, the Transportation Department dropped the idea of higher peak-hour charges because the Port Authority was adamantly opposed to them, and the department could not figure out how to levy the charges over the Port Authority's opposition. 
 The task force was formed last summer to grapple with delays created in January, when the federal government removed limits on the number of planes that could operate at Kennedy in peak hours. After the caps were removed, airlines quickly added flights, creating record delays not only at Kennedy, but also and at airports where flights from New York were headed.
 According to the report, airports in the New York area are responsible for 75 percent of the nation's flight delays, which will increase if New York's congestion is not addressed. According to a study made public by the F.A.A. in May and cited in the task force report, air travel in the region is expected to grow by 50 percent by 2025. Last year, 104 million passengers passed through the three major airports.
 The task force recommendations include many measures that can only be put into effect and, in some cases, must be paid for, by the federal government. For instance, the panel called for improved flight routes -- not unlike high-occupancy vehicle lanes on highways -- on busy corridors between New York and cities like Washington, as well as a program that would allow planes to fly around inclement weather.
 Yet other suggestions included introducing the latest navigation technology, which is already being used by air traffic controllers at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, to Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark airports, which together make up the busiest airspace in the nation. 
 The controllers were annoyed because they were not allowed to join the task force, which included hotel and tourism executives. As Phil Barbarello, the vice president for the northeast region of the National Air Traffic Controllers, said, ''They have a leaky pipe and call in an electrician.'' Several of the proposals, like extending and reconfiguring taxiways to speed the arrival and departure of planes on neighboring runways, would require additional financing.
 And the task force recommended that the staffing level in the tower at Kennedy be reviewed to see if additional controllers were needed. But Mr. Barbarello said he already knows the answer. ''They don't need to test that, they already did,'' he said. ''Two years ago, when we had the staffing, we didn't have the delays.''

HEADLINE: 105 Dead After Explosion In Chinese Mining Region

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Friday, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
A gas explosion at a coal mine in northern China late Wednesday killed at least 105 people in one of the country's worst mining accidents this year, the official Xinhua news agency said Friday. 
 The explosion occurred in the city of Linfen, about 240 miles south of Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, in a huge coal-producing region. The official media reports said at least 15 other miners had been rescued or had escaped on their own. It was unclear how many people had been working in the mine at the time of the accident.
 Many of the rescued miners were hospitalized after the explosion, which took place at a mine operated by the Ruizhiyuan Mining Company. 
 Xinhua reported that the blast occurred at 11:15 p.m. Wednesday, but that the local authorities were not told until 5 a.m. Thursday. The death toll climbed during the day and reached 105 Friday after 26 bodies were recovered overnight.
 The government said two mine officials, including the head of the mine, were being held by the police. Xinhua also reported that the accident may have been caused by illegal activity in an unauthorized area of the mine. 
 Coal mining accidents are a common occurrence in China, where on average more than 5,000 miners lose their lives every year, the worst accident rate in the world. Nearly every week, there are news reports of mining blasts, deaths, rescue efforts and teams of miners trapped in horrific circumstances. By comparison, there are typically about 30 mining deaths a year in the United States. 
 Last year, though, China reported that about 4,700 miners were killed in accidents. It was the first time in 30 years that there were fewer than 4,800 mining deaths. Most of the accidents here, though, involve small, private and illegal coal mines. The government has tried to crack down on illegal mines in recent years, but soaring coal prices and widespread corruption in the coal industry have encouraged small-mine operators to secretly enter the business. 
 In August, about 170 miners died in eastern Shandong Province after heavy rains flooded several coal mines. 
 A Chinese official announced Thursday that the country's coal production could reach 2.5 billion tons by 2010, up from about 2.2 billion tons in 2005. 
 China's demand for coal is soaring to power the country's fast-growing economy. China produces twice as much coal as the United States, the world's second-largest producer.

 'IMPERMANENT COLLECTION' Going to look at art in a museum usually produces immediate impressions: ''I hate it,'' ''I love it,'' ''I don't get it.'' Then we move on -- apparently the average time spent looking at a work of art is five seconds. Watching a performance, on the other hand, demands that we accept a slower accrual of thoughts and feelings during an event; we know -- in fact, we hope -- that our first and last impressions could be very different. 
 In ''Impermanent Collection,'' to be performed tonight and next Friday as part of the Whitney Museum of American Art's Whitney Live series, the Moving Theater directors Brennan Gerard and Ryan Kelly use five dancers, the new-music group International Contemporary Ensemble and a series of videos by Brock Labrenz to blur the boundaries between those experiences: permanence and impermanence, art object and live performance, the historical and the contemporary. 
 That's a tall order, but Mr. Gerard, who comes from a theatrical background, and Mr. Kelly, a former New York City Ballet dancer, are in the business of blurring boundaries with Moving Theater, an interdisciplinary collaborative that has produced a number of provocative, poetic pieces since the two men founded the company in 2002. 
 In ''Impermanent Collection,'' Mr. Labrenz's video portraits of the dancers responding to an artwork of their choice intersect with the dancers performing amid the audience in the Whitney's Lower Gallery, and with the music. These tensions -- between the captured moments on film (ultimately as fixed an art object as the surrounding paintings) and the transient intimacy of live performance; between the personal interpretations of the art and the public setting -- are just some of the facets of Moving Theater's inquiry. 
 And just as important, Mr. Labrenz said, the piece offers the museumgoer a more intimate acquaintance with the Whitney. ''It begs them,'' he said, ''to go upstairs and look at those paintings again.'' (Friday and next Friday at 7 p.m., Whitney Museum of American Art, 212-570-3600, movingtheater.org; free with pay-what-you-wish museum admission, starting at 6.) ROSLYN SULCAS

HEADLINE: Europe Holds Key Rate Steady, but Britain Opts for a Cut

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank, caught between fears of rising inflation and subsiding economic growth, walked a middle ground on Thursday, leaving interest rates unchanged.
 But across the channel, the Bank of England opted to take action, cutting its benchmark rate for the first time in two years, by a quarter-point, to 5.5 percent. The bank said the credit squeeze in the United States had curtailed loans for households and businesses, denting Britain's growth prospects.
 The different decisions underscore the murky atmosphere as Europe grapples with the fallout from the American mortgage crisis as well as rising prices for oil, food and other necessities. 
 ''These are not normal times,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''The global economy has taken a shock, and you have to decide, 'Does it matter or does it not matter?'''
 The European Central Bank, in deciding to leave its benchmark rate at 4 percent, signaled it was more troubled, for the moment, by rising prices. Inflation rose to 3 percent in November -- a full percentage point above the threshold preferred by the central bank's monetary policy.
 The bank predicts inflation will stay above 2 percent for most of 2008 and warns that it could be amplified by so-called second-round effects, like demands by unions for hefty wage increases.
 ''We will not tolerate second-round effects,'' the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said at a news conference in Frankfurt, implying that the bank would raise rates if it saw such activity.
 In a rare departure from his usual discretion about the bank's deliberations, Mr. Trichet disclosed that some bankers on the 19-member governing council had argued for raising rates.
 The bank's hawkish tone pushed up the euro modestly against the dollar, though the strength of the European currency did not even come up at the news conference, suggesting that, at least temporarily, it has been displaced by worries about the price of bread and milk.
 High prices for food and fuel have also nudged inflation in Britain above the 2 percent target set by the Bank of England. But that bank's monetary policy committee said the threat of inflation was overshadowed by the damping effects of continued turmoil in the credit markets.
 In Britain, 1.4 million homeowners are set to refinance their mortgages in the next year or so, Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, said in a note. Cutting interest rates will provide them with ''some much needed relief,'' he wrote.
 While the European Central Bank emphasized inflation, it is not discounting the potential effects of the credit tightening on Europe. The bank trimmed its forecast for European growth next year to 2 percent, from 2.3 percent, despite what it characterized as a ''resilient'' global economy.
 Mr. Trichet said that in Europe, there was little evidence that the turbulence had cut off loans to households or businesses. 
 The bank has injected hundreds of billions of euros into the financial system over the last few months to prevent subprime-related jitters from paralyzing money markets. But Mr. Trichet drew a distinction between these technical operations and its broader monetary policy.
 Mr. Mayer of Deutsche Bank, who favors cutting rates, said he worried that the bank could be storing up trouble for later. ''You can't separate the problems in the banking sector from the underlying economy,'' he said. 
 Other economists said the bank was right to stay its hand, in the absence of fresh numbers showing a slowdown. ''The recent flow of economic data was a lot stronger than people expected,'' said Elga Bartsch, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley in London. ''It all went against the notion of cutting rates.''

HEADLINE: Some Airlines to Offer In-Flight Internet Service

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Passengers may soon hear a new in-flight announcement: ''You can now log on.''
 Starting next week and over the next few months, several American airlines will test Internet service on their planes. 
 On Tuesday, JetBlue Airways will begin offering a free e-mail and instant messaging service on one aircraft, while American Airlines, Virgin America and Alaska Airlines plan to offer a broader Web experience in the coming months, probably priced at about $10 a flight.
 ''I think 2008 is the year when we will finally start to see in-flight Internet access become available, but I suspect the rollout domestically will take place in a very measured way,'' said Henry Harteveldt, an analyst with Forrester Research. But ''in a few years time, if you get on a flight that doesn't have Internet access, it will be like walking into a hotel room that doesn't have TV.''
 The airlines' goal is to turn their planes into the equivalent of a wireless hot spot once the aircraft reaches its cruising altitude. It will not be available on takeoff and landing. 
 Virgin America even plans to link the technology to its seat-back entertainment system, enabling passengers who are not traveling with laptops or smartphones to send messages on a flight. The network can also potentially be used for communications within the plane, like food and drink orders -- something Virgin America already does with its seat-back system.
 While the technology could allow travelers to make phone calls over the Internet, most carriers say they have no plans to allow voice communications. Many travelers find the prospect of phone calls much less palatable than having a seatmate quietly browsing e-mail. 
 Onboard phone calls are ''one of those 'just because you can doesn't mean you should' types of technologies,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''The last thing you want is to be in a crowded tube at 35,000 feet for two or three hours with some guy going on and on about his trip to Vegas.''
 While companies have been promising airborne Internet service for years -- the aircraft manufacturer Boeing offered a system that was adopted by a few international carriers but is now defunct -- JetBlue will be the first carrier in the United States to offer access to the Web, at least in a limited way.
 But if a test flight on Wednesday is any indication of the challenges airlines and their technology partners face in trying to offer Internet connections at 35,000 feet and 500 miles an hour, travelers can initially expect an experience reminiscent of the days of dial-up access -- slower and more prone to glitches than on the ground.
 ''Sometimes you just have to put things out there and see what happens when people try to use it,'' said Nate Quigley, chief executive of LiveTV, a JetBlue subsidiary responsible for the airline's Internet service as well as its in-flight entertainment system. ''We'll find the bugs and eventually get them worked out.'' 
 After years of false starts, LiveTV is one of several companies aiming to introduce in-flight Internet access in 2008. LiveTV's air-to-ground cellular system, however, functions only over the continental United States. It also involves a hand-off process between cell sites as the plane travels across the country.
 Since LiveTV's proprietary network uses a spectrum licensed from the Federal Communications Commission that was once reserved for seat-back phones, it does not interfere with cellphone service on the ground. But the hand-off process does create the potential for the airborne equivalent of a dropped call -- a problem that occurred during the test on Wednesday.
 It is also one of the reasons JetBlue is not charging passengers to log on.
 ''Why charge for something that doesn't work very well yet?'' said David Neeleman, JetBlue's founder and chairman, a self-described BlackBerry addict.
 JetBlue and LiveTV are betting that their messaging capability is more important to travelers than surfing the Web, which requires more bandwidth and therefore a fee.
 But other companies are convinced that plenty of travelers will pay for more robust Web access and are considering fees of around $10 a flight. .
 That view is bolstered by a recent survey by Forrester Research that found that 26 percent of leisure travelers would pay $10 for Internet access on a two-to-four-hour flight and 45 percent would pay that amount for a flight longer than four hours.
 ''I think that the airlines will see that the demand is there,'' Mr. Harteveldt said, adding that besides sharing the revenue from these fees, airlines could potentially earn money from advertising on these services or use the cabin's Wi-Fi network to enhance their operations.
 ''The airlines can justify the cost if only for their own operational efficiencies,'' said Jack Blumenstein, president and chief executive of Aircell, which is developing its own air to ground cellular network.
 Aircell has already arranged partnerships with American Airlines and Virgin America and plans to install its equipment on an American 767-200 aircraft later this month.
 The airlines would not predict a date it would become available, but Mr. Blumenstein estimated that it was likely to ready to go by early spring next year.
 A third company competing to offer airborne Internet service is Row 44, which is developing a satellite-based system that will also function over oceans and internationally, though the plan is to offer service in North America first, said John Guidon, Row 44's chief executive. 
 So far, Row 44 has signed a deal with Alaska Airlines, and Mr. Guidon hopes to have the equipment installed on an aircraft -- either with Alaska or another partner -- by the second quarter of 2008. That schedule essentially fits Alaska's plan.
 ''We're going to test the system on a single aircraft in the spring, and based on the outcome of that trial our plan is to equip our entire fleet by the end of 2009,'' said Amanda Tobin Bielawski, an Alaska Airlines spokeswoman.
 One potential pitfall, from a regulatory and technical standpoint, is that the connectivity would make it possible to make voice-over-Internet phone calls using services like Skype. American and Alaska will not allow phones calls with their services, but Charles Ogilvie, director of inflight entertainment and partnerships for Virgin America, said, ''We're definitely not automatically ruling anything out.''
 That may send chills down the spines of frequent travelers, many of whom are strongly opposed to the prospect of dozens of chatty passengers in a confined space, which was one of the reasons the F.C.C. decided against lifting the ban on cellphone calls in planes.
 ''I absolutely would not be in favor of voice,'' said Jeff Haber, a real estate lawyer in Los Angeles who added that he would like Internet access in the air, even if he had to pay for it. ''One of the things that's nice about airplanes is that people aren't on cellphones all the time.''

HEADLINE: House Sets Higher Goal for Vehicle Fuel Efficiency

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Brushing aside a veto threat from the White House, the House passed a package of energy measures on Thursday that includes a 40 percent increase in fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks sold in the United States. 
 The bill's supporters say it will reduce the nation's dependence on imported oil, jump-start development of clean-energy technologies and sharply reduce the nation's production of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. 
 But the complex and costly bill is all but certain to be radically rewritten when it reaches the Senate because of opposition there to two provisions: $21 billion in new taxes, mostly on the oil industry, and a mandate that electric utilities must generate 15 percent of their power from alternative sources, like wind or solar. The White House threatened to veto the bill if the final version contains those or several other provisions passed by the House. 
 The House vote was 235 to 181, with 14 Republicans voting for it and 7 Democrats voting against.
 Environmental groups, consumer advocates and alternative-energy companies hailed House passage of the bill, but a broad array of opponents, including cattlemen, coal producers and multinational oil companies, are lining up to block it.
 The centerpiece of the bill is a requirement that passenger vehicles sold in the United States achieve a fleet average of 35 miles per gallon by 2020, the first significant increase in mileage standards since 1975. The provision was a result of a deal brokered by Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who has long protected the domestic automakers' interests in Washington.
 Mr. Dingell gave his reluctant support for the package in a floor statement before the vote, criticizing the process by which the compromise was reached and suggesting he would not be unhappy to see the Senate remove major parts of the overall bill.
 ''This bill is not the ultimate answer to our dependence on imported oil, to high energy prices or to climate change,'' said Mr. Dingell. ''But it is a major and important step toward those goals, and, for that reason, I will be voting for it.''
 The White House issued a statement immediately after the vote expressing its objections.
 ''Unfortunately, Democratic leaders in the House today pushed a partisan bill, that members had very little opportunity to study before the vote, which they knew was unacceptable to the president and had no chance being signed into law,'' the statement said. ''Their proposal would raise taxes and increase energy prices for Americans. That is a misguided approach and if it made it to the president's desk, he would veto it.''
 The bill envisions a sevenfold increase in production of ethanol and other biofuels, from about 5 billion gallons a year today to 36 billion gallons by 2022. It provides incentives for production of diesel fuel mixed with renewable liquids including soy oil and animal fat; cellulosic ethanol made from sugar cane and switch grass and advanced fuels formulated from municipal garbage, wood chips and agricultural waste.
 The largest source of these alternative fuels remains corn, and food producers argue that diversion of corn to fuel production is driving up feed prices for cattle, pigs and poultry. They oppose the bill because it raises their production costs and, ultimately, the price of food on the table.
 ''The ethanol number is definitely too high. It burns more feed and food than we would like,'' said Jesse Sevcik, vice president for legislative affairs at the American Meat Institute. ''The hog diet is 80 percent corn, and when corn prices double, those producers' input costs go up pretty substantially.''
 The oil industry hopes to eliminate a provision that rescinds more than $13 billion in tax breaks granted in 2004 and 2005, when Congress was in Republican hands. Democratic supporters of the bill said the oil companies could easily afford the new taxes because they were earning record profits on oil selling for more than $90 a barrel. But the oil companies said the money would come from revenue needed to develop new sources of oil and would lead to higher prices at the gasoline pump.
 The bill contains hefty incentives for a variety of new energy sources and efficiency measures, like wind turbines, solar arrays, plug-in hybrid cars and more fuel-efficient buildings and appliances.
 The Senate is expected to take up the bill as early as this weekend, with prospects for the renewable electricity standard and the oil industry tax package highly uncertain. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said the Senate could pass an energy bill without those two ''millstones.''
 Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, declined to predict passage, with or without the renewable energy or tax provisions.
 ''We're going to try very hard,'' he said Thursday afternoon.

HEADLINE: Under a Microscope, Bush and His Presidency

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
THE FALL OF THE HOUSE OF BUSH 
 The Untold Story of How a Band of True Believers Seized the Executive Branch, Started the Iraq War, and Still Imperils America's Future 
 By Craig Unger 
 437 pages. Scribner. $27. 
 The story of how the Bush administration took the United States to war in Iraq is such a complicated tale with so many plots and subplots, so much misinformation and spin, so many missteps and outrageous misjudgments that reporters in countless newspaper and magazine articles, television documentaries and dozens of books have struggled to piece together the narrative. It is a continuing process, as more and more information comes to light and needs to be sifted and weighed and connected. 
 While Bob Woodward gave us, in a series of three books, a broad account of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, week by week, month by month (based largely on the testimony of administration insiders and other firsthand sources), investigative reporters like Seymour M. Hersh, Jane Mayer, Dana Priest, James Risen and Eric Lichtblau have shed a fierce light on hidden aspects of the administration's war on terror, including its misuse of intelligence, its embrace of aggressive interrogation methods and its covert surveillance programs at home. Legal experts like Charlie Savage, Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. and Aziz Z. Huq have explicated the Bush White House's efforts to expand the power of the executive branch, while military reporters like Thomas E. Ricks have chronicled the administration's disastrous mismanagement of the war in Iraq.
 In his new book, ''The Fall of the House of Bush,'' the reporter Craig Unger (the author of the 2004 book ''House of Bush, House of Saud'') attempts to turn an all-encompassing, wide-angle lens on the Bush presidency, looking at the rise of George W. Bush and his support from the religious right; his relationship with his father, George H. W. Bush, and its impact on foreign policy; the alliance between Israeli hard-liners and Christian Zionists, and the neoconservatives' push for the war against Iraq; the administration's use of flawed intelligence before the invasion; and Vice President Dick Cheney's efforts to expand executive power. The resulting book is a sprawling hodgepodge of the persuasive and the speculative, the well researched and the hastily assembled, the original and the highly derivative. 
 Among the assertions that Mr. Unger makes in this book are that Mr. Cheney initially wanted Paul D. Wolfowitz (who as deputy defense secretary became one of the chief architects of the war against Iraq) to be made head of the C.I.A., a plan that was supposedly derailed because of Mr. Wolfowitz's marital indiscretions, which would later play a role in his downfall at the World Bank. Mr. Unger also suggests that Mr. Bush did not become a born-again Christian after talking with the Rev. Billy Graham at the Bush compound in the summer of 1985, as the president recounted in his autobiography, but that he'd already been born again, more than a year earlier in Texas, thanks to an evangelical preacher named Arthur Blessit. Mr. Blessit, says Mr. Unger, once ran a ''Jesus coffeehouse'' on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood, where he preached to ''bikers, druggies, hippies, and two Mafia hit men.''
 When Mr. Unger sticks to the facts (often facts initially unearthed by other reporters) and focuses less on the personal lives of his subjects and more on policy making in the Bush administration, his narrative skills enable him to do a fluent job of putting the available jigsaw puzzle pieces together. He gives readers a powerful account of the long-standing campaign by neoconservatives (which long predated the terrorist attacks of 9/11) to topple Saddam Hussein, the ideological roots of the administration's ideas about pre-emption and unilateral action, and the efforts of hawks in the Pentagon and the vice president's office to bypass regular policymaking channels and use cherry-picked intelligence to push for war. This part of Mr. Unger's narrative remains heavily indebted to ground-breaking books like Mr. Hersh's ''Chain of Command'' (2004), James Bamford's ''Pretext for War'' (2004) and George Packer's ''Assassins' Gate'' (2005), just as those portions of Mr. Unger's book related to the administration's selling of the war owe a heavy debt to Frank Rich's ''Greatest Story Ever Sold'' (2006).
 One of the things that's new in this volume is the level of detail that Mr. Unger brings to his account of how Colin L. Powell was maneuvered into making the administration's case for war with his February 2003 speech at the United Nations, an account that clearly leans heavily on the author's interviews with Lawrence Wilkerson, Mr. Powell's former chief of staff, who has become an increasingly outspoken critic of the Bush administration. 
 Mr. Unger quotes Mr. Wilkerson saying that in trying to vet material for the United Nations speech, Mr. Powell kept having to throw out discredited allegations (made by the vice president's office) that the 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta had met with an Iraqi intelligence agent. 
 ''They were just relentless,'' Mr. Wilkerson says of the vice president's staff. ''You would take it out and they would stick it back in. That was their favorite bureaucratic technique -- ruthless relentlessness.'' According to Mr. Wilkerson, Mr. Cheney's office continued the night before and the morning of the speech to insist that Mr. Powell tie Saddam Hussein to 9/11. 
 Other assertions made in this book are more poorly sourced. For instance Mr. Unger not only writes that at least nine intelligence officials believe that forged documents, which described efforts by Iraq to buy uranium ore from Niger for a nuclear weapons program, were ''part of a covert operation to deliberately mislead the American public and start a war with Iraq,'' but he also goes on to insinuate -- without any sort of smoking gun -- that Michael Ledeen, a neoconservative analyst with ties to both Italian intelligence and high-ranking Bush administration officials, might have played a key role in that operation.
 In his eagerness to connect all the dots, Mr. Unger resorts at times to innuendo and speculation and hyperbolic language. For example he draws heavily upon the reporting from Peter and Rochelle Schweizer's 2004 book ''The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty'' to underscore the Oedipal tensions between the current President Bush and his father. But while he nimbly explicates the differences in their approach to foreign policy -- the senior Bush and his national security adviser Brent Scowcroft belong firmly to the realist school, while the younger Mr. Bush chose a decidedly more messianic approach -- he takes the fact that the current president has allied himself with some figures (like former Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld) who were rivals of his father to come to the melodramatic conclusion that Mr. Bush the younger ''with the help of so many of his father's nemeses'' had ''destroyed his father's legacy'' piece by piece. 
 Mr. Unger titles one of the chapters in this book ''Ripe for the Plucking,'' suggesting that the ambitious but inexperienced George W. Bush was ''precisely the right kind of cipher to embrace a vision of American exceptionalism shared by both the evangelicals and the neocons,'' and that in making an alliance with these groups, he ''put together a team that was his father's worst nightmare, a team whose utopian dreams challenged the very policies at the heart of his father's legacy.'' He also asserts that neoconservatives like Mr. Wolfowitz and Richard Perle began tutoring Mr. Bush in foreign policy, semisecretly, in late 1998 and early 1999, laying the philosophical groundwork for the Iraq war before the 2000 presidential campaign was well under way.
 It's unfortunate that Mr. Unger occasionally hypes his material and extrapolates from the documented facts in this book, as these tactics distract attention from -- sometimes even undermine -- his more carefully researched findings. And in the case of the Bush administration and its determination to go to war in Iraq the plain, unadorned facts are startling -- and disturbing -- enough.

HEADLINE: Lack of Donated Copters Harms Darfur Effort, U.N. Leader Says

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said Thursday that the refusal of countries to donate helicopters for the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping force in Darfur was endangering the scheduled start of operations three weeks from now.
 ''Without the mobility and transportation, it will be extremely difficult for us to deploy our forces,'' Mr. Ban told reporters outside the Security Council chamber. ''And even if they are deployed, without effective additional mobility capacity, we will not be able to protect the civilians and even our own soldiers.''
 ''We need on-the-ground capability, specifically helicopters,'' Mr. Ban said. ''We're not getting them. Because of that, the entire mission is at risk.'' 
 He spoke after he sent a letter to the Council that appealed for help in securing 24 helicopters. Without them, he wrote, the force ''will lack critical mobility and resupply capacity, which would fundamentally jeopardize its ability to carry out its mission.''
 Mr. Ban said that he had raised the issue with senior leaders of industrialized and major developing nations at every stop on his recent trips through South America and Europe and that he had cornered heads of government at the Middle East conference last week in Maryland. ''I have not been able to get even one single helicopter commitment,'' he said.
 Asked what reasons countries had given for resisting his pleas, Mr. Ban said: ''I think it is a matter of political will. I know that, and I appreciate the circumstances where many countries, potential contributing countries, are overstretched in their critical assets.''
 The 26,000-member peacekeeping force is charged with enforcing an end to the convulsive four-year-old clash between government forces and government-equipped militias on one side and a number of rebel groups on the other. The fighting has left at least 200,000 civilians dead and chased 2.5 million villagers from their homes.
 The start-up of the force has been called into question by the resistance of the Sudanese government to the inclusion of non-African military specialists in the predominantly African force and by the government's unwillingness to turn over land needed for supplying and housing the troops and to ease travel and visa restrictions to allow for night flights.
 ''Without that permission to operate the nighttime planes,'' Mr. Ban said, ''we may not be able to operate, particularly in cases of emergency.'' He said he was dispatching his deputy chief of staff, Kim Won-soo, and Edmond Mulet, assistant secretary general for peacekeeping, to Lisbon to press the United Nations' case with Sudan's president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who is attending a European Union-African Union summit there.
 Earlier Thursday, the under secretary general for humanitarian affairs, John Holmes, told the Council that 280,000 people had been forced to flee the violence in Darfur this year, that attacks on aid workers and their convoys had reached ''unprecedented levels'' and that national authorities were closing off access to areas ''where there are tens of thousands of civilians in severe need.''
 In Geneva, a report being prepared for the Human Rights Council said that from June 20 to mid-November, at least 15 land and air attacks were carried out against civilian centers in Darfur by government troops and their affiliated militias and by one faction of the rebel Sudanese Liberation Army. These attacks had killed 170 people, the report said.

HEADLINE: Turnabout on Fuel Standards

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; John M. Broder contributed reporting from Washington, and Nick Bunkley contributed from Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Just six months ago, an auto industry trade group warned that consumers could be forced to buy vehicles they did not want if Congress went too far in raising fuel economy standards.
 But this week, after a deal on proposed legislation to raise fuel economy by 40 percent to 35 miles per gallon by 2020, the companies in the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers declared the higher standards would be ''good for both customers and energy security.''
 The reversal was more than a simple matter of the carmakers accepting the inevitable. Despite the all-for-one, one-for-all sound of the alliance's new stand, the industry has in fact been divided in its response to growing calls to produce more efficient vehicles.
 Nissan and Honda, for example, bought in early to the idea of higher fuel economy. They did not join the alliance, which includes Detroit, German and other Japanese car companies, which fought bigger increases until it was clear they would lose. 
 In return for its early support, Nissan preserved a unique exemption that makes it easier to meet current fuel-economy standards. 
 ''We're not whiners,'' Dominique Thormann, a senior vice president at Nissan North America, said in Washington during a lunch with reporters on Wednesday, in a thinly veiled jab at competitors that originally fought fuel economy increases.
 ''We never went into this with the intention of challenging what the objective was,'' Mr. Thormann said. ''Tell us where we need to get to. We'll get our engineers cranking.''
 Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, did not share his view.
 ''This is not a bill I, or the members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, would have written if we had been permitted to follow regular order,'' said Mr. Dingell, the committee's chairman. 
 He was referring to tough negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi before Thursday, when the House easily passed energy legislation, which contained the fuel economy increase, by a vote of 235-181. The measure now goes back to the Senate, which passed a similar bill in June.
 Mr. Dingell, who has been an advocate of his state's main industry for three decades, told the auto companies months ago that an increase was politically unstoppable. He said he could support the bill for several reasons, including provisions that would ''help American factories retool to build the cars and trucks of the future.''
 His efforts for a more modest increase were overwhelmed by the determination of Ms. Pelosi and other members of Congress, who believed they had the public's support for higher fuel standards, to make carmakers contribute to efforts to fight climate change.
 The months-long process has created some awkward moments for Detroit companies and their allies.
 Last May, before the Senate action, the auto alliance ran newspaper and radio ads urging passage of a smaller fuel economy increase. Automakers currently must attain 27.5 m.p.g. for cars and 22.2 m.p.g. for light trucks, including minivans, sport utilities and pickups for their corporate average fuel economy, known as CAFE.
 ''Extreme, unrealistic CAFE increases could force manufacturers into offering vehicles for sale that do not match up with consumer demand for versatility, performance, affordability, and passenger and cargo space,'' David McCurdy, the group's president, said in a statement on May 14. 
 ''If higher standards make vehicles less attractive to consumers, vehicle sales will drop, negatively impacting auto dealers, suppliers, automakers, and the U.S. economy.''
 But last Friday night, after Mr. Dingell and Ms. Pelosi reached a deal on a fuel economy measure in the House, the alliance's statement said, ''We believe this tough, national fuel economy bill will be good for both consumers and energy security. We support its passage.''
 Despite this suggestion of blanket support, Detroit-friendly lawmakers were still maneuvering to secure protections in the bill for the hometown business.
 One provision in the House bill, backed by Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, and supported by the United Automobile Workers union, provides federal loan guarantees to help auto companies that invest in factories that are at least 20 years old to build vehicles with advanced technology. 
 That would specifically aid General Motors, which plans to build a new plug-in hybrid, the Chevrolet Volt, at a Detroit factory that opened in the early 1980s, making it eligible for the government-backed loan program.
 Even before that provision was added, G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, said last Friday night that his automaker was ''prepared to put forth its best effort to meet'' the higher fuel standards.
 Lobbying against the higher standards also risked undermining the efforts of the auto companies to convince consumers that their fleets are already fuel-efficient, and that they have more-efficient vehicles coming. 
 G.M., for example, has been promoting the 23 vehicles in its lineup that achieve 30 m.p.g. or more. For G.M., in particular, the Volt and other fuel-efficient cars can be its ticket back to dominating the American industry, said Daniel Becker, a former official with the Sierra Club who is now an environmental consultant.
 ''They can do it. They've got the best engineers in the world,'' Mr. Becker said. ''This is auto mechanics, not rocket science. They should be able to take advantage of this bill to become the major force in the industry that they used to be.''
 David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said, ''You're going to see people trying to kill each other over how green they can be.''
 G.M.'s environmental effort, in part, is a response to Toyota, which has been selling its hybrid-electric Prius in the United States since 2000. Toyota, however, did not emerge from the fuel-economy debate unscathed. 
 Its participation in the alliance made it the target of criticism from environmental groups that had previously praised its efforts to build cleaner vehicles. Even before Toyota's stand on the legislation, the groups were angry about the introduction of its big Tundra pickup. 
 Indeed, Toyota officials said this week that the company felt that it was taking heat for the entire industry. Toyota's involvement, however, helped it avoid protectionist pressure it might have felt when it passed Ford this year to become the No. 2 carmaker in the United States, behind G.M. Indeed, Toyota's Japanese imports have risen in 2007, largely because of the Prius, which is built only in Japan.
 On Monday, Toyota's top American official, James Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said it was time for Congress to pass a higher fuel economy standard.
 ''Automakers -- and the country -- need the certainty of one national plan to guide the considerable additional investments necessary to move forward,'' Mr. Lentz said in a statement.
 He added: ''Without a united industry willing to take on a major fuel economy challenge for the good of the nation, this agreement may never have come to pass.''

HEADLINE: U.S. to Pressure China on Food and Product Safety at Coming Trade Talks

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
When Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. started his ''strategic economic dialogue'' with China a year ago, he was seeking greater access for American goods and services and hoping to persuade the Chinese to let the value of their currency rise against the dollar.
 In return, he promised China a forum to air grievances with Washington and suggested that the dialogue would help him persuade lawmakers not to impose trade sanctions. 
 In recent months, such lofty goals have been brought down to earth by food and product safety problems involving Chinese imports. Now, as Mr. Paulson prepares for the third round of the semiannual dialogue which begins here next week, the safety of imported goods is a priority, trumping broader economic concerns. 
 ''What we need to do with China is deal with the most important issues of concern to Americans,'' Mr. Paulson said in an interview as he prepared to travel to China with other cabinet members. ''Right now product and food safety is at the No. 1 issue.''
 Many people in the Bush administration acknowledge that the dialogue has produced limited results. With numerous safety disputes lingering, American officials are negotiating accords they hope can be signed next week aimed at improving the atmosphere with new understandings. 
 The discussions have not been easy. As concern about the safety of Chinese products rose, American negotiators said that the Chinese raised concerns of their own and began imposing new safety restrictions on imported food and other products, possibly in retaliation. 
 ''When we raise a food safety issue, they claim they have food safety issues with us,'' said a Bush administration trade official, speaking anonymously as is customary when negotiations are under way. ''They try to raise an equivalent number of issues, but their concerns are not as concrete as ours.'' 
 For example, last summer China proposed extensive new inspections for American medical equipment, like patient monitors and surgical implants, but did not impose the same treatment for similar domestic products. The Bush administration cried foul and hopes to get the proposal revised next week.
 In addition, American officials say that the Chinese have imposed ''extreme requirements'' for inspection of American beef for mad cow disease, poultry for possible salmonella traces and pork for chemical additives. The acting agriculture secretary, Charles F. Connor, is trying to negotiate a more flexible regime.
 Michael O. Leavitt, secretary of health and human services and head of an administration review of American product safety standards, said in a speech this week that the agreements would cover food, animal feed, medical devices and drugs to ensure that imports meet ''American standards'' of quality and safety.
 An ''action plan'' on import safety was started by President Bush last month, calling for greater efforts to prevent tainted goods from American trade partners, improved certification of imports and American training to help other countries build safety inspection capabilities. 
 But department spokesmen say that details for putting these goals in place with the Chinese have not been worked out. It is not clear, for instance, what sort of onsite inspections or training the Chinese might permit or whether China is prepared to ease its safety standards on imports from the United States.
 Many people in Washington, especially in Congress, view the latest talks as a test for Mr. Paulson. 
 Since the dialogue began, disagreements with China have actually multiplied. The Commerce Department and the United States trade representative's office have taken China to court at the World Trade Organization, charging it with a failure to enforce laws against piracy and counterfeiting of goods and trademarks.
 Last month, the Chinese settled a separate dispute before the World Trade Organization and agreed to terminate a dozen kinds of subsidies and tax rebates that the United States had charged were unfairly promoting Chinese exports and discouraging imports.
 Two sets of talks occur next week. Mr. Paulson is to lead the dialogue with several cabinet members, including the commerce secretary, Carlos T. Gutierrez, and the top American trade envoy, Susan C. Schwab. But before their session, aides to Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Schwab are to discuss specific ''market access'' issues.
 Officials said these include objections to proposed standards and requirements that would restrict access for American cellphones and telecommunications services and the expansion of operations of express delivery services like FedEx and DHL.
 China is irritated that in many of these areas, the United States has threatened or imposed duties or taken China to court at the World Trade Organization. But Mr. Gutierrez and Ms. Schwab say their approach of litigating disputes and negotiating them at the same time has produced results.
 Mr. Paulson said the meetings next week would also be a test for Chinese leaders installed last fall. He noted that China was also under increasing pressure from Europeans to let its currency, the yuan, appreciate, to modify trade imbalances.
 On the issue of overhauling China's capital markets to remove curbs on foreign investors and joint ventures, he said ''there's been progress with almost every sector of the financial services industry, but it's been incremental progress.''
 ''I frankly can't conceive of anything that would be a better substitute for having two major global economies having a forum where we can make progress on the most important economic issues,'' Mr. Paulson said.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Aid, Within Limits

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
At least one thing is clear about President Bush's plan to help people trapped by the mortgage meltdown: it is an industry-led plan, not a government bailout. 
 Although Mr. Bush unveiled the plan at the White House on Thursday, its terms were set by the mortgage industry and Wall Street firms. The effort is voluntary and it leaves plenty of wiggle room for lenders. Moreover, it would affect only a small number of subprime borrowers.
 The plan was the target of criticism from consumer advocates who said its scope was too narrow, and from investment firms, who said it went too far. Others warned that the plan, by letting some stretched homeowners off the hook, could encourage more reckless borrowing in the future. 
 ''The approach announced today is not a silver bullet,'' said Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who hammered out the agreement. ''We face a difficult problem for which there is no perfect solution.'' 
 The heart of Mr. Bush's plan is a cautious attempt to help troubled homeowners by persuading financiers to freeze mortgages at low introductory rates for five years, but without actually forcing the hands of lenders and investors who hold the mortgages. 
 One of the financial industry's lead negotiators estimated that at most 20 percent of subprime borrowers whose payments will increase sharply over the next 18 months -- 360,000 out of 1.8 million people -- would qualify for rapid consideration of a special five-year freeze on interest rates.
 The number of people who actually obtain help would be smaller, because each borrower would face tests aimed at weeding out those considered too hopelessly in debt and those who make too much money to justify relief.
 In one curious twist, the plan could eliminate many who have good credit scores or managed to improve their credit scores, because the good ratings would be a sign they do not need help. 
 ''Talk about moral hazard,'' remarked Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''We've all told people, don't go any more deeply into debt. Now we're saying that people who go more deeply into debt will have an advantage over people who don't go more deeply into debt.''
 The administration's theory is that there is a ''sweet spot'' in the market where it makes more financial sense for lenders to offer some relief than it does to foreclose on homeowners.
 Most analysts agree there is a sweet spot of some sort. Investors typically lose 40 percent or 50 percent on homes that go into foreclosure, and the cost of shielding borrowers from a big jump in rates can be much less.
 ''I think there is a sweet spot,'' said Bert Ely, a banking consultant in Alexandria, Va. ''But I worry that the sweet spot is much smaller than people think it is. And as housing prices continue to decline and debts pile up, I fear the sweet spot will shrink.''
 Administration officials estimate about 500,000 subprime borrowers are in danger of losing homes in the next 18 months as their low teaser rates expire and their monthly payments jump by 30 percent or more. Outside analysts warn the number of foreclosures could be much higher.
 The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that the number of new foreclosure proceedings hit a record in the third quarter and that the delinquency rate on mortgages climbed to the highest level since 1986. The biggest problem, according to the survey, was in subprime loans, which are typically made at higher interest rates to people with shaky credit records or weak incomes. 
 But Mr. Paulson and the president's other top economic advisers have remained staunchly opposed to anything that resembled a government-financed bailout for people who took out foolish mortgages or investors who bought the mortgages.
 As a result, administration officials have walked a narrow line. They have held meetings bringing together mortgage-servicing companies and groups representing investors holding mortgages. 
 Instead of pressuring the industry to come up with specific relief, Mr. Paulson pushed the players to come up with a streamlined approach for deciding when to modify loan terms.
 But Tom Deutsch, deputy director of the American Securitization Forum, which represented investment funds in the negotiations, made it clear that any rate freeze would be strictly voluntary and based on what investors decided was in their self-interest.
 ''This is not a government bailout program,'' Mr. Deutsch said. ''This is an industry-led framework for providing the best market standards and practices. There is no mandate here.''
 President Bush and other top administration officials emphasized that the plan could help as many as 1.2 million subprime borrowers -- about two-thirds of all people with subprime loans.
 But that estimate covers hundreds of thousands of borrowers who are believed to qualify without any extra help for cheaper conventional mortgages, like those insured by the Federal Housing Administration.
 Nonprofit housing groups that try to help troubled homeowners renegotiate mortgages were underwhelmed by Mr. Bush's plan.
 The Greenlining Institute, a housing advocacy group in California that began raising alarms about subprime loans nearly four years ago, estimated that only 12 percent of all subprime borrowers and only 5 percent of minority homeowners would benefit from the rate freeze. The Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit group that supports homeownership, said the freeze would help only about 145,000 people.
 ''This grossly inadequate plan is likely to harm the president's desire to close the minority homeownership gap and create an ownership society,'' said Robert Gnaizda, general counsel for the Greenlining Institute. 
 Some Wall Street analysts were equally unenthusiastic. ''This plan only really amounts to a set of recommendations for lenders that is sure to meet some resistance from investors'' in the mortgage-backed securities, wrote Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.
 Indeed, there were rumblings of rebellion among some institutional investors. ''Why would anybody in his right financial mind agree to a five-year price freeze, especially when we're staring in the face of possible inflation?'' asked Roger W. Kirby, managing partner at Kirby McInerney, which has represented investors in class-action lawsuits over securities. ''Mr. Paulson has overestimated the generosity of people on Wall Street.''

HEADLINE: Mayor's Big-Thinking Aide Leaves City Hall With Mixed Legacy

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL and CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Daniel L. Doctoroff was to have been the Robert Moses of the Bloomberg era, a bold visionary who would guide a sweeping revitalization of New York and put to rest the notion that the age of building big had ended. 
 But now, as Mr. Doctoroff ends his tenure as the longest-serving deputy mayor for economic development, much of his agenda remains unrealized, despite his many achievements. 
 Mr. Doctoroff, 49, announced yesterday that he would resign at the end of the year and become president of Bloomberg L.P. in February.
 There is no question that he brought a brash new imagination and relentless determination to City Hall, but those very qualities sometimes alienated, rather than motivated, the people who could help him achieve his goals. 
 The announcement, which again blurs the lines between Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's public and private spheres, could signal the twilight of an administration still bursting with grand visions but running out of time, raising questions about what Mr. Doctoroff's, and by extension Mr. Bloomberg's, final legacy will be.
 Mr. Bloomberg heaped praise on Mr. Doctoroff, saying he was responsible for 289 separate projects and initiatives, including the rezoning of 6,000 city blocks and the creation of thousands of acres of parkland and 130 million square feet of residential and commercial space. 
 ''As the chief architect of our five-borough economic development plan, Dan Doctoroff has done more to change the face of this city than anyone since Robert Moses,'' the mayor said.
 But just as Mr. Moses' legacy is still intensely debated, interviews with more than a dozen experts and analysts suggest that Mr. Doctoroff's effect on the city has been decidedly mixed. Some credited him with setting in motion comprehensive plans to guide growth in the city's neighborhoods for decades to come, while others said he had often failed to see his plans through.
 And he was the driving force behind two of the administration's most prominent disappointments: the failure to win political backing for the West Side stadium and congestion pricing.
 Michael Sorkin, director of the graduate urban design program at City College, said Mr. Doctoroff ''reinvigorated interest in large projects for the urban agenda.'' But his approach relied too heavily on private development as the catalyst for improvement, Mr. Sorkin said. ''We're asked to accept projects that are too big in exchange for some ancillary public benefit.''
 Mr. Bloomberg said he had not yet selected a successor, but people involved in the search, who would speak only on condition of anonymity, said that Shaun Donovan, the city's housing commissioner, was among the candidates, although some officials said the mayor was most likely to once again bring in someone from the private sector.
 Whoever is chosen, however, will still have Mr. Doctoroff looking over his or her shoulder. The deputy mayor plans to remain officially involved in seeing through some of the biggest projects started during his tenure, including the Hudson Yards, Queens West in Long Island City, Moynihan Station and PlaNYC, the environmentally friendly program to guide the city's development through 2030. 
 Ultimately, Mr. Doctoroff's impact may be measured more in the future than by the brick-and-mortar projects of today. 
 As the chief architect of the effort to bring the 2012 Olympics to New York, Mr. Doctoroff, a wildly successful private equity manager, strode into City Hall in January 2002 armed with the most ambitious blueprint for revitalizing the city in decades, even as workers still sifted through the wreckage at ground zero.
 In the months that followed, as he helped guide the city back from the brink of economic disaster, he became nearly as much the public face of the new administration as Mr. Bloomberg and among the most powerful of his senior aides.
 Chosen by the mayor as an outsider with a new vision for City Hall, Mr. Doctoroff brought a curly-haired, whiz-kid energy to the job and favored colorful PowerPoint presentations packed with history, statistics and renderings of what could be. He was often charming in public, but could be forceful and even threatening in private. He rode his bicycle from his Upper West Side home for 7 a.m. meetings and surrounded himself with a coterie of whip-smart young people, nicknamed the Kids, several of whom have gone on to important posts in the public and private sectors.
 ''He brought the private sector voice into City Hall, as opposed to government telling the private sector what to do,'' said Marc V. Shaw, who served as first deputy mayor during Mr. Bloomberg's first term.
 Mr. Doctoroff's impatience with bureaucracy and his disdain for what he regarded as the corrupt politics of Albany led him to attempt the unconventional, like using city money for the extension of the No. 7 subway line, rather than waiting for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to do it. 
 But that approach could also be his undoing, as was the case with the West Side stadium at the heart of the failed 2012 Olympic bid. Mr. Doctoroff gathered support from corporate executives, but underestimated the need to woo politicians and community groups. 
 ''The mayor didn't hire Dan to do politics, nor would Dan have been good at politics,'' Mr. Shaw said.
 The administration learned from the stadium debacle, Mr. Shaw said, and kept Mr. Doctoroff distant afterward from the political relationship-building on other issues, like congestion pricing.
 Despite the rejection of the stadium, Mr. Doctoroff was able to use the hammer of the Olympic deadlines to get a 50-block swath of the West Side rezoned for high-rise development, a feat Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration had only talked about. He also initiated the process now under way to sell the development rights over the 26-acre West Side railyards.
 But while Mr. Doctoroff worked tirelessly on the Far West Side, the city was virtually absent in 2004 and 2005 from the effort to rebuild ground zero. 
 Mr. Doctoroff appeared devastated by the Olympic defeat in 2005. But instead of leaving government at the end of Mr. Bloomberg's first term, as he had planned, he became reinvigorated, plunging into the morass at ground zero, where progress had stalled amid disagreements between the state and the developer. Although the city did not have a formal seat at the table, Mr. Doctoroff became a catalyst for a new overall development plan and for the resolution of the memorial project.
 But Mr. Doctoroff's sharpest critics contended that he was a masterful marketer whose execution never matched his vision, pointing to a failure to redevelop the Brooklyn waterfront from Cobble Hill to Red Hook and to devise a viable plan for Governors Island.
 Ron Shiffman, a former city planning commissioner, said that he had mixed emotions about Mr. Doctoroff. ''It was good to get someone in the city who was willing to spur new development and new ideas,'' he said. ''At the same time, some of those ideas and those developments were wrong-headed. He could run roughshod over community planning efforts. He refused to listen to anyone about alternative locations for the Olympic stadium, part of his stubbornness and hubris. But after it was defeated, a much better process ensued for development on the West Side.''
 As he recited Mr. Doctoroff's many contributions at the news conference yesterday, Mr. Bloomberg appeared choked up at one point.
 ''I think it's not uncommon as you get near the end, particularly when I'm term-limited out, you know, the administration's coming to an end, for people in the city to start thinking about what they're going to do afterwards,'' he said.
 In response to a question, he said: ''I don't think it starts the beginning of the end.''

HEADLINE: Another New York Attorney General Starts a Wall Street Crusade

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
IT'S beginning to feel a lot like Spitzer.
 Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general, has been handing out subpoenas to Wall Street in an effort to find out how banks bought subprime home loans and packaged them into complex securities. 
 His inquiry conjures up memories of Eliot Spitzer, who as New York's previous attorney general took on Wall Street after the technology stock boom went bust. Mr. Spitzer, now governor, began his crusade by looking into tainted stock research and ended up delving into the arcane world of reinsurance. His crusade even extended to a debate over who could gain access to the cancer records of Maurice R. Greenberg's dog. (Mr. Greenberg is the former chief executive of the insurance giant A.I.G.) 
 There are more than a few similarities between Mr. Spitzer's research raid and Mr. Cuomo's mortgage mission. Both focus on products -- tech stocks, in Mr. Spitzer's case, and mortgage securities, in Mr. Cuomo's -- that started out small and ended up everywhere. At the heart of both inquiries is what Wall Street knew, and what it really thought, about the securities it was peddling.
 But there is a critical difference between the credit mess of 2007 and the technology meltdown of 2000. When dot-coms like Pets.com bombed, the investing public could watch the stock prices plummet tick by tick on exchanges. That is not the case with the tricky mortgage-linked investments that have soured lately. These investments are not traded on an exchange. In fact, investors often have to go to the banks that sold them the securities to get prices. And those banks may or may not be sitting on large stockpiles of the same securities. 
 The banks' prices and reality often seem a world apart. According to data provided by Lehman Brothers, some subprime-linked investments known as collateralized debt obligations were trading at spreads of 70 basis points over the London interbank offered rate last March. By late July, that spread had widened to 240 points, reflecting growing concern about these investments. But traders trying to buy protection against a further widening of these spreads say that they paid 200 to 400 basis points over Libor last February -- and that the spread had widened to 1,500 points by August. (The insurance market does not always trade exactly in line with the cash market, but the differential should not have been as great as it was.) 
 It is not just complex mortgage-related securities that are opaque. Before the buyout boom withered, public companies worth billions of dollars shifted into private hands. It is anyone's guess what many of those companies are worth now. 
 Recent evidence suggests that some are worth a lot less than they used to be. On July 22, Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity fund, announced it would buy United Rentals for $34.50 a share. In November, when Reuters reported that Cerberus might back out, United Rentals stock dropped to $23.50 a share, roughly 31 percent below Cerberus's bid. Cerberus did not claim that a ''material adverse change'' in the company's business had prompted it to pull out of the deal. But one might deduce that Cerberus was responding to a material adverse change in the world -- namely, that credit to finance such transactions had dried up.
 If one believes the stock market accurately values companies, United Rentals was worth a lot less without Cerberus. Even adding back what might be a reasonable take-out premium, the stock was still down about 20 percent. 
 But don't expect private equity portfolios to be written down by 20 percent. 
 Private equity firms are currently battling with their auditors over what the companies in their portfolios are worth. Some auditors reasonably argue that when a company's debt is trading at 50 to 75 cents on the dollar, the equity must be impaired. Some private equity firms, however, are arguing that these businesses are fine -- it's just that the bond market is having a bad run. Investors will know more when the buyout firms send them their next investment reports. Next spring.
 Investors tend to like dark corners of the market because that is where opportunity often lies. Policy makers, regulators and the press like sunlight. Lately, opacity has been winning. The magnitude of the mortgage crisis that started last year and blew up in February did not really emerge until August. Even as the credit markets reeled, Wall Street chiefs seemed to have little idea of how much their banks' own portfolios had suffered. (Merrill Lynch, for example, initially said it would write down $5 billion in securities, then raised that figure to $8.4 billion). There have been 19,795 credit rating downgrades this year versus 2,539 for all of 2006, according to Securitization Monthly, a Deutsche Bank publication. That is a shocking amount of volatility for securities, some of which were perceived to be and pitched as safe. 
 Which brings us back to Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Spitzer had the good idea to pore over Wall Street's e-mail to find out what bankers and analysts really thought about the securities they were peddling. He discovered, among other things, that Henry Blodget, a Merrill Lynch technology analyst, privately denigrated at least one company he was publicly promoting.
 If he digs deep enough, Mr. Cuomo may find some e-mail messages, instant messages or maybe even phone text messages that mention the deteriorating quality of mortgages. He might even find some disparaging remarks about the eager, yield-hungry investors, sometimes known as ''dumb capital'' on Wall Street. And perhaps there will be some comments about the complexity of subprime-linked securities and the willingness of rating agencies to give these investments platinum ratings. 
 If that happens, it will be Mr. Cuomo, not Mr. Spitzer, who will be cast as the Scrooge of Wall Street. Bankers will say he is just another overly zealous prosecutor out to undermine America's capitalistic dynamism. By then, of course, Wall Street's next boom should be just getting under way.

HEADLINE: A-Rod's Properties and Charity Suggest Some Stinginess

BYLINE: By SELENA ROBERTS. 
E-mail: selenasports@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The veneer of Alex Rodriguez's real estate empire of working-class housing is staged to disguise his inner Mr. Potter.
 Past a psychic's storefront and coin laundry on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard in Tampa, Fla., a sign reading ''We Our Residents'' is planted beside manicured shrubs and an iron gate with a fresh coat at the entrance of Newport Riverside apartments.
 The paint is camouflage for the mottled backside of the complex, where an exhausted appliance sits on a porch, cardboard is taped over broken window panes and missing spindles give rickety banisters the look of a snaggletooth smile.
 Some residents here tell tales of roaches overtaking kitchen cabinets in a bumper-to-bumper crawl to the corn flakes, of carpets stained in the 1990s and quick-trigger evictions. 
 ''My mom comes here and she ain't no rich person, but she thinks I live in the projects,'' said Miguel Ruiz as he sat on the second-floor landing of Building 2-A on a recent Sunday afternoon. ''She's scared to come over here, for real.''
 As Ruiz spoke, he pulled a boy named Elijah from a gap in the railing that opened when yet another piece of the banister rattled loose and fell to the ground.
 ''See, stuff like that, with kids around, it's messed up here,'' Ruiz said, adding, ''Honestly, I was raised in a ghetto and I was brought up a little better than this.''
 This is one of six apartment complexes in the Tampa area, and one of at least 16 nationwide, that Rodriguez owns and operates as the chief executive of Newport Property Ventures.
 An examination of his high-rolling corporate side, as well as a glossy A-Rod Family Foundation short on largess, reveals a portrait of Rodriguez as a player about to enter Yankee Take II solely for business purposes, primarily as a branding tool. He emerges as an obsessive pursuer of cold, hard numbers on and off the bases, with serially disingenuous nods to his ever-challenged image.
 A-Rod isn't exactly a slumlord -- some renters interviewed at his other properties had milder complaints -- but he has become a landlord caricature among dwellers who hold him accountable for, say, the stack of molding mattresses by the dumpster at Newport Villas on MacDill Avenue.
 A-Rod is the face on their leaky faucets, and yet his name isn't in the welcome kit. Rodriguez's brother-in-law, Constantine Scurtis, is the company manager -- the one whose signature is on nearly $50 million in mortgages for properties in Tampa, according to records -- but some of the cashiers and cooks who live at places like Newport Riverside know who holds their house keys.
 To them, he isn't A-Rod, a regular-season crackerjack on the verge of a Yankees deal potentially worth $300 million. To them, he is Tight-Rod, an apartment tycoon, who, renters say, has jacked late fees to $100 from $50 on units that run around $600 a month. 
 ''He's got everything, so why take money off our backs?'' '' said Roberto Santiago, standing next to his neighbor, Ruiz. 
 Why, with so many investment options, would A-Rod put himself in the unwinnable position of profiting off struggling families?
 Messages left on the voice mails of Rodriguez and Scurtis at Newport Property Ventures' offices in Coral Gables, Fla., were unreturned. Repeated efforts to reach A-Rod through three layers of publicists -- think booby traps around a precious stone -- were unsuccessful. 
 A-Rod doesn't talk biz, the P.R. folks echoed.
 But Rodriguez's CNBC devotions illuminate his baseball motivations. The next 10 years aren't about team championships, but financial benchmarks linked to A-Rod's rate of slugging, with a Monopoly game payout for eclipsing history: pass Barry Bonds, collect $6 million.
 Money is A-Rod's identity, engraving his social standing, with Warren E. Buffett on his I.M. buddy list. As any Buffett-phile knows, philanthropy stats are valued, too. 
 But A-Rod is a star constantly locked in a contradiction of conscience as evidenced by his charity. The homey surface of the AROD Family Foundation's Web site, which promotes a slogan of helping ''families in distress,'' belies its cap on generosity.
 Rodriguez has earned nearly $200 million over the past decade, but, according to 990 tax records dating to 1998, he is a cheap tipper to his foundation.
 In eight years of available documents, donations averaged $30,000 a year and gifts distributed to the community averaged $13,000 a year. In 2002, A-Rod did not contribute more than $5,500. In 2006, the foundation did not give away more than $5,090 despite a fund-raiser that collected $368,000.
 He isn't on the platinum level of athlete donors. Tiger Woods has seeded his foundation with millions. And he isn't on par with his teammates. Derek Jeter may have his I.R.S. issues, but he has given a total of $2 million to his Turn 2 Foundation since 1998.
 Maybe A-Rod is simply generous in private. Publicly, he has written vanity checks for causes. In 2002, he contributed $3.9 million to a scholarship fund and baseball stadium renovations at the University of Miami, where the practice facility is named Alex Rodriguez Park. 
 The site is near a splendid oceanside estate in Coral Gables that property records show Rodriguez purchased for $12 million in 2004. The manse's value is down -- like everything with an address in South Florida. 
 An economic swoon may mean nothing to the A-Rod Empire -- or does it?
 Did A-Rod opt out as a Yankee only to realize he needed a bailout?
 It was a flipper's heyday when A-Rod plunged into real estate. In August 2004, he wrote the foreword for a book by Dolf de Roos called ''Real Estate Riches: How to Become Rich Using Your Banker's Money.''
 ''When I landed my well-publicized 10-year, $252 million contract, I set about finding an investment vehicle that would ensure my financial fitness long after baseball,'' Alex wrote, adding that de Roos's book gave ''me the confidence to form Newport Property Ventures. I began by investing in a small duplex in an emerging area of South Florida, which led to the acquisition of several other income-producing properties.''
 He didn't just acquire. He binged. Property records indicate A-Rod's company paid $58.7 million for Tampa complexes between 2004 and early this year. Those same properties, according to the county appraiser, have a current market value of $46.3 million.
 Slump? Remember, A-Rod never uses that word in baseball.
 ''I'd say the best way to sum it up in the apartment market is to say there are short-term challenges,'' said Jay Crotty, a respected Tampa real estate investment adviser who has represented Rodriguez in transactions.
 There is an apartment glut as condominiums left unsold are being rented. On the grounds of Newport Square, a property on Himes Avenue with Yankee-esque bunting on the fences, signs offer residents $350 for referrals. 
 Are Alex's rent rolls covering company costs? 
 ''I can't speak for Alex, but I think he has made sound investment decisions,'' Crotty said. ''This is a minor blip in his eyes.''
 His fortune is probably safe. But vacancies aren't healthy for anyone's bottom line. 
 Some residents are eager to depart Rodriguez-ville. In a Web site that rates apartments, one exiting renter at Newport Villas wrote that since A-Rod ''fired all the nice people in the office and his crew knows not a damn thing they are doing, I'm leaving. At least the old management would not have lost everybody's rent. They sent me a letter stating they were evicting me five months after they lost my rent.''
 Here is A-Rod, steeped in a paradox of principles, engaged in a corporate venture that binds the needy, the very same people his foundation was designed to help.
 ''As far as keeping the grounds clean, it's fine,'' said Horace Bacon, a resident of Normandy Park, a recent acquisition by Newport Property Ventures. ''But the late fees? When I sign my next lease, it's $100 for being a day late -- a day. I don't agree with that. So, you know, it's not the outside of the apartment I'm worried about.''
 Will A-Rod ever worry about what's beneath a moneymaking veneer? Or will he forever be Mr. Potter in pinstripes?

 PAUL MCCARTHY'S
Chocolate Factory
 Maccarone Gallery
 630 Greenwich Street, West Village
 Through Dec. 24
 The Los Angeles artist Paul McCarthy is not a sentimentalist. In performances in the 1990s he turned Santa Claus into a filthy old man, nose running and face bloodied, as he smeared his white-trimmed red costume with food and various fluids. Christmas wasn't a holiday; it was a psychotic episode. The spirit of giving was just a nice term for compulsive acting out. 
 A decade later Mr. McCarthy, like everyone else in the art world, has appeared to put childish rebelliousness aside, cleaned up his act and gone into business. He used to make a mess; now he's making product, specifically a line of expensive chocolate Santa Clauses for the holiday season under the name Peter Paul Chocolates LLC. 
 To this end, he has temporarily transformed his gallery, Maccarone, into a factory outlet, which wasn't so easy to do; the plumbing and electrical systems had to be overhauled to meet city codes before kitchen hardware could be brought in. Then, because no one really knew the confectionary ropes, Peter P. Greweling of the Culinary Institute of America was enlisted to supervise the whole affair. 
 The results are worth the hassle. The figures of Santa carrying a Christmas tree -- 10 inches high and made of top-of-the-line semisweet Guittard chocolate -- are being smoothly turned out in gift wrapping at a rate of 1,000 a day. Cost: $100 a figure, not including a shipping and handling fee. The retail office is open and taking orders on the gallery premises seven days a week. (The work is also available on the Web at peterpaulchocolates.com.) And even if you don't want to buy, you can watch the fully staffed factory, enclosed in glass, in operation.
 It's all so great: art as the cottage-industry enterprise everybody wants it to be, turning out a line of cute cash-and-carry luxury objects, consumerist totems for the holiday shopping countdown. Of course none of this would bear the McCarthy stamp unless there were some spoiler element. In this case the tree the Santa carries is modeled on a commercial sex toy. You may not see this at first, but once you do, you keep seeing it. 
 But that's great art for you: It may give you a sugar high, but it has dirty little secrets. HOLLAND COTTER
 KONRAD KLAPHECK
 Paintings
 Zwirner & Wirth
 32 East 69th Street, Manhattan
 Through Dec. 22
 Any painter knows it's not so much what you paint as how you paint it. For most of his career the German painter Konrad Klapheck, born in 1935, has made images of furniture, machines, plumbing and appliances using a carefully distorted realist technique that he has characterized as a rejection of Tachisme, the European equivalent of Abstract Expressionism. 
 It is a world of smoothly shaded forms, familiar yet strange, that combine architectural scale with a fleshlike soft glow and intimations of sexual entanglements. Mr. Klapheck's first New York show since his debut at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1969 has 17 paintings and one large drawing dating from 1958 to 1998; they attest to the constancy of his style.
 Mr. Klapheck endows consumer goods with the displaced desires that drive consumerism, often by emphasizing the contrast of soft and hard, flexible and rigid, sinuous and straight. In ''The Capitulation'' (1966) some kind of black tubular appliance and its orange ringlet cord are draped over a stolid wood side chair like a spent body. A similar relationship is enacted in ''Amorousness'' (1969) by an old but pale-colored telephone and a tubular chair whose conflicting styles bring to mind the tensions of Germany in the 1920s and '30s.
 In other paintings single forms are rendered with a staunch blockiness that can only be called parental. The ominous gray adding machine called ''The Emperor'' of 1966 resembles an armored vehicle, while ''Inquisition'' (1971) gives a sewing machine the forceful snub nose of a diesel engine. 
 This tendency reaches its apex and calms down a bit in ''Maturity'' (1986), a wonderfully satisfying image of a boxy red adding machine. Its crooked arm and keys suggest a bemedaled marionette on parade, while its too-thin roll of paper hints at a pea-size brain. ROBERTA SMITH

 Through Jan. 12
 If you don't know Elaine Lustig Cohen's name, probably it's because she was never a single-minded careerist. Ms. Lustig Cohen, now 80, had a successful career as a graphic designer before turning to painting in the mid-1960s. Her first solo gallery show was in 1970, and in 1979 she was the first woman to have a one-person exhibition at Mary Boone Gallery. From 1972 to 1998 she operated the Upper East Side bookstore and gallery Ex Libris. 
 This two-gallery retrospective of works dating from 1965 to the present reveals a history of restless, playful variation founded on a finely tuned formalist sensibility. It includes geometric school-of-Mondrian paintings and lively Cubist compositions of jumbled triangular and rhomboid shapes. Functional wooden boxes have exterior surfaces covered by bands and blocks of color, and a sewing kit she designed could be mistaken for the work of a Jazz Age Art Deco master.
 Ms. Lustig Cohen has wedded abstraction and eroticism by painting geometric lines and shapes over vintage nude photographs, and she has created tightly compacted, vividly colored collages from scraps of election posters torn off walls in Majorca, Spain, where she lives part time.
 Lately Ms. Lustig Cohen has been designing alphabets. One example has fine, perfectly rounded white letters and numbers, each occupying a square of a red-and-black checkerboard. A spirit of sensual grace and Modernist optimism infuses all of this work. Don't call her a postmodernist; she's a neo-Classicist. KEN JOHNSON
 THOMAS DEMAND
 Yellowcake
 303 Gallery
 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea
 Through Dec. 22
 The large, somber color photographs of the German artist Thomas Demand isolate the innocuous places where history starts to happen. Translating images of these places into paper constructions that he then photographs, he imbues them with a measure of gravity, deliberation and unsettling opacity that makes you stop and look for clues.
 Lately Mr. Demand has had a surfeit of shady locales to choose from. He has made images, for example, of some of the ballots and chads at issue in the 2000 presidential election in Florida. Now comes a series of images of the modest apartment that serves as Niger's embassy in Rome. Stationery and stamps taken from its offices figured in the forged dossier used as evidence that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy the uranium concentrate known as ''yellowcake'' from Niger; the dossier helped precipitate the invasion of Iraq.
 Since no photographs of this eventually notorious location were published, Mr. Demand worked for the first time from images he took himself, on the sly, with his cellphone during visits to the embassy. Printed in different sizes and installed in a space that has its own architectural divisions, the photographs create a kind of airbrushed, stop-action tracking shot. From the Niger flag mounted on the building's exterior, they move inside and up the stairs to the embassy's door and through it. Then comes another flag, another heavy door and, finally, an office whose messy, paper-strewn desks could indicate either a break-in or extreme disorganization. 
 The idea that history's triggers are often as unknowable as their repercussions are inalterableis of a piece with the counterfeit reality of Mr. Demand's art. It recreates the lost times and banal places where things might have worked out differently, but didn't.

 Through Dec. 22
 The artists in this real estate-inspired group show are conceptual squatters in the spirit of Gordon Matta-Clark. Most of their projects exist mainly as maps, deeds and photographic documentation, at least within this nonprofit gallery's tiny footprint.
 The mostly European artists treat land as political, not economic, currency. In his project ''The Appropriation (of Land) Committee'' (1991), the Romanian artist Dan Perjovschi sells a square meter of his country in small packs of soil as a comment on the privatization of land encouraged by the neo-Communist government. The Danish-born artist Jens Haaning proposes a time-share estate on the site of a former German concentration camp.
 Other pieces tweak national boundaries in the name of artistic expression. The most bizarre is Lars Vilks's Republic of Ladonia, a square meter of land designated by Mr. Vilks as an independent nation in response to a dispute with the Swedish government over the location of one of his sculptures.
 Visual statements are scarce. Leyla Cardenas creates a maplike floor piece with peeling paint from ruins in her native Bogota, Colombia. Katrin Sigurdardottir puts a charming twist on Duchamp's ''Boite en Valise'' with a suitcase that unfolds to reveal models of parks and nature reserves near the artist's far-flung former homes.
 New Yorkers will be most responsive to John Hawke's modified Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, bus shelter and to Michael Smith and Joshua White's video ''Open House'' (1999), in which Mr. Smith gives a tour of the SoHo loft and studio he occupied for 20 years. 
 ''Loft living isn't for everyone,'' he advises, a warning that barely registers in the current housing market. KAREN ROSENBERG 
 LOOKING BACK
 The White Columns Annual
 White Columns
 320 West 13th Street, West Village
 Through Dec. 21
 The art world acquired a welcome new tradition when Matthew Higgs inaugurated the White Columns Annual last year. The second installment of this idiosyncratic year-end roundup has been organized by Clarissa Dalrymple, an independent curator, consultant and art world personality. With fewer than 20 artists, most culled from Chelsea, it is hardly comprehensive -- but then, the Whitney Biennial is only a few months away.
 The Annual requires only that the art have been seen in New York in the past year. To jog your memory, a bulletin board near the entrance holds cards from some of the shows that made an impression on Ms. Dalrymple -- among them, ''Just Kick It Till It Breaks,'' at the Kitchen in Chelsea, and a Blinky Palermo survey at Zwirner & Wirth on the Upper East Side.
 Ms. Dalrymple favors the muted abstract paintings of Julian Lethbridge, Mark Barrow and Paul Bloodgood. The subdued, even gloomy atmosphere extends into other mediums: Shannon Ebner's black, white and gray streetscapes; Adam Helms's wall of photographs of dead insurgents; and an engrossing Beckettian video by Richard Maxwell (better known for his theatrical work). Dave McKenzie's dangling aluminum letters, which spell out ''Tomorrow Will Be Better,'' end the year on a more optimistic note.
 In any case the Annual is less about trend forecasting than playing catch-up. If you missed Andrew Lord's ceramics at Gladstone, for instance, or Sadie Benning's videos at Orchard, you'll be grateful for the second chance. KAREN ROSENBERG
 TARA DONOVAN
 Metropolitan Museum of Art
 Through April 27
 Tara Donovan's last show at PaceWildenstein was a marvel of mundane accumulation, with three million plastic cups stacked to create an otherworldly sculptural landscape. Several years ago, at Ace in Los Angeles, thousands of glued-together Styrofoam cups hovered like a post-Minimalist cloud over the gallery floor. In other of Ms. Donovan's works, drinking straws, pencils, tape and other prosaic materials have been configured into suggestively organic topographies.
 The current show, which occupies a dismal zone of art real estate -- a low-ceilinged mezzanine gallery at the Met -- suggests that Ms. Donovan is more successful in wide-open spaces like Pace and Ace. To be fair, she does a better-than-average job of making this nook off the stairwell look good. (The German painter Neo Rauch's neo-Social Realist-Surrealist paintings felt diminished in the same space this year.)
 Ms. Donovan has curled Mylar tape into hundreds of little loops, installed them in clusters on the gallery walls and illuminated the whole thing with spotlights to create an effect like shimmering droplets or ice formations drifting across the wall.
 The upside of seeing this at the Met is that you can then wander through other precincts and find many objects that rhyme associatively and perceptually with Ms. Donovan's installation: vegetal patterns in the European tapestries; the beaded surfaces of Assyrian wall reliefs; and, particularly, depictions of snow, clouds or blossoms in Asian screens and scrolls. 
 It is not as rewarding as seeing one of Ms. Donovan's more ingenious, ambitious works, but it offers some compensation.

HEADLINE: Despite Post-Thanksgiving Gains, Stores Worry About Final Quarter

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Cold weather, deep discounts and a quirk in the calendar rescued retailers from what threatened to be a dreary November, but it might not be enough to save the holiday shopping season.
 Sales at big chain stores rose 3.5 percent last month, led by department stores, which have struggled this fall, according to International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group.
But signs of trouble remain -- and stores are taking no chances. In an unusual move, Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer, said it would offer steep early-morning discounts starting today, hoping to ignite the kind of shopping frenzy reserved for the day after Thanksgiving. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial yardstick in retailing, jumped 13.4 percent at Macy's in November, 10.2 percent at Kohl's and 8.7 percent at Nordstrom.
 Yet Wall Street was not impressed because the improvements can be traced, in part, to a anomaly in the calendar, which gave retailers an extra week of post-Thanksgiving sales this November, compared with last. 
 Target, for example, reported a 10.8 percent increase in sales, but said that without the calendar shift, sales would have risen just 1.1 percent. 
 If Target's sales do not ''meaningfully improve'' in December, its chief executive, Robert J. Ulrich, warned, the chain may struggle to meet its profit forecast for the final three months of the year.
 Target's troubles may not bode well for consumer spending. ''When such a good company with nationwide presence and a wide variety of merchandise talks about a severe slowdown in sales, that's a concern,'' said Bill Dreher, a research analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities.
 Investors punished several retailers' shares, despite strong sales. Shares of Target dropped 4.6 percent yesterday. Macy's shares were down 4.5 percent. Nordstrom was an exception, gaining 1.8 percent.
 The relatively strong November sales -- caveats and all -- were a stark turnaround from earlier in the fall, when a combination of unseasonably warm weather, a tight credit market and high energy prices produced the weakest retail sales in a decade.
 But merchants remain anxious. Steep markdowns for Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, encouraged shoppers to buy but might hurt the profits at chains. And while consumers flocked to cold-weather clothing as temperatures dipped in the Midwest and Northeast last month, they are unlikely to return to buy a second winter coat. 
 ''Investors are very concerned about the state of consumer spending,'' Mr. Dreher said. ''Do we have sluggish momentum? Are we cheaping out? Are we focusing on lower-margin goods?''
 Wal-Mart said its sales rose 1.9 percent in November, a relatively strong performance, but by no means stellar. The chain, in a statement, said it had ''very solid Black Friday sales across the store, from entertainment items to sleepwear'' and said demand for winter coats was high.
 November was not a banner month for everyone. Sales rose 2.6 percent at J. C. Penney but the company warned of a ''challenging economic environment,'' and its shares fell 2.2 percent. Gap said sales were flat, a triumph for a company accustomed to big monthly sales declines. American Eagle Outfitters and Limited also posted flat sales.
 Sales fell 13.7 percent at Chico's, the women's clothing chain, and 8.3 percent at Hot Topic, the teenage clothing store. 
 There is growing concern that consumer spending has trailed off since Black Friday. 
 ShopperTrak, a research firm, said retail sales dropped 4.4 percent for the week ended Dec. 1, compared with the same period last year. But online sales have surged. From Nov. 1 to Dec. 2, Web spending rose 17 percent, to $14.2 billion, according to comScore, a Web research firm.
 Analysts will now turn their attention to the pre-Christmas shopping period for a fuller sense of sales performance. The International Council of Shopping Centers predicts sales will rise 1.5 percent this December, compared with last year. 
 ''We have to see where December comes out,'' said Michelle Tan, a department store analyst at UBS. ''This year Christmas Eve is on a Monday so you have a full weekend to do your last-minute shopping.''

HEADLINE: A NEW BUSH TACK ON NORTH KOREA

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Steven Lee Myers and David E. Sanger contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
President Bush, directly engaging the man he publicly called a ''tyrant,'' wrote a letter to North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-il, in which he held out the prospect of normalized relations with the United States if North Korea fully disclosed its nuclear programs and dismantled its nuclear reactor, administration officials said Thursday. 
 The high-level personal missive from Mr. Bush to the leader of the country he placed in his ''axis of evil'' in 2002 was sent as American negotiators struggle to get the secretive North Korean government to fully explain and disclose the extent, use and spread of its nuclear material and technology. At the same time, the United States is also urging other nations to maintain pressure on Iran in the wake of a new assessment that Tehran halted nuclear weapons work in 2003. 
Mr. Bush addressed the letter ''Dear Mr. Chairman,'' and urged the enigmatic North Korean leader to disclose all of his country's past and present nuclear work. ''I want to emphasize that the declaration must be complete and accurate if we are to continue our progress,'' the letter said, according to a senior administration official. 
 The letter closed, ''Sincerely, George W. Bush.'' It was signed by hand, administration officials said.
 While administration officials described the letter as straightforward, its very existence underscores just how much the White House wants to ensure that one of the administration's scarce, tangible diplomatic accomplishments does not slip away.
 North Korea agreed in October to dismantle all of its nuclear facilities and to disclose all of its past and present nuclear programs by the end of the year in return for about a million tons of fuel oil or its equivalent in economic aid. That agreement has come under fierce criticism from national security hawks, but many foreign policy experts point to it as a rare diplomatic success in a period that has been dominated by frustration in Iran, the Middle East and Pakistan. 
 The White House declined to provide copies of the letter and sought to minimize its significance by pointing out that Mr. Bush had written letters to the leaders of all the other countries in the so-called six-party group that had been working to end North Korea's nuclear program. 
 ''In these letters, the president reiterated our commitment to the six-party talks and stressed the need for North Korea to come forward with a full and complete declaration of their nuclear programs, as called for in the September 2005 six-party agreement,'' said Gordon D. Johndroe, a White House spokesman.
 But Mr. Bush talks to the leaders of the other countries -- China, Russia, Japan and South Korea -- on a regular basis. And the letters were not identical, administration officials said. ''The letter to Kim Jong-il speaks of the six-party process and its historical mission, and lays out a vision of normalization and complete denuclearization,'' a senior administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the letters publicly. ''They are all different.'' 
 Another administration official said the letter emphasized the need to resolve three sticking points: the number of warheads North Korea built, the amount of weapons-grade nuclear material it produced and the need for North Korea to disclose what nuclear material and knowledge it has received from other countries and what nuclear material and knowledge it has passed on to other countries. 
 The proliferation issue has taken on new importance since an Israeli strike in Syria in September, which administration and Israeli officials say was conducted against a nuclear plant near the Euphrates River that was supplied with material from North Korea. Administration officials want North Korea to disclose what help it may have given Syria, although they also acknowledge that any such assistance occurred before North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear reactor and disclose its nuclear programs.
 Christopher R. Hill, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice indicated on Thursday that Dec. 31 was not a hard and fast deadline for the disclosure, and that it could slip a few days or even weeks.
 The letter to Mr. Kim is dated Dec. 1, administration officials said. Mr. Hill delivered it to his North Korean counterpart in Beijing on Wednesday. Within hours, North Korea announced that Mr. Kim had received the letter.
 The White House letter is a huge reversal from the veritable cold war that has existed between Mr. Bush and Mr. Kim for most of the Bush administration. In 2002, Mr. Bush referred to Mr. Kim as a ''pygmy'' and compared him to a ''spoiled child at a dinner table'' during a meeting with Republican senators, according to news reports at the time. 
 In his State of the Union address that same year, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim's government ''a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.'' During a news conference in 2005, Mr. Bush called Mr. Kim a ''tyrant'' and said he maintained ''concentration camps.''
 The letter struck a more cordial tone. ''I would describe it as a presidential letter to another leader of a country,'' said Dana Perino, the White House press secretary. 
 Mr. Hill, who was recently in North Korea's capital, Pyongyang, and was in Beijing on Wednesday for meetings with some of his counterparts in the talks, has advised the North to make a full disclosure of its nuclear programs, as it agreed to in October. North Korea seemed to be on the verge of making a limited disclosure, perhaps as a negotiating ploy before Dec. 31, the tentative deadline, administration officials said.
 Administration officials are walking something of a tightrope between pressing hard for the declaration and compromising with North Korean negotiators to get one and declare victory. Several senior officials said they were mindful of criticism from national security hawks in Washington, who do not want to see a deal go through because they do not believe that North Korea will abide by it.
 ''This is like Lucy and Charlie Brown and the football,'' said John R. Bolton, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations. ''How many times are we going to go through this with them?''

BANKS across the United States, particularly the smaller ones, have become dependent on construction lending just as that area of the economy is weakening and the number of bad loans is growing.
 Figures compiled by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and released last week show that both midsize and small banks had construction loans outstanding that were greater than their total capital. A decade ago, such loans were equal to only a third of capital for those banks.
 For most of this decade, that was a good strategy. Construction loans proved to be very profitable, particularly for smaller banks as competition from larger banks and securities markets eroded their position in areas like mortgage lending and credit card issuance. 
 Now, however, more than 3 percent of all construction loans are classified as being nonperforming, or have borrowers that are behind on their payments. That is the highest proportion in a decade.
 Such problems are not spread evenly across all banks, of course. ''When you look at the regional impact, the areas that were the booming condominium markets, like South Florida, have shown a surge in delinquency rates,'' said Matthew Anderson, a partner in Foresight Analytics, a real estate market analysis firm based in Oakland, Calif. 
 ''I think there will be a wave of bank failures in the not-too-distant future,'' he added, ''although probably not on the order of the 1980s and 1990s. You had a lot of high loan-to-value lending going on in markets that have soured significantly.''
 When construction loans go bad, they can go very bad, in part because it can take a long time to slow them down after markets begin to weaken. Construction projects, once begun, are useless if not finished. 
 So even though construction spending began to decline in mid-2006, the volume of construction loans on bank books has continued to rise, hitting a record $616 billion at the end of September, up 13 percent from a year earlier. Mr. Anderson estimated that construction loans for single-family homes fell 10 percent over the period, but that was more than made up by increases in loans for condominiums and apartments, and by a surge in commercial construction.
 It is somewhat easier to slow spending on single-family homes, since a developer planning a 50-home project can leave some of the homes unbuilt if demand dries up. But a planned 20-story condominium building cannot be topped off after 10 floors are built.
 ''A lot of the biggest construction lending problems are in markets that are already weak,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''Having weak projects hitting a weak market is just adding to the price pressure in that market.''
 In early 1991, in the last big real estate downturn, the percentage of construction loans that were either on nonperforming status or behind in payments hit 18.5 percent, nearly six times the current level.
 For anything like that to happen now, commercial real estate markets -- including office buildings and stores -- would have to weaken significantly. 
 That is unlikely to happen unless a severe recession arrives, but the possibility has worried federal bank regulators. In 2006, they proposed rules to restrain such lending but backed off after banks objected. The policy that finally came out did little more than warn that ''rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the advent of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets.'' 
 The problem, if it comes, is not likely to affect big banks as much as smaller ones. Banks with more than $10 billion in assets have lower concentrations of construction loans now than they did at the end of 1989. But banks with less than that amount of assets are more than twice as dependent on construction loans as they were then.

HEADLINE: A Challenge for Churches: Adulthood Takes Its Time

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
At some point during the 20th century, the United States invented adolescence. Where once there had merely been youth, there were now teenagers, with their own dress, music, magazines, books, economy, culture and expected patterns of behavior. It was enough to get organized religion, in the words of the bard, ''all shook up.'' 
 Now, says a leading sociologist of religion, a similarly ''distinct and important stage in life, situated between the teenage years and full-fledged adulthood, has emerged.'' It is ''reshaping the meaning of self, youth, relationships and life commitments''-- and religious leaders had better pay attention.
 Writing in the November-December issue of Books & Culture, that scholar, Christian Smith, describes what researchers in sociology, psychology and human development are calling ''emerging adulthood,'' a time between ages 18 and 30 or so, when marriage and parenthood are often delayed, formal schooling is prolonged, job switching is frequent and parental support is extended. 
 ''Half a century ago, many young people were anxious to get out of high school, marry, settle down, have children and start a long-term career,'' writes Professor Smith, who directs the Center for the Study of Religion and Society at the University of Notre Dame. Today, many young people spend more than a decade between high school and marriage ''exploring life's many options in unprecedented freedom.'' And, it should be added, in great uncertainty. 
 ''Studies agree that the transition to adulthood today is more complex, disjointed and confusing than it was in past decades,'' Professor Smith writes. It is a transition ''marked by immense autonomy, freedom of choice, lack of obligations and focus on the self,'' a time also characterized by instability and experimentation, when ''hopes and exhilaration recurrently run up against confusion and frustration'' and when ''ties to the social institutions of civil society, including church, are often weak.'' 
 He cites research suggesting that emerging adults seem to slough off almost entirely the religious faith of their upbringing or even of their adolescence.
 Of course, young people have always tended to drift from religious moorings when they leave home, and then connect with religion again when they marry or have children. But the longer that intervening period becomes -- and it may now be 15 or 20 years -- the less likely the return.
 Furthermore, Professor Smith says, ''these are crucial years in the formation of personal identity, behavioral patterns and social relationships.'' One returns a different person, possibly formed quite independently of any earlier faith, certainly of any participation in a religious community.
 Robert Wuthnow, another distinguished sociologist of religion, explores much the same territory in ''After the Baby Boomers'' (Princeton, 2007), a book subtitled ''How Twenty- and Thirty-Somethings Are Shaping the Future of American Religion.'' He focuses on adults 21 to 45 years old, a group that is not just the harbinger of the future but that already constitutes about half the country's adult population. 
 Professor Wuthnow too finds that delayed marriage and parenthood, economic instability and the constant blitz of new information and alternative lifestyles present a new challenge to religious institutions, as did the entry of women into the paid work force.
 Among adults in this age group, regular attendance at worship services has declined markedly in the last three decades, while the proportion never attending at all has increased. The change has occurred almost entirely among the growing numbers who have not married. 
 ''Unless religious leaders take younger adults more seriously, the future of American religion is in doubt,'' warns Professor Wuthnow, who teaches sociology at Princeton. 
 There are differences between the two accounts. Professor Smith's is a bold, broadly sketched essay proposing ''emerging adulthood'' as a life stage that demands powerful responses from organized religion. Professor Wuthnow's is a data-heavy volume filled with caveats about generalizing; the word ''journalist'' appears repeatedly in his warning against reports, maybe like this one, announcing some remarkable new development on the religion landscape. 
 The difference manifests itself in how the two scholars deal with sex. Both recognize delay of marriage and child-rearing as a defining feature of the new stage in adulthood. Professor Smith puts ''sex, cohabitation and marriage'' (in that order) squarely on the table as ''key dimensions'' of the changed situation. Any emerging adults who want to abide by traditional strictures against premarital sex, he says, ''face a very difficult peer culture in which to live.'' 
 Professor Wuthnow has a great deal to say about marriage, weddings, marital happiness and parenting, but only a page and a half on premarital sex, mostly devoted to data concerning which young adults consider it right or wrong and what percentage of the unmarried who consider it wrong nonetheless acknowledge having had sexual relations in the last year (answer: 63 percent). His index does not include the word ''cohabitation.'' 
 The same difference is evident in the two authors' thoughts about how religious groups might respond. Professor Wuthnow describes modest changes in worship services and programs that might help congregations engage young adults, especially unmarried ones. Professor Smith, writing for a largely evangelical audience, jumps in with the idea that perhaps parents, who already offer their adult offspring considerable financial and caretaking support, should challenge the cultural assumption that marriage ought to await financial independence. Instead, they should provide social and financial support for marriage in the early 20s rather than the late.
 ''Teenage marriage is the best recipe for divorce,'' he writes, ''but marriage in the 20s itself is not.'' He questions whether the current culture of emerging adulthood, with ''hooking up'' and serial cohabitation, is helpful preparation either for marriage or for real adulthood rather than ''mere rationalization for self-indulgence and, at its worst, sheer narcissism.'' 
 ''A good argument can be made that true, authentic selves are made more than found,'' he writes. ''It is arguably as much or more by making and keeping promises than by dabbling and deferring that we come to know who we as persons really are and are called to become.'' 
 Where the authors converge is on the contrast between the institutional resources that both society and religious bodies have poured into the first two decades of preparing young people for adulthood and the absence of any parallel support once these young adults are launched out on their own. It is high time, they agree, to conceptualize emerging adulthood as a distinct transitional life stage, to understand the social forces generating it and to grapple with its typical characteristics and consequences.

HEADLINE: A Separate Union, Of Athletes, For Athletes

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
The need for an association of professional athletes was never more apparent than in the aftermath of the murder of Washington Redskins safety Sean Taylor. 
 The news media response to Taylor's murder was disturbing, and should have been sobering to all professional athletes. Several commentaries rehashed Taylor's past transgressions, expressing no surprise that Taylor died a violent death. 
 After reading and listening to these accounts, I found myself more resolute. If there was ever a time for professional athletes to organize as a group to define themselves, this was the time. In many ways, professional athletes, while more visible than ever, are more restricted -- by league, by team, by owner. 
 Teams orchestrate, agents advise. The athlete simply tries to make the most out of a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, realizing that in the end they are disposable parts. Disposable parts with limited voices.
 ''It's like the athlete is mute and everybody's representing them,'' said Michael Stone, a veteran safety of seven N.F.L. seasons. ''That's why there's really a need for athletes to step up and have a united voice.'' 
 You probably have never heard of Michael Stone. He played with the Cardinals, New England, Houston and the Giants this season before going on injured reserve. 
 Stone wants his claim to fame to be that he successfully formed an association of professional athletes; an all-sports group -- multiethnic, multiracial -- that would address a number of issues: celebrity, safety, sudden affluence. These are crucial issues that fall outside the reach of a franchise and various players unions. 
 The horror of Taylor's death resonates across the landscape of sports because it speaks to the vulnerability of being a professional athlete. 
 ''The issue with Sean Taylor is the issue with about 90 percent of athletes,'' Stone said.
 Stone was referring to the predicament many athletes face after they achieve professional success and sudden wealth. 
 ''It's something that's going to keep happening again and again; it's not anything that's going to disappear until it's addressed,'' Stone said.
 Stone said he felt the best people to tackle this issue were the athletes rather than the team executives or the union. 
 I have often wondered why professional athletes, with vast resources and cultural cachet, have not organized beyond their unions. 
 One reason is that they do not see themselves as ''professionals'' the way we see accountants, doctors and engineers as professionals. For many pro athletes, sports are less a profession than a fantasy.
 Many athletes feel that their membership in a union is sufficient. It's really not. 
 ''To me, the association is in bed with the N.F.L. and with the owners,'' Stone said yesterday in a telephone interview. 
 ''The union is inherently tied in with the N.F.L., the N.B.A. is tied into the N.B.A. union, all of them are inherently tied into their respective leagues,'' he said. ''There is a commitment to players as long as they are important to the owners and important to the league.
 ''With sports agents, you're important when you're a player,'' Stone added. ''Whenever your career is done, your agent won't return your phone call. 
 ''A lot of relationships with players are set up that way: we're important while we're important. Once we're done, we're done. There's a big need for filling that gap.''
 This is precisely what a professional association of athletes could do: provide a free space between team and union in order for athletes to ferret out issues among themselves -- beyond the reach of agents -- and launch initiatives to get the most out of an industry largely built on their sweat and broken bones. 
 Let's not be naive: Many players -- especially the more elite -- won't see the need for an association beyond their respective membership in their sport's union. They can point to feel-good, league-sponsored initiatives like reading to a second-grade class for an hour or making visits to a hospital. They can also point to team alumni groups.
 ''If I'm a guy making $40 million a year or have a super contract,'' Stone said, ''I'm totally satisfied. I see that no matter what happens, my family will be taken care of and basically everybody's families that I know will be taken care of.
 ''But this association will be just as beneficial -- even more beneficial -- to an elite player than a middle ground player, but it's hard to get the elite player to realize how much it's needed.''
 He added: ''The uniting of players is going to open up so many different doors and opportunities. Unity is powerful.'' 
 In 1967, Jim Brown, the Hall of Fame Cleveland Browns running back, pulled together African-American athletes in different sports and formed the Negro Economic Development Union. 
 Stone said his proposed association would be open to everyone. 
 This is a wise approach. Athletes, more than any other professional group, embrace diversity as a necessary way of life. 
 Perhaps they can be the torch that lights the way.

HEADLINE: Warming and the Right

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
LAST June, Jim Manzi, a longtime software executive, laid out a case in The National Review for the need for conservatives to accept the ''reality'' of global warming (nationalreview.com). It is, he wrote, ''no longer possible, scientifically or politically, to deny that human activities have very likely increased global temperatures; what remains in dispute is the precise magnitude of the human impact.''
 Conservatives, he added, ''should accept this reality -- and move on to the question of what we should do about it.'' 
 ''This would put us in a much better position to prevent a massive, counterproductive intervention in the U.S. economy.''
 Mr. Manzi was lambasted by liberals as well as conservatives, including the radio host Rush Limbaugh (rushlimbaugh.com), who questioned his knowledge of physics and declared that he was relying on ''junk science.'' 
 Undaunted, Mr. Manzi followed up this week in The American Scene, a Web site focused on politics and culture, arguing against proposed carbon taxes. Imposing them would create a worldwide ''economic drag'' that could actually be worse, economically speaking, than global warming itself, he wrote (theamericanscene.com). 
 Far better, according to Mr. Manzi, would be to create technologies that would ''use energy more efficiently, emit less carbon per unit of energy, remove carbon from the atmosphere, and/or reduce the harm done by carbon dioxide.''
 Ryan Avent writes on the environment-focused site Grist that he is happy that ''some conservative thinkers are beginning to wrestle with warming in an intellectually honest, if mistaken, manner.'' But he says he is perplexed by the notion of a conservative arguing in favor of planned government investments over the choice-driven incentives that carbon taxes would create (gristmill.grist.org). ''A 'conservative' approach to emissions reduction that favors the wisdom of central planning over market allocations?'' he wrote. ''The mind boggles.'' 
 REVENUE VeRITe Video sites need to draw a minimum of 50,000 views a month before getting serious interest from advertisers, Dina Kaplan, a founder of the video-sharing site Blip.tv, told Daisy Whitney of TVWeek. And getting to that level is no easy task. 
 It is one thing to get attention, but quite another to build a big enough audience to make real money, Ms. Whitney wrote (tvweek.com). ''Some Web video stars, like the 'Ask a Ninja' guys, are raking it in. Some, like the Beet.tv video blogger Andy Plesser, are earning a hefty supplement to their day jobs.'' 
 ''Ask a Ninja,'' which features a guy in a ninja outfit answering viewer questions, is particularly hot just now, taking in about $100,000 a month for its two founders from advertising, merchandising and licensing, Ms. Whitney reported. 
 BACK TO THE FUTURE It's easy to make fun of decades-old films that tried to predict the future: the Internet is rife with clips depicting jet packs, hovercraft, and anthropomorphic robot butlers. This week, though, a short, uncannily accurate clip from ''1999 A.D.,'' a film made in 1967 by Philco-Ford, got lots of attention online when it was posted to the Ultimate News Flash blog (ultimatenewsflash.blogspot.com). The film's depictions of electronic commerce and e-mail are about as spot-on as they could be, though the filmmakers failed to forecast changes in attitudes toward sex roles. ''What the wife selects on her console will be paid for by the husband on his counterpart console,'' the narrator declares. She is in the kitchen, buying clothes; he is in the den, paying bills.

HEADLINE: As Spotlight on Myanmar Fades, Generals Breathe Easy

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The streets are quiet in Myanmar. The ''destructive elements'' are in jail. The international outcry has faded. The junta's grip on power seems firm. 
 Two months after they cracked down on huge antigovernment demonstrations led by Buddhist monks, the generals who rule Myanmar have reason to feel relief. 
 It seems they have ridden out their most difficult challenge in two decades and are set to maintain control through force and fear, offering only small concessions to the demands of their critics abroad. 
 If change is coming in Myanmar, experts say, it is likely to be a long process and to emerge from within the power structure. 
 Diplomats and human rights groups say that an unknown number of protesters and monks remain in prison, that many monasteries in the main city, Yangon, have emptied out and that new arrests are reported almost every day. 
 ''This is the soft continuation of the crackdown of August and September,'' said David Mathieson, an expert on Myanmar for Human Rights Watch, which released a report on the uprising on Friday documenting 20 deaths in Yangon but adding that the full death toll was probably higher.
 Separately on Friday, the United Nations human rights envoy to Myanmar, Sergio Pinheiro, said his research showed that 31 people had been killed.
 The government admits to only 15 deaths.
 The Human Rights Watch report said that during the crackdown security forces fired into crowds, beat marchers and monks, and arbitrarily detained thousands of people. ''Without full and independent access to the country it is impossible to determine exact casualty figures,'' the report said. 
 Meeting with reporters here last week, the top American diplomat in Myanmar, Shari Villarosa, said the continuing repression ''raises questions about the sincerity of the military in pursuing what we will consider to be a genuine dialogue leading to national reconciliation.'' 
 In what seems to be a sign of the United States' waning influence in the region, China, India and Myanmar's Southeast Asian neighbors have brushed aside Washington's calls for an economic embargo and the diplomatic isolation of the junta. 
 As the attention of the world shifts elsewhere, the generals have made it clear that they intend to follow their own course, as they have through a half-century of self-imposed isolation. 
 On Monday, they signaled their defiance by announcing that a constitutional drafting committee had begun its work and was not going to listen to outside voices. The constitution is one step on what the junta calls a ''road map to democracy.'' Many analysts call it a dodge to evade genuine reform. 
 ''The road map will, of course, lead to a military-dominated, civilianized government, which will perpetuate themselves in power,'' said David I. Steinberg, a leading expert on Myanmar at Georgetown University in Washington. 
 As it has in the past when it faced international pressure, the junta has offered small gestures of compliance. But analysts say that whatever happens, the generals are not about to give real ground to the demands of the United Nations. 
 In one of these concessions, a United Nations envoy, Ibrahim Gambari, is scheduled to visit Myanmar this month for the third time in an attempt to nudge the government toward a dialogue with its opposition. He follows a half-dozen other United Nations envoys over the past 17 years who have failed to moderate the behavior of the junta. 
 In another concession, a government official has held three meetings with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the pro-democracy leader who has spent 12 of the last 18 years under house arrest. The official, Minister of Labor Aung Kyi, said Monday that more meetings were planned, though he was vague about the time frame. ''We need to consider what to discuss and why,'' he said. ''We are choosing what and why. So we will take where, how and when into consideration in the future.'' 
 It was possible to read, in this dismissive comment, a note of confidence that the generals hold the upper hand in their dealings with the outside world. 
 ''This is not what the Security Council has called for, a genuine process to heal the country,'' a Western diplomat said by telephone from Yangon, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with embassy policy. 
 On Monday, Information Minister Kyaw Hsan belittled the protests as the work of a few agitators and dissident monks who were acting with the support of foreign powers. 
 ''Actually, the August-September protests were trivial for the whole country and in comparison to other events in other countries,'' he said. They dissolved quickly, he added, ''because the general public did not take part and our security forces were able to make pre-emptive strikes.'' 
 The crackdown, witnessed abroad in smuggled photographs and on videotape, drew condemnation and warnings from around the world. 
 A notable critic was the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean, whose sharp words suggested a real hardening of world opinion against Myanmar, which is one of its members. 
 In a statement written by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong of Singapore, Asean said the videos and photographs ''have evoked the revulsion of people throughout Southeast Asia and all over the world.'' 
 But this mood seems to have passed. A meeting of all 10 members in Singapore in November offered an occasion to bring pressure on the junta. Instead, the association seemed at pains to accommodate it. 
 At Myanmar's request, Asean canceled an invitation to Mr. Gambari, the United Nations envoy, to address the meeting. It also changed the language of a new charter to weaken its section on human rights. 
 As if nothing had happened in Myanmar in recent months, Asean's secretary general, Ong Keng Yong, said, ''We don't want to come across as being too confrontational in a situation like this.''

HEADLINE: Directors' Pact Nears End, Adding More Intrigue to Strikes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Talks between Hollywood's striking writers and producers collapsed amid acrimony on Friday night, even as the sides braced for the likely appearance of a third party -- the Directors Guild of America, whose own contract is up next June.
 After making marginal progress in renewed discussions over the last 12 days, bargainers for writers and producers broke off without settling crucial issues and with no plan to resume. 
 Both sides, meanwhile, could see the power equation in their fight tilt against one or the other, as the directors introduce their own take on nettlesome issues like the payments for the distribution of movies and television shows on the Web and through other new-media outlets. 
 For weeks, the directors' guild has been on the brink of opening negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, even as the industry group remained bogged in troubled, sometimes nasty negotiations with both the Writers Guild of America East and the Writers Guild of America West.
 In a statement late Friday, the producers said: ''We're disappointed to report that talks between the AMPTP and WGA have broken down yet again.'' 
 The writers, in a statement of their own, said they had been presented with an unacceptable ''ultimatum'' that would have required them to drop many of their key demands if bargaining were to continue. ''We remain ready and willing to negotiate, no matter how intransigent our bargaining partners are, because the stakes are simply too high,'' the statement said. In their statement, the producers complained that writers had spent their energy on public rallies, concerts and even a mock exorcism while pressing ''unreasonable'' demands that would give the unions jurisdiction over workers in animation and reality television, boost their Internet compensation to levels that might exceed the producers' own income, and eliminate an existing ''no strike'' provision that prevents guild members from honoring picket lines of other unions once their own deal is in place. 
 Earlier Gilbert Cates, who heads the directors' negotiating team, said his union had not yet decided when to open negotiations and was carefully monitoring progress in the writers talks. ''If they can come to an agreement, we'll all have a party,'' Mr. Cates said.
 Company negotiators expected to begin formal bargaining the week after Thanksgiving with leaders of the directors' union, which represents some 13,500 film and television directors and associated production workers. That plan was shelved as the writers and producers were persuaded by the talent agent Bryan Lourd and other intermediaries to have another go at their own stalled talks. 
 But the directors are increasingly itchy to get started, despite pressure for a delay from some of the roughly 1,400 directors who also belong to one of the writers' guilds.
 For producers, the new discussions would be a welcome break. They could offer another chance to make the company case against saddling new media with pay structures that match or exceed those covering the old. By providing a new viewpoint on common issues, the talks might also give employers some relief in a public relations war that has seen them cast as cold-hearted corporate giants. 
 Talks with the directors would also certainly divert the company negotiators' attention from writers' demands, and might well undercut some of them, if the directors push for less than their screenwriting brethren on some points. Still, concurrent bargaining could bring support for some of the writers' positions. It appears unlikely, for instance, that directors would be any more inclined than writers toward the companies' earlier request to delay setting pay for new media pending an industrywide study. Spokesmen for the producers and the writers declined to discuss possible talks with directors. 
 For months, the directors' guild leaders -- including Michael Apted, its president; Mr. Cates, its secretary-treasurer; and Jay Roth, its national executive director -- have been gathering economic information that is likely to become the basis for proposals that will not entirely please writers or producers. 
 Fiercely independent, the directors have seen advantage in early settlement of their contracts. (The current contract expires June 30, on the same day as that of the much larger Screen Actors Guild.) 
 In both 2001 and 2004, for instance, the guild reached agreements with producers months before existing three-year deals expired, winning what leaders described as gains from work in new technologies and funds to protect a buckling health plan.
 ''We're not going to be unreasonable, but we're tough,'' Mr. Cates said of his guild's approach. ''That's how movies get made.''
 To date, however, relations between the unions have been cool, at best. Leaders of the writers' guild have been straining to break a cycle under which directors have often reached agreements that became a pattern for the industry on central issues. (The directors have struck only once in their history, during a 1987 walkout that lasted for three hours on the East Coast and only minutes in the West.)
 Several weeks ago, a member of the writers' guild board, Peter Lefcourt, sent writer-directors an e-mail message comparing the prospect of early bargaining by directors and producers to the alliance of Hitler and Stalin.
 Mr. Cates responded tartly with an e-mail message of his own. ''If and when the DGA begins negotiations you can be sure that the DGA will not settle for anything but what is in the best interests of all its members and hopefully the working community at large,'' Mr. Cates wrote.
 The coming negotiation poses a special challenge for Mr. Cates, who not only heads the directors' bargaining committee, but is expected to produce the Oscar broadcast scheduled for broadcast by ABC on Feb. 24. Mr. Cates sounded sanguine about the lost weeks of negotiating time. ''That's what being a director's about,'' Mr. Cates said.

HEADLINE: Efforts to Harvest Ocean's Energy Open New Debate Front

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: NEWPORT, Ore. 

 BODY:
Chris Martinson and his fellow fishermen catch crab and shrimp in the same big swell that one day could generate an important part of the Northwest's energy supply. Wave farms, harvested with high-tech buoys that are being tested here on the Oregon coast, would strain clean, renewable power from the surging sea. 
 They might make a mess of navigational charts, too. 
 ''I don't want it in my fishing grounds,'' said Mr. Martinson, 40, who docks his 74-foot boat, Libra, here at Yaquina Bay, about 90 miles southwest of Portland. ''I don't want to be worried about driving around someone else's million-dollar buoy.''
 The coastal Northwest is one of the few parts of the West where water is abundant, but people are still fighting over it. Amid concerns about climate change and the pollution caused by generating electricity with coal and natural gas, Oregon is looking to draw power from the waves that pound its coast with forbidding efficiency.
 It might seem a perfect solution in a region that has long been ahead of the national curve on alternative energy. Yet the debate over the potential damage -- whether to the environment, the fishing industry or the stunning views of the Pacific -- has become intense before the first megawatt has been transmitted to shore.
 ''Everyone wants that silver bullet,'' said Fran Recht of the Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission. ''The question is, Is this as benign as everyone wants to say it is?''
 The first federal permit to conduct testing for a wave energy farm off the coast of the United States was awarded in February to a company that wants to study the ocean area near Reedsport, Ore., 60 miles south of here. Three more permits have since been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
 Major technical and financial obstacles remain, and energy generated from waves is not expected to start contributing to the electrical grid in the United States for several years. Yet like wind energy in its early stages in the 1980s, wave energy is considered promising, perhaps inevitable, with the potential to one day provide 5 percent to 10 percent of the nation's energy supply, according to some projections. 
 Oregon, Washington and Northern California, where the Pacific Ocean first meets land in the contiguous United States after gathering momentum for thousands of miles beneath westerly winds, have the potential to generate four times as much energy from waves as states on the East Coast, according to studies by the Electric Power Research Institute.
 All of the permits approved have been in Oregon, where transmission lines run close to the coast, making them easier to tap into, and where state government encourages businesses to explore new forms of energy.
 With state support, Oregon State University is testing a wave energy buoy it plans to deploy off the coast here next spring. 
 Finavera Renewables, a Canadian company with an office in Portland, has conducted tests near the Yaquina Head lighthouse here, and has a permit to do more testing near Coos Bay. Ocean Power Technologies, the company planning the project near Reedsport, has received a preliminary permit to test the potential for a wave farm it says could generate up to 50 megawatts of electricity. A typical coal-burning plant produces about 600 megawatts. 
 Several kinds of technology are being tested. Some would use buoys that hold turbines turned by waves. One type being tested at Oregon State would create energy from the relative movement between a fixed spar and a buoy that rises and falls with waves. 
 The Reedsport project could transmit energy to shore through an outflow pipe once used by a now-defunct timber mill. That convergence of old economy and new reflects what supporters of wave energy say is fitting symmetry for a region that has evolved from an extraction-based economy built on logging to one striving to use natural resources in ways that are environmentally sound.
 But some environmentalists and fishermen worry that the recent rush for renewable energy is more about politics, big business and the next big thing than it is about clean energy. They warn that too little is known about what effect wave farms might have on migrating fish and whales. 
 ''The tendency with new technology is always to minimize the downside,'' said Ms. Recht, of the fisheries commission, which works with conservation agencies and the fishing industry to protect fish populations. ''I'm not prepared to take new risks unless we're conserving and respecting the energy we already have.''
 Nancy Fitzpatrick, the administrator of the Oregon Salmon Commission, which is financed by the fishing industry, said: ''Is it going to impact us? Going way back to the dams, we find out later that of course, yes, it affected salmon and migration. So we don't want to be stuck in a situation like that with wave energy.''
 For now, wave parks are expected to be built two or three miles offshore and cover as much as several square miles. Supporters say they will barely be visible, it at all. 
 Philip D. Moeller, a member of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and a supporter of wave and tidal energy projects, said the government was ''not allowing these to go into sensitive areas.'' Mr. Moeller added, ''We haven't defined sensitive area, but the point is we'll be cognizant of that.''
 He said the commission was encouraging wave energy companies to seek a new five-year ''pilot license'' the commission has created specifically for wave and tidal energy projects. The license, which could be gained in six months, would let companies set up a short-term wave farm to test technology and demonstrate success to wary investors. If environmental damage became evident, he said, the equipment could be removed from the ocean fairly quickly, something that is far more complicated with dams.
 ''Let's get this stuff in the water and find out what it has to offer,'' Mr. Moeller said. ''Consumers want green power, and this is an option.''

HEADLINE: Ford, in Russia, Hurt by Strike And Rising Pay

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: VSEVOLOZHSK, Russia, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
A strike at the Ford Motor Company assembly line has slowed production and cost the company millions of dollars. Workers walked off the job on Nov. 22 at the Ford plant in this outlying district of St. Petersburg. 
 Following in Ford's footsteps, Toyota and Nissan are building plants in the region, which has become known as Russia's Detroit and is booming along with the car business. 
 The strike at Ford highlights the tightening labor market in Russia, a problem that would have seemed inconceivable a few years ago. Plants are compelled to pay ever higher wages. After two raises at Ford, each about 15 to 20 percent, the union is now demanding an increase of about 40 percent in base pay. 
 A Ford spokeswoman in Russia, Ekaterina P. Kuliko, said the average wage at the Ford plant was 21,500 rubles a month, or about $880. 
 Throughout Russia, a shrinking population, limited worker mobility and rapid economic growth has dried up the pool of available labor. 
 Toyota, which is further along than Nissan in building its plant, is hiring experienced assembly line workers from Ford, according to the union. 
 The Ford factory is in Vsevolozhsk, a town of concrete apartment blocks and parks of snowy pine trees where unemployment has all but vanished.
 Ford points out that its wages are among the highest in the district, where the average salary is 13,000 rubles a month, or about $530. 
 Ms. Kuliko said Ford was ''ready for talks, we are ready for discussion'' but the union demands were excessive.
 In addition to higher wages, the union is asking for shorter night shifts, overtime pay of three times base pay (up from two times) and a formula indexing wages to the cost of living. 
 Ford is ready to guarantee wage increases to match inflation, expected to be 11 percent in 2008, Ms. Kuliko said. 
 Ford management has resumed one of three shifts, using nonunion employees. The plant now produces 100 Ford Focus cars a day, down from 300. The waiting time for a Focus, which retails for about $17,000 and is the best-selling foreign car in Russia, is now three months.

HEADLINE: Slowing Growth in Jobs Seen as Ominous Sign for Economy

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Leonhardt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The nation gained a modest 94,000 jobs in November, the Labor Department reported yesterday, pulling back considerably from the previous month in the clearest sign yet that the American economy was headed for a substantial slowdown.
 But the jobs report, a much-anticipated indicator of the health of the economy, also provided some comfort that the United States had not slipped into a recession and might not be weakening as rapidly as some experts feared. With business leaders expressing uncertainty about the prospects for further growth, analysts said, a better view of the direction of the economy was not likely to emerge until next year.
 ''The expansion is intact, but increasingly frayed,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. The job creation numbers are ''indicative of a very fragile economy that will come undone unless conditions improve soon.''
 The unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent for the third consecutive month, as a survey of households found strong growth in the number of people saying they found new jobs last month. 
 On Wall Street, markets barely moved yesterday, absorbing the jobs data with ambivalence. The employment picture offered assurance that the economy was not plummeting and might continue to expand, sustaining corporate profits. But those very assurances sowed worry that the Federal Reserve would feel less pressure to ease interest rates aggressively when it convened on Tuesday.
 A number of market participants have urged a half-point cut in the Fed's key throttle control over the banking system, currently at 4.5 percent, but a stronger job market may make a quarter-point cut in the federal funds rate more likely.
 Central bankers have signaled that they intend to try to avert a recession with looser credit, but remain wary of fueling inflation with an unnecessarily sharp cut in rates -- particularly in a period of high oil costs and rising food prices.
 ''Financial markets can kiss goodbye any chance of a half-point cut,'' said Ellen Zentner, United States macroeconomist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi in New York. ''The kind of average jobs growth we've been getting, in the neighborhood of 100,000 per month, is like butter to the Fed, which looks to keep job creation going, but not so much so that wage inflation becomes a concern.''
 Average hourly wages among rank-and-file workers -- about four-fifths of the work force -- rose 8 cents, to $17.63 last month, according to the jobs report. But the November wage came against a more pronounced backdrop pointing to a longer-term erosion of spending power for most American workers. 
 While many Americans at the top of the income ladder have done well, wage gains in the current economic expansion have been generally weak. The inflation-adjusted hourly wage for rank-and-file workers has risen by just a penny over the last four years, from $17.62 in November 2003. Over the last year, they have actually fallen.
 ''Workers are still very anxious about their economic security,'' said Andrew Stettner, interim director of the National Employment Law Project in New York.
 The biggest job losses were concentrated in housing, which has been hit hard this year by the collapse of the real estate bubble. But employment in services rose, with business and professional services up a healthy 30,000. Education and health gained jobs and retail payrolls broke a string of three consecutive losses to increase by more than 24,000.
 All the figures are adjusted to take account of seasonal variations and include the Labor Department's best estimate of jobs created by new firms, which makes them subject to potentially large revisions next year. 
 In Tucson, Sue Foust was sifting through options for new jobs yesterday, having been laid off from an AOL software testing site, where she worked for the last decade. Ms. Foust, 41, had been making about $65,000 a year as a software quality assurance engineer, she said. Comparable prospects seemed poor, and she was growing resigned to finding secretarial work.
 ''There's plenty of jobs if you want to make $10 an hour,'' Ms. Foust said. ''I'll probably wind up taking something that pays half of what I used to.''
 A general sense of insecurity continues to gnaw at the economy, with consumer confidence dropping to its lowest level in more than two years, according to a survey released yesterday by the University of Michigan.
 Consumer spending makes up 70 percent of the American economy. Economists worry that a weakening job market will translate into less spending, which could deliver a downward spiral: weaker investment as sales dry up, and less hiring.
 Though yesterday's report eased worries that such a spiral had already begun, it did little to mute concerns about the future. 
 ''It tells you that we're not in a recession now,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs. ''There was a question about that before.''
 The greatest concern continues to revolve around whether the real estate downturn and the subprime mortgage crisis will ripple out to inflict damage on the broader economy. Yesterday's data lent credence to such fears.
 A year ago, the number of American jobs in financial services and construction was holding roughly steady, according to Mr. Zandi. Yet by the middle of this year, those two areas were shedding about 25,000 jobs each month. In October, they lost 50,000 jobs. In November, the number had swelled to 75,000.
 ''These are high-paying jobs that are simply lost as the economy is losing steam,'' said Brian Fabbri, chief economist at BNP Paribas in New York.
 Just this week, another construction supply company, 84 Lumber Company, shut down two stores --one in Redding, Calif., the other in Manchester, Tenn. -- laying off 14 people. The company had already laid off 75 people at its Pennsylvania headquarters, bringing its total work force down to about 9,000, about 200 fewer than a year ago.
 ''Certainly our sales are going to be off from a year ago,'' Jeff Nobers, the company's vice president for marketing, said. ''There's probably a little further drop coming. What we've tried to do is adjust to that now.''
 Though the weak dollar has helped American exports grow, manufacturing jobs continued to shrink in November, down by 11,000.
 Visteon, the auto parts maker, has been shifting work to Mexico. Yesterday, at a factory in Connersville, Ind., 195 workers clocked out for the last time, bringing to about 800 the number of people who have lost their jobs there this year. The last 100 workers are to be eliminated on Dec. 21, as Visteon shuts the plant down for good. 
 Yesterday's jobs number was down markedly from the revised figure of 170,000 jobs created in October. It slightly topped recent expectations, though: Economists had raised their estimates for yesterday's numbers after a separate tally, the ADP National Employment Report, showed an unexpected surge in November payrolls.
 The Labor Department sharply dropped its estimate for job growth in September to 44,000, from an original estimate of 110,000 jobs. That makes September the worst month for job growth since early 2004.
 Over all, the report reinforced a general downward slide in the labor market that has been unfolding for two years. 
 In 2005, the economy generated an average of 212,000 jobs each month. Last year, the pace slowed to 189,000. In the first 11 months of this year, the rate has dropped to 118,000 a month. Yesterday's report nudged the figure down even more.
 The picture becomes clearer after putting aside hiring by the government. The private sector added 64,000 jobs in November. Last year, the private sector was still creating 169,000 jobs a month.
 ''It's the best we could hope for,'' Ms. Zentner said. ''At least the bottom has not dropped out of the labor market.''

HEADLINE: Union-Busting at the Hall of Fame

BYLINE: By FAY VINCENT. 
Fay Vincent was the commissioner of Major League Baseball from 1989 to 1992.

DATELINE: Vero Beach, Fla. 

 BODY:
 THE National Baseball Hall of Fame, itself based on the historical error that baseball was invented in Cooperstown, N.Y., has just let one go right through its legs. On Monday, a committee of 12 baseball executives, newspaper reporters and former executives and players posthumously elected Bowie Kuhn, the earnest but unsuccessful former commissioner, to the Hall while overlooking Marvin Miller, the former union leader who dragged baseball, against strenuous resistance, into the modern age of labor relations. There is simply no way to comprehend this absurd decision by the Veterans Committee. 
 Here are some facts that even this historically challenged committee would have to acknowledge as accurate. Free agency came to baseball during Kuhn's tenure. He fought it with the owners' total support. The concept of baseball players having the same legal rights as the rest of us to bargain with their employers on even terms caused Kuhn to warn that baseball might not survive such a cosmic alteration in the relative power of the two sides. 
 Kuhn's devotion to baseball was genuine, but his judgment was not sound. He was unwilling to seek middle ground with the baseball players' union, despite protracted legal battles that the union repeatedly won, because to have done so might have cost him owner support and even his job. And he loved the job and title. 
 When Andy Messersmith, a pitcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers, sought free agency in 1975, the arbitrator in the case encouraged Kuhn and the owners to settle on the best available terms. Kuhn arrogantly dismissed the suggestion. He took the ridiculous legal position that he and his side would have the arbitrator's decision overturned in federal court. Of course, he was wrong, and free agency has now become an accepted part of baseball. 
 During the era of free agency, baseball has profited beyond all possible expectations, with owners and players making enormous amounts of money. It is not possible to study that history without wondering how much baseball would have prospered in the 1970s and early 1980s had Kuhn provided better leadership at a much earlier stage. 
 The decision by the Hall to overlook Miller is grounded in a bad reading of history. Miller had a bigger impact on baseball than any commissioner, owner or player in the past 40 years. Part of his legacy is a powerful, well-run union. The more important part is the present legal and financial structure of the sport, including free agency, arbitration and the enormous pension and benefit programs for the players, all due largely to his efforts. 
 Miller was much smarter and more talented than Kuhn. Though not a lawyer, he was a public relations genius. He had been an economist with the United Steelworkers when he became the executive director of the players' union. Miller presented the economic issues in baseball largely in moral terms. Kuhn was the lawyer who argued against change. Miller argued against evil. Guess which was more appealing? 
 Kuhn permitted Miller to portray the owners as unenlightened and mean-spirited rich men while casting the players as downtrodden and benighted workers who wanted only to be treated fairly. The owners never had a chance. 
 When Kuhn was pushed out of baseball -- as I was years later -- he went back to his law firm. In 1988, he and another lawyer started a new firm that was expected to be a grandly successful practice. At the end of 1989, Myerson & Kuhn filed for bankruptcy. At this point, Kuhn moved to Florida -- a move that his creditors' lawyers said was made to claim the protection of that state's homestead exemption. 
 Under that law, the home of a debtor may not be used to satisfy debts, and so Kuhn, with a large, valuable and recently purchased Florida residence, was literally home free. In effect, he thumbed his nose at the banks and court in New York, and he left his partners, some of whom he had vigorously recruited, holding a huge empty bag. One such former partner, a tax expert, complained bitterly to me when I was in baseball. He has since died but I wonder how he would have felt about this latest honor by an institution that claims to value character when it considers candidates. 
 The members of the committee that elected Bowie Kuhn and passed on Marvin Miller should feel ashamed. But they do not. They almost surely believe that Miller and the union won the war, but they refuse him the honor of his victory. This is a set of actions by little men making small-minded decisions. Electing Kuhn and Miller together might have been a tolerable result. But electing Kuhn alone is intolerable.
 These are old men trying to turn back time, to reverse what has happened. Theirs is an act of ignorance and bias. I am ashamed for them. I am ashamed that they represent our game.

HEADLINE: Maybe a Way To Get Rich Off the Rich

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
WHEN times get tough, people with an abundance of disposable income are inclined to keep disposing of it while the rest of us are forced to keep our thinner wallets in our pockets. 
 With that in mind, Tobias Levkovich, Citigroup's chief United States equity strategist, has created the Living Large Index, comprising stocks of businesses that cater to affluent consumers. Profits and share prices of luxury-goods makers, higher-end retailers and travel and entertainment companies should hold up even if businesses serving them suffer from difficult economic conditions, he said. 
 His index includes names like American Express, Tiffany, Saks, Nordstrom, Royal Caribbean Cruises, the casino operator Wynn Resorts and Callaway Golf. 
 Mr. Levkovich could have chosen companies with a more exclusive clientele but decided to focus less on the superrich than on modestly well-off people. There are far more members of the second group than the first, making the companies that cater to them a greater piece of the economic and investment pie. ''These are upper-income people, but not people who are buying business jets or Picassos,'' he said. 
 The index is a new creation, but back-testing shows that building a portfolio from its component stocks would have been a far more lucrative long-term strategy than mimicking the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. A $100 investment in Living Large at the end of 1995 would have grown to $1,013 by Oct. 31, compared with $252 for the S.& P. 
 No wonder the logic behind the index wins high marks from investment advisers.
 ''It certainly makes sense conceptually,'' said Charles L. Norton, manager of the Vice fund, which invests in companies like tobacco makers, gambling emporiums and purveyors of alcohol. ''Usually in a recession, people at the lower end of the food chain are hurt most and so those catering to the luxury end tend to be relatively insulated.'' 
 Mr. Norton holds one index constituent, Wynn, the owner of casinos, including one in Macao that has become a popular destination for Asian gamblers. Asia is expected to be a source of tremendous growth for the gambling industry. 
 If catering to well-heeled Americans is profitable, doing the same for wealthy people around the globe may be even more so. As economies develop, the number of rich people soars, and they have the same expensive tastes as Americans do. 
 ''The next big frontier for many of these luxury retailers is emerging countries, where growth is faster and the number of affluent people is growing even faster,'' said Andrew Peck, manager of the Baron Asset fund. ''There are opportunities ahead for them in markets like China and India, where many new millionaires are being created every day.'' 
 He expects Wynn and Tiffany to benefit from those opportunities, along with a retailer not in Mr. Levkovich's index, Polo Ralph Lauren.
 JOHN BUCKINGHAM, chief investment officer of Al Frank Asset Management, recently recommended Nordstrom and Callaway Golf. He cautioned against depending on them and other Living Large stocks to hold their value if weakness persists in the economy and stock market, however. 
 Much of their sales come from so-called aspirational buyers, those who hope to be affluent one day but are not yet in that category. The already affluent can afford cruises and top-name accessories when times are tough; the would-be affluent cannot. 
 He noted that some of the index companies, notably Coach, Tiffany and Nordstrom, have recently reported earnings lower than analysts' estimates, a result of ''aspirational buyers' slowing their purchases.'' 
 Mr. Peck's quibble is with the selection of companies from disparate industries to create an index that purports to track a single phenomenon. Their share prices may be driven by myriad factors other than the appeal of their products and services to affluent consumers, he said. 
 Still, the index ''makes intuitive sense to me, within reason,'' he said. ''As a result of gains on Wall Street and a reduction of the top tax rate, the rich are getting richer. They are going to continue to be able to afford luxuries.''

HEADLINE: Trucks Propel China's Economy, and Foul Its Air

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Every night, columns of hulking blue and red freight trucks invade China's major cities with a reverberating roar of engines and dark clouds of diesel exhaust so thick it dims headlights. 
 By daybreak in this sprawling metropolis in southeastern China, residents near thoroughfares who leave their windows open overnight find their faces stiff with a dark layer of diesel soot. 
 After Mary Leung opens her tiny open-air shop along a major road soon after dawn, she must wipe the soot off her countertops and tables; the tiny yellow-and-olive bird that has kept her company is harder to clean. 
 Trucks are the mules of this country's spectacularly expanding economy -- ubiquitous and essential, yet highly noxious. 
 Trucks here burn diesel fuel contaminated with more than 130 times the pollution-causing sulfur that the United States allows in most diesel. While car sales in China are now growing even faster than truck sales, trucks are by far the largest source of street-level pollution. 
 Tiny particles of sulfur-laden soot penetrate deep into residents' lungs, interfering with the absorption of oxygen. Nitrogen oxides from truck exhaust, which build all night because cities limit truck traffic by day, bind each morning with gasoline fumes from China's growing car fleet to form dense smog that inflames lungs and can cause severe coughing and asthma. 
 The 10 million trucks on Chinese roads, more than a quarter of all vehicles in this country, are a major reason that China accounts for half the world's annual increase in oil consumption. Sating their thirst helped push the price of oil to nearly $100 a barrel this year, before a recent decline, and has propelled China past the United States as the world's largest emitter of global-warming gases. 
 Yet cleaning up truck pollution presents complex problems for China's leaders. 
 For instance, regulators have begun raising emissions standards for new trucks, but have left millions of older ones belching black smoke. Forcing businesses and farmers to buy more expensive vehicles could put a drag on the economy, which already faces inflationary pressure from rising food prices and other costs. 
 That fear of inflation -- not to mention political and social unrest -- has led Beijing to prevent the country's mostly state-owned oil companies from increasing diesel prices at the pump in pace with global oil prices. Raising fuel prices for farmers, whose incomes have lagged behind those of city dwellers and who need diesel for their tractors, is one concern. Lower diesel prices also essentially subsidize every manufacturer in China's elaborate export machine. 
 But price controls create a vicious circle. Oil giants like Sinopec, losing money on every gallon of diesel they refine because of the low sales prices, upgrade refineries slowly, if at all. And they seek out cheap crude, which has high levels of sulfur, to make diesel, negating the effects of higher emissions standards for new vehicles. 
 ''Sinopec is trying our best to purchase low-quality crudes -- much heavier and more sulfur content,'' said Evan Jia, a Sinopec spokesman. ''We buy those kinds of crudes to lower the purchasing cost.'' 
 Low diesel prices frequently make trucks more cost-effective than trains, which pollute less. Sales of large freight trucks in China outpace those in the United States by a wide margin. Demand for diesel at service stations is so great, and supplies are so tight, that rationing and shortages have become common. Truck drivers idle for hours only to be allowed to buy as little as five gallons of fuel. 
 Since 2000, sales of heavy-duty trucks have risen sixfold while car sales have risen eightfold. This has created myriad problems, from gridlock that chokes China's cities to pollution that chokes its citizens, contributing each year to hundreds of thousands of premature deaths from heart and lung problems, according to the World Bank. 
 Working in the Fumes
 Ms. Leung, the shopkeeper, is a slender, tidy, 44-year-old woman with a cheery disposition. She used to keep her little bird in a wooden cage over the entrance to the two battered plastic tables where she serves soft drinks and fresh waffles for less than 40 cents each. 
 All day, trucks, buses and cars grind past. While large trucks are banned in Guangzhou from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m., some obtain special permits for daytime access. And many medium-size trucks with diesel engines are allowed in the city during the day if they carry local license plates. 
 ''We had to put out bowls of water in the cage,'' Ms. Leung said, so the bird could constantly wash itself. She finally moved the bird, a Pekin robin, to her home on a quieter street. 
 She tries not to think about what the exhaust fumes are doing to her own health. 
 ''My throat hurts all the time,'' she said. ''I suck on throat lozenges for it. It's unbearable.'' 
 International experts say that hundreds of millions of Chinese are exposed every day to the potentially lethal mix of soot particles and smog. 
 American regulators have labeled diesel soot a likely carcinogen. A growing body of academic literature blames tiny airborne particles from diesel exhaust, coal-fired power plants and other sources for up to 90 percent of all deaths from outdoor air pollution, because the particles penetrate so deeply into lungs. Diesel engines also emit large quantities of nitrogen oxides, which react with gasoline fumes to produce photochemical smog when hit by sunlight. 
 Mainland Chinese atmospheric scientists concluded in an analysis this year in The Journal of Environmental Sciences that, here in Guangzhou, particles were the pollutant farthest out of line with air-quality norms 226 days a year. Sulfur dioxide, which comes mainly from burning coal, was the pollutant that exceeded norms by the widest margin 45 days a year, while nitrogen oxides were the most prominent pollutant 23 days a year. 
 The air was relatively clean on the remaining 71 days a year. 
 New tests by Chinese and American researchers in Tianjin, in northeastern China, found that diesel engines in trucks and buses accounted for 93 percent of all nitrogen oxides from vehicles in China and 97 percent of particles. 
 A separate academic study of diesel exhaust here in Guangzhou found that Chinese trucks put out particles in unusually large quantities and sizes, as engines with often inadequate or damaged emissions equipment were forced to pull overweight loads. 
 Ms. Leung said she had little choice but to stick it out. 
 She and her husband had a shop on a less-busy street, but the building was torn down and the local government gave her the current lease as a substitute. They are not allowed to sell the lease or apply for a different one, and the shop is their sole means of support for two daughters, the elder one the first in the family to go to college. 
 The only option, Ms. Leung said, is to hope that her building will be condemned so the city will issue her a lease in a more healthful location. ''I'm dreaming of it,'' she said. 
 Poor Fuel in Dirty Trucks
 In nearby Shenzhen, Chan Kin-fun also faces economic realities. 
 A salesman shows Mr. Chan, the operations manager of a Hong Kong trucking company, around the towering tractor cabs at a Sinotruk dealership. Even the most modern cabs have engines that emit at least three times the levels of nitrogen oxides of new American trucks and at least seven times the particles -- even with clean, low-sulfur diesel. 
 Building a truck that meets top emissions standards is not just a question of spending a little extra on pollution-control equipment. It usually requires radical engine redesigns, which can add thousands of dollars to the price. 
 A truck meeting the European Union's existing Euro 4 pollution standard, which Beijing's municipal government will adopt in January, would have to be ordered specially from the factory, the salesman said. And it would cost $35,000, compared with $27,000 for a truck meeting the more lenient Euro 3 standard now in effect for Guangzhou and Shenzhen. 
 Trucks conforming to the Euro 2 standard, still legally sold in much of China, would cost only $23,000, and a ''special fee'' of $950, the Sinotruk salesman said, to conceal the truck's origin in an area where only Euro 3 trucks are supposed to be sold. 
 But none of this helps Mr. Chan. Hong Kong already requires him to buy Euro 4 trucks, and this puts him at a disadvantage against mainland trucking companies that use cheaper vehicles. 
 ''I don't know how much longer I'll be able to stay in business,'' he said. 
 One reason China has severe air pollution is that officials have been slow to impose that extra cost. Trucks in the United States, which has the stiffest diesel emissions standards in the world, typically cost at least twice as much as a Euro 3 truck of similar power in China, partly because of higher labor costs, but also because their engines emit less pollution. 
 The Chinese government has lagged about eight years behind the European Union in imposing new emissions standards. Only as air pollution has started to become a national issue has China begun to accelerate the pace; Euro 4 standards will take effect nationwide in 2010, five years after they took effect in the European Union. 
 But the opportunities for further improvements in emissions per vehicle are limited by poor fuel quality. 
 The United States allows maximum sulfur concentrations of just 15 parts per million for most diesel fuels, while China allows up to 2,000 parts per million. The average sulfur in American gasoline is limited to 30 parts per million; China allows up to 800 parts per million. 
 Sulfur clogs emissions control equipment, and the more advanced the equipment, the more vulnerable it is to sulfur damage. And China lacks an effective inspection system to enforce even its more lenient standards. 
 The cleaner fuel available in cities like Guangzhou and Beijing helps limit car pollution. But truck drivers tend to fill up in rural areas with less expensive high-sulfur fuel. 
 Western refineries pay extra for low-sulfur crude because removing sulfur is difficult. But in a bid to control inflation, the Chinese government orders service stations to sell gasoline and diesel at prices so low that they frequently fall below refiners' costs. 
 That gives refiners like Sinopec a strong incentive to buy the cheapest possible crude. Mr. Jia, the spokesman, said the company then refined the crude to meet China's standards. Low diesel prices also leave oil company refinery divisions with little money to invest in modernization. 
 The Chinese government raised regulated prices of gasoline and diesel by nearly 10 percent on Nov. 1, to the yuan equivalent of $2.65 a gallon. But that still roughly equals the wholesale price of diesel on international markets and is slightly higher than the wholesale price of gasoline, leaving nothing to cover the cost of distributing fuel to service stations, not to mention profit. 
 So refineries and service stations have been cutting back on sales, to the dismay of truckers. 
 Behind Wheel, a Hard Life
 After four years of coping with diesel shortages every few months, Zhang Yanchao, a 33-year-old trucker, thought he had become inured to lining up for fuel. But that was before he waited 10 hours on a recent night outside Guangzhou and was then allowed to buy just a quarter-tank of diesel. 
 ''It's the worst I've ever seen,'' he said. ''I couldn't get any sleep since I had to keep moving forward in the line of trucks all night long.'' 
 Two dozen truckers said in interviews here in Guangzhou and in Shenzhen that fuel shortages had become chronic. The shortages also contribute to air pollution, with trucks idling for hours as they wait in line. 
 Rapid highway construction has reduced travel time in much of China. A half-dozen truckers who regularly drive from Shandong province, 1,000 miles northeast of Guangzhou, said that what had been a three-day trip five years ago took only two days this past summer, thanks to the new expressways. But they said long waits for fuel had since lengthened the trip to four days. 
 The journeys are tough on drivers' health, as they breathe the exhaust of the trucks ahead of them. 
 ''When a truck driver is not eating rice, he's eating diesel,'' said Mr. Zhang over a dinner of rice and vegetables at a grimy cafe here as his brakes were repaired. 
 Wearing blue jeans and a dark pullover and chain-smoking cigarettes, like many of the truck drivers here, Mr. Zhang was frank about both the problems truckers face and the problems their vehicles create. 
 Overweight trucks damage roads and emit extra pollution. But Mr. Zhang said he frequently exceeded weight limits on his blue five-month-old Chunlan truck. 
 ''But of course I put more on it,'' he said. ''Otherwise, how could I make a living?'' With his pay based on how much cargo he hauls, he estimated that he typically carried two to three times his truck's legal limit. 
 Time on the road is hard on relationships, too. Mr. Zhang has a wife and a year-old daughter. But he takes another woman with him on many of his trips as a second ''wife,'' he said, insisting that his legal wife accepted the arrangement. 
 He acknowledged that the diesel exhaust was probably not good for him, and said many truck drivers developed coughs. ''Coughing comes with old age, but driving a truck makes it worse,'' he said. ''But coughing can come from these cigarettes as well.'' 
 Oil industry experts suggest that China should raise diesel prices by at least 20 percent to eliminate subsidies and fuel lines and to foster refinery investment. Mr. Zhang, who pays the equivalent of $680 a month on his truck loan, vehemently opposes an increase in diesel prices; he is convinced that he would not be able to pass on the extra cost to the manufacturers who hire him. 
 ''That would be too much for me,'' he said. ''I would be put out of business. I might as well stay home.'' 
 One response to China's truck-pollution problem would be to ban older trucks. But the government has resisted such a radical step, fearing the costs not just to the economy, but to the truckers and to members of their extended families, who typically pool their savings to finance a truck. 
 Another obstacle to change may be the lack of public criticism of truck pollution. While environmental groups are rapidly multiplying in China, vehicle pollution has attracted little attention -- and much resignation among truckers and residents alike. 
 Mr. Zhang typified that reaction when he said, surveying the dingy truck stop, ''If you don't like pollution, go live in the mountains.''

HEADLINE: Bonds Pleads Not Guilty to Federal Charges

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON; Carol Pogash contributed reporting.

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
Barry Bonds, baseball's home run king and the most prominent target of a five-year federal investigation into performance-enhancing drugs in sports, stood in a hushed federal courtroom Friday morning with his hands clasped behind his back and pleaded not guilty to five felony charges of perjury and obstruction of justice.
 Flanked by a team of six lawyers and accompanied by his wife, Liz, he simply nodded when United States Magistrate Judge Maria-Elena James asked if he understood his rights as a criminal defendant. 
 Later, he said ''I do'' when United States District Judge Susan Illston asked if he understood the terms of his release. He is not required to put up any money now but will have to forfeit $500,000 if he violates the judge's instructions. 
 Cheers and shouts of ''We love you, Barry!'' from a small crowd of supporters greeted Bonds after the hearing as he was leaving the federal courthouse. The supporters were far outnumbered by a news media pack that was reminiscent of the criminal trials of Michael Jackson and O. J. Simpson.
 Bonds was processed -- fingerprinted and photographed, front and side -- by the United States Marshals Service on Thursday. The entire proceeding Friday before two judges, sharing a courtroom for the news media's convenience, took less than 20 minutes. Bonds said only seven words, including his name, age (43), ''I do'' and twice ''Yes.''
 His new lead criminal defense lawyer, Allen Ruby, said Bonds would plead not guilty to all the charges and would likely file a motion to dismiss the indictment. 
 After court, Ruby said: ''Today, Barry Bonds is innocent. He has trust and faith in the justice system. He will defend these charges. He is confident of a good outcome.''
 Michael L. Rains, Bonds's criminal defense lawyer since 2003, who is now ceding the lead role to Ruby, said Bonds's demeanor was ''matter-of-fact'' in getting ready to face the indictment. ''He's looking forward to the court proceedings and to being vindicated,'' Rains said outside the courtroom.
 The court date was Bonds's first public appearance since criminal charges were filed three weeks ago. The Nov. 15 indictment, which cites 19 times that Bonds lied under oath, came four years after he gave sworn testimony to a grand jury in which he denied he used performance-enhancing drugs during the greatest home run spree in baseball history. He told the grand jury he thought he was taking flaxseed oil.
 The government's lead investigator on the five-year Bay Area Laboratory Cooperative case, the Internal Revenue Service special agent Jeff Novitzky, sat erect in the front of the courtroom watching Bonds.
 Bonds appeared in a wood-paneled courtroom on the 19th floor of the Philip Burton Federal Building and United States Court House, two floors above the grand jury room where he had testified for three hours on Dec. 4, 2003. 
 If convicted, Bonds faces a penalty of up to 30 months in prison under federal sentencing guidelines for first-time offenders. Bonds is the biggest name facing charges in the five-year Balco investigation. Six people have pleaded guilty so far, including the Balco president and vice president, Bonds's trainer, and a lawyer who leaked transcripts of Bonds's and other athletes' grand jury testimony.
 The defense -- newly hired top-tier lawyers -- won the first argument in the case. While the assistant United States Attorney Matthew A. Parrella sought to limit Bonds's travel to within the United States, Ruby asked that he be allowed to go anywhere in North America to pursue his baseball career because Toronto has a major league team. A free agent who was not re-signed by the San Francisco Giants after the 2007 season, Bonds is unemployed and hoping to sign with another team. Judge Illston ruled in Bonds's favor. But he must still petition for permission to travel outside North America.
 Judge Illston, who has presided over all the Balco cases, set Feb. 7 as the date for the next hearing and said Bonds did not need to attend. No trial date has been set. Bonds's lawyers want time for what promises to be a series of preliminary motions to try to keep the case from ever going to a jury.
 The judge asked Bonds if he understood he was waiving his right to a speedy trial within 70 days. ''Yes,'' he replied.
 Prosecutors will begin sharing all their evidence in the case with the defense next week, Parrella said in court. That will provide Bonds and his team with their first look at the evidence against him, which is expected to center on a privately administered positive steroid test from 2000 that the government says it has connected to Bonds. The grand jury testimony of his former longtime girlfriend, Kimberly Bell; his former best friend and business partner, Steve Hoskins; and other professional baseball players is also expected to be key to the government's case.
 Ruby told the judge that he may file a motion to dismiss the indictment for ''facial defects,'' but did not elaborate.
 Peter Keane, a professor and dean emeritus at Golden Gate University School of Law, said such a motion would argue that the indictment was defective or insufficient in stating a crime. But Keane, a 30-year veteran defense lawyer who has followed the case closely, said he did not see any obvious problems with the indictment.
 Keane said Bonds's new defense team was ''very effective, very skilled, very talented.''
 The Bonds team is led by Ruby, a former wrestler who is as big as Bonds and uses his Stanford law training to good effect in federal court. The team also includes Cristina C. Arguedas, another aggressive veteran in the top tier of Bay Area defense lawyers, and Dennis Riordan, a motion-writing and appellate specialist. Paula Canny, a lawyer and friend of Greg Anderson, Bonds's trainer, who has refused to testify against him, said the new lawyers were a brilliant team that will work together well. ''If you could turn the Yankees into lawyers or the lawyers into Yankees, I'd take Bonds's dream team over the Yankees' starting lineup,'' Canny said in an interview. ''Even with A-Rod.''
 Bonds repeatedly came up from his Beverly Hills home to conduct a methodical search for his legal team, interviewing numerous lawyers, and he plans to be active in the defense, according to a person with knowledge of that search who spoke on condition of not being identified. Bonds did not like how much another prominent defense lawyer, John Keker, was going to charge him, the person said. He was also concerned with how little control he would have in the defense with Keker on the case as well as with Keker's aversion to working with Rains, and so turned to other candidates, the person said.
 As a small crowd applauded Bonds in the lobby of the courthouse, an older woman who identified herself as his Aunt Rosie hugged him and offered him $5 toward his hefty bond. Bonds laughed. One man offered a baseball that Bonds declined to autograph. Bonds and his wife were driven away in a black S.U.V.
 Bonds hit a single-season record 73 home runs for the Giants in 2001. Federal prosecutors say they have documentary evidence that a private test Bonds took a year earlier was positive for performance-enhancing drugs. 
 The 10-page federal indictment lists 19 answers Bonds gave the grand jury that prosecutors say were knowingly false on material questions, which is the standard for perjury. Material questions were those relating to illegal drug distribution, which was the subject the grand jury was investigating. The questions covered steroid use in 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the use of human growth hormone at unspecified dates.

HEADLINE: Gold's Quirk: It's Volatile, but Holders Feel Secure

BYLINE: By JANE BIRNBAUM

 BODY:
On Nov. 7, the market price of a troy ounce of gold bullion briefly touched $845.50, the top so far in gold's current eight-year bull market and a 28-year high in New York trading. The news made headlines and became a hot topic on radio talk shows. 
 At Lexington Coin, a shop in affluent Lexington, Mass., the number of customers seeking to do business in gold coins spiked, the owner, Eric Carlson, said. Some customers were there to lock in profits, selling bullion coins containing an ounce of gold that they had bought five years earlier when gold traded under $350. Some were selling just one coin, telling Mr. Carlson they needed money to pay property taxes or car repair bills. 
 And some were buying, saying that they thought gold's price would continue to climb. ''The ones purchasing 10 coins at a time told me they were taking the money out of stocks and bank accounts,'' Mr. Carlson said. ''A woman buying three American Eagles told me she was buying them as a hedge against the price of her home heating oil shooting up this winter.'' 
 Gold has a long history of waxing and waning in allure. At the moment, it holds a particular attraction, given Americans' worries about inflation, the risks in the financial market and the falling value of the dollar. 
 ''People understand gold's intrinsic value,'' said Katherine M. Porter, an associate professor of law and a bankruptcy specialist at the University of Iowa. ''But because it's beautiful and they can hold it in their hands, they may not perceive how volatile, like all traded commodities, gold is.'' 
 It closed yesterday at $800.20, down $6.90.
 Trading and owning gold have never been easier, thanks to the Internet. 
 ''There's been a democratization of gold ownership and new ways to acquire it,'' said Jon Nadler, a senior analyst for Kitco Inc., a bullion dealer based in Montreal. (Kitco makes money when consumers buy or sell gold, and the profit of its scrap operation is tied to the price of gold.) 
 ''While gold coins or bars remain popular, investors no longer have to worry about storing their gold when they can buy gold certificates or digital ounces,'' Mr. Nadler said. ''And with exchange-traded funds, the metal can be traded much like shares of stock.''
 Gold investors tend to buy on bad financial news. Rich Checkan, vice president of Asset Strategies International Inc., a precious metals and currency broker in Rockville, Md., said purchases at his company started picking up substantially after the subprime mortgage turmoil began in August. Most of his buyers were acquiring Perth Mint Certificates entitling them to gold held in a government-owned vault in Australia. 
 James K. Galbraith, an economist and public policy professor at the University of Texas, however, cautioned that investors who are considering a gold purchase now, either to hold or trade, should ''be prepared to take a bath.'' They should know, he said, what happened to those who waited in long lines outside shops on Jan. 21, 1980, eager to pay more than $900 apiece for coins containing an ounce of gold. 
 While gold is a hot commodity now, the demand by average investors is still far from what it was then. That was the top of the previous gold bull market, which had begun in January 1975, after President Gerald R. Ford signed a bill legalizing private ownership of gold coins, bars and certificates.
 Gold ownership had been illegal since 1933, when, to forestall Americans from demanding that banks give them gold for their dollars, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order prohibiting it. (In the early 1970s, President Richard M. Nixon severed the last remaining links of the so-called gold standard that had made currency redeemable for actual gold.)
 The early gold buyers in 1975 included Kenneth J. Gerbino, 62, who now manages private accounts and a hedge fund of gold mining stocks and who profits when buyers push up gold's price. 
 ''I could see that when the federal government prints money to pay its bills, inflation always results, and buying gold was the best way to keep up with it,'' recalled Mr. Gerbino, whose business is based in Beverly Hills, Calif. ''I'd go to a coin shop, give a guy $1,000 and get some coins.'' 
 Gold started climbing strongly in 1978. In January 1980, with inflation nearly 14 percent, average investors afflicted by gold fever jumped into the market. So did experienced sellers like Anthony Calcagno, who was dealing rare coins in San Francisco. Less than six months earlier, he had purchased many South African Krugerrands for around $300 apiece. 
 On Jan. 17, the so-called second London fix -- the price of gold that the London market, the world's largest for physical gold, establishes each afternoon as the New York market opens -- was $750. The next day, it was $830.
 ''It was wild on the 18th, buyers and sellers all coming in, bulls and bears battling it out,'' recalled Mr. Calcagno, who today deals the card game 21 in a casino in Reno, Nev. ''Most dealers were not paying even near spot, so I felt lucky selling for around $800 a coin.'' 
 Mr. Gerbino, however, sat tight. ''I wasn't into trading,'' he said. ''When you buy gold as an insurance policy against inflation and currency devaluation, you don't sell unless you have to.'' 
 On Jan. 21, gold hit a historic $850 and buyers lined up outside shops in the cold, frantic for coins and bars. Then suddenly, the herd turned. The next day, sellers suddenly outnumbered buyers and gold tumbled to $737.50 an ounce. It continued falling and then traded sideways from $300 to $400 for nearly two decades. 
 When gold bottomed at about $250 in the summer of 1999, seasoned investors made their first forays back into buying. Robert Moriarty -- who describes himself as ''probably on the very fringe'' of gold aficionados and owns a precious metals Web site partly sponsored by gold mining companies -- was tipped to a Sotheby's London auction of Middle Eastern commemorative gold bullion coins. 
 ''They were selling below spot,'' recalled Mr. Moriarty, 61, who lives in the Cayman Islands. ''They were so cheap I couldn't afford not to buy them.'' 
 Other buyers agreed, and the current gold bull market commenced, this time with the Internet giving average investors constant access to 24-hour global gold prices. 
 Thomas Trottier, a glass artist who lives in Hawaii, had lost $20,000 day-trading stocks when he decided to trade gold four years ago. Using Kitco.com, Mr. Trottier first ordered delivery of gold bars. After selling those to buy Perth Mint Certificates, he discovered trading digital ounces of gold online through Kitco's pool account. 
 ''Trading gold I've doubled my money,'' said Mr. Trottier, 54. Declining to specify gains, he disclosed he had taken some profits to buy California rental property. 
 Alongside virtual gold ownership, physical gold remains popular. Jeffrey Osborn, 48, a retired computer entrepreneur and private investor who lives in Maine and Florida, has about 5 percent of his liquid assets in American Eagles purchased in 1997. Mr. Osborn keeps the coins in the vault of a ''very large bank's branch,'' which he occasionally visits ''to hold them.''
 ''When I tell people to buy American Eagles, they're usually skeptical and tell me about some midcap stock their broker suggested,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''But I question holding assets denominated in a depreciating dollar. For now, I am not selling my coins. They are a good hedge against the unforeseen.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Suburbs Fear a Drop in Special Education Aid

BYLINE: By WINNIE HU and DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New Jersey's support of special education in the public schools has been so generous that parents from all over the country have moved to the state to take advantage of the programs and services it offers. 
 But a new school financing formula being proposed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine may vastly reshape the way the state divides the nearly $1 billion a year it allocates for special education, directing a larger share of the money to special education students in poor districts.
 The move to a so-called wealth-equalized formula would have a far-reaching effect on school budgets in the state's 615 districts at a time when increases in special education enrollments are outpacing total enrollment growth in many districts. Under the current system, the state provides a fixed amount of money per student regardless of where the student lives: an autistic child in Princeton, for example, receives the same aid as a child with autism in Camden.
 At one time, most states used this sort of financial need-blind approach. But since the early 1970s, a growing number of states, including New York, Connecticut and Maryland, have factored the wealth of a school district into the equation, as part of a larger effort to redistribute resources more equitably among students, according to school financing experts. 
 ''We have the highest expenditure of any state in the nation with regard to special education,'' Mr. Corzine said on Friday at a news conference. ''We had it in the world we live in today, and we will have it in the world we live in tomorrow, when there's a new formulation, and in fact, there will probably be additional funding going to special education.''
 The new approach for special education financing has won support among some legislators who represent poor districts, but it is drawing fierce opposition from school officials and parents in wealthier suburban districts who say that they fear receiving a dwindling share of state aid even as their costs are rising. Lynne Strickland, executive director of the Garden State Coalition of Schools, an advocacy group that represents primarily suburban districts, said that as many as 200 districts could be penalized under a wealth-equalized approach.
 ''There's really a lot of angst about it,'' Ms. Strickland said, adding that many of these districts have not seen an increase in state aid since 2001. ''This is a very stressful thing to impose on communities that have already been taxed to the nth degree and feel at the end of their rope.''
 The New Jersey School Boards Association, which represents 601 school boards across the state, and advocacy groups like the Statewide Parent Advocacy Network, have also opposed the move to a wealth-based formula for special education aid. 
 ''We feel that learning disabilities do not know economic boundaries,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the school boards association. ''All school districts are already paying far more than they should for special education, and this would only foist more of the cost on some of them.''
 Mr. Corzine is expected to officially unveil his new school financing formula next week, with district-by-district breakdowns of state aid. Until then, it remains unclear how many of them stand to gain, or lose, with the proposed change. For the first two years at least, no district would receive less state aid than it does now even if it were to fare worse under the new formula, say legislators and advocacy groups who have been briefed on the proposal.
 Mr. Corzine would increase total state education aid by $400 million to $500 million in next year's budget, most of which would go to poor students who live outside the 31 so-called Abbott districts in historically poor cities including Newark, Asbury Park and Camden, which critics say have received a disproportionate share of state aid. The new formula would apportion money to schools based on the characteristics of its students, including income and language ability.
 While special education aid is just one component of the larger financing plan, it has attracted intense scrutiny because it directly affects middle-class and upper-income districts that have too few poor students to benefit from any changes to the Abbott system. In Glen Ridge, where total state aid makes up 4.5 percent of the $23.8 million school budget, the superintendent, Dan Fishbein, pointed out that the district had already had to shift money from regular education programs to cover the increasing cost of special education. He said the new formula could create divisions between parents who have special education students and those who do not.
 ''I am disappointed,'' Mr. Fishbein said. ''I thought all children would see something in the new funding formula. Every district has its pressures. Our community is unique because we're mostly residential and our taxpayers bear the vast majority of the cost of educating those students.''
 Within the broader move to a wealth-based formula for special education aid, Mr. Corzine's plan calls for using what is known as a census-based approach to determine special education costs in a district. Under the current system, state aid is based on a four-tiered cost structure, in which special education students receive varying levels of fixed aid depending on their disabilities. Some critics have said this does not accurately reflect the actual cost of providing services to them.
 Under Mr. Corzine's plan, the state would pay a single average cost per student, based on total statewide spending on special education. 
 Mr. Corzine's plan would also increase overall special education aid for students with the most severe disabilities, or ''extraordinary need.'' At the same time, districts that send special education students away to receive services would receive partial reimbursement from the state only after they spent $55,000 for out-of-district instruction. Under the current system, districts are reimbursed after spending $40,000.
 Supporters of this approach contend that it would reduce the cost of special education by discouraging school officials and parents from misusing the system, steering students to special education just to increase numbers and qualify for more state aid. Still, John Myers, a consultant who specializes in school financing issues, said that a potential problem with using a statewide average is that it may shortchange districts with a disproportionately large number of special education students.
 Many school officials have also disputed the suggestion that special education numbers are inflated to secure more state aid. Jan A. Furman, superintendent of the Northern Valley Regional district in Bergen County, which operates an autism program for 130 elementary students from 22 towns, said that school districts spend far more on special education -- as much as $100,000 a year for a single student -- than they ever receive in state aid. 
 ''There's no incentive to classify students for money,'' she said.
 In the West Windsor-Plainsboro schools, in Mercer County, the cost of special education has grown to $20 million a year, in a $147 million budget. The district receives just $1.5 million annually in special education aid, and must cover the rest through local property taxes, said Thomas Smith, an assistant superintendent. 
 ''No district can afford to lose money with all the increases we're looking at,'' he said.
 Suzanne Mack, a member of the Jersey City board of education who has a child with special needs, said she thought that the proposal for special education sounded promising, but ''it's too early to tell how it will definitively impact us.'' She did, say, however, that she was concerned about the idea of eliminating the current process by which students are classified as disabled.
 State Senator Stephen M. Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester County who was recently selected as majority leader, also said that he was encouraged by the concept underpinning the new formula for special education. 
 ''The concept sounds good, but first, we've got to see the numbers,'' said Senator Sweeney, who said that he entered politics because of his daughter, Lauren, who has Down syndrome. 
 He said that he thought that wealthy districts would not be affected. 
 ''I don't think they're going to hurt the wealthy districts at all, because the wealthy districts are basically funding themselves,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Democracy Is Alive and Well in Venezuela

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''Venezuela Vote Sets Roadblocks on Chavez Path'' (front page, Dec. 4) has it right: ''the results showed that Venezuela's institutions remained durable, for now, even in the gale-force winds of an overwrought political environment.'' 
 During a trip to Venezuela early this year with Witness for Peace, the most surprising thing I observed was the newly found sense of political empowerment and ''ownership'' felt by the ''Chavistas.'' I will never forget a conversation with an acquaintance in Maracaibo who is both an evangelical Christian and a supporter of Hugo Chavez. 
 When I asked if it worried him that Mr. Chavez was gathering too much power into his own hands, he quickly said no. I asked why not, and heard him reply: ''If Chavez does not do the right thing, we will get rid of him. We Venezuelans know what we are defending.'' 
 Although the social classes of Venezuela are strongly divided in their political views, there are many signs that the spirit of democracy there is alive and well. I came home feeling that the only thing likely to destroy it is too much meddling by the United States.
 Tom F. Driver New York, Dec. 4, 2007
 The writer is professor emeritus of theology and culture at Union Theological Seminary.
 To the Editor:
 President Bush has turned promoting democracy in other countries into a mantra. So it seems especially ironic that two national leaders in whom he's invested much trust -- and even friendship, to hear him talk -- are Pervez Musharraf in Pakistan and Vladimir V. Putin in Russia. 
 Both have recently rammed through national election victories that are anything but democratic. 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Bush dismisses Hugo Chavez as a tyrant, yet the Venezuelan president readily cedes defeat in a democratic election.
 Isn't there a lesson for Mr. Bush -- as well as the American people -- somewhere in this? 
 Christopher Cook Prague, Dec. 3, 2007
 To the Editor:
 The key words in Roger Cohen's Dec. 3 column are ''decades of neglect of Venezuela's poor by ruling elites.''
 Only when the ruling elite learns that it can best thrive when everyone thrives and when the alleged power of laissez-faire capitalism to benefit all classes comes true will demagogues like Hugo Chavez find themselves unemployed.

BUYER TO CLOSE COMPUSA CompUSA, the consumer-electronics retailer owned by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said it was acquired by the restructuring firm Gordon Brothers Group, which plans to close or sell its 103 stores.
 CompUSA stores will remain open during the holiday season, the company, based in Dallas, said. Financial terms were not disclosed. ''An orderly and expedited wind-down and asset sale process is the best option for CompUSA and its creditors at this juncture,'' Bill Weinstein, principal at Gordon Brothers, said. Mr. Weinstein will serve as interim president of CompUSA, which was founded in 1984. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 OFFER FOR NORTHERN ROCK The British investment group Olivant outlined details of its rescue offer for the mortgage lender Northern Rock as the American investment firm J. C. Flowers reportedly pulled out of the bidding process. 
 The offer from Olivant, which includes immediately repaying up to $:15 billion ($30.5 billion) of the government funds propping up Northern Rock, could be a strong contender to the current preferred bid from Richard Branson's Virgin Group. (AP)
 ANALYSTS CUT CREDIT FIRMS
 A Merrill Lynch analyst, Kenneth Bruce, cut American Express, Capital One Financial and Discover Financial Services to sell from neutral, predicting a deterioration in consumer spending. 
 An analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Company, Christopher Brendler, downgraded American Express to hold from buy, saying he expected the housing recession to cause significantly higher loan losses for credit card lenders. American Express and Capital One fell more than 3 percent in New York trading. (BLOOMBERG NEWS)
 SPECIAL PAYOUT AT UAL The UAL Corporation, parent of United Airlines, said it would pay shareholders $250 million, or $2.15 a share, in a special distribution. The payout will be made on Jan. 23 to shareholders as of Jan. 9, UAL said.
 American carriers are under pressure from investors to bolster stock values. UAL's stock has dropped 14 percent since late October. United has said it wants to merge with another carrier, and is considering selling assets like its maintenance operation and frequent-flier plan. (BLOOMBERG NEWS) BIGGER BEAR STEARNS STAKE Joseph Lewis, a billionaire investor who bought 7 percent of the investment bank Bear Stearns three months ago, has increased his stake to 8 percent, according to a regulatory filing.
 According to the new filing, he owned 9.25 million shares of Bear Stearns as of Dec. 5. Mr. Lewis's stake now exceeds that of the bank's chairman and chief executive, James E. Cayne, above, who holds about 5.8 percent. (REUTERS) 
 VENTURES IN CHINACredit Suisse has signed a memorandum of understanding to establish a strategic relationship with Founder Securities of China. The venture, which is subject to regulatory approval, expects to underwrite domestic initial public offerings of shares by local Chinese firms and to offer corporate advisory and research services. Morgan Stanley also has reportedly signed an agreement to set up an investment banking venture with China Fortune Securities of Shanghai. (REUTERS)
 PLEA IN INSIDE-TRADING CASE Juan Renteria, a former worker at a Wisconsin plant that printed BusinessWeek magazine, pleaded guilty for his role in an insider trading scheme that netted more than $6.7 million. 
 Mr. Renteria, 22, was accused of stealing advance copies of the magazine and passing on names of stocks mentioned in its ''Inside Wall Street'' column to two former Goldman Sachs employees, Eugene Plotkin and David Pajcin, who authorities said led the scheme. (REUTERS)
 CREDIT CARD SETTLEMENT Some 30 million people across the nation are receiving notices that they may be eligible for $25 or more from the settlement of a class-action suit over foreign currency conversions on credit and debit cards.
 The case claimed that card companies overcharged when converting foreign transactions into dollars and did not disclose all fees. People who held cards branded by Visa, MasterCard or Diners Club and issued by major American banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup, are part of the class. A $336 million settlement in the case, which had been brought in 2001, was announced in July 2006 and affirmed by a court in November 2006. (AP)

HEADLINE: Electric Glide: Passing Pumps On a Scooter

BYLINE: By DEXTER FORD

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 I WAS riding down Sepulveda Boulevard in Los Angeles, watching wallowing S.U.V.'s recede in my mirrors. An ARCO station loomed over the windscreen. Unleaded regular, just $3.09 a gallon?
 I had flicked the blinker on and was banking toward the pumps when it hit me. 
 Gasoline? I don't need no stinking gasoline. 
 I was riding a Vectrix, a slick Futurama-spec scooter powered by a 20-kilowatt (26.8 horsepower) direct-current motor. Instead of gasoline, ethanol, hydrogen or plutonium, it was motivated by squeaky-clean electrons racing between the poles of its 3.7-kilowatt-hour nickel-metal-hydride battery pack. 
 The Vectrix scooter is similar in design to gasoline-powered maxi scooters by Honda, Suzuki, Piaggio and others -- practical, economical, motorcycle-size transpo-pods that are far more popular in Europe and Asia than in S.U.V.-besotted America. But instead of a conventional maxi's 250 cc-to-400 cc gas engine, the Vectrix's brushless electric motor gets the job done using stockpiled household current.
 The Vectrix is designed to accommodate riders with little motorcycle or scooter experience, though in most states it will require a motorcycle license. (Newbies would be well advised to first learn defensive riding through the Motorcycle Safety Foundation RiderCourse, available at www.msf-usa.org.) 
 Riding the Vectrix is like nothing else. The twistgrip control works like a motorcycle throttle -- rotate the top of the grip rearward for more power. But unlike a motorcycle, the twistgrip also acts as a brake: rolling the top of the grip forward engages regenerative braking, recharging the battery as the scooter slows.
 There are excellent, motorcycle-spec Brembo disc brakes, front and rear, which can be used to stop even faster. But for most riding, the energy-efficient regen braking is more than sufficient. 
 The innovative twistgrip has yet another trick: from a standstill, twisting the grip forward activates reverse, helping the rider (slowly) back out of a tight parking space. 
 The Vectrix motor, combined in the rear hub with a single-speed planetary gearset, spins the rear wheel in a smooth, silent surge of power. The machine is anything but slow: its instantly available torque builds speed quickly, easily staying with lead-footed car drivers from stoplight to stoplight. 
 Top speed is 62 miles an hour, which is dictated more by decreasing range at higher speeds than by limited power. On a rush-hour freeway run from Hollywood to Manhattan Beach, the Vectrix easily kept pace with 90 percent of auto traffic. Its steering is precise and its handling inspires confidence, thanks to a rigid aluminum chassis, low center of mass and motorcycle-style suspension and tires.
 The only significant limitation is range. Vectrix claims 40 to 60 miles in average driving conditions. With this throttle-happy test rider on board, a 40-mile loop at routine speeds depleted the battery pack completely. And that rush-hour trip dropped the charge meter to nearly zero after only 25 miles. The Vectrix takes about two hours to refuel with its built-in charger, which can be plugged into any standard outlet.
 So the Vectrix is not for long-haul touring. But for the daily driving most of us do most of the time, the Vectrix is a viable choice. It's smooth, disarmingly fun to ride, has enough luggage space under its flip-up seat for two open-face helmets or a couple of canvas grocery bags, and is comfortable for two adults. It's warranted for two years and unlimited miles, and its battery pack is projected to last for 50,000 miles -- quite a way to go on an open-air scooter. 
 The Vectrix Corporation is a well-financed, truly international effort with offices in Rome and Newport, R.I., and production facilities in Poland. Big high-tech companies including Lockheed Martin, Alcoa and Parker-Hannifin have contributed to the project.
 The Vectrix is on sale in major American cities for $11,850. And though the initial cost is high compared with gas-powered scooters, the savings come, of course, on fuel costs: the company estimates those at 2 cents a mile. 
 This saving-the-planet thing may be more fun than we expected.
