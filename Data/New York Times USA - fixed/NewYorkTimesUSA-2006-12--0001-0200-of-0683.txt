HEADLINE: Highway Courtesans

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:

Opens today in Manhattan
Directed by Mystelle Brabbee
In Hindi, with English subtitles
Not rated; 71 minutes
 Nine years in the making and timeless in its observations, ''Highway Courtesans'' is an intimate look at some of the youngest practitioners of the world's oldest profession. Filmed literally on the side of a road in central India from 1995 to 2004, the movie observes the daughters of the impoverished Bachara community as they sell themselves to an endless stream of long-haul truckers. This centuries-old tradition robs the girls of any chance of marriage and enslaves them to male family members who live (and drink) off their earnings. 
 ''Some people commit crimes to feed themselves, but these girls do this with dignity, as a profession,'' says one satisfied customer, while parents and a village leader insist the girls have a choice. Yet we see the fights that ensue when an enterprising 17-year-old, Guddi Chauhan -- who, along with her sisters, supports her parents and four brothers -- leaves ''the business'' to teach school and start a microcredit group. Even her boyfriend and sometime customer, the skittish Sagar, turns violent when she talks back to him. ''I am stranded on the road to nowhere,'' Ms. Chauhan tells the director, Mystelle Brabbee, attempting a mischievous pun that turns heartbreaking in light of her subsequent suicide attempt.
 With a camera attuned to the languid rhythms of the girls' lives, Ms. Brabbee reveals the tangle of a culture where sex and economics are inextricably intertwined and Bollywood movies perpetuate images that glamorize prostitution. It's a world where children, no matter their provenance, are always a blessing -- especially if they're girls. JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

HEADLINE: Takes a Licking and Keeps on Floating 

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
PRODUCT demonstrations have long been a mainstay of advertising, none perhaps better known than the series of torture tests for Timex watches, which carried the triumphant theme ''It takes a licking and keeps on ticking.''
 Now, as the Internet gives marketers more opportunities to make product tests a focus of their campaigns, visitors to Web sites can watch sponsored demonstrations of longevity, strength and power.
 One case in point is a campaign, now under way, for the Triumph line of boats sold by Genmar Industries. The campaign, by an agency in Durham, N.C., known as the Republik, is centered on efforts to demonstrate that Triumph boats are ''the world's toughest.'' 
 Up first is what is titled the bubba test: a good ol' boy, considering buying a Triumph boat, hitches it to the back of his pickup, without a trailer, and drives it at high speeds on dry land, bashing and bumping the boat innumerable times until it fishtails into a lake.
 ''I'll take it,'' he tells the dealer, who replies with a nonchalant ''O.K.''
 The bubba test is available for viewing on a special Web site (toughboats.com), along with similar video clips showing Triumph boats dropping from helicopters and being pounded by sledgehammers.
 The campaign's budget -- an estimated $250,000 -- reflects the economical nature of online video. There are also traditional elements like television commercials and print advertisements.
 Still, the best part about the campaign, from the perspective of Triumph executives, is its model of engagement rather than interruption: people watching the bubba test online choose to be there, making it likely that more than a few of them are in the market for a boat.
 ''We can start a conversation with the consumer,'' said Doug Andersen, president of Triumph Boats in Durham.
 ''And it's measurable,'' he added, referring to the ability to gather data like how long people remain on the Web site to watch the video clips and whether they click on a link to the regular Triumph Web site (triumphboats.com).
 Mr. Andersen likened the boating industry to the automotive industry. Both are crowded and competitive, he said, and neither is growing, ''so you have to differentiate yourself.''
 Triumph tried that with campaigns concentrating on what Mr. Andersen called the Ropeline story -- the brand of polyethylene from which the boats are made -- and qualities like being ''environmentally friendly, unsinkable, shock absorbent.''
 ''The Republik told us, 'You've got so much to talk about, you're diluting your message,' '' Mr. Andersen recalled. The agency suggested that the company limit itself to promoting toughness and work to distinguish Triumph from all the ads ''of boats riding on the water, with scantily clad women or fishermen.''
 David Smith, partner and executive creative director at Republik, said the bubba test was given a trial before filming.
 ''We tested it in a field in North Carolina, slammed the boat into a few trees at 40 miles per hour, and we couldn't break it,'' Mr. Smith said. The actual shoot took place on a go-kart track in Warren, Ark. 
 ''Let me tell you, the folks in that town thought we were out of our minds,'' Mr. Smith said. 
 The video clip and print ads carry disclaimers that spoof the standard language of such qualifiers: ''Demonstration. Closed course. Professional redneck driver. Do not attempt.''
 Plans are already being made for additional over-the-top tests, Mr. Smith said, including one called ''the double black diamond test,'' which would involve pushing the boat down a ski slope, and another that needs no explanation: ''The blind captain test.''
 The bubba test clip is already being noticed by blogs like Adjab (adjab.com) and Adrants (adrants.com).
 Adrants compares the clip to ''an old Burt Reynolds 'Smokey and the Bandit' movie'' in which ''stereotypical Southern yee-haw ensues.''
 The clip is also being seeded on blogs and Web sites that appeal to boat owners and fishers. The television version will appear on cable channels like FLW Outdoor from Fox Sports.
 The print ads are running in 11 regional and national publications like Fish Sniffer, North Carolina Sportsman, Salty Dog, South Carolina Sportsman and Wave.

HEADLINE: Sign of Slowdown in Midwest Tempers Investor Enthusiasm 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Stocks ended little changed yesterday as recent signs of healthy economic growth drove fund managers to bet that stocks would keep rallying into December, but a report on slower Midwestern business activity tempered that enthusiasm.
 For the month of November, the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 1.17 percent, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.65 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 2.75 percent.
Energy stocks rose, tracking a rally in crude oil prices and lifting Exxon Mobil and Chevron to record highs. 
 In focusing on government data indicating growth in personal income and spending and gross domestic product, investors played down a report showing an unexpected contraction of business activity in the Midwest. Wall Street also appeared to shrug off a disappointing holiday sales outlook from Wal-Mart Stores, whose shares fell 1.7 percent.
 The Dow slipped 4.80 points, or 0.04 percent, to 12,221.93. The S.& P. 500 rose 1.15 points, or 0.08 percent, to 1,400.63. The Nasdaq composite index edged down just 0.46 of a point, or 0.02 percent, to 2,431.77.
 The Nasdaq had a fourth consecutive month of gains in November, matching a streak set at the end of 2004, while both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 registered their fifth consecutive monthly advances. The Dow's run was its longest winning streak in more than three years.
 Among Nasdaq stocks, top advancers included Research in Motion, up 3.5 percent, or $4.68, at $138.83. Cingular Wireless, the mobile phone company, said it had started selling the BlackBerry Pearl handheld device from Research in Motion.
 Shares of VeriSign jumped 7.5 percent, or $1.82, to $26.09 after the Department of Commerce approved a deal that lets VeriSign continue running the lucrative .com Internet registry through 2012.
 Exxon Mobil shares rose 1 percent, or 78 cents, to $76.81 on the New York Stock Exchange. Crude oil for January delivery gained 67 cents to settle at $63.13 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a drop in United States fuel inventories.
 Stock of Chevron, a rival oil company, gained 1.8 percent, or $1.27, to $72.32, after reaching a record high of $72.96 on the New York Exchange.
 Shares of the drug maker Pfizer, a Dow component, rose 1.6 percent, or 42 cents, to $27.49 after the company raised its 2006 profit forecast.
 That positive momentum helped Wall Street overcome the unexpected drop in the November business barometer of the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago, which signaled business contraction in the Midwest for the first time in three and a half years.
 But Wall Street chose to focus more on the government's higher estimate for third-quarter growth in gross domestic product, released on Wednesday, as well as on yesterday's data showing American incomes grew steadily in October and spending rebounded.
 The heaviest weight on the Dow was DuPont, whose shares sank 2.5 percent, or $1.22, to $46.93 on the New York Stock Exchange.
 The second-biggest drag on the Dow was Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, which forecast little improvement in December sales after posting its first monthly same-store sales drop in more than a decade in November. Wal-Mart shares fell 79 cents, to $46.10.
 Bonds rose, with the price on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising 16/32, to 101 10/32. The yield, which moves in a direction opposite to the price, fell to 4.46 percent, from 4.52 percent.

HEADLINE: Sharply Divided Reactions to Report on U.S. Markets

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
A report by an independent committee concerned about the competitiveness of capital markets in the United States drew a wide range of responses yesterday. Different interests weighed in on all aspects of the report, from its premise -- that the United States is less competitive -- to its recommendations. 
 The ''Interim Report of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulations,'' headed by Hal S. Scott, a Harvard Law professor, recommended tougher standards for rule-making by the Securities and Exchange Commission and curbing what it deemed excessive and uncoordinated federal and state regulation. 
The report proposed strengthening shareholder rights, imposing caps on litigation against accounting firms and joined a chorus of dozens of other groups that have criticized the impact of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on small companies. 
 It is unclear what impact the report will have. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. applauded the formation of the group in September, but did not meet with it and declined to comment on its conclusions. The Treasury Department will hold its own conference on the competitiveness of capital markets next year. On Dec. 13, the S.E.C. will propose changes to Section 404, part of a process that has been under way for about two years. 
 Response to the report fell along predictable lines: state regulators and consumer advocates characterized the report as a one-sided attempt to roll back regulation at a time when corporate scandals like the backdating of stock options abound, while pro-business groups either praised the findings or suggested that they did not go far enough. 
 ''It is a bunch of warmed-over, impractical ideas, many of which have been kicking around for a long time,'' said Richard C. Breeden, a former S.E.C. chairman who now runs Breeden Capital Management, a $1.3 billion hedge fund. ''It is very elegant whining.''
 The governor-elect of New York, Eliot Spitzer, who as the state's attorney general battled Wall Street and often the S.E.C., vowed to fight the proposals. ''I will personally appear on Capitol Hill and appear with tens of thousands of investors to defend against these wayward and wrong-headed proposals,'' he said. 
 ''This is the same old tired response from the defenders of the status quo who time and again jump to eviscerate the prosecutorial power of the only office who did anything in the past decade,'' he said. 
 Other groups felt the report did not go far enough. The National Venture Capital Association said the recommendations would do little to mitigate the burden on small companies of Section 404, which requires audits of internal controls. 
 ''As currently written, the committee's recommendations are not sufficient and will do little to support the emerging enterprises we are trying to protect,'' the association said.
 Mr. Breeden criticized the make-up of the committee, a bipartisan collection of academics and business leaders including R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and a former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush; Kenneth Griffin, founder and chief executive of Citadel Investment Group, a $13 billion hedge fund, and John L. Thornton, chairman of the Brookings Institution and a former co-president of Goldman Sachs. Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr., global chief executive of PriceWaterhouseCoopers, and William G. Parrett, chief of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, were also members.
 But the committee did not include any former regulators. 
 ''They didn't think it was a conflict to have two sitting C.E.O.'s of Big Four firms making recommendations to cap the liabilities of accounting firms but they thought it would be inappropriate to have anyone who has worked at the S.E.C. commenting on the practicality of it,'' Mr. Breeden said. 
 Mr. Scott had earlier said that he was concerned about including regulators who might have played a role in drafting rules that would be discussed in the group. ''We would not want to put people in the position who had formulated these rules in the past,'' he said. ''They may have a lack of objectivity.''
 Some critics contested the report's assumption that the United States was losing competitiveness. The report cited that 5 percent of the total value of global initial public offerings was raised in the United States last year compared with 50 percent in 2000. It also cited the huge fundraising efforts by private equity firms as evidence that the American public markets have become burdened by regulatory risks and costs. 
 ''We have noticed that when we invest in a foreign company, and it comes time to go public, the companies are more reluctant to do that here than ever,'' said Wilbur Ross, a member of the committee. 
 But critics challenged that point. Mr. Spitzer said it was poor management by public companies that was fueling the private equity boom, not regulatory burdens. ''It's not a problem with the public markets,'' he said. ''There has been failed leadership.''
 Others pointed out that many big recent I.P.O.'s have been listed in their home countries like China, where markets have become more developed. 
 Initial seed capital for the report was provided by Mr. Ross and Mr. Griffin, according to Mr. Ross. Each individual provided about $200,000. 
 The group had additional financial support from the Starr Foundation, according to Mr. Scott. Maurice R. Greenberg, who controls the foundation, has been a vocal critic of regulators. He ran American International Group for more than 40 years when investigations by the New York attorney general and S.E.C. over improper accounting led the board to force him to resign.

HEADLINE: Talks Go On; Strike Averted At 2 Dailies

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
A strike was averted, at least temporarily, at The Philadelphia Inquirer and The Daily News Thursday night as management and unionized newsroom workers suspended negotiations and agreed to resume their talks Friday morning. 
 ''We're not going to finish tonight,'' Henry Holcomb, president of the Newspaper Guild's local unit, said in a statement during a break in negotiations. ''We will keep talking as long as we are making progress, and we are.''
Brian Tierney, chief executive of Philadelphia Media Holdings, the team that bought the newspapers earlier this year, said in a statement: ''We are all working hard and I believe that a great deal of progress is being made.'' 
 The two sides said earlier that the biggest areas of dispute concerned employee pensions, sick pay and a management proposal that it not be bound by seniority rules when it seeks to make job changes or layoffs.
 Nine of the papers' 10 unions agreed to extend their talks for a third time, until Dec. 9. But one union, the Newspaper Guild, which represents the newsrooms, advertising and circulation departments, said it was sticking to its deadline of 12:01 Friday morning.
 The other unions said they would cross a picket line if the Guild went on strike, pitting the Guild against its fellow unions on the eve of its strike deadline.
 The Philadelphia papers have been watched closely by the industry since they were sold earlier this year to a team led by Brian Tierney, a local business executive. 
 He recently said that the papers' advertising revenues were so weak that layoffs were inevitable, and that the number of layoffs would depend on what kind of economic concessions the unions were willing to make.

HEADLINE: For Residents of the West Bronx, an Online Newspaper to Call Their Own

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In many parts of New York City, local news is ultra-local. 
 People in Forest Hills, Queens, can read The Forest Hills Ledger. And The Forest Hills Tribune. And The Forest Hills Courier. And The Forest Hills/Rego Park Times, to name just a few.
Residents of other neighborhoods in Queens and Brooklyn -- Bayside, Jackson Heights, Bay Ridge, Brooklyn Heights -- have two, three and sometimes four or more community and ethnic newspapers to choose from. 
 In the Bronx, neighborhood news is harder to come by. Some sections of the Bronx that have struggled over the years with high rates of crime, poverty and unemployment have never had a community newspaper. 
 Mount Hope never did. 
 The neighborhood, a compact, gritty stretch of the west Bronx cluttered with bodegas, African markets and tall brick apartment buildings, sits in Community District 5.
 Mount Hope, Morris Heights and the district's other neighborhoods are home to 128,000 people. Yet for as long as anyone can remember, residents have relied on either the city's major media outlets or the borough's major weekly newspapers for neighborhood news. Often, that news was crime and nothing else. 
 Yesterday, community journalism finally came to Mount Hope. But there was no hum of printing presses, no trucks unloading stacks of bundled papers. Just a few quiet taps on some laptop computers. That was all it took to officially start The Mount Hope Monitor, an online newspaper that will cover the neighborhood and all of Community District 5.
 The top story in the first edition, so to speak, was about an unlikely bit of greenery among Mount Hope's concrete and brick: a community garden with a peach tree at the corner of Walton Avenue and East 175th Street. On the right side of the home page were links providing residents with information on local schools, elected officials and post offices. And there was at least one article that Mount Hope residents might consider a scoop: major crimes in the precinct were down 16 percent compared with two years ago.
 ''Every neighborhood needs and deserves a community newspaper,'' said James Fergusson, 26, the Monitor's sole reporter.
 The online newspaper is part of a new project in cyberspace for the western Bronx, a Web site called the West Bronx News Network. The network, www.thebeehive.org/wbnn, is a news hub for the western Bronx that was also unveiled yesterday, along with The Mount Hope Monitor. 
 The network features The Monitor, a west Bronx blog and news stories from community newspapers in two neighborhoods to Mount Hope's north and south, Norwood and Highbridge. It also includes links to neighborhood services and information on starting a business, money management and job skills. Starting next week, The Monitor will be updated every Friday with new articles, both in English and Spanish, a majority of which will be written by Mr. Fergusson, Mount Hope's unlikely online chronicler. 
 Mr. Fergusson, a part-time children's soccer coach, grew up in Bridgwater, England, among rolling hills and apple orchards. Now he walks his beat with a digital camera and a backpack, wide-eyed by the bustle of the Bronx, New York, U.S.A. ''I feel like I got 100 stories to write,'' he said. 
 The Mount Hope Monitor and the West Bronx News Network are collaborations of two community papers, The Norwood News and The Highbridge Horizon, and several local and national nonprofit organizations. The Mount Hope Housing Company, a nonprofit community development corporation, is one of the network's financial supporters.
 Money for the Web site was also provided by grants from The New York Times Company Foundation, the Verizon Foundation and J. P. Morgan Chase & Company. The Web site is run by One Economy Corporation, a nonprofit group that provides affordable high-speed Internet access to low-income communities.
 Jordan Moss, 40, editor of The Norwood News, said the network's goal was to fill a journalistic gap in Mount Hope and also to provide the west Bronx with a central source for news and information that no community group or newspaper had the time or resources to provide on its own. 
 One challenge for Mr. Moss and other network supporters is making sure enough west Bronx residents see it. In some parts of Community District 5, 30 percent to 60 percent of residents live below the federal poverty line, and no one knows for certain how many own computers or have access to the Internet. Still, residents and community leaders said Mount Hope and other neighborhoods needed to have a presence on the Internet and a newspaper, even an online version, to call its own.
 ''The poverty is as much a poverty of information as much as any other type of poverty,'' said Gary Axelbank, host of BronxTalk, a talk show on public access cable television. 
 The neighborhoods of the west Bronx, with a population of about 400,000, are home to Bronx Community College and Yankee Stadium, not far from the banks of the Harlem River. A majority of residents are black or Hispanic, and though the area continues to cope with its share of problems, residents say they see changes for the better, including the opening of new businesses. 
 Yesterday, in an apartment building where the Web site was unveiled, Sidney Flores, 47, a longtime Mount Hope resident, scrolled through an article about a new playground that he was featured in. 
 ''There's a lot of positive things happening,'' Mr. Flores said. ''That's what we need to talk about.''

HEADLINE: Profit and Questions as Doctors Offer Prostate Cancer Therapy

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
The nearly 240,000 men in the United States who will learn they have prostate cancer this year have one more thing to worry about: Are their doctors making treatment decisions on the basis of money as much as medicine? 
 Among several widely used treatments for prostate cancer, one stands out for its profit potential. The approach, a radiation therapy known as I.M.R.T., can mean reimbursement of $47,000 or more a patient.
 That is many times the fees that urologists make on other accepted treatments for the disease, which include surgery and radioactive seed implants. And it may help explain why urologists have started buying multimillion-dollar I.M.R.T. equipment and software, and why many more are investigating it as a way to increase their incomes. 
 Already, dozens of the nation's 10,000 urologists have purchased the technology for intensity modulated radiation therapy, which is what I.M.R.T. stands for, and some of them are recommending its use for growing numbers of their patients. 
 Critics see a potential conflict of interest on the part of urologists, the specialists who typically help prostate patients choose a course of treatment. The critics say that urologists who can profit from the new form of therapy may be less likely to recommend other proven approaches, which for some older men can involve forgoing treatment altogether. 
 If the patient has insurance, the added expense may not be a concern for him. And like the other treatments, the new therapy can be highly effective. But doctors say that prostate cancer treatments should be tailored to the individual. 
 Compared with seed implants, for example, I.M.R.T. involves a large time commitment, requiring patients to visit a radiation center 45 times over the course of nine weeks.
 More worrisome for some experts is a concern that the multiple-beam radiation of I.M.R.T. may raise the risk of secondary cancers, although no medical studies have proved such a link. 
 Helping drive the trend is a Texas company, Urorad Healthcare, which sells complete packages of I.M.R.T. technology and services, and hopes to persuade even more urologists to buy them.
 ''Join the Urorad team and let us show your group how Urorad clients double their practice's revenue,'' the company says in a marketing pitch to doctors on its Web site. 
 Urologists who have purchased the new multiple beam systems say they are embracing a superior way to treat prostate cancer. But because there is little research directly comparing I.M.R.T. with the other treatments, there is little consensus among urologists about which approach is best. 
 That is why some doctors worry that I.M.R.T. may be emerging as yet another example of the way financial incentives can influence medical decisions in this nation's for-profit health care economy.
 ''It's all money-driven, and it's a shame medicine has come down to this,'' said Dr. Brian Moran, a radiation oncologist in Chicago, who specializes in radioactive-seed implants, in which tiny radioactive pellets are placed into the prostate. His clinic is paid $15,000 or less for the procedure, with the urologist on the case getting about $900.
 Dr. Eli Glatstein, a professor of radiation oncology at the University of Pennsylvania, said he was concerned that some urologists would steer patients to the new treatment because they owned the technology and could greatly profit from its use.
 ''It's not illegal to do this,'' Dr. Glatstein said. ''That doesn't make it right.'' 
 I.M.R.T. was introduced in the mid-1990s and has proved useful for delivering multiple beams of radiation to a small area while avoiding healthy tissue. Like other treatments for prostate cancer, though, it has possible side effects, potentially including impotence. 
 The one certainty about I.M.R.T. is that for doctors who own the technology, it can be much more lucrative than alternative treatments. Medicare and other insurers typically pay urologists only $2,000 or less for performing surgery to remove the prostate or for implanting radioactive seeds. The insurers say the much higher I.M.R.T. payments, which in some cases exceed $50,000, are based on the technology's cost.
 Leslie Norwalk, Medicare's chief administrator, said she was not worried that doctors who invest in I.M.R.T. would use it on patients who require no treatment. 
 ''You're just not going to do beam therapy on someone who doesn't need it,'' Ms. Norwalk said in a telephone interview.
 But because of the potential conflicts, urologist-owned I.M.R.T. is the type of arrangement that Medicare should be watching, she said.
 Dr. Juan A. Reyna, president of a San Antonio urology group that was among the first to order I.M.R.T. technology in 2004, said that the revenue opportunities were a factor in the decision to buy it. 
 ''These are the kind of things you have to do to be able to maintain yourself in practice,'' Dr. Reyna said, noting that Medicare has been cutting back payments for other forms of prostate cancer treatment. Dr. Reyna says he recommends the treatment more frequently now because he is convinced of its value. 
 Some other urologists, though, say they are uncomfortable with the I.M.R.T. ownership trend. For example, Dr. Robert Waldbaum of Manhasset, N.Y., said he declined to go along when a large group of Long Island urologists invested in the technology, fearing it might influence his advice to patients. 
 ''I felt in my own mind that it would be a conflict of interest to me,'' said Dr. Waldbaum, the former chairman of urology at North Shore University Hospital, who is in private practice.
 Varian Medical Systems, a leading maker of the technology, still sells it mainly to hospitals and free-standing radiation oncology centers. But it has sold about 20 I.M.R.T.-capable machines to urology groups, according to a company spokesman, Spencer Sias. Typically, doctor groups pool their money to buy the technology.
 ''There's definitely heightened interest from urology practices in this,'' Mr. Sias said. 
 Helping drive that interest is Urorad, based in McAllen, Tex., which has been aggressively marketing I.M.R.T. to urologists across the country, who must either hire a radiation oncologist or form a partnership with one. The company helps arrange a complete setup as well as consulting services to calculate radiation doses for patients, with costs to get started estimated at about $3 million. 
 Five Urorad centers are already operating around the country, according to Dr. Mark L. Harrison, the chief executive, who said that contracts had been signed for six more. 
 The majority of prostate cancers are caught early, owing mainly to use of the prostate-specific antigen test. Still, prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in men, after lung cancer. 
 The prostate cancers that are detected early have several treatment alternatives with high success rates -- among them surgery, radioactive seed implants, and external radiation, like the multiple beam therapy. 
 In some cases, especially for older men, doctors recommend ''watchful waiting,'' or no treatment at all. An estimated 40 percent to 50 percent of men with the disease get surgery, which many doctors still consider the gold standard for a cure. But surgery also carries a risk of incontinence; up to 29 percent of men who have their prostates removed report wearing pads to keep dry, according to one large study. 
 As with surgery and seed implants, men treated with I.M.R.T. run a risk of eventual impotence. A recent study at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, which has conducted much of the early research onthe therapy, found that eight years after treatment, 49 percent of men who were potent before treatment developed erectile dysfunction. 
 Compared with surgery, neither seed implants nor I.M.R.T. carry high risks of incontinence, though. And the arguments in favor of the multiple beam therapy include a new research study indicating that urinary complications, like painful urination and a narrowing of the urethra, are lower with I.M.R.T. than with seed implants. 
 Depending on the region of the country, the owner of an office-based I.M.R.T. system can be reimbursed up to $47,000 for a nine-week course of daily treatments, including the physician's fee, which often goes to the radiation oncologist. 
 Medicare and commercial insurers have said the reimbursements are based not only on the cost of the software and equipment, but on the complicated mathematical calculations required in administering the treatments. 
 Yet Dr. Ivan A. Brezovich, a physicist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said that delivering multiple beam therapy to the prostate was a relatively simple procedure compared with using it on more complex conditions like head and neck cancers. 
 ''You can do it almost on an assembly-line basis,'' Dr. Brezovich said. 
 Medicare, which has reviewed the issue, is scheduled to begin reducing I.M.R.T. reimbursements. For example, reimbursement in the Atlanta area, considered close to the national median, is scheduled to be cut by 8.2 percent, from $39,000 this year to $35,800 in 2007. 
 But because Medicare or another insurer pays for the treatment, cost is often not a factor for patients as they assess their options. 
 Leonard Streim, 58, a clinical psychologist in Deer Park, N.Y., learned he had prostate cancer this year. He said he researched various options, including seed implants and surgery, before deciding on multiple beam treatment, which was covered by his medical insurance. 
 Mr. Streim said his side effects were minimal. 
 ''As compared to surgery, as compared to walking around being radioactive, I don't think there's any choice there, at least not for me,'' he said. 
 His urologist is a member of a large Long Island group, Integrated Medical Professionals, formed in July by 13 different practices with a total of more than 30 doctors. Now the largest urology group on Long Island, it pooled its resources to invest in an image-guided I.M.R.T. system, which uses markers implanted in the prostate to more accurately direct the beams of radiation. Some say that the group's formation has contributed to a shift in prostate cancer treatment in the region. 
 Fewer patients in the area now appear to be getting seed implants, according to Dr. Jay Bosworth, a radiation oncologist involved with another Long Island group of diagnostic and treatment centers whose services include I.M.R.T. 
 According to three hospitals where doctors in the Integrated Medical Professionals group have practiced, about 300 seed procedures were performed in 2005 compared with about 100 this year through mid-October. 
 Dr. Deepak A. Kapoor, Integrated Medical's chief executive, said the downturn in seed implants began before his group's formation, as urologists began to recognize the benefits of I.M.R.T. He denied that financial incentives were a driving force.
 ''All of our physicians are required to discuss all available options with every patient,'' Dr. Kapoor said.
 One of Dr. Kapoor's Long Island patients, Daniel Staiano of Massapequa, N.Y., who is covered by Medicare, said he was not concerned to learn that his urologist had a financial stake in the therapy. 
 Mr. Staiano, 75, was one of several patients treated by I.M.R.T. in Plainview, N.Y., who said they suffered only minor side effects after the nine-week course of radiation. 
 ''This treatment is fabulous,'' said Mr. Staiano, a retired tape editor for NBC, who said that his side effects were minimal. ''If I ever get cancer again,'' he said, ''this is the way I want to go.''

HEADLINE: When the Joneses Can't Keep Up

 BODY:
An article in yesterday's Times about obstetricians who prefer working in Botox boutiques is a reminder that the growing gap between the rich and superrich has an impact on those of us who are neither. The article, by Natasha Singer, reported that family practitioners and emergency room physicians have also jumped over into the cosmetic treatment business because the money is so much better. 
 As The Times has noted in a series of recent articles, the very richest earners are increasing their earnings at twice the rate of their onetime peers, and the average-rich are taking resentful note. Investment bankers are jealous of hedge-fund wunderkinds and, from the sound of it, almost every last person in Silicon Valley is envious of the founders of YouTube (with the likely exception of the Google billionaires who bought their company).
 It's hard for people flying in coach to have much patience with those in first class bemoaning their lack of a personal jet. Neither policymakers nor society at large need sympathize with the longing of millionaires to become billionaires. But we do need to worry about the effects on society as a whole when members of the educated elite think they are grossly underpaid. The more they feel as if they are losing ground against their peers, the more likely they are to ditch professions in which the pay is only good -- like delivering babies -- in favor of less useful careers in which the compensation is off the charts -- like eliminating lines from wealthy people's foreheads.
 America has long had a problem attracting enough well-trained people to important but not particularly well-compensated positions, like public defender, social worker or teacher. But an era in which a cancer researcher moves over into health-care management consulting because the pay is better -- as Louis Uchitelle reported in The Times this week -- is something else entirely.
 Part of the explanation is undoubtedly a tax code that has sent the incomes of the wealthiest sliver of the nation into hyperdrive. Another might be the spike in education costs, which send many new doctors, lawyers and scientists out into the world armed with a diploma and a six-figure debt. But the bottom line seems to be that in 21st-century America, more people can't feel successful unless they're making a killing.

HEADLINE: New Citizens Will Need Deeper Knowledge

BYLINE: By HOLLI CHMELA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
The federal government rolled out a new citizenship test Thursday to replace an exam that critics say has encouraged prospective Americans simply to memorize facts, rather than fully understand the principles of a democracy.
 The exam will be assessed in a pilot program in 10 cities beginning early next year.
Gone are these questions: ''How many stripes are there in the flag?''; ''What color are the stripes on the flag?''; ''What do the stripes on the flag represent?''; and the obvious, ''What are the colors of our flag?'' The new exam rephrases the questions to focus on what the stripes represent, asking, ''Why do we have 13 stripes on the flag?'' or ''Why does the flag have 13 stripes?'' (The answer: Because the stripes represent the original 13 colonies). 
 ''Our goal is to inspire immigrants to learn about the civic values of this nation so that after they take the oath of citizenship they will participate fully in our great democracy,'' said Emilio Gonzalez, director of the Citizenship and Immigration Services, which has been working since 2000 to develop a new test.
 The result is 144 questions on civics and history, including 57 rephrased questions from the current exam. (All the questions are available on the agency's Web site, www.uscis.gov). 
 The exam will be administered in the same way, with an applicant asked to answer orally 10 questions chosen by the examiner. Six correct answers are required to pass. According to the citizenship agency, about 600,000 immigrants pass the test and are naturalized each year.
 The revised test will be introduced in a pilot program in 10 cities chosen for their geographic range and high percentage of immigrants. Applicants will be asked to volunteer to take the pilot exam and will have the option of taking the current exam if they fail the new one.
 Officials say the goal of the pilot program is to assess the effectiveness of the exam and refine the exam's questions or answers. Before the new test is implemented nationwide in 2008, it will be pared down to the current number of 100 questions.
 The exam will be tested in Albany; Boston; Charleston, S.C.; Denver; El Paso; Kansas City, Mo.; Miami; San Antonio; Tucson; and Yakima, Wash.
 In developing the revised exam, the agency worked with test development contractors, history and government scholars and experts in English as a second language to improve ways to focus on an analytical understanding of the acceptable answers. 
 ''The current exam did not elicit enough civics knowledge and values we as Americans hold true,'' said Chris Rhatigan, a spokeswoman for the citizenship agency. ''At the end of the test, there was no demonstrable knowledge that the new citizens were ready to participate in our government on the federal, state or community level.''
 Ellen Mercer, a senior program officer at the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, an advocacy organization that was part of a focus group about the revisions, said, ''The purpose of redesigning the test is to make it more meaningful -- and also to update it -- for the people applying for U.S. citizenship.'' 
 The current exam has not been changed since 1986. Before that, no official test existed. 
 Besides the oral questions, the revised exam, like the 1986 version, gives applicants three chances to read and write a sentence correctly in English. But the sentences focus exclusively on civics and history rather than on a range of topics, and to prepare for the test, applicants will be given study materials and a civics-based vocabulary list. 
 Another way the two exams differ is that the new questions will be weighed by level of difficulty to ensure that each exam tests equivalent knowledge. How the questions will be weighted will be determined by the results of the pilot program. Part of the pilot program includes training test administrators to make the process fairer and more consistent nationwide.
 The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Citizenship ''has done everything imaginable to make the test more meaningful, but not more difficult,'' Ms. Mercer said.
 Several advocacy organizations are reviewing the exam to determine whether the level of English is appropriate and whether the civics questions are understandable.
 ''We all want to look at the questions carefully to ensure fairness and compliance of the law,'' said Rosalind Gold, a senior director at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. 
 Ms. Gold added that while the citizenship agency had made progress in ensuring that the exam was administered fairly, ''there needs to be continued improvement in training examiners so they don't abuse the discretion they're given to administer exams.''

Focusing on Principles, Not Facts
 The Citizenship and Immigration Services has devised 144 questions for a new citizenship examination. Here is a sampling of the questions, which will be tested in 10 cities beginning next year. Correct answers are listed (some questions have more than one correct answer). The entire exam is available online at www.uscis.gov. 

Name one important idea found in the Declaration of Independence.
People are born with natural rights. The power of government comes from the people. The people can change their government if it hurts their natural rights. All people are created equal.

What type of economic system does the United States have?
Capitalist economy. Free market. Market economy.

Why do we have three branches of government?
So no branch is too powerful.

Name one example of checks and balances.
The president vetoes a bill. Congress can confirm or not confirm a president's nomination. Congress approves the president's budget. The Supreme Court strikes down a law.

Name one thing only the federal government can do.
Print money. Declare war. Create an army. Make treaties.

Name one famous battle from the Revolutionary War.
Lexington and Concord. Trenton. Princeton. Saratoga. Cowpens. Yorktown. Bunker Hill.

Name one of the writers of the Federalist Papers.
James Madison. Alexander Hamilton. John Jay.

HEADLINE: World Briefing Asia: Thailand: Plan To Override Patent For Aids Drug 

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

 BODY:
Thailand announced that it would override a patent held by the pharmaceutical company Merck for a medicine to treat AIDS, efavirenz. The country's own public drug manufacturer is expected to make a generic version for about $267 a patient per year, compared with Merck's price of $466. Thailand and Brazil have hesitated to override drug patents, as international trade rules allow, fearing trade retaliation from the United States. A recent World Bank study concluded that unless multinational drug companies slashed prices or Thailand allowed more domestic production of cheap knockoffs, Thailand's AIDS treatment costs would quintuple by 2020 from the current $100 million a year as patients need costly patented medicines.

HEADLINE: Economic Storm Signals

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
''It's tough to make predictions,'' Yogi Berra is supposed to have said, ''especially about the future.'' Actually, his remark makes perfect sense to economists, who sometimes have trouble making predictions about the present. And this is one of those times.
 We're now two-thirds of the way through the fourth quarter of 2006, so you might think we'd already know how the quarter is going. Yet, economists' assessments of the current state of the U.S. economy, never mind the future, are all over the place. 
And here's the bad news: this kind of confusion about what's going on is what typically happens when the economy is at a turning point, when an economic expansion is about to turn into a recession (or vice versa). At turning points, the various indicators that usually tell us which way the economic wind is blowing often point in different directions, so that both optimists and pessimists can find data to support their position.
 The last time things were this confused was early in 2001, when most economists failed to realize that the United States was sliding into recession. If that sounds ominous, it should: the bond market, which has a pretty good record of forecasting recessions, is pointing toward a serious economic slowdown next year. 
 Before I explain what the bond market is telling us, let's talk about why the economy may be at a turning point.
 Between mid-2003 and mid-2006, economic growth in the United States was fueled mainly by a huge housing boom, which created jobs directly and made it easy for consumers to spend freely by borrowing against their rising home equity.
 That housing boom has now gone bust. But the optimists and pessimists disagree both about how bad the bust will get and about how much damage the housing slump will do to the economy as a whole.
 The optimists include Alan Greenspan, whom some accuse of letting the housing bubble get out of hand in the first place. On Tuesday, he told investors at a conference that the worst of the housing slump is over, saying that ''it looks as though sales figures have stabilized.''
 But the very next day the government released grim data on new home sales for October, and revised its estimates for earlier months downward. Most, though not all, of the other economic numbers that came out this week were also substantially weaker than expected.
 Pessimists feel vindicated by the downbeat data. Nouriel Roubini of Roubini Global Economics, who has been forecasting a housing-led recession for some time, now believes that the economy has already stalled: he predicts zero growth for the current quarter. Economists at Deutsche Bank say the same thing.
 But that's still a minority position; most forecasters are still telling us not to worry. So whom should you listen to? And how can you avoid believing what you want to believe?
 Maybe the best answer is to look at what the financial markets say. Not the stock market, which is a notoriously bad indicator of the economy's direction, but the bond market. (Paul Samuelson, the Nobel Prize-winning M.I.T. economist, famously quipped that the stock market had predicted nine of the last five recessions). 
 Since last summer, when the housing bust became unmistakable, interest rates on long-term bonds have fallen sharply. They're now yielding much less than short-term bonds. The fact that investors are willing to buy those long-term bonds anyway tells us that these investors expect interest rates to fall. And that will happen only if the economy weakens, forcing the Federal Reserve to cut rates. So bond buyers are, in effect, betting on a future economic slowdown.
 How serious a slump is the bond market predicting? Pretty serious. Right now, statistical models based on the historical correlation between interest rates and recessions give roughly even odds that we're about to experience a formal recession. And since even a slowdown that doesn't formally qualify as a recession can lead to a sharp rise in unemployment, the odds are very good -- maybe 2 to 1 -- that 2007 will be a very tough year.
 Luckily, we've got good leadership for the coming economic storm: the White House is occupied by a man who's ideologically flexible, listens to a wide variety of views, and understands that policy has to be based on careful analysis, not gut instincts. Oh, wait.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Barely Rose In Quarter 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Home prices rose in the third quarter at their slowest pace since 1998, and were essentially flat when adjusted for inflation, according to a government price index released yesterday.
 The data suggest that prices, especially for the existing single-family homes that the index focuses on, continue to weaken across much of the country and particularly in formerly hot coastal markets. Nationally, prices rose 0.86 percent from the second quarter and 7.73 percent from the third quarter of 2005.
Prices fell in five states, including New York and Massachusetts, and in 15 of California's 25 metropolitan areas, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight reported. Nationally, prices declined for the third quarter in 92 of 379 metropolitan areas, up from 87 in the second quarter. 
 ''We have a pretty clear evidence -- if anyone was confused about it -- that prices have decelerated in most parts of the country,'' said Patrick J. Lawler, chief economist for the agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the large mortgage buyers. ''But we are not looking at a bubble bursting across the country.''
 The biggest declines were seen in cities in the Midwest, where manufacturers have been laying off workers. Among states, prices fell 0.52 percent in Michigan and in four Northeast states -- New York (0.33 percent), Massachusetts (0.49 percent), New Hampshire (0.14 percent) and Rhode Island (0.37 percent).
 Still, several pockets of strong growth remained. Five Western states -- Idaho, Utah, Oregon, Arizona and Washington -- had the biggest price increases, ranging from 1 percent to 4.7 percent. And on the Gulf Coast, a shortage of housing and the slow pace of rebuilding sent home prices soaring in markets that were affected by Hurricane Katrina. Prices rose 15.8 percent from a year earlier in New Orleans, 23.3 percent in Gulfport-Biloxi, Miss., and 17.5 percent in Mobile, Ala.
 Unlike data collected by the National Association of Realtors, which have shown declines in the median price of homes sold in the last three months, the federal housing office's index is still rising. That difference is a result of the way the government compiles its index, housing specialists say. It measures repeat sales of the same houses over time, while the Realtors report median prices of houses sold in a period. 
 If a large number of modest homes are sold in a given month relative to a year earlier, the Realtors data will indicate that prices have fallen, even if the price on any specific property has not changed appreciably. Also, the government index does not include condominiums, and condo sales and prices have fallen far faster than those of single-family homes.
 Taken together, the two data series suggest that moderately priced single-family homes are doing better than more expensive properties, said S. Lawrence Yun, a senior economist at the Realtors association. 
 Mr. Lawler said an adjustment in home prices should come as no surprise given that prices rose 55 percent nationally in the last five years, with some hotter markets posting even bigger gains. He noted that, adjusting for inflation, prices fell in the early 1980s and the early 1990s after periods of strong gains. What is surprising about the recent flattening in prices, however, is that it has not been prompted by economic weakness and job losses, as was the case in those previous periods. 
 ''This market has been unusual over the past few years because we had a recession'' earlier in the decade, Mr. Lawler said, ''and the market didn't weaken, and now the housing market is weakening and we don't have a recession.''
 The weakness in housing appears to be more muted and gradual than many had predicted. The recent decline in long-term interest has provided critical support to the housing market, Mr. Lawler said. Nationally, the average 30-year fixed mortgage carried an interest rate of 6.14 percent this week, down from 6.76 percent in July and roughly where it was in January, according to Freddie Mac.
 National and local data on home prices may not reflect reality as lived by people trying to buy or sell homes, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com. Housing reports are based on transactions, and because many sellers are reluctant to cut prices and buyers are waiting for prices to fall further, the number of homes being sold has fallen significantly.

HEADLINE: Winds Blow For Rollback Of Regulation

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Sometimes it is the times that control what politicians do, whether or not they really want to do it.
 Consider the state of regulation of American securities markets and some of the major players in those markets, notably the auditing firms and the investment banks.
 President Bush came to office with a clear bias against heavy regulation, and Harvey L. Pitt, his first chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, made it a priority to improve relations with auditing firms when he took office. 
 Then came Enron and WorldCom. A nearly unanimous Congress passed, and President Bush signed, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, dramatically increasing regulation. 
 Mr. Bush's Justice Department set up a task force to deal with corporate crime and it brought criminal charges against Arthur Andersen, a major accounting firm that had been Enron's accountant. The firm promptly went out of business.
 Auditors, accustomed to very light self-regulation, got a regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, that was quite willing to tell them how to conduct audits and to force them to redo audits it found inadequate.
 At first glance, now would not seem to be the logical time to push an antiregulatory agenda. By no means are Democrats automatically pro-regulation, but they are less likely than Republicans to be against it, and they will control Congress in the next two years. Mr. Bush appears to be weakened.
 But many business leaders are hopeful that at least some of what they see as post-Enron excesses can be rolled back, with a battle cry of making America more competitive. Companies complain that auditors spend too much money and time auditing internal controls. Wall Street argues that it is such rules -- and not higher investment banking or listing fees -- that keep foreign stocks from listing in New York. Auditors, companies and corporate directors say it is too easy to sue them.
 One agenda for change was presented in New York yesterday by an unofficial Committee on Capital Markets Regulation that was formed with the blessing of Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. 
 That group says American capital markets must have less regulation if they are to compete with newly vigorous foreign markets, but it asserts that it has no desire to let bad executives get away with anything. That claim is not enhanced by the fact that the group received financing from the Starr Foundation, which was started by Maurice R. Greenberg.
 Many bosses got into trouble with regulators for playing games with their own companies' numbers. But Mr. Greenberg is unique in that he also found a way for the American International Group, which he headed, to profit from helping other companies produce misleading financial statements. He lost his job after the S.E.C. and the New York attorney general's office found his actions reprehensible. The committee wants to clamp down on both of those regulators.
 A harsh way of looking at one of the committee's most important recommendations is that it proposes to give the S.E.C. a taste of its own medicine by tying it up in bureaucratic knots.
 The S.E.C. says it already looks at the cost-benefit ratio when it adopts rules, but the committee proposes setting up a new regulatory apparatus to make that more formal. And it raises the possibility that the president could direct his Working Group on Capital Markets to do its own cost-benefit analyses of commission rules. That group includes the Treasury secretary and the chairmen of the Federal Reserve, the S.E.C. and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
 W. Glenn Hubbard, an economist who is dean of the Columbia University Business School and a former economic adviser to President Bush, is a co-chairman of the committee and a leading advocate of such rules.
 When I asked him if some would see politics in the idea of the Working Group looking over the S.E.C.'s shoulder, he seemed surprised. 
 ''We propose that the president's working group take a look at the analysis,'' he said. ''Arguably there is a tremendous amount of expertise in the Treasury and the Fed, and I don't think that anyone, or at least anyone responsible, would describe the Treasury and Fed staff as political.'' 
 If the Working Group criticized an S.E.C. rule, there would be heavy pressure to change it, even if the group lacked formal authority. The chances are that there would be fewer rules coming out of the S.E.C.
 The S.E.C. is already set to introduce efforts to make audits of corporate financial controls -- required by Sarbanes-Oxley -- less expensive for smaller companies. What this report does is place on the table a variety of other ideas that companies will love. The proposals would make it harder to sue companies and easier for directors to escape liability if their companies blew up.
 The regulatory rollback winds are blowing. It will be up to Congress, the Treasury and the S.E.C. to determine whether they blow over important safeguards for investors in the name of reducing excessive regulation.

HEADLINE: Spending and Income Data Confirms Fed Economic Outlook

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve, holding short-term interest rates firm at 5.25 percent, should see little reason in the latest consumer spending and income report to shift its posture. 
 Just this week, the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned that inflation remained ''uncomfortably high.'' He signaled that if anything, the Fed's next move would be up, not down. And a report yesterday from the Commerce Department essentially confirmed that position, finding that consumer spending in October chugged along while wages rose and inflation held steady.
The data showed that an index of inflation that the Fed closely tracks had advanced last month at an annual rate of 2.4 percent -- the same as September. The economists who set monetary policy at the Fed typically like to see that index, known as the core personal consumption expenditure deflator, no higher than 2 percent on an annual basis. 
 On a monthly basis, the core index rose 0.2 percent in October.
 At the same time, personal spending advanced at a stronger-than-expected clip last month, growing by 0.2 percent for the month. Spending in September fell 0.2 percent. For the year, spending rose 5 percent.
 Incomes grew, but not quite at the same pace as in September. 
 Growth was 0.4 percent in October, compared with 0.5 percent a month earlier.
 Taken together, the numbers paint a picture similar to the one Mr. Bernanke sketched out this week: an economy expanding at a steady pace but still threatened by high inflation.
 ''There's nothing in this report that would necessarily bend the Fed one way or the other,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist with Global Insight. ''You don't want to get too excited about this,'' he added. ''It's good news, but consumers are still being somewhat tentative in terms of their shopping.''
 With the housing market slowdown dragging down the rest of the economy, consumer spending needs to remain strong to prevent too tight of a contraction. Falling energy prices have allowed for some slack in household budgets, but it remains unclear whether Americans are spending the money they are saving on gasoline. The new government data suggests they are both spending that money and saving it.
 The nation's personal savings rate showed an improvement last month, though it remained negative. It stood at a negative $53.8 billion in October, compared with negative $69.1 billion in September. It was the second consecutive month that savings grew stronger.
 Still, some economists said they expected spending to be higher in October, given that gas prices have fallen so much since the summer. ''Given the massive decline in energy prices we saw in those two months it is a major setback,'' Capital Economics, an economics research firm in London, said in a report.
 And a separate report yesterday on manufacturing in the Midwest raised concerns about whether growth will be choked off too tightly.
 The National Association of Purchasing Management Chicago said its index of area business activity fell this month to the lowest level in three and a half years. The index was measured at 49.9 in November. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing activity.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Besieged New Leader Faces Tough Challenges

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.; Antonio Betancourt and Elizabeth Malkin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
It is a measure of the problems Felipe Calderon will confront as president when he is sworn in on Friday that both his conservative supporters and leftist opponents have camped out on the dais in Congress where the ceremony is to take place. 
 The leftists swear they will stop Mr. Calderon from taking the oath of office. The conservatives vow to ensure that he does. The standoff has become comic, as legislators from both sides have stayed up all night singing ranchero songs in between hurling fists and insults.
But the antics in Congress reflect a real gulf between people throughout this country that opened during the hotly contested national elections in July. They also reveal the paralysis that Mr. Calderon will have to overcome to deal with a range of pressing issues from job creation and poverty relief to a worsening war between drug cartels and violent social strife. 
 Mr. Calderon won by a bare 240,000 votes, and his main opponent, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a populist former mayor of Mexico City, has never conceded defeat, charging that the presidential election was rigged against him by a powerful alliance of businessmen and President Vicente Fox, who belongs to Mr. Calderon's conservative National Action Party. 
 That Mr. Lopez Obrador's supporters do not recognize him as the winner is only one of Mr. Calderon's woes. More than 2,000 people have died this year in an underworld war between drug cartels, among them scores of police officers and other law enforcement officials. 
 The United States, meanwhile, has hardened its position against illegal immigration, a traditional escape valve for the unemployed. And the southern state of Oaxaca continues to be crippled as leftist protesters seeking the ouster of the governor have clashed repeatedly with government paramilitary groups, leaving more than a dozen people dead and scores wounded.
 What is more, Mr. Lopez Obrador, the candidate of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party, has declared himself ''the legitimate president'' of Mexico. He has set up a shadow government and has promised to call mass protests any time Mr. Calderon makes decisions on policy that the leftist party does not agree with.
 While Mr. Lopez Obrador is clearly running the risk of becoming a professional political gadfly, he also threatens to be a permanent thorn in the side of Mr. Calderon's presidency.
 Mr. Calderon, 44, the man who must take on these challenges, possesses little charisma, even his admirers admit. But he is a stubborn and pragmatic politician. 
 ''He lacks worldliness, he lacks vision, but it is nothing that cannot be learned, and there comes into play his tenacity,'' said German Dehesa, a writer and columnist. 
 Political analysts say it would be a mistake to underestimate Mr. Calderon, who holds advanced degrees in law, economics and public administration. The son of one of the Nation Action Party's founders, he has been active in politics since he was a youth and became the party's youngest leader in its history in 1993. 
 Most recently, he served for 13 months in the Fox administration, first as the head of a development bank and then as energy minister. He served two terms in Congress and proved to be a tough negotiator when he was the head of the party's delegation from 2000 to 2003, good at forming coalitions and bridging partisan differences. That is a skill he will need to navigate the rough waters ahead -- and one Mr. Fox never seemed to possess. 
 ''Felipe Calderon is a very young man, an intelligent man, who is clear about the relations he must have with political forces, relations that President Fox never had,'' said Jaime Sanchez Susarrey, a conservative columnist. 
 Mr. Calderon's campaign revealed his ability to surprise. He soundly beat Mr. Fox's chosen candidate for the party's nomination last year and then went on to narrowly defeat Mr. Lopez Obrador with a well-oiled negative campaign. Only six months earlier, the leftist candidate had been predicted to win by at least 10 percentage points. 
 Since the nation's highest electoral court declared him the winner in early September, Mr. Calderon has done his best to call for unity and reconciliation. He has said his top priorities will be fighting poverty and reducing crime. He has promised tax incentives to spur investment and vows to reorganize Mexico's fractured and ineffective police forces to take on drug cartels.
 ''In the light of all the problems and national challenges, now is the time for unity and not futile divisions,'' he said in a recent speech.
 His choices for cabinet members have suggested that he may take a hard line against the sort of civil disobedience that has disrupted Mexico for the last few months. For instance, he appointed Francisco Ramirez Acuna, a former governor of Jalisco, to the all-important post of interior minister. As governor, Mr. Acuna gained notoriety for brutally quashing leftist protesters in May 2004.
 Mr. Calderon has also tapped a former high-ranking official of the International Monetary Fund, Agustin Carstens, to lead his budget office, sending a signal that he intends to follow a tight monetary policy, keep inflation low and avoid overspending on public programs.
 The country Mr. Calderon inherits on Friday has changed in many ways since 2000, when Mr. Fox's election ended the 71-year monopoly on power held by the Institutional Revolutionary Party. Under Mr. Fox, Mexico has become a country with stronger democratic institutions, vociferous public debate and the end of an imperial-style presidency. 
 Mr. Fox managed to put an end to decades of economic mismanagement. He also made some headway with social programs, particularly a vast public housing initiative that provided low-cost mortgages to millions of households. The number of families living in desperate poverty has dropped.
 But Mr. Fox's tenure was a disappointment in many other ways. 
 As the election made clear, social divisions and a lack of opportunity still define the country. At least a quarter of working-age Mexicans labor in an underground economy, selling contraband in street markets or washing cars in parking lots. Some 400,000 emigrate to the United States every year in search of work. 
 Mr. Fox also failed to get key energy and tax reforms through a divided Congress. Oil production at the government-owned oil monopoly has begun to fall, even as the government continues to depend on oil revenues rather than tax collection, a barrier to deeper political reform. 
 Nor did Mr. Fox take on the public and private monopolies, like those in energy and telecommunications. Changes in labor laws never made it to Congress, and Mr. Fox was unwilling to curb public employee unions, particularly the teachers' union. 
 Mr. Calderon will now have to address the leftover slate of issues. One of his greatest challenges will be to create jobs that could finally begin to reduce Mexico's vast income gap, one of the widest in the world. But to do that he will need to form alliances in the divided Congress to push through the changes that Mr. Fox could not. 
 He will face opposition from some of Mexico's business leaders, who have fought attempts to break the dominance of a few big companies. It will be hard, since many of them also backed his campaign. He must also take on powerful unions that oppose competition in the energy industry and changes to the education system.
 In a speech earlier this month, Mr. Calderon said his goal was ''a clean Mexico, a Mexico, in short, that has the conditions our children deserve to live in, a truly winning Mexico in a world that competes ferociously.''
 ''Todo this, it is necessary to put aside our differences, to reach agreements and define a strategy for the country that we want, that Mexican's dream of and that should be reality for the next generation.''

HEADLINE: Dissent Weakens Coalition Pressing Iran on Nuclear Program 

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: DEAD SEA, Jordan, Nov. 30 

 BODY:
After months of missed deadlines, threats and counterproposals in the effort to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions, the fragile coalition of six world powers that has been facing down Tehran may be about to splinter. 
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sounded fed up Thursday with Russia's refusal to sign on to the list of United Nations Security Council sanctions the United States would like to see enacted against Iran.
A senior administration official in Jordan with Ms. Rice said the United States would soon be ready to force the issue by calling for a vote. 
 ''Unity is not an end in itself,'' Ms. Rice told reporters, in answer to a question about whether the United States was willing to sacrifice a tough sanctions resolution in order to keep the Russians on board. ''I'm all for maintaining unity, but I'm also all for action.''
 Her comments came during a roundtable with reporters on the outskirts of a democracy meeting with Arab leaders in Jordan.
 The Iran sanctions issue has been a vexing one for Ms. Rice. It has been six months since the six powers -- the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and China -- offered Iran a list of incentives to stop enriching uranium and threatened sanctions if Iran did not. In June, at the time of the initial offer, American officials said Iran had ''weeks, not months'' to comply.
 Since then, Iran has not complied, and since September, the six powers have been working on a Security Council resolution. But Russia has balked at the tougher sanctions sought by the United States, Britain and France.
 A new draft resolution under consideration at the United Nations has dropped all mention of sanctions against Iran's first nuclear power plant at Bushehr, American and European diplomats said. The United States had initially proposed including Bushehr on the list of programs to single out, but Russia, which has been helping build the power plant with the Iranians, objected.
 On Wednesday, Agence France-Presse reported that the International Atomic Energy Agency investigation of Iran's nuclear program was still being hampered by unanswered questions about work hidden by Tehran for almost two decades.
 Tehran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes, an assertion that is disputed by the United States and its allies.
 A senior Bush administration official said that if the six powers could not come to an agreement on the sanctions resolution before the end of the year, the United States would seek to put a resolution up for a vote in a bid to force Russia to take a public stance.

HEADLINE: A Broken Iraq: Who Owns It Now?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Ten Months or Ten Years,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, Nov. 29):
Many who promoted the invasion of Iraq now seem to be salving their consciences by asserting that it was a good idea, just badly executed. Mr. Friedman repeats this claim, saying, ''Had we properly occupied the country, and begun political therapy, it is possible an American iron fist could have held Iraq together long enough to put it on a new course.''
 It would be a tragic mistake to allow this narrative to prevail, lest some years from now we find ourselves willing to try a similar adventure, only ''doing it right.'' 
 The nature of armed conflict has changed, as has the nature of states and their relation to nonstate actors, as we have learned to our sorrow and that of the Iraqis. 
 Invading Iraq to impose a democracy was never a good idea, however executed. We need to recognize that.

Williamstown, Mass., Nov. 29, 2006

The writer is a professor of anthropology at Williams College.

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes about the war in Iraq as if the initial invasion he supported was a good idea that was spoiled by poor American implementation. That does a disservice to the large body of evidence that existed before the war that occupation would be complex, costly and fraught with peril.
 Nationalism, whether Iraqi or otherwise, is a potent force. Counterinsurgency operations in a foreign land are always very difficult, and often fail. 
 The decision to invade Iraq, not simply the policies that followed, was deeply flawed. It will stand as one of the great blunders in the history of American foreign policy. 

Jeremy Pressman
Storrs, Conn., Nov. 29, 2006

The writer is an assistant professor of political science at the University of Connecticut.

To the Editor:
 The choice between withdrawing from Iraq or ''reinvading'' Iraq is difficult. Even opponents of the initial invasion recognize the need to stabilize the region. 
 Elections in Iraq, one of the few achievements of American intervention, could provide a way to determine whether there is sufficient Iraqi support to make increased military intervention successful. 
 The United States should offer a referendum in Iraq that proposes that the United States will increase its military commitment to a level sufficient to establish order if (1) a supermajority of Iraqis vote to request an expanded American force and (2) future oil revenues are pledged to offset the cost. 
 If the supermajority voted for an increased American military force, then we would have a clear mandate with popular support. If that majority did not want further American military intervention, then we would have a mandate to leave. 
 Either outcome would establish the power of public debate and democratic principles, and the United States would have achieved one of its goals in Iraq.

Stephen Tapscott
Seattle, Nov. 29, 2006

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman is right that the United States must either engage in a phased withdrawal from Iraq or else reinvade and do things right this time. 
 We should reinvade, reconquer and this time disarm all Iraqis: Sunni, Shiite and Kurd. Then we will have the basis for a truly democratic government that is concerned for the rights and protection of all Iraqis.
 The civil war in Iraq developed from the mistake in disbanding only the Iraqi Army, which was predominantly Sunni Muslim. 
 This left the Sunnis as a helpless minority in the face of the well-armed militias of the Shiites and the Kurds. 
 As a result, the Sunnis are now fighting for their lives against Shiite militia death squads in the Iraqi police and the Iraqi Army. The Saudis have warned that if the United States leaves and Iraq implodes into a slaughter of Sunnis by Shiites, they will intervene in Iraq to save Sunnis.
 So let's stay the course, disarm all factions and move toward a truly democratic Iraq that takes into account the hopes and wishes of all of its citizens. 

Francis Xavier Cunningham
Arlington, Va., Nov. 29, 2006

4To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes that his ''Pottery Barn rule'' -- ''You break it, you own it'' -- was wrong for Iraq. 
 What about when applied to Afghanistan? 
 We invaded Afghanistan for very different reasons, but we don't appear to be owning the problems of the current Taliban resurgence and the continued opium trade. 
 There are numerous other political and economic issues that are plaguing Afghanistan, but they are taking a back seat to the inferno that is now Iraq. 
 If the United States is serious about showing the world that we can keep our commitments, then let's start at the beginning and establish a real democracy in Afghanistan.

Greg Nowell
Merion, Pa., Nov. 29, 2006

To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes, ''We need to face our real choices in Iraq, which are: 10 months or 10 years.''
 After reading his column, I am moved to ask: Why didn't he write, ''10 minutes or 10 years''?

HEADLINE: There's Spending, and Then There's Spending

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THEY are not building homes at the pace they once did in the United States, but they are building stores and office buildings. And while car sales are weak, sales of other things are holding up quite well. 
 The American economy has so far managed to withstand the housing slump, and statistics released by the government this week showed that one reason is that construction crews have found other things to do.
In the third quarter of this year, spending on residential construction was 5 percent below what it had been a year earlier. It was the first year-over-year decline since 1995 and the largest drop since 1991, when the economy was coming out of a recession. The figures are based on actual spending, at seasonally adjusted annual rates, not adjusted for inflation.
 That decline follows one of the strongest periods ever for the housing construction business. Spending had been up by more than 10 percent, year over year, for 13 consecutive quarters, through the first quarter of this year. The only longer streak, of 14 quarters, ended in early 1979, a year before the economy fell into recession.
 But as can be seen from the charts, nonresidential construction spending in the third quarter was 27 percent higher than a year earlier. That was the fastest rate of gain in a quarter-century.
 The auto sector is another drain on the economy now. Spending on motor vehicles and parts has been down, year over year, for four consecutive quarters. That is something that last happened in 1991.
 But even with housing and car spending on the decline, consumers seem quite willing to keep spending on other things. The rate of growth in personal consumption expenditures on things other than energy and food has slipped, but not by a lot. In the third quarter, it was up 5.4 percent from a year earlier. That is down from the recent high of 6.4 percent, but the continued strength is one reason the economy has held up.
 Another, little appreciated, drag on the economy is the slowing growth in federal spending. It was up just 3.4 percent, year over year, in the last quarter, for the smallest growth rate of the Bush administration. Given the size of federal deficits, a rapid acceleration of federal spending -- the kind of spending that might be called upon to help avoid or escape a recession -- might not be easy to manage.
 Offsetting that, however, is a surge in spending by state and local governments. Their spending has been up more than 7 percent, year over year, for four straight quarters. There had not been such a string of increases since 2000, before the technology stock bubble burst and the economy slid into recession in 2001.
 If business investment can continue at high levels, and if consumers continue to be willing to spend on day-to-day things, then the economy may be able to keep growing until the housing recession finally ends. That is what many economists think will happen.

HEADLINE: Today In Business Jobs Added In Canada 

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Canadian employers added 22,400 jobs in November, more than economists expected, but the unemployment rate rose to 6.3 percent from October's 6.2 percent, as more people entered the labor force looking for work, Statistics Canada said. Much of the increase in jobs came as companies hired part-time workers in manufacturing, transportation and professional services. Manufacturers hired 13,200 people, and transport and warehousing companies hired another 15,000, replacing workers that were laid off in industries and provinces that were previously battered by the effects of the country's high dollar and slower demand in the United States for Canadian products.

HEADLINE: Extra Weight, Higher Costs

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
As you snatch a couple more Christmas cookies or down another eggnog, you might be thinking about what those extra calories will do to your health. 
 But have you considered what they will do to your wealth? The sugar and fat will add pounds, which can lead to heart disease, diabetes and a shortened life span.
There is another consequence to packing on extra weight: being fat costs money -- tens of thousands of dollars over a lifetime. 
 Heavy people do not spend more than normal-size people on food, but their life insurance premiums are two to four times as large. They can expect higher medical expenses, and they tend to make less money and accumulate less wealth in their shortened lifetimes. They can have a harder time being hired, and then a harder time winning plum assignments and promotions. 
 We're not talking about people who are merely carrying a few extra pounds, or only those who are Jabba the Hutt in their dimensions, either. People carrying 30 to 40 pounds extra can be affected. 
 ''Being overweight can be dangerous to your wealth,'' said Jay L. Zagorsky, an economist at Ohio State University who has looked at the relationship between various economic and sociological factors and a measure of obesity called the body mass index.
 Doctors use the index to determine whether a person is merely overweight or dangerously obese. You divide your weight in pounds by the square of your height in inches, which is then multiplied by 703, to adjust the English-system measurements to the metric system. (You could use kilograms and centimeters, but that would be too easy.) Or use a Web calculator like the one at www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/ or www.halls.md/ideal-weight/body.htm.
 Anything under 25 is considered a normal reading of the index. From 25 to 30 is overweight, and above 30 is obese. People who rate above 40 are considered morbidly obese, meaning they are facing serious and sustained health problems.
 The index has been criticized for its inability to distinguish between a well-muscled person and a fat one. Nevertheless, it is by this measure that academics estimate that 97 million Americans, about a third of the population, are considered obese. Almost 10 million Americans could be considered morbidly obese.
 Academics have struggled to place a price tag on the cost of treating those carrying around too much weight. The obese suffer from heart disease, diabetes, depression, arthritis and joint problems, liver disease and sleep apnea.
 Complications from obesity, particularly diabetes, which afflicts 21 million Americans, push up the bill: $44,000 for a heart attack, $40,200 for a stroke or $37,000 for end-state kidney disease, estimates Judith A. O'Brien, the director of cost research at the Caro Research Institute, a health costs consulting firm. Amputating just a toe, a not uncommon consequence of untreated diabetes, averages $15,000, she estimates. 
 Academics have not spent much time calculating what that care costs the overweight individual. Instead, they look at what obesity costs society or insurers. The sum usually arrived at is about $80 billion a year and steadily growing. The government or insurers pay about 85 percent of that. In other words, the fit and the fat pay for it indirectly through taxes or higher health insurance premiums.
 This year, two nutritional scientists at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, Rachel N. Close and Dale A. Schoeller, took a unique twist on the calculations to determine what ''supersizing'' a fast-food meal costs society. Paying 67 cents to supersize an order -- 73 percent more calories for 17 percent more money -- adds an average of 36 grams of adipose tissue. The future medical costs for that bargain would be $6.64 for an obese man and $3.46 for an obese woman. ''The hidden financial costs associated with weight gain from upsizing a value meal may help convince people it is not a bargain,'' Mr. Schoeller said.
 Even routine care can put a dent in a family's finances. Office visits and prescriptions for medicines to manage diabetes, high cholesterol, back pain and depression can reach $7,000 in annual out-of-pocket expenses for someone -- admittedly one with nearly every problem associated with obesity -- covered by an employer's health insurance, according to an online health care cost estimator United HealthGroup provides to its customers. 
 While the health problems ravage savings, an overweight person may have difficulty accumulating a nest egg in the first place. One of the earliest sociological studies of the overweight, in 1966, found that the heaviest students had a harder time getting into top colleges. More recent studies have found that the obese, particularly white women, are paid less. A study by John H. Cawley, an associate professor of human ecology at Cornell University, found that a weight increase of 64 pounds above the average for white women was associated with 9 percent lower wages. 
 Evidence from decades of discrimination studies has led Mark V. Roehling, an associate professor at the School of Labor and Industrial Relations at Michigan State University, to the conclusion that there is ''consistent evidence of weight discrimination.''
 One factor is that some employers do not want to be burdened with higher health insurance costs. Other times it is a matter of appearances or a belief that ''people of size,'' as Mr. Roehling terms the obese, are lazy, weak-willed or considered too unattractive to interact with customers. He has found that some employers are upfront about it, even in Michigan, which is the only state that outlaws weight discrimination. 
 While conducting research, he said, he was told by a personnel manager, who himself was overweight, that the company would not hire overweight people, even after Mr. Roehling told him that was illegal. The bias is more pronounced toward white women than white men, Mr. Roehling said: ''Blacks are more accepting of large people and whites are more accepting of overweight black females.'' 
 Mr. Roehling is convinced that weight bias is stronger than bias stemming from race. You can test that thesis yourself with the Implicit Association Test, at implicit.harvard.edu/implicit. It was created by researchers at Harvard, the University of Virginia and the University of Washington to plumb an individual's attitude toward race, ethnicity and religion. Take the test for prejudice against overweight people and compare your result against the similar test for race. 
 Brian A. Nosek, a psychology professor at the University of Virginia who helped develop it, said that test results showed that bias against blacks and the overweight was about equal, but that while people rarely admit to race bias, they freely admit to weight bias. ''There is no social sanction against saying you don't like fat people,'' Mr. Nosek said.
 The weight penalties come in other forms as well. Sociologists have long noted that in developed countries, the higher-status people tend to be thin and the lower- status ones are fat. ''That heavier people have a harder time getting married is pretty well supported,'' said Jeffery Sobal, a professor at Cornell University who has studied obesity. Marriage can be crucial in wealth creation, especially when a person ''marries up'' to someone with money or a higher education. That may be a rarer occurrence for the obese. ''There is a stigma against the overweight that plays out in the social class world,'' he said.
 The end result? The obese accumulate only about half the assets of the normal-size American, said Mr. Zagorsky, the Ohio State University research scientist. He matched B.M.I. and wealth data in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, a multiyear sampling done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and found that for every one-point increase in the index, net worth dropped by $1,000. The typical female baby boomer, he said, earned $313.70 less annually for every one-point increase in her B.M.I., while the typical male earned $161.30 less for every point.
 A chicken-or-egg question invariably pops up. Are people fat because they are poor or poor because they are fat? 
 ''We can never prove causality in social science,'' Mr. Zagorsky said. ''As an experiment, I can't force people to eat or force them not to eat.'' But he said that if wealth causes the change in weight, then people who receive inheritances should show a corresponding drop in their B.M.I. That does not happen, so he asserts that weight drives the lack of wealth. 
 Mr. Zagorsky's data revealed an odd finding about inheritances. Thin people tend to receive bigger inheritances. He is not sure why, but he thought it could be because people with low B.M.I.'s live longer and their parents tend to live longer, so wealth has a longer time to accumulate before it is transferred. 
 What happens to a person who loses weight? Mr. Zagorsky said a drastic drop in weight corresponds to an increase in wealth. A baby boomer whose B.M.I. drops from 27.5, the middle of the overweight category, to 21.7, the middle of the normal category, sees an increase in wealth of $4,085. The impact of weight loss on wealth was considerably less for black women and it appeared to make no difference for black men. But a B.M.I. decrease of 10 points corresponds to a wealth increase of $12,720 for white men and slightly less for white women. 
 But it has to be a big loss in weight. ''You can't just drop 10 pounds and change your wealth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One Threat Averted But More Await G.M.

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Top executives of General Motors, wrestling with one of the biggest financial crises in its history, have not had much to celebrate this year.
 But they scored a big victory late Thursday when the billionaire Kirk Kerkorian retreated, selling off the last of $1.2 billion in shares he bought last year in a bid to shake up the company's strategy and possibly its management ranks.
 He had caused them no end of consternation in the last 18 months, trying to push G.M. into an alliance with two foreign automakers, Renault of France and Nissan of Japan. 
 In many respects, this city has felt under siege from outsiders and, to many, Mr. Kerkorian's departure could not come too soon. ''Goodbye and don't let the door hit you in the tushie,'' said one reader comment posted Friday on the Web site of The Detroit Free Press after an article about Mr. Kerkorian's decision.
 But seen from another perspective, Mr. Kerkorian's departure represents not so much a surrender as a lack of faith in the future of G.M.
 And he has a lot of company. About 35,000 workers decided last summer to take G.M.'s incentive packages to leave or retire early from jobs that have been a ticket to prosperity for generations of blue-collar workers. This week, Ford Motor disclosed a preliminary tally that 36,000 of its workers were taking similar deals to leave the company.
 With these buyouts, too, there is some good news for leaders at G.M. and Ford. In a matter of months, they have been able to drastically reduce their long-term labor-cost structure.
 That is a big boost in both companies' efforts to transform themselves in the face of another siege, by foreign competitors, who are wresting market share from them every month.
 But the successes are tinged with defeat -- of a way of doing business that built G.M. and Ford into symbols of American industrial power. In a sense, they are a vote of no-confidence from both a big investor and thousands of men and women who worked in their factories.
 ''Kerkorian's going away puts a brighter spotlight on G.M. management to prove that it can fix the company,'' said John Casesa, an auto industry analyst with Casesa Shapiro Partners.
 Auto workers, meanwhile, are ''sending a message that these businesses will not return to the level of prosperity that they once had,'' Mr. Casesa added.
 Indeed, the bad news for Detroit continued this week.
 On Friday, November sales figures showed that Toyota pushed past Ford for the second month this year to rank as the country's No. 2 carmaker, behind G.M. Ford, in fact, fell below DaimlerChrysler to fourth place.
 This week, Ford had to mortgage virtually all its most valuable assets -- including its factories, the Swedish automaker Volvo and even its blue oval trademark -- to guarantee $18 billion in loans that will pay for its turnaround efforts.
 It was a high-stakes version of a home equity loan, and it was a significant gamble by the company's new chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who joined Ford in September from Boeing.
 To be sure, Mr. Mulally has reassured employees that Ford's turnaround program, the Way Forward, will save the company.
 G.M. executives are also confident that they are making the right moves to help their company return to prosperity.
 In Los Angeles this week, G.M.'s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, announced that his company was developing a hybrid-electric vehicle that could be plugged in to be recharged, giving G.M. a step up on Toyota, which is only studying the idea despite having a broad lineup of hybrid models.
 Appearing with Tiger Woods alongside another new model, a sport utility vehicle called the Buick Enclave that is built on a car chassis, Mr. Wagoner said he was confident the turnaround efforts he was leading were taking hold but he said more work remained.
 David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., said Mr. Kerkorian's retreat essentially provided more short-term security for Mr. Wagoner. Now the company can continue to carry out its turnaround plan, seemingly without the threat that Mr. Kerkorian might try to gain control.
 ''It was the shootout at the O.K. Corral that never materialized,'' Mr. Cole said.
 Recent improvements in G.M.'s financial situation hurt Mr. Kerkorian's case that the company needed new leadership, and he apparently decided he could not afford the time it would take to get his way, Mr. Cole said.
 Even so, it was a surprise that Mr. Kerkorian backed away so quickly, especially since G.M. gave a board seat in February to his representative, Jerome B. York, said Charles Elson, a professor at the University of Delaware and an expert in corporate governance.
 Mr. York left the G.M. board in October, after G.M. broke off talks with Renault and Nissan that Mr. Kerkorian had encouraged.
 ''I'm sorry Mr. York didn't stay,'' Professor Elson said. ''The lesson you learn is you stick it out; you might not win on first blush, but you might win the next time.''
 If Mr. Kerkorian returns for a next round, however, it could mean that Mr. Wagoner has not succeeded in his primary task of overhauling G.M. so that it can withstand competition from Toyota, which is on track to pass G.M. to become the world's biggest carmaker, perhaps as soon as next year.
 Should that happen, the global industry would be led by a company with solid profit and billions of cash to reinvest in itself, said Jonathan Steinmetz, an industry analyst with Morgan Stanley.
 In a research report Friday, Mr. Steinmetz said Mr. Kerkorian's departure could turn out to be another loss for G.M. ''''Having somebody chase after you often makes you run faster than you otherwise would,'' Mr. Steinmetz wrote.
 Indeed, no one in the industry should become complacent. ''''The uncertainties are just enormous out there, between gas prices and the Middle East,'' said Michael Useem, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 No matter how tempting it might be to celebrate, he added, ''For the moment, it is tough times in Detroit.''

Wall Street stumbled yesterday after a survey showed manufacturing unexpectedly contracted in November for the first time in more than three years, raising concerns that the economy will not be able to achieve a soft landing.
 Stocks and the dollar were hurt after the Institute for Supply Management said its index of manufacturing fell to 49.5 from 51.2 in October. Economists had been expecting 51.5. Anything under 50 indicates that the manufacturing sector is contracting.
The report, based on a survey of corporate purchasing managers, was seen by some on Wall Street as a sign that the Federal Reserve might have overshot the mark in more than two years of interest rate increases that ended in June. Wall Street had been expecting that the Fed would hold interest rates steady at its Dec. 12 meeting, and now there is a growing belief that the central bank may soon cut rates because of economic weakness. 
 ''This is just additional confirmation that the economy is not only slowing but quite possibly going into a recession,'' said Hugh Moore, a partner with the investment firm Guerite Advisors. ''It's not just the housing and auto industry any longer, now we're finding out that manufacturing in general is slowing.''
 Mr. Moore said a number below 50 in the institute's manufacturing index has preceded every recession in the United States since the 1960s.
 The Big Board was led lower in volatile trading by the shares of manufacturers like 3M, Caterpillar and United States Steel. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 27.80 points, or 0.23 percent, to 12,194.13.
 Broader stock indicators also declined. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.92 points, or 0.28 percent, to 1,396.71, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 18.56 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,413.21.
 The drop does not bode well for Wall Street hopes to finish the year with double-digit growth. The Dow is up 13.78 percent so far this year, while the S.&P. 500 has gained 11.89 percent and the Nasdaq is up 9.43 percent.
 The news about the manufacturing index had a big effect on other markets. Bonds rose, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury note gaining 7/32, to 101 17/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to an 11-month low of 4.43 percent from 4.46 percent late Thursday.
 The dollar continued its slide against major currencies, except the yen. The dollar was also hit by a Commerce Department report that construction spending posted its biggest decline in five years during October.
 Yesterday's news focused attention on afternoon speeches by the presidents of several regional banks of the Federal Reserve system though the comments ultimately seemed to have little effect. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, made no comment on the economic outlook during a speech yesterday morning, although on Tuesday he said that risks from inflation could further complicate an economy suffering from a general slowdown.
 Michael Moskow, president of the Chicago Fed, said yesterday that inflation was moving in the right direction but that further interest rate increases could be necessary. 
 The weak manufacturing snapshot came after a report Thursday from Chicago-area corporate purchasing managers that indicated business activity in the Midwest slowed faster than anticipated. It also follows a bigger-than-expected decline in home sales for October.
 Manufacturers were among the biggest decliners, touching sectors from chip makers to steel companies. Caterpillar fell 84 cents, to $61.19. Intel declined 47 cents, or 2.2 percent, to $20.93. United States Steel fell $1.79, or 2.4 percent, to $73. 3M was off $1.48, to $79.98.
 Automakers were also in focus as they reported November car and truck sales. Ford fell 9 cents, to $8.04, after it reported sales in the United States slipped 9.6 percent, while DaimlerChrysler dropped 29 cents, to $57.99, after posting a 4.7 percent rise. Toyota's monthly sales surpassed Ford's for only the second time ever.
 General Motors rose 46 cents, to $29.69, in heavy volume after a report that the financier Kirk Kerkorian shed his stake in the automaker for more than $800 million. Investors seemed little moved by the company's November auto sales report, which showed an increase of 5.8 percent.
 Home Depot shares surged $1, or 2.6 percent, to $38.97 on speculation the home improvement chain might be an acquisition target by several private equity firms.
 H&R Block declined after it reported a wider-than-expected loss during the second quarter as its mortgage lending arm continues to lose money. H&R Block fell 25 cents, to $23.75.
 Warner Music Group fell 62 cents, to $24.80, after third-quarter results fell short of Wall Street projections.

HEADLINE: Nature Getting the Blame For Costly Orange Juice 

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN; Eric Ferkenhoff contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
The cost of breakfast is going up courtesy of four hurricanes and a tenacious citrus disease.
 The average price of a gallon of orange juice is 14 percent higher this year, according to statistics compiled by ACNielsen, the market research firm. Prices averaged $5.09 a gallon at the end of October compared with $4.45 a year earlier.
Tropicana, a division of PepsiCo and the nation's largest producer of orange juice, and Minute Maid, part of the Coca-Cola Company, say consumers should see more price increases or fewer discounts in coming months because of what is expected to be a lackluster crop. 
 Prices for orange juice had been relatively flat for a number of years. 
 The current crop of oranges is estimated to be the smallest in 17 years, 135 million boxes compared with a harvest in excess of 200 million boxes before a string of hurricanes hit in 2004 and 2005. A box represents 90 pounds of oranges. Florida produces about 80 percent of the orange juice consumed in the United States.
 Andrew Meadows, a spokesman for the Florida Department of Citrus, said the orange crop for 2006 and 2007 was anticipated to be the smallest since a series of freezes in the 1980s -- the last of them in December 1989 -- devastated Florida's orange industry. 
 This time, the orange shortfall results from a series of events that began in 2004, when three hurricanes -- Charley, Frances and Jeanne -- hit the citrus-growing regions of Florida. Last year, Hurricane Wilma did more damage to the areas.
 Mr. Meadows said the hurricanes crisscrossed the state in such a way that nearly every acre with citrus groves was affected in some way. In the worst case, trees were uprooted, while in other instances nearly ripened fruit was blown off trees or trees were damaged, he said.
 The shortage of fruit has been made worse by lingering problems from citrus canker disease, which started in Dade County in 1995 and has spread through the state, in part on the winds of the hurricanes. As a result, an estimated 10 percent of the state's orange groves have been burned in an effort to impede the disease, Mr. Meadows said.
 Last year's crop was 148 million boxes, and the 2004 season's crop was 150 million boxes, compared with 242 million boxes in 2003.
 In the past, the Florida citrus industry has responded to bad crops by planting new trees, but it appears it will be difficult to do so on a large scale this time around. Many of Florida's nurseries were damaged by citrus canker disease, and land values are so high in the state that it is hard to justify planting new orange groves, according to Thomas H. Spreen, professor and chairman of the food and resource economics department at the University of Florida.
 ''Twenty years ago, people would have been planting trees like crazy,'' he said. ''We don't think the industry is going to suddenly collapse, but we don't think it's going to recover like it did after the freezes in the 80s.''
 The smaller crops have nonetheless been a boon to growers whose trees have continued to produce fruit. Prices for a box of oranges are hovering around $10, compared with $3 a box during the bumper crops before the hurricanes, Professor Spreen said.
 ''I own 60 acres myself, and we are going to make a bunch of money this year, and I don't even have a very good crop,'' he said.
 But the orange shortage has created headaches for manufacturers. The chief executive of PepsiCo, Indra K. Nooyi, said in October that the biggest factor holding down third-quarter profits was the cost of orange juice.
 The orange industry's problems follow those of the grapefruit industry. The grapefruit crop, which was down substantially last year because of hurricane damage, is recovering somewhat this year. Where last year's crop was 19 million boxes, this year's should be in the range of 26 million boxes, Mr. Meadows said.
 But last fall, with the grapefruit crop down substantially, consumer demand for grapefruit juice plummeted by as much as 30 percent after prices increased 20 percent and more.
 ''We went from being afraid we were going to run out of grapefruit juice to having a year's supply,'' said Richard A. Fort Jr., president of the Peace River Packing Company in Fort Meade, Fla. ''People found an alternative product.''
 But Mr. Fort said he thought that demand for orange juice would not dip as drastically because it was a much larger market, approximately six times the size, and consumer demand was much less volatile. Sales of orange juice are down 10 percent over last year.
 ''There is always concern when any product goes up dramatically like orange juice has done,'' Mr. Fort said.
 At the Wilmette Food Mart in the north suburbs of Chicago, the owner, Milay Shah, said wholesale prices had jumped so much that he had little choice but to pass along the costs to consumers. As a result, sales have tanked, he said.
 ''In any week here, I'd sell three dozen of those 64-ounce bottles,'' Mr. Shah said. ''But now, lucky to sell six or seven. Total.''
 But at a nearby Jewel grocery store, a shopper, Bruce Scivally, 44, said he had not changed his occasional orange juice habit. 
 ''Even with the prices going up, it's generally so incremental that I would still stick with orange juice rather than switch,'' he said. ''I've been drinking it for years, and in the cold weather, with a sore throat coming on, there aren't many better choices.''

HEADLINE: Decline in Manufacturing Is First Since April 2003 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Manufacturing contracted in November for the first time in more than three years, and construction spending fell sharply in October, reports said yesterday, pointing to a slowdown in the economy. 
 The Institute for Supply Management said its index of national factory activity dropped unexpectedly to 49.5 in November from 51.2 in October; the median forecast of economists was for a slight rise, to 51.5.
It was the first time the index had fallen below 50, which indicates shrinking activity, since April 2003.
 The Commerce Department reported that construction spending declined 1 percent in October, more than expected and another sign of a cooling housing market.
 A slowdown in the economy could lead the Federal Reserve, which paused in its two-year-long campaign of interest rate increases in August, to begin cutting benchmark short-term rates next year from the current level of 5.25 percent.
 A decline below the critical 50 mark in the institute's index of factory activity has historically been a reliable predictor of Fed rate cuts, analysts said. The last four cycles of monetary easing began, on average, three months after sub-50 readings, said Richard Franulovich, currency strategist for Westpac in New York.
 Some economists, however, cautioned against writing off the economy too soon after the weak report.
 The weakness seems to be concentrated in the housing and auto industries while other sectors appear to be fine, said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Conn.
 ''We are simply not convinced,'' he said, ''that the economy is weak enough in a broad sense for the Fed to envision easing.''
 The institute's report also showed that new orders, a gauge of future growth, fell to 48.7 from 52.1 in October, while the employment index slipped to 49.2 from 50.8.
 Prices paid, however, rose to 53.5 in November from 47 in October, pointing to continued inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector even as growth slows.
 Norbert Ore, chairman of the institute's survey committee in Atlanta, said manufacturing activity appeared to have peaked and November's overall index was likely to be the first of several months under 50.
 But he said he viewed the outlook as a ''soft landing'' for manufacturing, not a screeching halt to growth.
 ''I think it's way too soon to talk about a manufacturing recession, which would be six consecutive months below 50, unless the inventories are much worse than the data have shown them to be,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Official Sees Inflation Shift 

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, Donald L. Kohn, said last night that inflation trends seemed to be shifting ''from up to down,'' while risks were still ''tilted to the upside.'' 
 ''The trend seems to be shifting and our expectation is that it will shift towards a gradual decrease,'' Mr. Kohn said in response to a question after his speech at the Federal Reserve Board's International Monetary Conference. ''But the risks around that expectation are still tilted to the upside.''
Other Fed policy makers have mentioned the potential risks of inflation recently in speeches; some have suggested that interest rates might need to move higher to keep them in check.
 Mr. Kohn did not discuss the economic outlook or the path of interest rates in his speech yesterday. But in answering a separate question, he said the Fed enjoyed ''considerable credibility'' on inflation, making the case for a numeric inflation goal ''less clear.''
 The Fed's preferred inflation indicator, the personal consumption expenditures price index, minus food and energy, rose 2.4 percent for the 12 months ended in October, above the preferred range of 1 percent to 2 percent of several policy makers.
 Mr. Kohn has not specified a preference range for inflation. In October, he said in a New York speech that the risks of inflation were ''of greater concern'' than an economic slowdown.
 Fed policy makers kept their benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent for a third time on Oct. 25, saying that a slowdown in economic growth would probably help diminish inflation pressures.
 The Fed also said the economy was likely to grow at a ''moderate'' pace.
 Mr. Kohn, 64, became a governor in August 2002 and has spent his entire career at the Federal Reserve. In his speech, Mr. Kohn said that monetary policy makers should avoid relying on any single indicator because of uncertainties surrounding the accuracy of economic data and public behavior.

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposing Regional Force To Monitor Somalia Violence

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
The United States circulated a draft resolution on Somalia on Friday, urging a regional peacekeeping force to monitor a struggle for control between the country's embattled government and its powerful Islamist foes, and calling for a partial lifting of an arms embargo to enable the equipping of local security units. 
 The 8,000-member force would come from seven East African nations but not from neighboring states of Kenya, Djibouti and Ethiopia. This restriction was added out of concern that the proposed United Nations move, aimed at calming tensions, might end up provoking wider hostilities.
 The International Crisis Group, a Brussels-based study group with expertise in the area, raised alarm this week by predicting that deploying a force, particularly one that included soldiers from neighboring countries, ''could trigger all-out war in Somalia and destablize the entire Horn of Africa region.''
 John R. Bolton, the American ambassador, expressed annoyance with this view. ''You know, people criticize us when we take action on the ground, that our taking action makes the situation worse,'' he said. ''O.K., so what is the answer, not to take action?''
 He said, ''What we want to do is endorse the insertion of the regional peacekeeping force, which many of the African states have called for, in order to provide some measure of stability there to permit a political solution.''
 Somalia has not had an effective government since 1991, when warlords overthrew the president and then turned on each other.
 The interim government, formed two years ago and supported by the United Nations, controls only Baidoa, the provincial town where it is headquartered, while the Islamic alliance, known as the Union of Islamic Courts, has taken over Mogadishu, the capital, and increased its grip on the rest of the country.
 Ethiopia supports the interim government and has sent troops into the country. Washington earlier backed a coalition of warlords to try to combat the Islamists, who the United States believed harbored terrorists.
 The draft urged the Islamists to ''cease any further military expansion and reject those with an extremist agenda or links with international terrorism.'' It noted the Security Council's willingness ''to engage with all parties in Somalia, including the Union of Islamic Courts, if they are committed to achieving a political settlement through peaceful and inclusive dialogue.''
 There is fear that Ethiopia and Eritrea, which are in a tense faceoff over their disputed border, are fighting a proxy war in Somalia. Eritrea also would most likely be barred from participating in the peacekeeping force under the resolution.
 The United Nations arms embargo on Somalia, which has been notoriously porous, began in 1992.
 Mr. Bolton said that the text would be circulated to various capitals over the weekend, and that he hoped that reactions could start to be incorporated into the document at drafters' meetings beginning Monday. ''And then we'll proceed as rapidly as we can after that,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In the Midwest, Remembering Europe's Fields of Red 

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

DATELINE: KANSAS CITY, Mo., Nov. 30 

 BODY:
There was never a network of trenches running through the vast fields here in Missouri, as there was in Flanders or along the 466 miles of the Western Front. Nothing in America's heartland ever resembled the ''morass full of shrieking and dying'' that a German soldier witnessed after the battle of Verdun. And these plains have surely never been as saturated with blood as the muddy earth that provided a ready grave for Europe's lost generation during World War I.
 In fact, the Kansas City soldiers dead in that war numbered only in the hundreds. Even the scars left by the deaths of 100,000 American soldiers seem slight compared with the nearly 9 million dead of the other combatants.
But now Kansas City, so remote in space and time from that cataclysm, has become one of the few places where that war can begin to be understood, and the shadow that it still casts can be mapped out. 
 On Saturday a new 30,000-square-foot National World War One Museum is opening here, recounting the history of that ''Great War'' and the United States entrance into it in 1917, drawing on a major collection of 49,000 objects and wrapping around them a strongly conceived narrative of conflict, heroism, death, determination and waste.
 This museum, with its name given by Congress and its $26.5 million cost largely financed by city-issued bonds, is also both conceptually and physically an inversion of one of the nation's most imposing World War I monuments, the Liberty Memorial. The new museum was excavated under its base, conceived in its shadow and completed after the memorial's recent $76 million restoration, providing a contrast to it that is almost as revealing as the museum itself.
 The memorial, dedicated in 1921 and opened in 1926, is a 217-foot obelisklike tower jutting upward out of a plaza, framed by stone sphinxes representing Memory and the Future, and two tomblike exhibition buildings. It is a mock-Egyptian monument, promising a kind of mythic afterlife. ''In honor of those who served in the world war in defense of liberty and our country'' is the inscription at the tower's base.
 The memorial reflects, that is, a spirit of justified purpose and epic heroism; it is the kind of vision the traumatized European victors could not fully muster at the time. But in Missouri, one of whose native sons was Gen. John J. Pershing, the leader of the American forces, the war was seen with a less bloodied gaze. The tribute is overblown, but affecting: the war was solemn and somber but also a triumph.
 The new museum, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates (Mr. Appelbaum also designed the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum and the Clinton presidential library), asserts almost the opposite view, though it too is affecting. It is less solemn, and there is no sense of triumph. The war's intertwining events are surveyed in a timeline that circles the tower's subterranean base. The entire museum is a narrative circle, telling the war's history, with the unseen tower providing the geometry but not the inspiration.
 While the tower's purpose is reverence, in the museum the point is almost journalistic: to come at the war through its particulars, seeking to discover in ordinary objects like boots and tobacco tins as much truth as is found in a life-size trench at which visitors awkwardly peer, like voyeurs, through various openings. There are charts of deaths, accounts of mobilization, descriptions of how the new technology of flight was harnessed. There are interactive exhibits in which flashlights are used like mouse cursors to make selections on an illuminated table.
 There is no grandeur here. Approaching the building, you walk toward the tower but then descend a ramp leading beneath it into a dim hall. At first, things look hopeful, as daylight streams down on a glass bridge leading into the exhibition, suspended over a mock field of 9,000 poppies. But each of those blood-red flowers actually represents a thousand dead soldiers. Death, not liberty, is the overriding fact here. The nature of that death and the world it gave birth to become the museum's subjects.
 And while the war's purpose is so confidently proclaimed in the memorial's inscription above, here, following the lead of historians, the conflict's original goals remain mysterious, puzzling, eclipsed by the nightmarish battles that entangled 36 countries and 65 million combatants. An opening film tries to touch on some of the war's causes: a European nexus of secret alliances, the beginning of an urban society, rival colonial powers seeking to increase their territory. If anything, the patriotism and nationalism celebrated above ground are here rendered suspect.
 But there is also a redemptive aspect to this story, which is told from a distinctively American perspective. The first half of the presentation takes us to the war's darkest point in 1917, before the United States involvement. In a 20-minute high-tech theater piece, film clips, sounds of battle and flashes of light are seen above a life-sized diorama of soldiers trudging through the mud. President Woodrow Wilson had just won re-election using a campaign slogan, ''He Kept Us Out of War.''
 But Germany had also just resumed its submarine attacks on neutral ships, and the United States felt under increasing pressure. The second half of the exhibition shows how America, with a standing army of fewer than 108,000 men, goes on a war footing, revamping its industries and sending 1.3 million troops to France by August. The United States ends up playing a decisive role in bringing the war to its close.
 But in the wake of German defeat, empires collapse, economies stagger and, as the exhibits point out, 20,000 miles of borders are redrawn (with consequences still being felt). The American century begins. Europe is so shell-shocked that all through the 1930s, few could bear the prospect of having to fight again. ''Is peace possible?'' a voice asks in a closing display, just before visitors emerge to walk over the poppies again. Does this exhibition form a circular path because we are doomed to repeat history's follies?
 This is the museum's narrative, and the message suits the current mood. But the emphasis is so placed on death and futility that even the museum's own account of the war's origins seems inadequate. The exhibits are full of individual detail, but the causes are abstract ideological forces. There is a lineup of villains: imperialism, the arms race, industrialization. It takes a while to realize that one of the unusual things about the museum's story is that apart from these forces, there are no bad guys, or rather, no good guys. 
 The narrative is also drained of personality, a flaw in many contemporary histories. What, for example, was the German kaiser like? History's forces did not just sweep along passive human actors. Choices were made, many with moral consequences. Was there any justification for the Allied cause? What if the Allies had lost? The museum makes it seem as if such questions, like detailed examinations of individual battles, would distract from the central theme. 
 In contrast, consider this museum's counterpart in London, the Imperial War Museum. That institution was established when the war still raged. Its permanent exhibition about World War I is exhaustive and exhausting. It is also pointed: it is impossible not to know who was fighting whom and why.
 Of course, World War I, with all its foolishness and tragedy, should not be turned into a morality tale. But other simplifications are also a danger. It is too easy to think that the lesson of the war to end all wars is that all wars should be avoided. World War II's confrontations, begun too late and precariously fought, proved how disastrous that course could be.
 This new museum, which remains an imposing achievement, never goes that far. But emerging from its doors, I still find reassurance in the memorial tower above, with its solemnity, confidence and sense of purpose, and think that the truth lies somewhere in between.

The National World War One Museum opens today at 100 West 26th Street, Kansas City, Mo; (816) 784-1918 or nww1.org.

HEADLINE: Getting 40 Gold Coins, and a Role In a Corrupt Governor's Downfall

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
To many people, Lawrence E. Alibozek epitomized much that was wrong with the ill fated administration of Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut. 
 From the moment Mr. Alibozek joined the governor's office as his deputy chief of staff in the fall of 1997, the improper favors flowed. It started with $9,500 from a state contractor so that he could buy a new car. Later, Mr. Alibozek's boss, Peter N. Ellef, handed him an envelope stuffed with cash in the Capitol parking lot with a promise of more to come.
 After five years, enough money and gifts had changed hands at the highest levels of state government that federal prosecutors needed 22 pages to list everything that was taken and to tell a bit of the stories behind them. 
 In the case of Mr. Alibozek, there were limousine rides to hotels in Boston and New York, vacations in Maine and Florida, the use of a 65-foot yacht, and dinners and getaways for him and his mistress, a state official. There were the 40 gold coins he buried in his backyard -- a symbol of corruption at its most blatant -- that he had accepted in exchange for steering a contract. 
 But what the public did not know was how much the government's successful prosecution of Mr. Rowland on bid-rigging charges, which drove him from office in his third term, depended on Mr. Alibozek's cooperation, and the price he has paid.
 ''I can tell you this,'' said Hugh F. Keefe, the lawyer who represented Mr. Ellef, the governor's co-chief of staff, ''he was a significant part of the prosecution's case, in my case, in Ellef's case.''
 Federal prosecutors advised Mr. Alibozek not to comment because they needed his testimony at a trial of his former associates. His own sentencing was put off until their cases were resolved so that the value of his assertions could be assessed. His lawyer, William T. Gerace, said yesterday: ''He's in limbo right now. He can't move on, and he'd like to.''
 But now that those cases have been successfully prosecuted, Mr. Alibozek's own sentencing is scheduled for January, suggesting that the impasse may be ending. It will be a cathartic end to a long-running investigation in which he was derided as an unstable informer and a symbol for much of the misconduct, and later was the subject of harassment.
 ''Let's hope so,'' said Hope Seeley, a Hartford lawyer who has represented several figures in the investigation, including Kristine Ragaglia, Mr. Alibozek's former mistress. ''It's a sad chapter in Connecticut.''
 The public will also get a more complete portrait of a man who feasted on improper favors, but who belatedly tried to distance himself from his co-conspirators. 
 Mr. Alibozek, 61, grew up in Torrington, Conn., graduated from what is now Central Connecticut State University, and spent four years in the Air Force, rising to staff sergeant. ''He's no fancy-pants Republican,'' said Tom D'Amore, a neighbor in New Hartford who was once the head of the state Republican Party.
 Soon after taking office in 1995, Mr. Rowland, a Republican, hired Mr. Ellef, a Cigna executive, to head his economic development team. Mr. Ellef, in turn, recruited Mr. Alibozek, a colleague at Cigna. 
 In 1997, Mr. Ellef became a chief of staff for the governor, and Mr. Alibozek was named the deputy. At Cigna, the two executives had become acquainted with William A. Tomasso, a contractor with ambitions for his family's construction and property-management business. Once Mr. Ellef and Mr. Alibozek joined the governor's inner circle, Mr. Tomasso's share of state business increased by tens of millions of dollars.
 Court papers detail many of their secret arrangements. In one, Mr. Alibozek told prosecutors that in 1998 Mr. Ellef handed him a cash-filled envelope in the Capitol parking lot. He said he was told the money from Mr. Tomasso was theirs to split -- with the understanding that Mr. Ellef would steer business his way.
 Mr. Alibozek also told of receiving the $9,500 from Mr. Tomasso for a car and the 40 American Eagle gold coins worth $10,800; the coins were given to him because as the year 2000 approached, there were widespread fears that computer problems could bring the economy to a halt. 
 Mr. Alibozek also described how Mr. Tomasso bought him expensive dinners, gave him limousine rides and provided him with cash -- perks he often shared with Ms. Ragaglia, at the time the head of the State Department of Children and Families. 
 In November 1998, when the state decided to build a juvenile prison, Mr. Ellef and Mr. Alibozek saw to it that Mr. Tomasso was the only potential bidder to accompany state officials to an Ohio correctional facility that was emerging as the model for the project. 
 In addition, Ms. Ragaglia -- who told investigators last summer that she and Mr. Alibozek were romantically involved at the time -- admitted in a sworn statement that she used her influence, at Mr. Alibozek's behest, to help steer the contract to Mr. Tomasso by telling a subordinate to make sure that his company was on the short list of bidders.
 Later, when she was serving on a panel that selected the contractor, she said she heeded Mr. Ellef's instructions and voted for Mr. Tomasso. Although never charged with a crime, Ms. Ragaglia resigned from state government in July. Her lawyers declined to comment about her.
 Once the juvenile prison was on track, Mr. Alibozek left the governor's office in July 1999 and spent several months running a lawn-and-garden business that prosecutors later described as yet another way for Mr. Tomasso to funnel money to Mr. Alibozek and his former colleagues. 
 With Connecticut reeling from the news in September 1999 that a former state treasurer, Paul Silvester, pleaded guilty to corrupt acts while in office, court papers show that Mr. Alibozek informed his partners in the landscaping business ''shortly thereafter'' that he wanted to pull out. They obliged him by dissolving the business, he told prosecutors, and he then ''walked away'' for good and ended his friendship with Mr. Ellef.
 Three years later, investigators, emboldened by their prosecution of Mr. Silvester on corruption charges, came calling on Mr. Alibozek at his home in August 2002. By September, Mr. Alibozek had reached a formal agreement with prosecutors to cooperate in the investigation of Mr. Rowland and his aides.
 Less than two months later, Mr. Rowland was handily elected to a third term, so Connecticut residents hardly knew what to make of the announcement the following spring by the United States attorney that Mr. Alibozek had pleaded guilty to accepting ''cash, gold, and other items and services'' in exchange for steering contracts to an unidentified contractor when he was the governor's deputy chief of staff.
 Governor Rowland insisted he was not under investigation. Yet behind the scenes, Mr. Alibozek's cooperation was credited by many lawyers in the case with providing the road map used to convict Mr. Ellef and Mr. Tomasso on conspiracy charges and the governor on charges he deprived the public of honest services.
 Mr. Rowland pleaded guilty in December 2004 and has already completed the year-and-a-day sentence handed down by Judge Peter C. Dorsey. Mr. Ellef and Mr. Tomasso are still serving the 30-month sentences they received in October 2005.
 And Mr. Alibozek waits. Still married, he keeps busy by helping neighbors with their landscaping and caring for his two teenage children. 
 Mr. D'Amore, a friend of 30 years, said Mr. Alibozek was under great strain because of the publicity, exacerbated by a heart condition and efforts by Mr. Tomasso's lawyers to refute or shake Mr. Alibozek's testimony.
 Investigators, for instance, have examined whether someone associated with Mr. Tomasso was involved in tapping Mr. Alibozek's phone, slashing his tires, or stealing his mail. Mr. Alibozek's family has also complained of being followed in their cars and even being bumped. Federal agents at one point seized surveillance equipment belonging to Mr. Tomasso's private investigators, but a spokesman for the United States attorney declined to comment.
 Mr. Gerace, Mr. Alibozek's lawyer, said his client ''has suffered greatly.''
 A sign that the investigation into the role of Mr. Alibozek was nearing an end emerged recently when he was scheduled for sentencing next month before Judge Dorsey.
 The plea agreement calls for a sentence of 24 to 30 months, but some defense lawyers and friends say a reduced sentence is warranted.
 But how much is a matter of dispute.

HEADLINE: A Limited Time Offer to Iran

BYLINE: By George Perkovich and Pierre Goldschmidt. 
George Perkovich is the director of the nonproliferation program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Pierre Goldschmidt is a non-resident scholar there and a former deputy director of the International Atomic Energy Agency.

 BODY:
IN October, Iran began operating a second group of 164 uranium enrichment centrifuges, violating a legally binding demand by the United Nations Security Council that Iran suspend such activities until the international community is confident that the country's nuclear program ''is for exclusively peaceful purposes.'' Iran's response was that a suspension would abrogate its rights under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- even though under international law, it has temporarily surrendered these rights by violating the obligations that condition them.
 Beneath the legalese, Iran is moving as fast as it can to master uranium enrichment, while threatening its neighbors and refusing to provide transparency that the International Atomic Energy Agency requires. Tehran bets that Russia will continue to buy it time by slowing and diluting Security Council sanctions. Once Iran has fully mastered enrichment, it will have gained confidence that it can produce weapons-grade uranium quickly if it decides to do so. 
With this confidence, Iran would assess the costs and benefits of continuing the construction of a large-scale uranium enrichment plant. If Russia were prepared to join the United States, Europe and others in imposing significant costs, Iran might choose to negotiate a handsome benefits package in exchange for suspending enrichment-related activities. If the Security Council were to remain lenient, on the other hand, Iran would have complete freedom to maneuver.
 International interlocutors must disabuse Iran that it can have its uranium cake and eat it, too. The vital security objective all along has been to prevent Iran from acquiring the capacity to make nuclear weapons fuel. Once Iran has mastered uranium enrichment, this objective will have been largely lost. At that point, it would make no further sense to offer Iran exceptional nuclear energy cooperation, political benefits or access to international markets, capital and technology. 
 Thus, Iran's interlocutors should clarify now that the positive incentives the world wishes to negotiate with Iran will be withdrawn if it does not immediately accede to the binding Security Council demand for suspension. 
 The message from the Security Council, including Russia and China, should be: ''You can get the uranium enrichment capacity you seek, even though, because you have violated your Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and International Atomic Energy Agency Safeguards obligations, it threatens international peace and security. But you will lose the prospects of many benefits. The International Atomic Energy Agency and the Security Council will continue to press for the greater transparency required to verify 'that there are no undeclared nuclear materials or activities in Iran.' Maybe we can tighten the sanctions you will face, maybe we can't, but the case won't be closed, and you will not become an acceptable nuclear trade partner.'' 
 Failure to clarify the limited duration of positive incentives only encourages those in Iran who argue that there are no real costs to defying the Security Council and continuing the enrichment program. Conversely, if Iran suspends enrichment while it is still meaningful, interlocutors should be willing to negotiate generously to meet the country's nuclear energy, economic and security interests. This could ultimately include helping Iran develop its nuclear fuel cycle, if and when doubts about the peacefulness of its nuclear ambitions have been durably allayed. 
 Russia, China and perhaps others will be tempted to argue that pressing Iran this way could be an American attempt to precipitate a crisis and set the stage for military action. To pre-empt such charges, President Bush should clarify that if Iran complies with the Security Council's demands, suspends its fuel-cycle activities and gives up its unjust support for organizations that commit violence against unarmed civilians, the United States will commit not to threaten Iran's sovereignty or territorial integrity. Such a security guarantee, perhaps expressed in the Security Council, would facilitate not only longer-term nuclear negotiations with Iran, but also broader rapprochement. 
 Iranian national security decisions are made collectively. A precarious consensus emerged in 2005 to defy international demands and press on with enrichment. This consensus will not be reconsidered as long as the policy appears cost-free and the option of cashing in on restraint seems so open-ended that it could be still available after enrichment has been mastered. 
 The Iranian people, their neighbors and the world deserve a more considered debate of Iran's options and of their consequences. Iran will never be in a better position than it is now to obtain a favorable deal that would improve its economy, employment and quality of life.

GREENE, LEONARD MICHAEL

 BODY:
 GREENE--Leonard Michael. November 30, 2006, age 88, of Mamaroneck, NY, after a long and courageous battle with cancer. A 1991 inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Greene patented hundreds of inventions, many integral to modern aviation, including the stall prevention devices that are now essential safety equipment on all aircraft and have saved many thousands of lives. In 1946, he founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, one of a very few early aviation companies still owned by its founding family. 
An aerodynamicist and expert pilot, Greene was a life member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and held many aviation records and awards. In 1981, he co-founded the Corporate Angel Network, a nonprofit that arranges free transportation to treatment for cancer patients by using the empty seats on corporate flights. To date, the organization has flown nearly 25,000 cancer patients to treatment centers throughout the U.S. An avid sailor, Greene advised several America's Cup syndicates and then bought the two-time winner Courageous to compete again in 1986. Sailing under the aegis of the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, the only undergraduate sailing club ever to participate, the Courageous Syndicates 1986 run at the Cup spearheaded Greene's campaign to restore the Corinthian ideals of amateur sportsmanship to the competition, and more broadly, to team sports in general. Following the 1997 donation of Courageous to the Museum of Yachting in Newport, RI, the famed 12-meter was named Rhode Island's State Yacht. Leonard Greene experienced poverty as a youth during the Depression, and never forgot it. As a successful businessman, he implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility. Seeking a broader forum and greater impact for his ideas, in 1974 he founded the Institute for SocioEconomic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to enhancing economic and social opportunity and improving quality of life. The Institute provides a national forum for innovative insights and solutions to problems of economic development, social motivation, poverty, and urban regeneration and conducts research in these areas. Through the Institute, Greene advocated a revolutionary change in tax policy that would extend economic opportunity and incentives by transforming existing social welfare spending into a generous national tax rebate. In pursuit of these interests, he was a was a member of both the Special Committee on Welfare & Income Maintenance and the Council on Trends & Perspectives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Income Maintenance Committee of the Community Service Society and the Work Group on Welfare Reform of the Task Force on the New York City Fiscal Crisis. Greene was author of the books Free Enterprise without Poverty (Norton, 1981), The National Tax Rebate: A New America with Less Government (Regnery, 1998), and Inventorship: The Art of Innovation (Wiley, 2001). He was president of the Institute and active in its mission to the end. Greene graduated in 1938 from the City College of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry, and went on to receive the M.S. degree in Engineering, also from CCNY, before doing postgraduate work at the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics of New York University. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa by Pace University in 1977. Among his many other awards and honors are the Flight Safety Foundations Air Safety Award (1949 and 1981), Award for Meritorious Service (1981), and Allied Signal/Bendix Trophy Award for Aviation Safety (1999); the National Business Aircraft Association's Pilot Safety Award (1961) and Award for Meritorious Service to Aviation (1996); the Private Sector Initiative Commendation of the President of the United States (1982 and 1984); the Foundation for Westchester Community College's Medallion Award for Distinguished Achievement in Business, Science and Humanitarianism; the Special Act Award of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Aviation Week & Space Technology's Laurels Award in the Field of Electronics (1999) and Laureate Award for Lifetime Achievement as a Pioneer in Flight Safety, Performance and Innovation (2001); and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Contribution to American Innovation Award (2002). He was man of vision who not only imagined and developed new and better products and policies, but also cared deeply enough about the well being of others to dare to try to overturn the status quo and to leave the world a better place. Beyond his gifts for invention and innovation, perhaps his most salient quality was his capacity for enjoyment. He loved his work and his life, and brought to both a child like sense of fun and adventure that gave him a special bond with children, including his own. Born in 1918 in New York City to Max and Lyn (Furman) Greene, Leonard Greene was also proceeded in death by his siblings Helen and Elliot. On September 11, 2001, his son, Donald Freeman Greene, was killed in the terrorist attack on Unitied Flight 93. Leonard Greene is survived by his children Randall Greene of Greenwich, CT; Bonnie Le Var of Briarcliff Manor, NY; Laurie Balwin of Kalispell, MT; Douglas F. Greene of Cortez, CO; Charles F. Greene of Novato, CA; Stephen F. Greene of Ludlow, VT; Terry Greene of Somerville, MA; and many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. He will be deeply missed by his devoted family and friends, and by his ''family'' at Safe Flight, CAN, and the Institute. A memorial service will be held on Monday, December 4, at 2pm at the ECS of Westchester, 7 Saxon WR, White Plains, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Corporate Angel Network, Inc., Westchester County Airport, One Loop Road, White Plains, NY 10604.

HEADLINE: Shoppers Seem Hesitant, but Ford Bets It All 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
CHRISTMAS shoppers crowded malls on the day after Thanksgiving, but they were not spending as freely as expected, and that made many economists and investors worry that holiday sales may disappoint and that consumers may not be able or willing to re-energize the slowing economy.
Ford did not wait for the whole economy to rebound. It took several drastic steps to shore up its finances and scale back its production capacity to cope with an automobile market that is becoming smaller and more fragmented.

MIXED MESSAGES -- The economy grew faster in the last quarter than initial estimates suggested, but other new data raised concern that growth may slow faster than forecast in the months ahead. 
 The Commerce Department said that gross domestic product expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the third quarter, up from its initial estimate of 1.6 percent. Even the higher estimate, however, is down from the 5.6 percent rate in the first quarter. 
 Slower spending by businesses in October added to the gloom. Orders for durable goods -- things like jet engines and computers -- declined by 8.3 percent, the Commerce Department said. The drop was the largest in more than six years and led economists to conclude that businesses were responding to slower economic growth.
 Even as growth slowed, inflation remained above the Federal Reserve's target range, and the Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said the central bank might raise interest rates again.

READY, SET, SHOP -- Retail sales rose 2.2 percent in November, the slowest pace in seven months, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group. That fed fears that the crucial holiday shopping season may disappoint.
 Wal-Mart, by far the nation's biggest retailer, estimated that its sales actually fell in November -- and that includes the day after Thanksgiving, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. That is the first time in 10 years that Wal-Mart's sales declined. 
 Unexpectedly, sales at department stores rose 4.6 percent last month, suggesting shoppers are turning to chains like Macy's, Saks and Nordstrom at the expense of discounters like Wal-Mart and specialty stores like Gap, Ann Taylor and Abercrombie & Fitch, the shopping centers group said.
 Federated, owner of Macy's and Bloomingdale's, raised its estimates for sales in December.

GREENER PASTURES -- Stymied at home, Wal-Mart announced a joint venture to open stores in India, the first large-scale entry into that booming market by a major foreign retailer.
 Wal-Mart will allow Bharti Enterprises, an Indian cellphone company, to open hundreds of franchised superstores throughout India in the next five years. A local partner is required by Indian law, but foreign companies like Wal-Mart can open their own wholesale outlets.
 India's retail industry is expected to more than double, to $600 billion, by 2015. Sales at big-box stores like Wal-Mart are expected to grow three times that fast.

ROLLING BACK RULES -- An independent committee endorsed by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. called for a sweeping overhaul of securities market regulations, including some adopted in response to the wave of corporate scandals that began with the collapse of Enron.
 The committee, saying it is concerned about a loss of competitiveness, said it should be harder for the government to indict companies and easier for corporate directors and auditors to avoid shareholders' lawsuits. It also suggested limiting the Securities and Exchange Commission's ability to write rules that would be too costly for businesses to follow.
 The committee's report was released two days after the New York Stock Exchange and NASD said they planned to accede to Wall Street requests to merge their regulatory organizations.
 Sanjay Kumar, the former chief executive of Computer Associates, is to report to federal prison on Feb. 27 to begin his 12-year sentence for orchestrating a huge accounting fraud at the company, now known as CA.

FORD GOES ALL IN -- For the first time in its 103-year history, the Ford Motor Company is mortgaging its assets, including factories, equipment, office buildings, patents and trademarks, and stakes in subsidiaries like Volvo, to raise $18 billion to overhaul itself.
 As a measure of the risk Ford is taking, the amount it is borrowing exceeds the total market value of its outstanding stock. Ford chose to offer collateral for the loans because its credit rating, well below investment grade, makes unsecured loans too expensive.
 The company, which lost about $7 billion in the first nine months of this year, says it does not expect to earn a profit in North America until 2009 at the soonest.

AUTO WORKERS LEAVE -- More than 30,000 hourly workers at Ford -- nearly half of its unionized work force -- have agreed to quit in exchange for a buyout or a package of early retirement benefits, giving the company a lift in its revamping effort.
 Including 8,000 who accepted packages offered at specific plants earlier in the year, about 38,000 of Ford's 75,000 members of the United Automobile Workers union have agreed to take buyouts. 
 Ford said ''just over half'' of the workers accepted buyouts that absolve the company from having to pay them retirement benefits. Others opted for cash payouts of up to $35,000 and the right to retiree health insurance and other pension benefits.
 Ford also intends to eliminate about 14,000 salaried positions through buyouts. Those workers still have time to decide whether to accept a package and leave.

POWER UP -- Demonstrating that the current wave of mergers is a worldwide phenomenon, the Spanish utility Iberdrola agreed to pay $22.5 billion for Scottish Power, creating one of Europe's biggest power companies.
 In addition to British operations, Scottish Power generates power and sells natural gas in the United States and Canada. 
 Iberdrola said the acquisition of Scottish Power would make it a leading producer of renewable energy, generating more than 6,000 megawatts from wind farms and hydroelectric dams.
 Analysts said the relatively low price Iberdrola offered might attract a competing bid for Scottish Power or encourage consolidation among other European utilities.

HEADLINE: Plan for South American Pipeline Has Ambitions Beyond Gas 

BYLINE: By JENS ERIK GOULD

DATELINE: GUIRIA, Venezuela 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez is not modest about his energy plans. He wants to build a 5,000-mile natural gas pipeline that stretches from this remote northern tip of South America to the bottom end of the continent.
 Erecting possibly the longest pipeline in the world is the centerpiece of a broader effort by Mr. Chavez to strengthen ties among Latin America's economies and shrink their dependence on the United States.
But from the outset, the $20 billion ''great gas pipeline of the south,'' planned to be more than twice as long as the United States border with Mexico, has generated political and environmental controversy at home and abroad.
 Mr. Chavez, who deeply distrusts the United States and has raised the prospect that it may invade Venezuela to seize its oil, is seeking to diversify his country's energy exports away from its biggest client and toward countries as far away as China and as close as Brazil. 
 Mr. Chavez has strengthened political ties with Brazil and Argentina in recent years. 
 [The voting is Sunday, with most polls showing Mr. Chavez ahead by a wide margin.]
 And these days, he is dangling Venezuela's significant reserves as an incentive as he asks his neighbors for a long-term natural gas commitment.
 During a recent visit to the pipeline's projected starting point, as oil workers and local residents crowded just outside this fishing town in Venezuela's northeast, Mr. Chavez proclaimed, as he stood next to a row of national flags: ''Here in this South America, from the Caribbean to Patagonia, we'll build a great bloc of political, economic and social power to seek world equilibrium this century, where we don't have one policeman who wants to be the owner of the world.'' 
 That geopolitical aim is, in fact, the project's biggest hurdle, energy analysts maintain. They say that the decision by Mr. Chavez to give his ideological goals priority over profit jeopardizes the success of the project. 
 ''You don't build a pipeline for political reasons,'' said Robert E. Ebel, energy analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It should be a financially viable operation.''
 Though Venezuela could reap higher profit margins by exporting liquefied natural gas to higher-price markets like the United States, Venezuelan officials acknowledge that is not their goal. 
 ''It's not that the economic part doesn't matter,'' said Angel Gonzalez, general director of exploration and production at the Energy Ministry, ''but it's really not the most important part of this project.''
 Venezuela is not the only country to use gas pipelines for political influence. Critics in the United States accused Russia of using energy politics after its giant company Gazprom stopped supplying Ukraine in an effort to raise prices at the start of the year. 
 Still, it is not clear that Mr. Chavez can muster long-term support in South America for a huge pipeline that would take at least a decade to complete. There is already skepticism and bickering over other energy deals, analysts say. 
 ''Does political will last that long?'' asked Michelle Billig of the PIRA Energy Group in New York, a consulting firm. 
 Brazil, for instance, may be wary of committing itself to a pipeline with Venezuela after Mr. Chavez applauded Bolivia's nationalization of energy industries in 2006. That move jeopardized the natural gas investments of Petrobras, Brazil's state-owned oil company, in Bolivia, said Anne Korin, co-director of the Institute for the Analysis of Global Security in Washington.
 Argentina and Brazil, expected to be the project's largest users, would find themselves dependent for supplies of gas on Venezuela and Bolivia, nations that have shown themselves to be politically volatile. Venezuela halted oil exports during a two-month national strike starting late in 2002, and tensions in Bolivia over how to manage energy resources have helped topple two recent presidents. Paraguay and Uruguay would also take part in the pipeline. 
 ''In South America there is no project more challenging than this one in its history,'' said Ricardo Savini, a business development manager for Petrobras. He said his company could take part in the pipeline if feasibility studies turned out favorable.
 Venezuela's natural gas reserves are largely undeveloped, and over the years, gas has taken a back seat to petroleum in Venezuela, one of the world's leading oil exporters. 
 The Chavez government has made laws more attractive for investors in gas. That contrasts sharply with the blunt measures that have wrested control from foreign companies producing oil. Chevron has already found enough gas in the Plataforma Deltana area in the east for Venezuela to begin processing liquefied natural gas. Chevron expects to export liquefied gas to the United States and European markets through a $5.6 billion complex that the state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, plans to build outside Guiria.
 Now, the state company also wants the complex to feed the transcontinental pipeline and says those plans are a higher priority than exporting liquefied gas. 
 Energy analysts say it will be a tall order for Venezuela's budding gas industry to produce enough for both the L.N.G. plant and the pipeline, especially when current output does not even satisfy domestic demand for natural gas. 
 The pipeline also faces resistance from environmental groups because it would cut through the Brazilian Amazon and cross several large rivers to reach its destinations. Watchdog groups, like Greenpeace, say it could devastate some of the least-developed and least-studied areas in the dense rainforest and that the influx of laborers could bring diseases to remote indigenous communities.
 ''It will be terrible,'' said Paulo Adario, Amazon campaign coordinator for Greenpeace. ''The environmental impact seems very high.''
 There is concern in Guiria, too, a city of 35,000 people. A month after Mr. Chavez broke ground for the gas complex on the environmentally sensitive Paria peninsula in September, the monument built for his nationally televised speech was still littered with the empty water bottles and soda cans of those who attended. ''You manage a project that you supposedly consider won't create any environmental impact on an international level -- and then you do this,'' said Rodolfo Foucault, a Guiria resident, when he saw the trash on an otherwise unspoiled coastline.
 Still, many locals welcome Petroleos de Venezuela's promise to spend more than $1 billion on infrastructure and local industries in Sucre, the northeastern state where Guiria is situated. ''We want the development for our community,'' said Antonio Calazan, who fishes mackerel and shark in the waters off Guiria.
 While even critics are optimistic that the state oil company will keep its promise to build the liquefied natural gas plant, many say that the pipeline will be the latest in a long line of Venezuelan energy plans that never got off the ground or have been significantly delayed. For example, Mariscal Sucre, a promising offshore natural gas project, has been stalled for more than a decade.
 Government officials have yet to disclose details on its routes or costs, saying that technical teams are performing preliminary studies. A model of the complex in Guiria's airport does not offer any clues either, nor does it illustrate what part of the plant's terminal will feed the transcontinental line.
 There was no actual construction to be seen along the main road cutting through the plant site in Guiria other than the monument that Mr. Chavez opened -- and even that appeared abandoned. The wind had torn down the young coconut trees that provided the president's television backdrop.
 Yet Mr. Chavez and his energy officials continue to champion the proposal. They have even devised a slogan for Guiria on the plaque, which Carlos Figueredo, Petroleos de Venezuela's general manager for offshore natural gas, repeated at an industry conference in October in Sucre state. 
 ''We have called Guiria the place where the gas is born that unites the people,'' he said. ''That gives you an idea of the magnitude that we're looking at.''

HEADLINE: Volatile Dollar May Not Be Scary to Washington 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
As the dollar tumbled against the euro this week, reflecting fresh concern about a possible weakening of the American economy, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. issued the usual phrase from the catechism: ''A strong dollar is clearly in our nation's best interest.''
 Treasury secretaries since Robert E. Rubin in the 1990s have, with rare exceptions, offered precisely that formula whenever the subject comes up.
But many economists say that Mr. Paulson's statement does not reflect what the United States actually seeks right now. For one thing, the Bush administration is in active pursuit of a weaker dollar against China's currency, which would probably encourage similar changes with other Asian competitors. The goal would be making American exports there less expensive, and imports more expensive, helping to spur an industrial revival at home. 
 And though there are high risks if the dollar were to continue to fall rapidly against the euro and the British pound, the United States is generally seen as hoping for the economic gains delivered by a lower dollar as American exports become more competitive against planes, machinery and other goods produced in Europe.
 ''Paulson has got to like a euro that's appreciating in value,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute of International Economics and a longtime advocate of a weak dollar. ''He came into office facing an overall American trade deficit that is close to $1 trillion a year. He's got to welcome something that shows the trade deficit likely to go down.''
 Still, the fluctuations of the dollar have unsettled many in the world of finance this last week, when it sagged about 2 percent against the euro, bringing its decline this year to more than 12 percent. On Friday, the dollar fell to 1.33 euros; it dropped against the British pound as well, with it now taking $1.98 to buy a pound.
 By contrast, against the Japanese currency, the dollar has slipped much less, closing Friday at 115.35 yen.
 In Europe, the French finance minister, Thierry Breton, has expressed concern about a weakening dollar, noting that exports have helped Europe's recent economic recovery. But other European finance ministers said this week that at least for now, gains in the euro do not appear to threaten prospects for growth in Europe.
 The gyrations of the dollar highlight the sensitivity of Mr. Paulson's role at this particular moment, as he prepares for his biggest overseas trip so far as Treasury chief: a veritable expedition to China, accompanied by five cabinet members and by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman.
 The goal of the trip, which starts Dec. 14, is to engage China on a range of economic issues but most particularly to press Beijing to let its currency, the yuan, rise in value against the dollar. That would help, American officials hope, to narrow a Chinese trade surplus with the United States that soared past $200 billion last year.
 As a former investment banker who lived and breathed the logic of international markets for decades at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Paulson is trying to engineer a kind of correction in which China would cease what American officials say have been currency manipulations aimed at pumping out exports.
 Against the background of the rise of the euro, the China trip illustrates the three-cornered complexities of the world economy and of Mr. Paulson's dollar diplomacy.
 Suddenly with a declining dollar, Europeans are stepping up their purchases of American goods, and it has become more expensive for Americans to visit Europe as tourists or business officials. American investors overseas, meanwhile, are enjoying the extra kick that a falling dollar delivers on their foreign profits.
 The decline of the dollar against the euro, while the dollar-to-yuan ration remains stable, also has the effect of increasing tensions between Europe and China. European businesses, like their American counterparts, are already upset about cheap Chinese exports to Europe. Now these goods are even cheaper because the yuan is declining against the euro, pulled down by the dollar.
 The Chinese, meanwhile, are likely to get more nervous than ever that a decline in the dollar against the yuan will damp their exports and reduce the value of their dollar-denominated assets, putting pressure on Chinese banks that are holding those assets.
 China has resisted American appeals to let the yuan rise in value, arguing that China is already undertaking painful economic reforms -- writing off bad loans and closing money-losing state enterprises -- and cannot afford further social disturbance brought on by new difficulties in exports.
 ''We are committed to a market-based exchange-rate mechanism,'' said a senior Chinese official, speaking anonymously under Chinese ground rules. ''But we will do it in a responsible way -- responsible to the health of our country, the United States, Asia and beyond.''
 Part of the reason for the dollar sell-off, many analysts say, has been a recent sense of disappointment about the American economy even as Europe has picked up some momentum, prompting traders to look for more promising investments in markets overseas. The prospect of higher interest rates in Europe while rates remain stuck or drift lower in the United States has also drawn funds out of the dollar.
 Some analysts also say that the dollar decline has been partly seasonal -- that there is always a decline in investment in dollar-denominated investments at the end of the year, despite the huge need by the United States to finance its current-account and budget deficits.
 ''There's always a little seasonal weakening of the dollar at year-end,'' said Robert Sinche, head of global currency research and strategy at Bank of America. ''With its large imbalances, the United States needs to attract capital every day. Capital flows tend to slow down at this time, because people go on holidays or are closing their books.''
 ''It's like musical chairs,'' he added. ''When the music stops, those who have deficits are going to suffer.''
 If American policy makers are pleased about the prospect of the dollar's providing a kick for exports, they fear a dollar falling so far and fast that it fuels inflation in the United States. Higher inflation might force the Federal Reserve, which is still concerned that price increases are outside its comfort zone, to raise interest rates, slowing the American economy further.
 ''The fall of the dollar has both benefits and risks,'' said Nouriel Roubini, chairman of Roubini Global Economics. ''The danger is that the willingness of foreign investors to buy dollars is shrinking. If the fall of the dollar accelerates, investors could start dumping U.S. assets, and you'll get a hard landing for the economy.''
 The fear of a loss in the value of its assets is a factor in China's rebuffing American imprecations to let its currency float more flexibly against the dollar, many analysts say. China has amassed $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves after years of trade surpluses with Europe and the United States.
 About $700 billion of those reserves are said by many economists to be in dollars. One reason China does not want a cheaper dollar against the yuan, these economists say, is that the value of its holdings would decrease, limiting the lending ability of its banks.
 Nevertheless, Mr. Paulson's trip is organized around the principle that China needs a bit of a weaker dollar now because its current path of binging on exports will overheat the Chinese economy -- it is growing at 10 percent a year -- and cause a collapse sooner or later if it is not cooled off slowly.
 The dollar has declined about 5 percent against the yuan in the last year and a half, but American policy makers say that the yuan is still artificially low. That is also the view of leading members of Congress, especially Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who becomes the speaker of the House in January.
 Not all economists agree that am upward revaluation of the yuan will benefit the American economy. They note that cheap exports from China are desired by American consumers, and that Chinese imports have not led to rising unemployment, as critics charge.
 ''Let's say China revalues by 10 percent overnight,'' Mr. Sinche said. ''Then prices at Wal-Mart go up by 10 percent. So we then see worse inflation numbers, the Fed tightens monetary policies, and we end up with higher inflation, higher prices and higher interest rates. Remind me again why that's what we want.''

HEADLINE: With Economics in Mind, City Takes Aim at Movie Piracy 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Alarmed by New York City's status as a global center of film and video piracy, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has embraced a proposal that would criminalize unauthorized recording in movie theaters.
 At first glance, the proposal, which is before the City Council, might seem unnecessary. A federal law signed by President Bush in April 2005 made recording a film with a video camera in a movie theater a felony, punishable by up to three years in prison for the first offense. And in Albany the Legislature is weighing bills, supported by Mr. Bloomberg, that would make recording a film inside a theater a crime statewide.
Nonetheless, powerful industry groups are pushing New York City to adopt its own anti-recording statute, hoping that such a law would spur the Police Department to crack down on piracy and minimize the economic damage it does. 
 ''Piracy robs New York City of tax revenue, cheats trademark holders and undermines the creative community, which is a vital sector of our economy,'' said John A. Feinblatt, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator. ''We have a responsibility to fight this crime at every level: city, state and federal.''
 In November 2004 a report by City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. estimated that the counterfeit trade in the city totaled $23 billion a year and cost the city more than $1 billion a year in lost taxes: $380 million in sales taxes, $360 million in personal income taxes and $290 million in business income taxes.
 At a Council hearing on Thursday, Vans Stevenson, a senior vice president at the Motion Picture Association of America, testified that 43 percent of movies illegally recorded with camcorders in the United States last year were copied in New York City theaters. 
 Movies pirated in the city also made their way to 48 countries and 100 Internet sites, Mr. Stevenson said.
 The bill before the Council would make unauthorized recording in a movie theater a misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $5,000, as well as a civil penalty up to $5,000.
 Currently, under the state penal code, illegally recording a movie is only a violation, punishable by up to 15 days in jail or a fine of up to $250. (However, related crimes, like trademark counterfeiting and failing to disclose the origin of a recording, are felonies under state law.)
 In Albany the State Senate has twice passed a bill that would make unauthorized recording in a movie theater a misdemeanor for the first offense and a felony for subsequent offenses, but the Assembly has not acted on a companion bill. At least 39 states have laws against the use of recording devices in theaters, according to the motion picture association.
 Mr. Stevenson said the city law would improve enforcement. ''Right now an illegal recording in a theater has to occur in the presence of a police officer in a darkened theater,'' he said. ''If this legislation passes, just like shoplifters in retail stores, movie thieves can be observed and detained by theater employees until police officers arrive to make the arrest.''
 Mr. Bloomberg said on Oct. 23 that his Office of Special Enforcement would use civil nuisance abatement laws to hold building owners liable for movie-piracy activities on their properties, a tactic that has been used successfully against counterfeiting in the apparel industry. 
 The Police Department, which created a Trademark Infringement Unit in 1994, is also preparing to crack down on film piracy.

HEADLINE: As Crime Soars For Venezuela, Chavez Coasts

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 1 

 BODY:
Walk into an emergency room in many poor parts of this booming, oil-rich nation on a weekend night and you will be overwhelmed -- victims of gunshot wounds and drunken clashes line the corridors. Homicides are up 67 percent since 1999, and violent crime is the top concern of Venezuela's voters as they head to the polls on Sunday. 
 Yet the man in charge since then, President Hugo Chavez, rarely addresses the problem publicly and is sailing toward an easy election for a third time. Analysts say Mr. Chavez is able to ignore the issue by governing through a system of extensive handouts that eases the purchase of basic goods but does little to ensure public order.
''Chavez has shielded himself from the issue because people see his government as an important arbiter in their daily life,'' said Miguel Tinker-Salas, an expert on Venezuelan history at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif. ''Chavez's policies have made a difference among the poor, and that's what is recognized.'' He pointed to subsidized groceries, health care and literacy, in particular. 
 Crime analysts say part of the problem is that the government and its allies have politicized police forces throughout the country, marginalizing officers viewed as disagreeing with Mr. Chavez's ''Bolivarian Revolution,'' which uses militaristic and nationalistic rhetoric in an attempt to reconfigure society with vague socialist ideals. 
 A similar process has taken place in government ministries, the national oil company and the armed forces after the coup that briefly removed Mr. Chavez from the presidency in 2002. 
 Analysts say police forces have also largely been urged to tread lightly in poor neighborhoods, turning a blind eye to small demonstrations and petty crime like burning tires. Critics say it is part of Mr. Chavez's efforts to maintain support in poor neighborhoods. 
 Meanwhile, crime has exploded. According to human rights groups and a Unesco study, Venezuela has the highest rate of gun-related deaths of 57 countries surveyed -- far surpassing Brazil, one of the most violent nations in Latin America.
 ''Venezuela has undeniably become one of the most violent countries in the world,'' said Julio Jacobo Waiselfisz, the researcher who conducted the Unesco study.
 Though he trails badly in most polls, Mr. Chavez's opponent, Manuel Rosales, 53, governor of Zulia State in western Venezuela, has been pounding the crime issue, questioning why murders have surged since Mr. Chavez entered office in 1999, to 9,962 in 2005 from 5,974 in 1999, according to figures from the Criminal Investigations Police.
 Officials in the Justice Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the government's crime policies. The National Assembly, controlled by supporters of Mr. Chavez, is considering legislation to diminish police corruption by centralizing more authority in a national police force.
 Mr. Rosales, the candidate of a coalition of opposition parties, laid the blame squarely at the feet of the president, saying his confrontational style and tendency to turn the courts, military and the police into tools of his own power, are feeding the crime epidemic.
 ''Chavez nourishes the anarchic forces that are tearing Venezuela apart with a discourse advocating aggression on all fronts,'' the candidate has said. Polls show Mr. Rosales trailing Mr. Chavez, though his approval ratings have inched up since the start of the campaign several months ago. 
 Concern over crime has jumped this year after a series of brutal episodes pierced even the relatively sheltered existence of the upper middle class and the diplomatic and international business communities. Street protests broke out in April after three brothers with Canadian citizenship, John Faddoul, 17, Kevin Faddoul, 13, and Jason Faddoul, 12, were kidnapped and found executed.
 Around the same time, burglars shot Walter Rehberger, a consul at the Austrian Embassy here, during a break-in. Diplomats were singled out again this month, when thieves broke into the trade office for the Chinese Embassy and stole $14,000.
 The highway from the international airport in Maiquetia to Caracas has also proved particularly dangerous, with armed gangs rear-ending cars and robbing passengers of their belongings. Carlos Colina, a consultant for Hewlett-Packard, was shot to death on the route in July, one of several incidents that led the United States Embassy in Caracas to issue a warning against traveling on the road after nightfall.
 While much of the recent attention has focused on killings among the privileged, the vast majority of homicides in Venezuela occur in the country's poorest communities -- Mr. Chavez's strongest base. 
 Killings tend to spike during weekends and around paydays in the middle and end of the month, when robberies are also common, according to criminologists. The large majority of incidents involve boys and men ages 15 to 25.
 Mr. Waiselfisz, the Unesco researcher, found that gun-related deaths in Venezuela were surging, to 41.4 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2002, the last year for which figures are available, from 34.3 in 2000.
 One of the most unsettling aspects of the spike in killings is that it has developed as Venezuela's economy has boomed -- thanks to high oil prices. Gross domestic product climbed 10.2 percent last quarter, making Venezuela the fastest-growing economy in Latin America. 
 Previous economic booms helped Venezuela avoid the crippling violence and social conflict that plagued neighboring Andean countries like Colombia and Peru.
 Though the accuracy of official statistics is sometimes questioned by the government's opponents, the channeling of oil revenues seems to have alleviated poverty somewhat in recent years. The Venezuelans living in poverty has fallen to 34 percent from 44 percent in 1998, the year before Mr. Chavez took office, according to government figures.
 Some of that decline has clearly happened as Mr. Chavez has used oil revenues to finance a broad range of social welfare programs, like adult literacy programs, subsidized basic foodstuffs and medical care in poor areas provided by Cuban doctors.
 ''We're witnessing a reduction in infant mortality rates only to see our boys killed when they turn 16,'' said Ana Maria Sanjuan, a sociologist at Central University in Caracas and an official with Provea, a nongovernmental organization that monitors human rights issues. 
 Citing figures from the Criminal Investigations Police, Ms. Sanjuan said the number of homicides in Venezuela climbed 23 percent from January to August of this year, to 7,616. ''The politicization and decrepitude of our policing structures may have more to do with our culture of violence than just poverty,'' Ms. Sanjuan said.
 Pedro Ure, chief inspector for the municipal police in Sucre, a sprawling district of Caracas, led a visitor on a nighttime patrol of slum streets and said tolerant policing methods were part of an attempt to instill respect among his officers for human rights.
 ''This means a citizen can enjoy his rum on the street if he wishes, even though this could be an infraction,'' he said, though he acknowledged that many homicides occurred when suspects were drinking.
 Meanwhile, however, a history of far graver abuses by the police has gone unchecked, some crime analysts note. Last year, the attorney general's office said it was investigating 5,520 presumed executions by the police between 2000 and 2005, involving 6,127 victims. Of the police officials implicated, prosecutors have filed charges against 517, and fewer than 100 had been convicted, according to Human Rights Watch.
 ''We're experiencing the worst crime wave in modern Venezuelan history,'' said Marcos Tarre Briceno, director of the nongovernmental organization Secure Venezuela, ''and the government barely acknowledges its inability to control its own police forces.''

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS WOLK

 BODY:
Cartoonists can creatively distort a story's setting -- playing up its salient details, putting an interpretive spin on its lines and contours -- until it's more vivid and imposing than its real-world model. Will Eisner (1917-2005) was both a great distorter and a great observer, and WILL EISNER'S NEW YORK: Life in the Big City (Norton, $29.95) compiles four volumes of his thinly veiled excuses to draw Manhattan and the Bronx. This collection contains the brief sketches of everyday scenes in his books ''New York: The Big City'' (1981) and ''City People Notebook'' (1989), and the more story-based ''Invisible People'' (2000) and ''The Building'' (1987). 
By the time these books originally appeared, drawing his hometown had been Eisner's specialty for decades. (In his mid-century weekly comic book ''The Spirit,'' he called it Central City, but nobody was fooled; the stories from 1949 recently reprinted in Eisner's ''Spirit Archives, Volume 19,'' some of them ghostwritten by a very young Jules Feiffer, are as Midwestern as an egg cream.) Still, the hyper-real Big Apple of ''Life in the Big City,'' with its leaking fire hydrants and IRT blackouts and crumbling bricks surrounding rickety half-opened windows, seems somehow rooted in the '70s.
 Eisner's clubfooted sentimentality and irony make for better gazing than reading -- delinquent teenagers pulling a fire alarm for kicks are inevitably caught in a building fire on the very next page. His characters play to the cheap seats, with their rubbery anatomy distended into scenery-chewing gesticulations, but they're so alive you can practically smell them, and the same goes for his brownstones and office blocks. The point of ''The Building,'' in fact, is that the grime and decay of a skyscraper is also the manifestation of its accumulated human experience.
 The young cartoonist Brian Wood is fascinated with New York, too, and DMZ: On the Ground (DC/Vertigo, paper, $9.99), the first volume of his collaboration with the artist Riccardo Burchielli, is a love letter to the city and its residents that couldn't be more different from Eisner's. Its premise is that, sometime in the near future, there's an American civil war -- over what, we're never told -- in which Manhattan has become a bullet-riddled no man's land between the Free States (on the Jersey side) and the United States (which has managed to hold Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island). Matty Roth, a young, politically naive reporter who finds himself stranded in the middle of the DMZ, tries to figure out how the city is surviving under fire, not to mention how he's going to survive, given that every heavily armed faction wants the press to act as its propaganda organ.
 The book's messy, deliberately ugly artwork gets much mileage out of depicting, say, Herald Square as a bombed-out disaster area, and Wood's script is full of acidic metaphors for American flag-waving and embedded reportage. But his New Yorkers are gloriously resilient: bridge-and-tunnel types may be lobbing bombs and partisan cant at them, but downtown hipsters have transformed the meatpacking district into the ''Independent Artists' Collective Protectorate,'' Central Park's paramilitary guardians maintain underground bamboo farms, and nobody dares to mess with the Flatiron Building.
 In 1997, the Canadian-born cartoonist Guy Delisle was sent to the ''Special Economic Zone'' of Shenzhen in southern China to supervise an animation project. SHENZHEN: A Travelogue From China (Drawn & Quarterly, $19.95) is a record of his three months of culture shock. Delisle does his best to acclimate to his surroundings, feasting on dog and snake and desperately trying to communicate through improvised sign language, but the linguistic and cultural barriers prove as impassable as the electrified walls around the city. Like last year's ''Pyongyang,'' about his similar stint in North Korea, ''Shenzhen'' is a casual, dryly witty series of observations; Delisle depicts himself as so expressionless he usually doesn't even have a mouth, and lets details like the identical design of every Chinese hotel room speak for themselves. He's got an animator's eye for quirks of motion, though, analyzing the arc of a public fountain's water and the way street vendors make popcorn in a pressure cooker. The best artwork in the book is his impressionistic, unnarrated pen-and-ink-wash drawings of Shenzhen's drab buildings and billboards, but Delisle's keen awareness of how and why he can't connect to the city makes for a rarity: a thoroughly engaging memoir of being bored to distraction.
 George Herriman set his sui generis 1913-1944 comic strip ''Krazy Kat'' in a version of Arizona's Coconino County, abstracted into a perpetually shifting landscape of crags and mesas and scrubby little plants. The strip's setup was almost primal -- an endlessly repeated id-ego-superego scheme of Krazy Kat's desire for love from Ignatz Mouse, Ignatz's willful compulsion to bean Krazy with a brick and Officer Pupp's obligation to drag Ignatz off to jail. Its genius was in the way Herriman used its few scraggly elements as axioms of perpetually renewable comedy. He was less concerned with punch lines than with precariously balanced towers of whimsy.
 KRAZY & IGNATZ: Shifting Sands Dusts Its Cheeks in Powdered Beauty (Fantagraphics, paper, $19.95) reproduces Herriman's full-color Sunday strips from 1937 and 1938, in which he experimented with increasingly bold, modern-art-inspired compositions. Written in a cracked phonetic babble (in one strip, Krazy is upset over atomic warfare -- ''sign tisks ... smeshing that poo l'il adam''), it forces readers to absorb it slowly. And what's really worth lingering over is the broad, desolate background behind Herriman's kat-and-mouse pas de deux, the desert's expanses broken only by a gnarled cactus or a half-carved-out twist of orange and green that stands in for the moon.
 Marjane Satrapi's brief, bitter fable CHICKEN WITH PLUMS (Pantheon, $16.95) is set mostly in the Tehran of 1958; we scarely see its physical landscape, but the crushing weight of its historical moment is everywhere. The book tells the story of the eight-day death from heartbreak of a great musician, Nasser Ali Khan, who gave up on life after his wife smashed his instrument in a rage. A quarter of the way through, we find out it's not quite fiction -- Nasser Ali was Satrapi's great-uncle -- and the story opens up to encompass more of her family's history. His death parallels the decline of Iran's culture, as downtrodden men reminisce about life before the American-sponsored 1953 coup d'etat and nurse their erotic fixations with Sophia Loren. Satrapi's narrative glides along with the terrible momentum of a myth, and her artwork becomes subtly less realistic and more iconic as Nasser Ali drifts into delirium. By the end, Azrael, the angel of death, is hovering around the fringes of the story as a horned silhouette, darkness punctuated only by a few white lines, and the citizens of Tehran have become silhouettes too.

 BODY:
THOMAS JEFFERSON ON WINE
 By John Hailman.
 Illustrated. 457 pp. 
 University Press of Mississippi. $38.
Perhaps life really is better seen through a single window,'' says that famous voyeur Nick Carraway, a line decanted by John Hailman in his introduction to ''Thomas Jefferson on Wine.'' Then again, perhaps viewing a life as multifaceted and eventful as Jefferson's through the narrow lens of oenophilia is like training an electron microscope on an orgy; one is apt to miss some of the major events; or to see them from a bizarre perspective, as in a subchapter on the American Revolution entitled ''The Revolutionary War: Gross Inflation in the Wine Market.'' And yet, that said, there are some of us for whom the question of whether Jefferson sired children with Sally Hemings is less urgent than the question of whether he preferred Bordeaux or Burgundy. 
 In addition to being an architect, archaeologist, astronomer, jurist, musician, natural philosopher, slaveholder and statesman, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third president of the United States, Thomas Jefferson was the founding wine geek. Most of the founding fathers were deeply fond of good claret and Madeira, but none were as passionate or systematic in their appreciation of the grape as Jefferson, who was utterly compulsive on the subject. 
 Jefferson was not only a connoisseur, but a proselytizer. He planted dozens of grape varieties at Monticello, and though he never succeeded in producing a vintage, he predicted that someday America would compete with France and Italy as a wine-producing nation. He believed wine was a healthier beverage than the whiskey and brandy that were consumed in such vast quantities in the colonies, and while in and out of office he pushed for lower import duties. ''No nation is drunken where wine is cheap,'' he declared, ''and none sober where the dearness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as the common beverage. It is, in truth, the only antidote to the bane of whiskey.'' 
 In 1784 Jefferson joined Benjamin Franklin and John Adams as a commissioner in Paris, a position he had coveted. Though he seems to have developed an interest in wine during his student days at William and Mary, it was only after the Revolution, when he went to France, that his oenophilia really metastasized.
 ''The first thing to be done in Paris,'' Adams advised, ''is always to send for a tailor, a perukemaker and a shoemaker, for this nation has established such a domination over fashion that neither clothes, wigs nor shoes made in any other place will do in Paris.'' Jefferson seems to have followed this advice. The 1786 Mather Brown portrait, painted in Paris, shows him in a powdered wig, looking fairly dandy. Practically the next thing he did was to immerse himself in a study of French wines. Shortly after his arrival he ordered 24 cases of Haut-Brion, the great Bordeaux first growth that was the first brand-name wine to appear in English literature: Samuel Pepys had mentioned it as having ''a most particular taste.'' 
 In 1787, after inheriting the title of American minister to the King of France from the ailing Franklin, Jefferson made a trip through France that he described to Lafayette as ''combining public service with private gratification.'' Officially he was checking out prospects for American trade; perhaps coincidentally his itinerary managed to take him through most of the great wine regions of Europe, starting in Burgundy and moving on to the Rhone Valley, making his way down into Italy's Piedmont before looping north again to Bordeaux. Most of Jefferson's widely quoted writing about wine comes from his journal of this journey and a subsequent one to Germany's Rhine and Mosel regions as well as Champagne. He was a keen observer. While in Burgundy he notes that in Volnay they eat ''good wheat bread'' and in nearby Meursault, rye. ''I asked the reason of the difference. They told me that the white wines fail in quality much oftener than the red. ... The farmer therefore cannot afford to feed his laborers so well.'' 
 Much of what he wrote about the character of the country and wines he encountered could have been written last week, spelling eccentricities aside. ''Chambertin, Voujeau and Veaune are strongest,'' he says of the red wines of Burgundy's Cote de Nuits; he declares ''Diquem'' the best Sauternes -- observations that wouldn't seem terribly out of place in the current issue of Wine Spectator. 
 It's hard to imagine any aspect of contemporary life Jefferson would recognize if he were to suddenly reappear among us, with one exception: he would be very comfortable navigating the wine list of a Parisian three-star restaurant. It is a testament partly to his connoisseurship and partly to the durability and conservatism of European wine traditions that many of the wines Jefferson drank and collected are the same ones that excite the interest of today's grape nuts. Almost a century before the official classification of the great growths of Bordeaux, Jefferson recorded a hierarchy remarkably similar to the present classification. In addition to Haut-Brion he ordered multiple cases of Lafite, Margaux and Chateau d'Yquem for the cellar of his new residence, the Hotel de Langeac on the Champs-Elysees. He also ordered many of these wines for the cellar of President George Washington, who was happy to be the beneficiary of Jefferson's growing expertise. When Jefferson occupied the White House himself, he raised the standard of hospitality considerably. As president he spent lavishly on food and wine, perhaps a factor in his later bankruptcy. In his later years at Monticello, he became a budget drinker, substituting the wines of southern France and Tuscany for the great growths of Bordeaux and Burgundy.
 Jefferson is usually assumed to be a Bordeaux man, in part because he wrote about it most and in part because Bordeaux seems like the wine that reflects his character; Bordeaux is an Apollonian wine, a beverage for intellectuals, for men of patience and reason. Austere in its youth, it predictably develops great complexity over the years. There are few surprises in Bordeaux. Burgundy, on the other hand, is a wine to engage the emotions more than the intellect, a wine for the lunatic, the lover and the poet. So it comes as a bit of a shock to learn here that during his years in Paris, when he had access to all the great growths of France, the sober sage of Monticello stocked his cellar with more Burgundy than Bordeaux. His taste in Burgundy seems to have been impeccable: he liked the reds of Volnay, still a connoisseur's wine; among the whites he liked Montrachet, which remains the most coveted white wine on the planet, though he sometimes substituted the less expensive Meursault Goutte d'Or. 
 Perhaps Jefferson's apparent preference for Burgundy will eventually lead to another of those reassessments of his character which seem to come every decade or two; having presented the evidence, Hailman -- who certainly knows his wines -- doesn't make much of it, perhaps because he is so engrossed in the commercial and bookkeeping minutiae of Jefferson's correspondence with wine merchants and customs agents, which take up many pages of this volume. True, it was hard work to be a wine lover in those days. ''To order wine, Jefferson had to specify in each letter the ship, the captain, the ports of entry, how the wines should be packaged and how he would get payment across the ocean and determine and pay the customs duties.'' As someone who can order his Mersault Goutte d'Or online I feel for the guy, but dozens of pages of this kind of trivia may drive the reader to strong drink, which is the last thing the father of American oenophilia would have wished.

HEADLINE: Do Immigrants Make Us Safer?

BYLINE: By Eyal Press. 
Eyal Press, a contributing writer for The Nation, is the author of ''Absolute Convictions: My Father, a City and the Conflict That Divided America.''

 BODY:
Although the midterm election failed to render a clear verdict on illegal immigration, the new Democratic Congress may enact sweeping legislation tightening border controls and allowing more guest workers next year. If that happens, the rancorous debate about how undocumented workers affect jobs and wages in the United States will be rejoined. So, too, will an equally rancorous, if less prominent, debate: Do immigrants make the U.S. more crime-ridden and dangerous?
In an age of Latino gangs and Chinese criminal networks, the notion that communities with growing immigrant populations tend to be unsafe is fairly well established, at least in the popular imagination. In a national survey conducted in 2000, 73 percent of Americans said they believe that immigrants are either ''somewhat'' or ''very'' likely to increase crime, higher than the 60 percent who fear they are ''likely to cause Americans to lose jobs.'' Cities like Avon Park, Fla., have considered ordinances recently to dissuade businesses from hiring illegal immigrants, whose presence ''destroys our neighborhoods.'' Even President Bush, whose perceived generosity to undocumented workers has earned him vilification on the right, commented in a speech this May that illegal immigration ''strains state and local budgets and brings crime to our communities.'' 
 So goes the conventional wisdom. But is it true? In fact, according to evidence cropping up in various places, the opposite may be the case. Ramiro Martinez Jr., a professor of criminal justice at Florida International University, has sifted through homicide records in border cities like San Diego and El Paso, both heavily populated by Mexican immigrants, both places where violent crime has fallen significantly in recent years. ''Almost without exception,'' he told me, ''I've discovered that the homicide rate for Hispanics was lower than for other groups, even though their poverty rate was very high, if not the highest, in these metropolitan areas.'' He found the same thing in the Haitian neighborhoods of Miami. In his book ''New York Murder Mystery,'' the criminologist Andrew Karmen examined the trend in New York City and likewise found that the ''disproportionately youthful, male and poor immigrants'' who arrived during the 1980s and 1990s ''were surprisingly law-abiding'' and that their settlement into once-decaying neighborhoods helped ''put a brake on spiraling crime rates.''
 The most prominent advocate of the ''more immigrants, less crime'' theory is Robert J. Sampson, chairman of the sociology department at Harvard. A year ago, Sampson was an author of an article in The American Journal of Public Health that reported the findings of a detailed study of crime in Chicago. Based on information gathered on the perpetrators of more than 3,000 violent acts committed between 1995 and 2002, supplemented by police records and community surveys, it found that the rate of violence among Mexican-Americans was significantly lower than among both non-Hispanic whites and blacks.
 In June, Sampson and I drove out to a neighborhood in Little Village, Chicago's largest Hispanic community. The area we visited is decidedly poor: in terms of per capita income, 84 percent of Chicago neighborhoods are better off and 99 percent have a greater proportion of residents with a high-school education. As we made our way down a side street, Sampson noted that many of the residents make their living as domestic workers and in other low-wage occupations, often paid off the books because they are undocumented. In places of such concentrated disadvantage, a certain level of violence and social disorder is assumed to be inevitable. As we strolled around, Sampson paused on occasion to make a mental note of potential trouble signs: an alley strewn with garbage nobody had bothered to pick up; a sign in Spanish in several windows, complaining about the lack of a park in the vicinity where children can play. Yet for all of this, the neighborhood was strikingly quiet. And, according to the data Sampson has collected, it is surprisingly safe. The burglary rate in the neighborhood is in the bottom fifth of the city. The overall crime rate is nearly in the bottom third.
 The safety of neighborhoods like these has received little attention in the debate about immigration -- or, for that matter, the debate about crime. Ever since cities like New York began cracking down on panhandling and loitering in the mid-1990s, a move that coincided with a precipitous drop in violence, policy makers have embraced the so-called broken-windows theory, which emphasizes the deterrent effects of punishing such minor offenses. Lately, though, scholars have begun to question whether ''broken windows'' deserves all the credit for diminishing crime after all. Some researchers have linked progress to the cessation of the crack epidemic. Others point to an improved economy, community-policing initiatives or even the legalization of abortion, which reduced the number of poor, unwanted children growing up in high-risk neighborhoods. 
 Sampson's theory may be the most provocative yet. Could America's cities be safer today not because fewer unwanted children live in them but because a lot more immigrants do? Could illegal immigration be making the nation a more law-abiding place?
 There are, to be sure, scholars who take issue with this rosy picture. Wesley Skogan, a political scientist at Northwestern University, has spent the past 13 years tracking violence and social disorder in the white, black and Latino communities in Chicago. In a new book, ''Police and Community in Chicago: A Tale of Three Cities,'' just out from Oxford University Press, Skogan concludes that the big success story took place not in immigrant areas but in African-American ones, where participation in community-policing programs was highest and violence fell the most. ''About two-thirds of the crime decline in Chicago since 1991 took place in black neighborhoods,'' Skogan says. In Hispanic communities, by contrast, Skogan found that the fear of crime, as measured in surveys of residents, and real social disorder -- gang activity, loitering -- actually became worse as the foreign-born population increased. Skogan acknowledges that Hispanic immigrants don't show up much in arrest records, but he says he believes part of the explanation for this rests in the fact that those who are undocumented go to enormous lengths to ''stay off the radar.'' Many also come from a country, Mexico, where distrust of law enforcement is endemic, which is why he suspects they underreport crime and participate less in community-policing programs, as his study found.
 Sampson doesn't deny that crime may be underreported in immigrant neighborhoods. Nonetheless, he is quick to note that as the ranks of foreigners in the United States boomed during the 1990s -- increasing by more than 50 percent to 31 million -- America's cities became markedly less dangerous. That these two trends might be related has been overlooked, he says, in part because immigrants, like African-Americans, often trigger negative associations regardless of how they actually behave. Not long ago, Sampson and Stephen W. Raudenbush, a sociologist who teaches at the University of Chicago, conducted an experiment to test this idea. The experiment drew on interviews with more than 3,500 Chicago residents, each of whom was asked how serious problems like loitering and public drinking were where they lived. The responses were compared with the actual level of chaos in the neighborhood, culled from police data and by having researchers drive along hundreds of blocks to document every sign of decay and disorder they could spot. 
 The social and ethnic composition of a neighborhood turned out to have a profound bearing on how residents of Chicago perceived it, irrespective of the actual conditions on the streets. ''In particular,'' Sampson and Raudenbush found, ''the proportion of blacks and the proportion of Latinos in a neighborhood were related positively and significantly to perceived disorder.'' Once you adjusted for the ethnic, racial and class composition of a community, ''much of the variation in levels of disorder that appeared to be explained by what residents saw was spurious.''
 In other words, the fact that people think neighborhoods with large concentrations of brown-skinned immigrants are unsafe makes sense in light of popular stereotypes and subliminal associations. But that doesn't mean there is any rational basis for their fears. Such a message hasn't sat well with everyone. As the debate about immigration has grown more heated and polarized, Sampson has found himself barraged with hate mail. ''Vicious stuff,'' he told me, ''you know, thinly veiled threats, people saying, 'You should just come and look at the Mexican gangs here.' '' But Sampson has also won some far-flung admirers. In Mexico, one of the nation's leading dailies, La Reforma, published a story hailing his findings, under the triumphal heading, ''Son barrios de paisanos menos violentos que los blancos '' (''Neighborhoods of our countrymen are less violent than white ones'').
 If immigrants really are making America safer, why is this so? ''That,'' Sampson says, ''is the $64,000 question.'' In discussing the persistence of poverty and the causes of crime, sociologists on the left often emphasize the importance of ''structural'' factors like unemployment and racism, while scholars on the right tend to focus on individual behavior like having an illegitimate child and using drugs. Sampson prefers to focus on the nature of the social interactions taking place in particular neighborhoods. At one point in Little Village, we strolled past a house where a couple of young girls were playing outside. It didn't seem that anybody was supervising them. Next door, however, an elderly woman was standing just inside the window. The window was open, and as Sampson and I passed by, her eyes did not leave us. ''Did you notice that?'' asked Sampson as we proceeded down the block. She was making sure the two strangers who had appeared weren't dangerous. It was an example of the kind of informal social control that Sampson says can prevent even the poorest neighborhoods from spiraling into chaos and that he suspects may distinguish many tightknit immigrant communities. 
 But Sampson also notes the importance of another factor, one often stressed by conservatives: Mexicans in Chicago, his study found, are more likely to be married than either blacks or whites. ''The family dynamic is very noticeable here,'' Sampson remarked as we passed a girl with long braided hair clutching her mother's hand. Her father followed a few steps behind. Sampson does not believe family structure explains everything: the data showed that in immigrant neighborhoods, even individuals who are not in married households are 15 percent less likely to engage in crime. Yet neither did he discount its significance. 
 To the extent a strong family structure does play a role, it has left Sampson understandably mystified why the most strident opponents of immigration so often come from the right. Shouldn't conservatives concerned about the breakdown of traditional values be celebrating these family-oriented newcomers? This is indeed what David Brooks argued not long ago in a column in The New York Times, gently chiding his fellow conservatives for reflexively assuming foreigners have had a corrosive impact on the nation's moral fiber. ''As immigration has surged, violent crime has fallen 57 percent,'' Brooks noted in the column, which was titled ''Immigrants to Be Proud Of.''
 Sampson wrote Brooks a note complimenting him on the piece. But he is under no illusions that his views on crime and immigration will endear him to Republicans clamoring for America's borders to be sealed. On the other hand, it might not make his colleagues on the left any happier. The flip side of the impulse to demonize immigrants is, after all, the tendency to romanticize them as hard-working Horatio Alger types who valiantly lift themselves out of poverty -- with the implication that if they can avoid falling victim to drugs, gangs and other inner-city scourges, those who succumb to these forces have only themselves to blame. In calling attention to the virtues of immigrant communities, there is a risk that Sampson's work will be taken by some as a commentary on the high crime rate in some poor African-American communities. 
 Of course, comparing the experiences of Mexican immigrants and African-Americans may seem grossly unfair, not least because studies have shown that many employers are willing to hire foreigners (on the assumption they work hard) but not blacks (on the assumption they don't). Yet the fact that it is unfair hardly means such comparisons won't be made -- even though immigrants commit less crime not only than African-Americans in inner-city neighborhoods but less than American-born white people as well. 
 Before anyone rushes to conclude that crime would vanish from America's cities if only more foreigners moved here, it is worth considering something else Sampson's study uncovered. It is a finding as troubling as his basic thesis about immigrants is hopeful. Second-generation immigrants in Chicago were significantly more likely to commit crimes than their parents, it turns out, and those of the third generation more likely still. 
 Opponents of immigration frequently charge that Mexican immigrants threaten America's national identity because of their failure to assimilate. A more reasonable concern might be the opposite of this: not that foreigners in low-income neighborhoods refuse to adopt the norms of the native culture but that their children and grandchildren do.
 The sociologists Alejandro Portes and Ruben G. Rumbaut conducted a multiyear longitudinal study of immigrant children in Miami and San Diego. The offspring of foreigners who grow up in impoverished ghettos, they have argued, particularly Mexican-Americans exposed to racial as well as economic discrimination, often lose the drive and optimism their parents had and come to share the widespread attitude among their inner-city peers that survival depends on brandishing an oppositional stance toward school authorities and, more broadly, a culture that looks down on them. ''The learning of new cultural patterns and entry into American social circles does not lead in these cases to upward mobility but to exactly the opposite,'' Portes and Rumbaut contend, a process of ''downward assimilation'' that has created a new ''rainbow underclass.'' Astoundingly, in a recent paper, Rumbaut and several doctoral students found that the incarceration rate among second-generation Mexicans was eight times higher than for the first generation; among Vietnamese, it was more than 10 times higher. Where the first-generation immigrants in their data were less likely to wind up in prison than native-born whites, the second (with the exception of Filipinos and Chinese) were more likely. 
 Such findings suggest the class and race divisions that cleave America's social landscape may prove decisive after all. In Sweden, a country with markedly less inequality and more generous social welfare policies -- and far less violent crime -- studies have shown the rate of offending tends to be lower for the second generation of immigrants than for the first. Of course, America has historically done an admirable job of assimilating newcomers, and the theory of ''downward assimilation'' has not gone unchallenged. Recently, a team of researchers completed a study in New York of more than 2,200 second-generation immigrants and 1,200 native-born Americans that allowed them to compare the rate of offending among various groups, West Indians versus African-Americans, for instance, or Russians versus American-born whites. According to John Mollenkopf, a political scientist at the CUNY Graduate Center, the arrest rates among the children of immigrants were the same or lower in every case. ''The second-generation immigrants are doing better, on the whole, than the native-born,'' he said.
 Clearly, the debate over assimilation will continue, as Sampson acknowledges. When I asked him why he thought the positive trends he and his colleagues had discovered in Chicago seemed to become diluted by the second and third generations, he paused. 
 ''That's another $64,000 question,'' he said, chuckling softly. Part of the explanation, he went on to speculate, may rest in the exposure subsequent generations have to the things that often lure young people in America's cities to engage in illicit activities: drugs, cash, cars, contraband. Part of it, as well, might be the adoption of streetwise attitudes that lead people to react quickly to insults in the United States. One thing it is difficult for Americans to realize, he said, is how unusually violent their country is, particularly in light of its inordinate wealth. Recently, scholars have become increasingly interested in the historical origins of American violence. Richard Nisbett of the University of Michigan and others have traced our ''culture of violence'' back to the valorization of retribution and dueling among Scotch-Irish immigrants in the American South, suggesting that antique folkways have become encoded into the nation's DNA. 
 It is a dark view, perhaps, but Sampson is hopeful that the good news about crime in recent years can continue, albeit under certain conditions, among them less alarmism about the supposedly dangerous foreigners in our midst. Sampson shook his head when describing some of the correspondence he has received from people absolutely certain that immigrants are sowing mayhem in our streets. In the last few years, he noted, such people have had somewhat less cause for worry, since the numbers show the flow of newcomers has subsided a bit. Meanwhile, the crime rate in some cities has begun to creep back up. Sampson, for one, does not think this is a mere coincidence. Those clamoring for America to close its borders in order to prevent violence-prone strangers from flooding our shores may well get their way, he acknowledged, but they ought to be careful what they wish for.

HEADLINE: The New, Soft Paternalism

BYLINE: By Jim Holt. 
Jim Holt, a regular contributor to the magazine, is working on a book about the puzzle of existence.

 BODY:
When the government tells you that you can't smoke marijuana or that you must wear a helmet when you ride your motorcycle even if you happen to like the feeling of the wind in your hair, it is being paternalistic. It is largely treating you the way a parent treats a child, restricting your liberty for what it deems to be your own good. Paternalistic laws aren't very popular in this country. We hew to the principle that, children and the mentally ill apart, an individual is a better judge of what's good for him than the state is and that people should be free to do what they wish as long as their actions don't harm others. Contrary to what many people believe, you can even commit suicide legally (although if you don't live in Oregon, you should think twice about seeking assistance). 
But what if it could be shown that even highly competent, well-informed people fail to make choices in their best interest? And what if the government could somehow step in and nudge them in the right direction without interfering with their liberty, or at least not very much? Welcome to the new world of ''soft paternalism.'' The old ''hard'' paternalism says, We know what's best for you, and we'll force you to do it. By contrast, soft paternalism says, You know what's best for you, and we'll help you to do it.
 Here's an example. In some states with casino gambling, like Missouri and Michigan, compulsive gamblers have the option of putting their names on a blacklist, or ''self-exclusion'' list, that bars them from casinos. Once on the list, they are banned for life. If they violate the ban, they risk being arrested and having their winnings confiscated. In Missouri, more than 10,000 people have availed themselves of this program. In Michigan, the first person to sign up for it was, as it happens, also the first to be arrested for violating its terms when he couldn't resist sneaking back to the blackjack tables; he was sentenced to a year's probation, and the state kept his winnings of $1,223.
 The voluntary gambling blacklist is an example of what's called a self-binding scheme. It is a way of restructuring the external world so that when future temptations arise, you will have no choice but to do what you've judged to be best for you. The classic case is that of Ulysses, who ordered his men to tie him to the mast of his ship so that he could hear the song of the Sirens without being lured to his destruction. As a freely chosen hedge against weakness of the will, self-binding would seem to enlarge individual liberty, not reduce it. So what is there to object to in a program like Missouri's or Michigan's?
 Plenty, say libertarian critics. To begin with, they don't like soft paternalism when it involves the state's coercive power; they are much happier with private self-binding schemes, like alcoholism clinics, Christmas savings clubs and Weight Watchers. They also worry that soft paternalism can be a slippery slope to the harder variety, as when campaigns to discourage smoking give way to ''sin taxes'' and outright bans. But some libertarians have deeper misgivings. What bothers them is the way soft paternalism relies for its justification on the notion that each of us contains multiple selves -- and that one of those selves is worth more than the others.
 You might naively imagine that you are one person, the same entity from day to day. To the 18th-century philosopher David Hume, however, the idea of a permanent ''I'' was a fiction. Our mind, Hume wrote, ''is nothing but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which succeed each other with an inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement.'' According to this way of thinking, the self that inhabits your body today is only similar to, not identical with, the self that is going to inhabit your body tomorrow. And the self that will inhabit your body decades hence? A virtual stranger.
 The idea of multiple selves may seem like a stoner's fantasy, but economists who study human decision-making have found it surprisingly useful. Consider: Most people, if given a choice today between doing seven hours of irksome work on May 1, 2007, versus eight hours on May 15, 2007, opt for the former. When May 1 arrives, however, they will find that their preference has flipped: they now wish to put off the work for a couple of weeks, even at the cost of having to do the extra hour's worth. Why this inconsistency, if the self calling the shots is one and the same?
 Further evidence for the fragmented self comes from neuroscience. Brain scans show that the emotional part of the brain, the limbic system, is especially active when the prospect of immediate gratification presents itself. But choice among longer-term options triggers more activity in the ''reasoning'' part of the brain, located (suitably enough) higher up in the cortex. Now suppose you're tempted by a diet-violating Twinkie. Which part of your brain -- the shortsighted emotional part or the farsighted reasoning part -- gets to be the decider? There may be no built-in hierarchy here, just two autonomous brain modules in competition. That is why you might find yourself eating the Twinkie even while knowing it's bad for you. (A similar disconnect between two parts of your brain occurs when a visual illusion doesn't go away even after you learn it's an illusion.)
 The short-run self cares only about the present. It is perfectly happy to indulge today and offload the costs onto future selves. For example, recent studies show that teenage smokers do not underestimate the risk of getting lung cancer as an adult (if anything, they tend to overestimate it); they simply don't mind making the future self suffer for the pleasure of the moment. The long-run self may deplore this ruinous behavior, but its prudent resolutions are continually ignored. Yet it can enforce its will indirectly by shaping the environment to constrain some short-run selves from exploiting others -- by, say, putting a time lock on the refrigerator.
 But why, some skeptics ask, should the government side with your prudent long-run self against your hedonistic short-run selves? What's so great about the long-run self, anyway? As the economist Glen Whitman has observed in a shrewd critique of soft paternalism, the harms that selves impose on one another are reciprocal: ''The long-run self can harm the short-run self by adopting self-control devices -- such as flushing cigarettes down the toilet, refusing to allow ice cream in the house, checking into a clinic and so on.'' It is not good to be profligate, lazy and obese, but neither is to good to be a miser, a workaholic or an anorexic.
 If the goal is to promote freedom, though, there is an interesting argument favoring the long-run self. A distinctive quality of humans, as the third earl of Shaftesbury observed three centuries ago, is that we do not simply have desires; we also have feelings about our desires. Take the unhappy heroin addict: he gives himself an injection because he desires the drug, but he also has a desire to be rid of this desire. The philosopher Harry Frankfurt has given such ''second order'' desires a central role in his analysis of free will: we act freely, he submits, when we act on a desire that we actually desire to have, one that we endorse as our own. Beings that do not reflect on the desirability of their desires -- like animals and infants and, perhaps, our short-run selves -- are what Frankfurt calls ''wantons.''
 People have fashioned a wide range of techniquesfor keeping their inner wantons under control -- like buying a pint of ice cream instead of the more economical quart because they know they would end up consuming the latter in one sitting. So why can't soft paternalism be left to the private sector, as some libertarians prefer? The problem is that private self-binding schemes are easily subverted when someone can make a buck off your weakness of will. One Michigan man who signed up for a casino's private self-blacklisting program found the owners all too accommodating when he had a change of heart. ''Within a half an hour, I was back in,'' he said.
 Editorializing against soft paternalism earlier this year, The Economist warned that ''life would be duller if every reckless spirit could outsource self-discipline to the state.'' There are certainly more exalted ways to achieve mastery over unwelcome impulses. Thinkers of an existentialist kidney, like Jean-Paul Sartre, used to insist that each of us is free to redefine his character through an act of radical choice. For the religiously inclined, an access of divine grace might be what is needed to stiffen the will.
 But what if you are one of those people who rely on more mundane stratagems, like self-binding? The general problem you face (as put by the political theorist Jon Elster) is this: For a given uphill goal and a given strength of will, does there exist a path, however circuitous, that will get you to the top of the hill? By adding a new path here and there, state soft paternalism makes it more likely that the answer will be yes.

HEADLINE: Post-Apartheid Fiction

BYLINE: By Rachel Donadio. 
Rachel Donadio is a writer and editor at the Times Book Review.

 BODY:
Niq Mhlongo is one of the most high-spirited and irreverent new voices of South Africa's post-apartheid literary scene. One afternoon in the spring, he was sitting in the front seat of his friend Gugu's blue BMW pointing out Soweto landmarks. Buoyant, wearing a floppy knitted hat on his round, shaved head, Mhlongo chatted with Gugu in English and a combination of Zulu and Sotho they dubbed ''Zutho'' while Gugu drove and fiddled with his BlackBerry at red lights. We passed the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital compound, the largest hospital in the world, down hilly Vilakazi Street, where Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu once lived, past brick ranch houses transformed into bed-and-breakfasts catering to tourists nostalgic for the struggle, along roads lined with KFC billboards and low-slung walls painted with colorful advertisements for undertakers: ''Green Pastures Funerals. Affordable and Dignified.'' 
Not owning a car and concerned that we might attract undue attention touring Soweto by taxi, Mhlongo had asked if I'd consider paying ''a contribution'' for Gugu to drive us, and I readily agreed. That turned out to attract another kind of attention. Nearly as soon as we got on the highway from the parking lot of one of Johannesburg's countless shopping malls, a police car signaled us to pull over. In contrast to the usual American protocol, the officers stayed in their car while Gugu got out to talk to them. He came back a few minutes later, smiling. They had wanted 10 rand (about $1.40), he said, a casual bribe that left both him and Mhlongo completely unfazed. ''I think about 95 percent of the people that own cars here have experienced it,'' Mhlongo later wrote in an e-mail message. ''It was not a surprise for me at all. The urban legend here is that you cannot drive your car without carrying petty cash for 'tax.' ''
 Mhlongo and his cohort have in one short decade made social and economic leaps that might previously have taken generations. Born to a poor family in Soweto under apartheid, he came of age in a culture of post-apartheid possibility and has joined, however precariously, a black middle class that's a small but growing fraction of the population. As such, he and other young black novelists carry the full promise -- and burden -- of their country's future. 
 In his brash first novel, ''Dog Eat Dog,'' published in 2004, Mhlongo, now 33, wrote with verve and candor about the anxieties of his demographic: children who are the first in their families to attend college, who are worried about making a living and fearful of disappointing their relatives' expectations, let alone their country's, yet who aren't afraid to play the system. Set in 1994, the heady year of South Africa's first post-apartheid elections, the first-person novel tells the story of Dingamanzi Njomane, a street-smart kid from the townships struggling to stay afloat at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg. Informed by the university that he doesn't meet the criteria for financial aid, he storms into the bursary and shouts at a white woman who handles such cases. He tells her supervisor that his mother supports nine relatives on his late father's pension. They had even shut off the electricity, he says. ''I was not ashamed that I lied. Living in this South Africa of ours you have to master the art of lying in order to survive,'' Mhlongo's protagonist explains. ''As she looked at me I hid my hands under the edge of the table so that she couldn't see my gold-plated Pulsar watch, which I had bought the previous year at American Swiss.''
 At one point, a blond white woman singles out Dingz to help a black woman having trouble with an A.T.M. machine. ''Why pick me when there are three people in front of me?'' he asks himself. ''Is it because I'm black?'' he says out loud, then ponders: ''Yes, it is true that I was implying that she was a racist. It was the season of change when everyone was trying hard to disown apartheid, but to me the color white was synonymous with the word and I didn't regret what I had said to the blonde. Anyway, I had been told that playing the race card is a good strategy for silencing those whites who still think they are more intelligent than black people. Even in Parliament it was often used. When the white political parties questioned the black parties they would be reminded of their past atrocities even if their questions were legitimate. Then the white political parties would have to divert from their original questions and apologize for their past deeds.'' 
 Today Mhlongo says, racism still exists in South Africa, ''although now it is no longer institutionalized or overt like before.'' As Mhlongo's work makes eminently clear, the era of struggle literature is over in South Africa. Today, the country is contending with the complications of freedom. A racial divide once enforced by law has become an economic divide that falls mostly along racial lines. Everyone is profoundly uncertain of his place. Four out of five South Africans are black, one in four is unemployed and at least one in nine H.I.V. positive. Violent crime is rampant, rape rates are among the highest on the globe. South Africa today is a grand experiment in multicultural democracy, where the leadership is black, money largely white and the line between empowerment and exploitation ever shifting. The preamble to the 1996 Constitution -- perhaps the most significant document to emerge from the post-apartheid period, if not the country's entire history -- says, ''South Africa belongs to all who live in it, united in our diversity.'' The unity is willed: not quite a facade but not quite a foundation, either. 
 The state of the novel is hardly among South Africa's top priorities, and yet in some ways its bill of health mirrors that of the culture as a whole. In the mid-'80s, J. M. Coetzee famously asserted that the ''great South African novel'' -- a book that would encompass all strata of society the way ''War and Peace'' did for Russia -- would be impossible to write in a country so divided. Twelve years after the end of apartheid, the South African literary scene remains as fragmented as ever, with writers exploring their own ethnic experiences. Although more books are published than ever before, few create a national conversation, in part because South Africa has been transformed from a resistance culture to a consumer culture, where the novel is less vital. During apartheid, writers contended with a government that underscored their importance by banning their books. Today, as the artist William Kentridge put it when I spoke to him in Johannesburg in the spring, South Africa is best understood ''not as a post-apartheid society but a post-anti-apartheid one.'' Writers, like everyone else, are coming to terms with a new moral order. ''What are our themes now?'' the accomplished literary novelist Damon Galgut, who is white, asked when I met him in Cape Town. ''How do we pick up? The resistance literature is gone; there's nothing to resist.'' Today the conversation has shifted away from the search for the great South African novel and toward the search for the great black South African novelist. Since the end of apartheid, the national and international spotlight has been shifting to black writers, driven by an expectation that this is their moment to write the next chapter of South African history: the political, social and economic coming-of-age of the 80 percent of the population that was formerly disenfranchised. 
 ''This is a great time to be a black writer in South Africa,'' Mhlongo says. ''Most black writers who wrote before democracy focused on politics, but now there are lots of things to write about -- the AIDS pandemic, poverty, crime, xenophobia, unemployment. My scope is not limited to apartheid because there are so many things happening in South Africa today.'' But the wealth of new material has produced other complications: intense pressure on the few black novelists who have emerged, compounded by white guilt about why there aren't more of them. In 2000, Shaun de Waal, then literary editor of The Mail and Guardian, a left-wing weekly newspaper, lamented in a column that he had grown ''very tired of hearing the question inevitably posed by visiting foreign journalists trawling for information about South African literature: Where are the new young black writers?'' De Waal, who is descended from the first Dutch colonists to settle in South Africa, wrote that he was tired of ''feeling apologetic'' about the lack of clear answers. ''There seemed to be an expectation that as apartheid collapsed and its legacy faded a new generation of young black writers (let's call them Y.B.W.'s) would emerge in their full glory, spurred on by the new freedoms of a new democracy. It was thought that the combination of apartheid censorship and lack of educational advantage had held them back, but now their time had come.'' That didn't happen. ''If you were a bright young thing,'' de Waal suggested, ''with creative talent in a marketplace uninterested in serious writers but desperate to find black people to fill highly paid government and corporate jobs, what would you do?''
 Niq Mhlongo is one of only a handful of black novelists of his generation to have achieved a certain level of prominence. Two others in this small group have died in the past two years: K. Sello Duiker committed suicide at the age of 30, and Phaswane Mpe died at 34, probably of AIDS. Celebrated while alive, the two became the subjects of intense hagiography after their deaths, seen as martyrs of the country. In his 2001 novel, ''Welcome to Our Hillbrow,'' Mpe captured the dislocation and despair of people who moved in the late '90s from rural South Africa to Hillbrow, a rough neighborhood in downtown Johannesburg with overcrowded high-rises and a large population of immigrants from elsewhere in Africa. In the South African literary imagination, Hillbrow has come to represent everything frightening and promising about the new South Africa; it is at once a scene of drugs, crime and xenophobia toward immigrants and also what theorists enthusiastically call ''Afropolitan,'' a space that transcends national boundaries. Mpe, who taught in the department of African literature at the University of the Witwatersrand, moved to Johannesburg from a rural village. In his novel, he wrote about AIDS and explored the collision between urban economic mobility and the traditional beliefs that migrants imported to the city. ''Different traditions merge into each other, and often new ideas are undermined by the old,'' Mpe said in a 2001 interview with South Africa's Sunday Times. Before his death in 2004, Mpe began preparations to become a sangoma, or traditional healer.
 Duiker was a child of the city. Raised in Soweto by middle-class parents who had university degrees, in the '80s he was sent out of the township to attend a Catholic primary school. He later became one of the first black students to attend a largely white, elite progressive private high school, the Redhill School, a path not without its complications. Duiker also wrestled with his sexuality. His first novel, ''Thirteen Cents'' (2000), is about a child hustler who turns tricks for rich white men in Cape Town. His second, more ambitious and richly realized novel, ''The Quiet Violence of Dreams'' (2001), tells the story of Tshepo, a young black university student who winds up in a mental hospital, given the diagnosis ''cannabis-induced psychosis'' and unable to make sense of his life, his inner turmoil a reflection of a broader societal confusion. He eventually turns to prostitution. The novel also examined the melding of black and white through consumer culture. ''When you go out in some places in Cape Town no one really cares that you're black and that your mother sent you to a private school so that you could speak well,'' Duiker wrote. ''No one cares that you're white and that your father abuses his colleagues at work and calls them kaffirs at home. On the dance floor ... people only care that you can dance and that you look good.'' There, he went on to write, ''designer labels are the new Esperanto,'' and kwaito, or township music, and the rave music of white club culture begin to merge. ''The people I know never forget that in essence the difference between kwaito and rave is down to a difference in beats per minute and that the margin is becoming narrower.''
 In his young life, Duiker was a rising star, anointed as a spokesman for his vexed generation. ''At the tender age of 28, he has had two novels published and is well into his third,'' The Sunday Times declared in 2002. ''And his voice is growing stronger by the day.'' (Duiker's third novel, ''The Hidden Star,'' a kind of folk tale, was published posthumously in the spring.) Although Duiker was clearly contending with mental illness, his suicide has come to seem a result of external as well as internal pressures. When I met him in Johannesburg, Fred Khumalo, a journalist for The Sunday Times, a novelist and the author of a recent memoir about his years as an anti-apartheid activist, suggested: ''Maybe in a way we killed him. We put him on a pedestal. We put pressure on him, we expected so much of him.''
 Mhlongo now feels the pressure left by their deaths. Mpe and Duiker, he wrote in an e-mail message, ''ventured into new themes that are relevant to South Africa today'' -- like homophobia, homelessness and xenophobia. ''Now people expect us (few young writers as we are) to fill their shoes and explore more themes that were uncommon to South African writing before.''
 For his part, Mhlongo is wary of being boxed in by a public persona he is also trying to cultivate. ''I got this name tag of being the 'voice of the kwaito generation' in writing,'' he says. The moniker is the South African equivalent of the hip-hop generation -- a marketing term as much as a demographic one. ''This sometimes is a bit harmful to my performance, because I always have to behave in a certain way, or write in a certain way that is associated with this generation.'' Namely, to keep up with the mores, music and slang of his friends from the township. Indeed, Mhlongo supports himself with freelance projects about his world -- writing comics and the occasional newspaper feature or for television. He's working on a screenplay for a film about Khabzela, a well-known D. J. who died from AIDS after refusing to take antiretroviral drugs. ''My publisher once told me that if I want to be a writer I must keep my old job because there is no money in writing,'' Mhlongo says. Mhlongo lives -- or ''stays'' in Jo'burg parlance -- in Ridgeway, a mixed-race but effectively black suburb. Although it is only a 5- or 10-minute drive from Soweto, the distance is symbolic as much as geographic -- like leaving the projects or moving to Manhattan from the outer boroughs once you've made it, only with far more political weight. Although he no longer lives in Soweto proper, Mhlongo goes back all the time. ''I like the noise,'' he told me, gazing at the horizon from the roof terrace of the Rock, a Soweto bar and nightclub that's the pulsing heart of his social scene. 
 In the past few years, Mhlongo has become something of a regular on the international circuit, attending conferences and residencies in Holland, Belgium, Germany and elsewhere in Africa. He was invited to the prestigious Bread Loaf Writers' Conference in Vermont this summer but chose to attend a conference in Kenya instead. ''Dog Eat Dog'' has been translated into Spanish, and last summer Mhlongo traveled to Spain to collect a literary award, which came with a heavy bronze statue. At the Alicante Airport, ''they scanned my prize and thought it was a bomb,'' he said. 
 But even as Mhlongo achieves success abroad, in South Africa the people he writes about aren't necessarily reading his work. Much to his disappointment, in all of Soweto, ''Dog Eat Dog'' is for sale in only one place: the upscale bookshop of the Hector Pieterson Museum, dedicated to a 12-year-old boy killed in a 1976 student demonstration protesting the government's plan to teach all subjects in Afrikaans. An impressive new structure with a permanent photographic exhibit on the political and social history of Soweto, the museum clearly caters to tourists, not locals. Indeed, in South Africa, literature is something of a luxury item. Books are expensive -- a paperback can cost $20, while the average per capita income is less than $5,000 a year. But the single greatest obstacle to reading culture in South Africa is illiteracy. In Soweto, Mhlongo took me to the tiny, dark one-story township house where he lived as a child and where his older sister Margreth now lives with her small children. She met us in the spare kitchen. Although in her late 40s, she looked older and was missing a few teeth. She didn't speak English, Mhlongo said, and had never learned how to read.
 Growing up in Soweto, Mhlongo did not have a mother tongue: he writes today in English, speaks Zulu and Sotho with his friends and knows his way around Afrikaans. Mhlongo is the seventh of nine children born between the late '50s and the late '70s, ''all from the same mother and father,'' he noted. His father, who died when Mhlongo was a teenager, worked as a sweeper in a post office, and his older brothers supported the family. ''Food was O.K., but cold drinks were a luxury,'' he said. Mhlongo's mother is from the northeast Limpopo Province and sent Mhlongo there to finish high school. He failed his matriculation exam in October 1990 -- something he attributes to his study habits and the fact that schools had been interrupted when Mandela was let out of prison in February of that year. Mhlongo had a desultory academic career, albeit at two of South Africa's best universities. He studied African literature and political studies at the University of the Witwatersrand for a few years, then transferred to the University of Cape Town to study law. He didn't do particularly well and all but dropped out. ''I got bored,'' Mhlongo said. So he wrote a novel: ''I was lucky to have had it published the first time I submitted it.'' Mhlongo's second novel, due out next year, is about the pressures on the first children in their families to attend university. The protagonist's family doesn't have a ''Western education,'' Mhlongo explained to me, and expects him to become the breadwinner. Afraid of shaming his family by confessing that he flunked out, he pretends to be a lawyer and sets up an office in the township. The novel is tentatively titled ''After Tears,'' for a ritual that has become a mainstay of township social life: a night of carousing to honor the newly deceased. After visiting his sister, we drove to the gates of Avalon, the vast, unassuming field that is Soweto's main cemetery. A plain sign at the gate listed burial fees. ''More people live there than in Soweto,'' Mhlongo said. 
 No longer fueled by rage at a morally bankrupt regime, as their parents were, Mhlongo's generation is instead beset by anxiety about how to take advantage of the freedom it inherited. Young writers admire enormously those who helped dismantle apartheid. For many, the godfather of that generation is Zakes Mda, who at 58 is one of the most prominent black novelist in South African history. A celebrated playwright during the struggle years, Mda has published five novels since 1995 and won every literary prize offered in South Africa. (He is also one of the few South African novelists to be published in the United States, in his case by the distinguished literary publisher Farrar, Straus & Giroux.) Mhlongo speaks highly of Mda's work, and the older novelist knew Mpe and Duiker before their deaths. (He was particularly close to Duiker, who he says would call him in moments of despair.) Both generationally and perhaps temperamentally, Mda seems as secure of his place in South Africa as Mhlongo and his contemporaries seem uncertain about theirs. This is not without its paradoxes, because for much of the past 30 years, Mda has lived abroad. Mda may have a more central place in South Africa's literary and political spheres than any other novelist today, but he lives in Athens, Ohio, where he has taught creative writing and literature at Ohio University since 2002. 
 When I met him in Ohio in August, in the flush of late summer, Mda said that he considers himself a migrant worker in the States, not an emigre. A rotund man with a wide smile, Mda returns to South Africa several times a year and said he would prefer to return permanently but is staying in Ohio for the sake of his two young children, who love their elementary school. He is in the process of getting them permanent residency. In Ohio, Mda lives in a small, dark ranch house off the highway near a Wal-Mart. In Johannesburg, he lives in a formerly white suburb, in a large house with a swimming pool. If he moved his children back to South Africa, he said, ''they'd be spoiled brats.'' Mda remains the dramaturge at the Market Theater in Johannesburg, a flagship institution of the South African scene and formerly the front lines of anti-apartheid theater. For Mda, the novel is a ''luxury'' of freedom, well suited to the more reflective, post-apartheid period. Before, there was ''an urgency of writing novels that would have an immediate impact on the struggle,'' Mda told me. ''We're no longer writing for the struggle; we're writing for ourselves.'' 
 Since the end of apartheid, Mda's old comrades have become the country's political and business elite. ''People I was in the struggle with are billionaires,'' Mda said. ''But I've chosen to be a writer and be poor.'' In his novels and other writings, Mda has been outspoken in his criticism of the new ruling class and what he calls ''the cronyism networks'' that have led to the enrichment of a select black minority, leaving the majority in poverty. When Mda criticized the Mandela government for this in the late '90s, Mandela sent three government ministers to have lunch with him at an Indian restaurant in Pretoria. ''I was pleasantly surprised because I thought these guys were unhappy with me,'' he said. Like many South Africans, Mda says he wishes there were a stronger opposition to keep the African National Congress accountable. ''The A.N.C. is winning on the economy,'' he maintained, ''but losing on security and AIDS.'' Yet the opposition parties -- white nationalists, religious parties -- offer no viable alternative. ''They'd take that country down the drain,'' he insisted. ''It would be like Zimbabwe.''
 Under the A.N.C., if anyone has the standing to speak truth to power, it's Mda, who has the pedigree of what he calls the aristocrats of the revolution. His father, Ashby Peter Mda, was the head of the African National Congress Youth League in the late '40s. As a child in Johannesburg in the '50s, Mda spent time at the Mandelas' house, before Nelson Mandela's imprisonment in 1964. In 1963, Mda's father, a lawyer, was involved with political activities that forced the family into exile in Lesotho. During apartheid, Mda's plays were widely performed in South Africa, even when he lived abroad. Mda first left Africa to study painting in Switzerland several years after high school and over the years has acquired a Ph.D. in theater from Cape Town University and two master's degrees, one in theater and one in communications, from Ohio University. In the early '90s he was a research fellow at Yale and taught at the University of Vermont.
 Mda's textured, contemplative novels, with their vivid imaginative universes, have often been compared to magic realism. In ''Ways of Dying,'' which tells the story of a professional mourner in a violent, unnamed South African city, people are beset by curses, and a woman is pregnant for 15 months. In his critically acclaimed and most difficult novel, ''The Heart of Redness,'' published in South Africa in 2000 and in the United States in 2002, Mda explores the ways in which black South Africans manage to hold a variety of seemingly contradictory ideas in their heads at the same time. It tells the story of Camagu, a man who returns to his native South Africa after the end of apartheid, after three decades in exile, working at an international development agency in New York. Back home, he finds he doesn't have the right struggle connections to get a job. ''He regrets now that he acquired so much knowledge in the fields of communication and economic development but never learnt the freedom dance,'' Mda writes. Camagu's story is interwoven with that of Nongqawuse, a 19th-century prophetess from the Xhosa people who still looms large in the South African popular and political imagination. In 1856, Nongqawuse had a prophetic vision that if the Xhosa slaughtered their own cattle, their dead ancestors would rise from the grave and cast the British conquering their lands into the sea. Heeding her vision proved disastrous, and many thousands of Xhosa died of starvation. The survivors were divided: Nongqawuse's supporters were called believers, her detractors unbelievers. In ''The Heart of Redness,'' Mda brings that clash to the contemporary Eastern Cape Province. In his new configuration, the believers support building a casino on the coast, while the unbelievers fear it will destroy the landscape and heritage. It is an ambiguous stance: while not exactly endorsing the Xhosa's self-sacrificial impulse, Mda doesn't entirely disown it, either. He seems to be saying that tradition doesn't look so bad if progress means casinos. 
 The novel caught the attention of the American novelist Norman Rush, who published a scathing assessment of Mda's work in The New York Review of Books in 2003. Rush interpreted ''The Heart of Redness'' as nothing less than ''a literary gesture against modernity, against the heedlessness of gangbuster capitalism, against secularism,'' the product of ''a controlling, reflexive, culturally backward-looking ideology.'' Rush also saw what he called ''the great omission'' in that novel and in ''Ways of Dying'' too: that Mda doesn't directly address the AIDS pandemic. ''Was the AIDS crisis omitted because its presence would have made implausible the optimism, or social energy, that the story promises as it does its work of encouraging attachment to the old ways?'' Rush asked. 
 The review deeply irritated Mda. ''That guy, he expected me to talk about everything going on in South Africa,'' Mda said over dinner in Ohio. ''I'm not a newspaper!'' If he were writing ''Ways of Dying'' now, he said, ''it would be about AIDS, that's the major way of dying today. In 1991, it was not the issue.'' His most recent novel, ''The Whale Caller'' (2005), doesn't talk about AIDS because it's not part of the plot, he told me; in ''The Madonna of Excelsior'' (2002), he does, because it is. (That novel was a best seller in South Africa.) But who, Mda asks, is Norman Rush to tell him what to put in his novels, anyway? ''Why didn't he ask Coetzee why he didn't write about AIDS?'' Mda said. ''In 'Disgrace' '' -- Coetzee's 1999 novel, which caused a tremendous clamor in South Africa for its unsettling vision of post-apartheid life -- ''there's not even a mention of AIDS. Nobody takes issue with him because he's white. But because I'm black, it's my issue.'' Mda told me that his sister died of AIDS. ''I know very few families who haven't been touched'' by the disease, Mda added. 
 In many ways, Rush's review points to the pitfalls facing all South African writers. Even with the best intentions, anyone who writes opens himself up to criticism that he's hewing -- or not hewing -- to a particular political program. White writers who probe the moral confusion of the new South Africa are sometimes seen as apologists for the bad old days, while those who don't are seen as too beholden to the romance of the A.N.C., a critique frequently leveled at Nadine Gordimer. Coetzee was criticized for not creating fully realized black characters in ''Disgrace,'' if not for outright racism. (He has since emigrated to Australia.) Even if the country is bursting with material -- what better terrain for a novelist than the ways a new political, racial and economic order is playing out in people's everyday lives? -- it's not easy to remain true to the demands of the imagination. And yet, Mda says, writers are doing their best. ''There are more black novelists today than there ever were in the history of South Africa,'' he told me. ''There's a quantity out there, and out of that quantity you'll get quality.'' 
 In Johannesburg, Mhlongo's confidence is more measured. ''I will be romanticizing our 12 years of democracy if I say that the end of apartheid in South Africa brought about the end of racism,'' Mhlongo told me. ''We as South African people -- blacks, whites, Indians and coloreds -- have internalized it over the years. Racism therefore is not something that can be expected to change overnight in South Africa, although my generation is trying hard to forge a new identity.''

 BODY:
I first encounter Mera Rubell on the telephone. ''I don't know whom I'm speaking to,'' she shouts, ''and I can't hear anything you are saying because I'm in Miami at the opening of the Performing Arts Center, and there is live music on every street. It's just amazing. Oh, my God, is it wonderful. Listen.'' Halfway around the world she holds up her cellphone. I can hear some crackly noises and Rubell laughing in the background, her voice filled with joy. ''Mera Rubell is great,'' a Berlin art dealer e-mails me later that day. ''One of the very best. She buys with her eyes and never with her ears and genuinely loves art.''
A couple of days later, I meet Mera and her husband, Don, who together with their children, Jennifer and Jason, have amassed one of the more ambitious private collections of contemporary art, at the Frieze Art Fair in London. Mera and Don, Jason and his wife, Michelle, have come directly from Heathrow (they stopped at their hotel only to dump their luggage) and will spend the next eight hours on their feet. ''We like to hit the ground running,'' Mera says, without any affect. 
 You spot many things at Frieze -- Norman Rosenthal, the exhibitions secretary of London's Royal Academy, posing on top of Jonathan Meese's horsy-like sculpture, or Kate Moss, being, well, photographed -- but it is not necessarily an environment conducive to looking at art. The problem is compounded for the Rubells because they know everybody, and so their progress around the fair is slow. ''Look,'' Mera says, ''it's very nice to see people. It's part of it. You can't get away from it.''
 At some places, however, they linger deliberately. They stop to study Robb Pruitt's paintings at Gavin Brown, Francis Als's work at David Zwirner, Andre Butzer at Guido Baudach, Glenn Ligon at Thomas Dane and Mai-Thu Perret at Barbara Weiss. And though they admire all these artists (they bought Perret's whole show, ''Apocalypse Ballet,'' in February 2000 and later this week will buy a Ligon), they are at Frieze this year with an agenda: to make sure there isn't anyone that they might have overlooked for ''Red Eye,'' a show of Los Angeles artists that will open at the Rubell Family Foundation in December, before Art Basel Miami Beach, and to see, in particular, ''Whore in the Church House,'' a painting they are thinking of buying by the Los Angeles artist Mark Bradford. ''It's a killer painting,'' Mera says, looking at it and shaking her head in wonder, ''just killer.''
 Not all purchases are made swiftly. ''We'd have a weak and heartless collection if we didn't fight,'' Mera says about her family's collaborative collecting style. ''You have to give up your ego when you collect by consensus, but that doesn't mean that you don't stand up for what you believe in. The fighting, the agreeing, the resolution, it's all relevant. Don and I wake up every morning at 6 and talk about art for two hours.'' How does she know which paintings are worth fighting for? She shrugs her shoulders. ''How do you choose the person you want to have sex with? How do you know when you meet the person you want to share your life with? You just know.'' Later, she is more pragmatic. ''How do you know when you really want to buy a work of art?'' she asks. ''Because you're willing to pay for it with money you've had to earn.'' 
 When Mera first met Don back in the '60s, he was starting medical school and she was a teacher for Head Start. Their income was $100 a week and they spent $25 of that on art. And though they now spend considerably more, they still work for a living, running a hotel business, and spend their money wisely; they travel economy class, for example, and have always bought work by young artists, discovering Richard Prince, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Damien Hirst and Jeff Koons early in their careers, before they became fashionable and, more pertinently, prohibitively expensive.
 The foundation is a family collection in more ways than one; not only is each member of the family consulted before any purchase -- often, literally, in a scrum in the corner of an artist's studio -- but each artwork they own also seems to inform what they go on to collect. ''Red Eye'' is an important show for them because it reflects the very core of the collection -- among their earliest acquisitions were important pieces by Charles Ray, Mike Kelley, John Baldessari and Paul McCarthy, all Los Angeles artists. ''These artists have become historical figures in our collection,'' Mera says, ''but to show their work alone would be a monologue. You create a dialogue by showing them with new work by young artists working in the same territory. That's when it gets interesting.'' And so at Frieze, one of the things that gives them pleasure is seeing work by younger L.A. artists -- Aaron Curry, Amy Bessone, Lara Schnitger, Matthew Monahan.
 Discovering artists is, after all, what the Rubells enjoy most. But really it is the work itself that keeps drawing them back. They stride around Frieze, determined to see everything, and yet keep returning to the Bradford painting -- which is now officially part of their collection. ''We were recently offered $3 million for our Marlene Dumas painting 'Miss January,' and, yes, we had a family conference about it,'' Mera says. ''But really there wasn't much of a discussion. I mean, do you sell your dog if somebody offers a good enough price for it? Do you sell your grandchildren?'' She shrugs her shoulders and returns to join her family in front of the painting.

SHOPPERS, TO THE KEYBOARDS

The News -- Online consumer spending on the Monday after the Thanksgiving holiday increased 26 percent over last year, setting a record for a single day in retail Internet sales, according to comScore Networks, which tracks Web purchases. 


Behind the News -- Christened Cyber Monday by retailers, it's the day consumers return to work following the long weekend and log on to their office computers to do a little holiday shopping. Consumers spent $608 million, excluding travel, comScore estimates, up from $484 million on the same day last year. The spending was fueled by promotions and the migration of shoppers to the Internet. Retailers said they expected online holiday sales to increase by about 20 percent this year. But expectations are less cheery when brick-and-mortar stores are included. The National Retail Federation predicts a 5 percent rise in sales over all, below last year's 6.1 percent increase.

CHARLIE BROWN, BACK AGAIN

The News -- About 13 million viewers tuned into ABC on Tuesday to watch the 41st annual telecast of ''A Charlie Brown Christmas,'' in which Charlie and Linus search for the true meaning of the holiday, ''a big commercial racket'' in Lucy's opinion.

Behind the News -- About 15.4 million viewers watched the show when it first went on the air in 1965, making it the second-most-watched show that week, behind ''Bonanza.'' The 30-minute program with its piano-driven jazz score has had remarkable staying power. Although CBS's ''NCIS'' won the 8 p.m. time slot, ''A Charlie Brown Christmas'' outperformed it among adults 18 to 49. Lee Mendelson, 73, the executive producer, said the show's success goes back to Charles Schulz, the creator of the Peanuts cartoon strip. ''Someone once said he was a bell-ringer, and in a sense this was the ultimate bell-ringing: Hey, what's Christmas all about?''

THE CLASH OF VIDEO GAMES

The News -- In the latest holiday video game war, Nintendo sold 600,000 units of its new Wii game in its first eight days on the market, while sales of Sony's new PlayStation 3 appeared to be hurt by production problems that limited its availability.

Behind the News -- The holidays are crucial to the $30 billion worldwide video game industry. In the United States, roughly half of the industry's sales take place then. But short-term sales totals don't necessarily predict long-term success. Every Wii and PlayStation 3 that reaches a store will sell this month. But due to limits on availability, says Evan Wilson, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, ''we can't gauge demand; that will become clearer next year.'' Meanwhile, the biggest winner this season may be Microsoft's Xbox 360, released last year, which targets the same hardcore gamers as Sony's new PlayStation, and is in stores.

A WINTRY BLAST

The News -- The first major snow and ice storm of the season swept across the central United States, closing schools, businesses and highways, creating chaos for air travelers and leaving hundreds of thousand of people without power.

Behind the News -- An arctic front pushing across the nation's center collided with warm moist air surging north from the Gulf of Mexico, creating freezing rain, sleet and snow across the Southern Plains, the mid-Mississippi River Valley and the central Midwest. In Kansas, the governor declared 27 counties disaster areas. Parts of Missouri were hit with more than a foot of snow, shutting down Interstate 70. Hundreds of flights were canceled at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. What about Christmas? Too soon to say. ''December is kind of a wild card,'' says Michael Halpert, head of forecast operations at the National Weather Service's Climate Prediction Center.

HOLIDAY PINK SLIPS

The News -- Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, announced that it would lay off almost 2,400 sales representatives and managers, a 20 percent reduction in its sales force, which could lead to broader retrenchment in the industry.

Behind the News -- What would the holidays be without fourth-quarter layoffs and buyouts? Analysts said the decision by Pfizer, which had led the industry's sales force expansion, could induce other drug makers to cut back. The day Pfizer alerted its sales force of the layoffs, the Ford Motor Company said that nearly half of its hourly production workers -- some 38,000 -- had accepted buyouts and early retirement. There was also an unexpectedly large increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits, rising by 34,000 to 357,000 -- the highest level since October 2005, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.

HEADLINE: Can We Afford to Close Hospitals?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Details of Hospital Proposal Show Far Wider Cuts'' (front page, Nov. 29): 
 The recommendations by the Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century to close, merge or shrink hospitals to control skyrocketing health care costs reflect a misguided strategy of bashing the providers of health care -- hospitals, doctors and hospital staff -- as the primary means to contain cost.
If the commission had truly meant its recommendations to be comprehensive, it would have also addressed the malfeasance of many managed care companies, the malpractice insurance crisis, nonnegotiable pharmaceutical prices and Medicaid fraud -- the true culprits responsible for our ''broken'' system. 
 Today's excess hospital beds may become essential hospital beds in the event of a flu epidemic, a terrorist attack or a natural disaster.

Paul Aaronson, M.D.
New York, Nov. 29, 2006

To the Editor:
 It is unconscionable to think that anyone would even consider saving health care dollars by depriving the citizens of New York State of precisely what they need: greater and better access to health care services.
 The proposed fix -- closing of hospitals across the state -- is oxymoronic! Taking away hospitals and denying health care, together with the resulting unemployment and the overcrowding of the remaining facilities, would serve only to add to the already existing problems facing the citizens of New York. It would not solve anything. 

Harriet Harris
Floral Park, N.Y., Nov. 29, 2006

To the Editor:
 I applaud the recommendations of the Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century. Few industries allow the gross inefficiencies observed in our health care system. New York's acute care facilities, collectively, have lost money for eight consecutive years and are the most deeply indebted in the country. 
 In New York, ''economies of scale'' seem to be foreign words. There is excess capacity in many areas, but other areas are underserved. Because of this, many New Yorkers have no access to preventive and primary care services while vacant beds absorb scarce resources. 
 Little attention is directed toward strategic planning for changing populations and trends in the marketplace, leaving us further unprepared for the future. If health care in New York State were a company in nearly any other industry, the windows would have been boarded up long ago. And we all suffer because of it.
 Acting on the commission's report would be a first step in repairing this broken system.

To the Editor:
 Re ''Reordering New York's Health Care'' (editorial, Nov. 29): 
 The Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century seeks savings by closing and consolidating hospitals. 
 But while New York does have excess hospital beds, the evidence shows that there is no meaningful link between beds and cost. And we've found that hospitals that close are typically at least as efficient as survivors. After a closing, patients, workers and costs simply migrate. 
 Cutting the average patient's hospital stay won't save money either, because days that can be shed are very cheap to provide. 
 Closings and consolidations would temporarily buttress survivors, mainly by allowing them to raise their prices. But that's unaffordable, so surviving hospitals would win only short-term financial relief. 
 Saving money requires squeezing the one-half of New York's health spending that goes to unnecessary care, paperwork, excess prices and theft. That means shifting the focus from hospitals to New York's 75,000 physicians, whose decisions shape almost all health spending.

To the Editor:
 The inevitable decline of health care in New York has been slowly occurring over the last several decades. The recommendation by the state is to close some institutions, which will only redistribute costs among wealthier institutions.
 The problem is that there are too few health care dollars to go around. A growing number of uninsured patients are coming to hospitals for care, and the hospitals are obligated to provide that care with little hope of recouping their expenses.
 In the old days, when hospitals were better reimbursed by private insurance companies, a surplus of money existed at hospitals that allowed the care of the indigent without causing the institutions to function in the red. But today, with diminishing reimbursements and rising costs, this can no longer occur. 
 It is time to re-evaluate the insurance companies. Society needs to decide what is more important: a chief executive of an insurance company making millions of dollars, or the comfort of having a hospital available that is staffed by competent dedicated physicians when you are ill.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action And Black Lawyers

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Lawyers Debate Why Blacks Lag at Major Firms'' (front page, Nov. 29): 
 The American Bar Association Commission on Women in the Profession's study, ''Visible Invisibility,'' details why women lawyers of color are leaving the profession.
Our research spotlights what's been called a ''double whammy.'' Women of color experience unique disadvantages based on race in addition to gender. Women lawyers of color nationwide report lack of networking and access to significant billable hours, being omitted from client development opportunities, and demeaning comments and harassment. Eighty-one percent of women lawyers of color left their firms within five years of being hired. 
 It's not enough for these women to develop thick skins. It's the job of the law firm to, as the study suggests, ''weave them into the social and professional fabric of the firm.''

Pamela Roberts
Chairwoman
American Bar Assn. Commission on Women in the Profession
Columbia, S.C., Dec. 1, 2006

To the Editor:
 Critics of Prof. Richard H. Sander's study thought it unnecessary to explain why those blacks hired by major firms had such weak law school performance. 
 As a result of affirmative action, black students enter law schools with well below average undergraduate grades and LSAT scores. And going back to the reason for poor undergraduate performance, selective undergraduate programs enroll black students with poor SAT scores, resulting in low grades. 
 There is no magic set of policies, such as better mentoring, that will transform a significant proportion of weakly prepared college students so that they can be successful at the most demanding positions. Instead, we should focus on identifying potentially strong black (and other poor) intermediate and high school students, giving them the support necessary when it will be most effective. 

Robert Cherry

The writer is a professor of economics at Brooklyn College.

To the Editor:
 While Prof. Richard H. Sander's study finds a disparity between the grades of black and white law firm hires, that does not explain the racial disparity in success at those firms. Other studies prove beyond dispute that grades have almost nothing to do with career success.
 Further, grades are so subjective that it is ridiculous to suggest that law school graduates with a 3.5 are so vastly superior to those with a 3.0. 
 As a black Ivy League law school graduate, I found that coming from a blue-collar background with only one parent having graduated from high school greatly affected my fitting into a law firm in many ways. For example, I identified with the secretaries, paralegals and even the janitors, and had a hard time telling ''underlings'' what to do. 

Thomas Wilson
New York, Nov. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 ''Lawyers Debate Why Blacks Lag at Major Firms'' did not acknowledge the many bar association- and court-sponsored diversity studies that have documented patterns of racial bias that continue to impede the progress of minorities, especially African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans, in large law firms.
 Many of these studies focus on an often unconscious presumption of incompetence that clouds law firm decision-making with respect to minority attorneys. The result is that minority associates are disproportionately denied training and mentoring opportunities; early mistakes are often fatal to the advancement of minority attorneys while excused for their white peers; and desirable assignments, case referrals and opportunities for partner and client contact tend to be funneled more often to white associates.
 These findings belong in any discussion of the factors determining the career success of minority attorneys and the larger question of our society's ability to achieve a diverse legal profession.

Brenda Stith Loftin
President, National Association of Women Judges
St. Louis, Nov. 30, 2006

To the Editor:
 ''Lawyers Debate Why Blacks Lag at Major Firms'' suggests that affirmative action is working. The elite law schools and prestigious law firms are giving a group that has traditionally suffered from discrimination a slight edge to get in. 
 After that, it is (or should be) up to the individual to succeed. Affirmative action provides access to the playing field, but does not ensure success once you are on that field. 
 It is likely that the children of these individuals, who in completing law school have already achieved considerable success, may in their turn become partners of the prestigious law firms. By that point, affirmative action may have become unnecessary and discontinued.

HEADLINE: National Health Care? We're Halfway There

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
WHEN Democrats assume control of Congress next month, they may be dusting off some long-dormant proposals on how to deal with the growing disconnect between health insurance and employment. From 2000 to 2005, the proportion of workers aged 18 to 64 with employment-based health benefits fell to 70.6 percent from 74.5 percent, according to the Employee Benefits Research Institute. A record 46.6 million Americans lacked health insurance last year; of them, more than 82 percent lived in households headed by someone holding a job.
 Any efforts to expand government's role in providing insurance will likely be opposed by the Bush administration, which says it opposes excessive direct government involvement in an industry that constitutes about 14 percent of the gross domestic product. Michael O. Leavitt , the secretary of health and human services, recently dismissed a proposal to have the government negotiate drug prices for the Medicare benefit, arguing that ''it's a surrogate for a much larger issue, which is really government-run health care.'' 
While the administration may oppose government-run health care in principle, the government's role in the vast health industry has been expanding. By various measures, the United States is about halfway toward a system in which the government and taxpayers fully fund health care. And trends are pushing the government to become more involved each year. 
 Out of a total population of about 300 million, 35.6 million elderly Americans were on Medicare in 2005. Of the working-age population, which reached 257.8 million in 2005, some 45.5 million were covered by Medicare, Medicaid or military health programs, according to the benefits institute. An additional 18.2 million workers had health insurance through jobs in the public sector, which includes state, federal and local governments, public schools and state universities, according to Paul Fronstin, director of the institute's health research and education program. Millions of those workers' dependents are covered as well. Even if those dependents are not included in the tally, taxpayers paid the bill for almost two-fifths of all Americans with insurance in 2005.
 But that's not the full extent of government and taxpayer involvement. Employer-provided health insurance premiums are a form of compensation, yet are not subject to federal payroll or income taxes and are exempt from many state and local taxes. Economists consider these exemptions a form of subsidy. Thomas M. Selden, economist at the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, estimates that the tax subsidy for employment-related coverage at $208.6 billion in 2006, or 35.4 percent of the amount spent on premiums. 
 ''The tax subsidy is one of the largest public expenditures on health care,'' Mr. Selden said. In fiscal 2006, by comparison, spending on Medicare was $378.7 billion and federal spending on Medicaid was $180.6 billion.
 Viewed strictly in terms of dollars and cents, the government already accounts for more than half of the nation's health care spending. Mining data from the National Health Expenditures Accounts, Mr. Selden found that public expenditures on health care -- Medicare, Medicaid, military health care and federal employee benefits -- accounted for $888 billion of the $1.96 trillion spent on health care in 2004. Adding in the aforementioned subsidies, and premiums paid for public-sector employees, the total comes to $1.2 trillion, or 61 percent. 
 Uwe E. Reinhardt, the James Madison professor of political economy at Princeton, suggests adding 5 percent for the federal mandate that hospitals provide free health care to the uninsured. ''So government accounts for about two-thirds of health care spending,'' Mr. Reinhardt said.
 The government spends money as if there were a national health insurance program. In 2004, government spending on health care equaled 9.6 percent of the gross domestic product, compared with 6.9 percent in Canada, which has a single-payer universal health care program, said David Himmelstein, associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. And yet some significant components of federal support are not efficient methods of providing health insurance to the people who most need it. Higher-income workers are likely to have higher rates of coverage, higher premiums and higher taxes, all of which means that the tax break for compensation disproportionately helps the well-off.
 ''We're paying for national health insurance, but we're not getting it,'' Dr. Himmelstein added.
 Taxpayers also don't get as much bang for their bucks because the government guarantees coverage for the elderly and the poor, groups that account for a disproportionately large amount of expenditures. 
 ''A rough rule holds that private insurance covers two-thirds of the population and pays for only one-third of all health care,'' Mr. Reinhardt said.
 THE raw figures may be worrisome, but the trends behind the data are clearly troubling. Despite five consecutive years of economic growth, the private sector has continued to reduce its role in providing insurance. As the population ages, the ranks of Medicare recipients grow. And if the price of health insurance keeps rising at a much faster rate than the average earnings of lower-income people, more and more of the working poor will be priced out of the market. 
 So even as politicians rail against the pernicious effects of government-run health care, taxpayers, one way or another, are likely to be footing more of the nation's huge and mounting medical bills.

HEADLINE: Worries About the Economy Push Stocks Lower

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The stock market started off badly on Monday, dropping more than it had in any single day since July. Wall Street fared better over the next three days, but a plunge on Friday sent the market down for the week. 
 The decline in stocks was accompanied by a fall in the value of the dollar, which on Friday reached a 20-month low against the euro. An economic report on Friday, showing that manufacturing shrank unexpectedly in the United States, rattled the financial markets. Concern about the strength of the American economy depressed both the value of the dollar and the price of stocks.
The best performer in the Dow Jones industrial average last week was Exxon Mobil, which rose 6.7 percent on rising oil prices. On Friday, the futures price of a barrel of crude for next-month delivery closed in New York at $63.43, up from $59.24 the previous week. For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 86.04 points, or 0.7 percent, to close at 12,194.13. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 4.24 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 1,396.71. The Nasdaq composite index fell 47.05 points, or 1.9 percent, to close at 2,413.21. 
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond dropped to 4.43 percent, from 4.55 percent the previous week. JEFF SOMMER

HEADLINE: When You're Moving, But the House Just Sits 

BYLINE: By LISA CHAMBERLAIN

DATELINE: RALEIGH, N.C. 

 BODY:
PAULA AND DAVID LAPADULA had lived in the Northeast their whole lives, most recently in Woburn, Mass., a suburb about 15 minutes north of Boston. Having grown weary of the long winters, they started thinking about moving more than a year ago.
 Mr. Lapadula was in Raleigh for business several times and liked the area, and on a visit, Ms. Lapadula liked it as well. It was not long before Mr. Lapadula, a technical sales engineer, got a job offer, and they decided to relocate here. They put their house on the market for $455,000.
But a strange thing happened on their way to a new life in North Carolina. The residential real estate market in their old neighborhood seemed to slow down considerably the minute they listed their house. Seven months later, after dropping the asking price by $75,000 to $380,000, the Lapadulas' home finally sold. 
 Having lived in an apartment with most of their belongings in storage for the last nine months, the couple are relieved to begin building their three-bedroom house on a quarter of an acre in Holly Springs, a Raleigh suburb. The cost is $350,000. 
 Newcomers from around the country are helping to drive housing sales in Raleigh. Yet it is not clear whether there will be a ripple effect in places like Raleigh because of the slowdown in other regions. 
 So far, the market here is robust, according to local real estate agents, although there has been a slight increase in inventory since summer.
 Rapid job growth is what has helped keep the Raleigh housing market stable. Research Triangle Park -- a 7,000-acre nonprofit center created almost 50 years ago -- has been an economic engine in the technology and health science industries.
 And this year the area is on track to slightly surpass the previous job growth record, set in 1995. According to the North Carolina Research Triangle Regional Partnership, an economic development organization that manages the park, more than 40,000 jobs will have been added this year alone. 
 Within 20 miles of Research Triangle Park, about $1 billion of business investment will be coming online in the next 12 to 18 months, according to Ted W. Abernathy Jr., the executive vice president of the partnership. Not surprisingly, the area has one of the highest percentages of college-educated adults: 41 percent. 
 ''We are a magnet for knowledge workers who move here and start businesses,'' Mr. Abernathy said. ''The depth of the market is attractive to people. That's important, especially if you're relocating a family.'' 
 That was the case with Gerald and Carol Longoria, who recently moved to the area with their four children. ''We had been looking for a startup opportunity in Research Triangle Park,'' said Mr. Longoria, who worked for Dell in Austin, Tex., for eight years. 
 But like the Lapadula household, they ran into problems selling their house. 
 ''I was coming to North Carolina for a week, two weeks at a time; my family stayed back in Texas,'' Mr. Longoria said. ''We did that thinking the house would sell during the summer. I commuted for about three months and finally we just moved to get the kids in school. The house is still on the market today.'' 
 The Longorias are renting a 3,100-square-foot house for $2,300 a month in the area where they hope to buy, so their children will not have to change schools. But until their home in Austin sells, they are in limbo. 
 ''We definitely want to buy a house when our other house sells,'' Mr. Longoria said. ''But until that happens, we're just happy to have found a place to lease in the school district we wanted to be in. The market here feels more like Austin did in 1998. The Research Triangle area is really growing.'' 
 That is not to say that the housing market in Raleigh is overheated. 
 ''Prices never skyrocketed here,'' said Nancy Briggs, a real estate agent with York Simpson Underwood. ''Even though there are a lot of people moving to the area, new developments are being built at a steady pace. The issue is schools. A projected 35,000 new kids will be added to the school district by 2010.'' 
 In fact, many schools are holding classes in temporary trailers. To relieve overcrowding, some have even started operating year-round, staggering vacation times throughout the year.
 In Wake County, voters last month approved $970 million in school construction bonds that will help pay for 17 new schools and renovate and repair several others.
 In the meantime, the Raleigh housing market seems to be enjoying what can be described as a Goldilocks period, according to a recent report by Richard J. DeKaser, a senior vice president and chief economist at the National City Corporation, a Cleveland-based financial services company. Mr. DeKaser ranked 99 markets, from the most overpriced to the most underpriced, and Raleigh was ranked right in the middle. 
 Housing prices appreciated 7.4 percent in 2004 and 2005, though that is still below the national average of 13 percent for the same time period, according to figures compiled by York Simpson Underwood. The median home price in the Raleigh area is $185,200, the brokerage firm said, while the national median price is $213,000. 
 For the 18,500 people who moved to the area in 2005, a stable but growing housing market may be of some comfort, but having to sell in a slowing market elsewhere has taken people by surprise in many parts of the country. 
 Meena and Michael Elliott put their house in Washington up for sale when Ms. Elliott, a lawyer, took a corporate legal job in Raleigh. ''Unfortunately, we put our house up for sale right when things were declining,'' Ms. Elliott said.
 ''We decided not to purchase a home until we sold our own. But we still have to pay rent. We hadn't lived in an apartment in 17 years, so it's different. It took five and a half months to sell the house.'' 
 The Elliotts originally listed their 3,600-square-foot four-bedroom colonial for $999,000 but eventually settled for $880,000. ''That was a big surprise,'' Ms. Elliott continued. ''Nobody expected that the market had changed that dramatically. We could see that it was going to slow down but not such a dramatic shift.''
 The Elliotts are now looking for a home in the Raleigh area. ''What's interesting is, the market here, it's much more stable,'' Ms. Elliott said. ''The homes we've seen, there haven't been any price markdowns.''
 Mr. Abernathy, meanwhile, says he was not concerned about the slight increase in inventory since the summer. 
 ''There is more housing on the market because there's lots of building,'' he said. ''Compared to other high-tech regions, our average house prices are very reasonable. If you looked at the numbers over the years, appreciation here has been steady but not spectacular, so we had little or no bubble here.''

HEADLINE: The Graying of the Housing Market

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AS baby boomers age, younger generations will have to pick up the slack in areas like health care and transportation. Now a new study suggests that younger people could face a profoundly different housing market as well, if their parents' habits are consistent with those of past generations.
 Late last month, the Mortgage Bankers Association in Washington released a report conducted with the Brookings Institution showing that aging baby boomers, generally defined as those born in 1946 through 1964, will probably cause stagnation in many housing markets, particularly in the suburbs. 
''Baby boomers are moving into age groups where they'll be much less mobile,'' said Michael Fratantoni, a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association. ''With that aging-in-place phenomenon, portions of the country that are not used to having large senior populations will gray very quickly.''
 According to the study, homeowners are less likely to move after they reach 50. About 27 percent of the people age 25 through 30 move in a given year. By contrast, fewer than 10 percent of those 50 and above move at all, and fewer than 5 percent move to a different state.
 Those baby boomers who will move in the coming decades, Mr. Fratantoni said, are likely to be the most affluent and educated. ''They're the ones that have the means to move,'' he said.
 Those who remain, he added, will have lower incomes and less education. ''So there's likely to be a greater demand on services,'' he said.
 The effect will be felt most keenly between 2010 and 2030; by 2030 the whole baby boom generation will be older than 65.
 All states will have growth in older homeowners, of course, and those that have traditionally attracted retirees, like Florida and Arizona, will have a higher percentage of the elderly than other states.
 But even in the suburbs of the New York metropolitan area, homeowners will see differences. Suburbanites in the New York region already face relatively high costs of living, Mr. Fratantoni said, and paradoxically, those with the resources will be more likely to move to lower-cost areas. As a result, the senior population will still grow, but to a lesser extent than in other states.
 That change could be felt most profoundly by those who put their houses on the market after 2030, although the changes will begin to be felt long before that. ''One would expect sales volumes to come down considerably at that time,'' Mr. Fratantoni said. ''You wouldn't necessarily expect values to decline, but the time on the market may be a lot longer.''
 With fewer people interested in moving at all, prices could also be affected, he said.
 ''And in suburban areas, given that you won't see people downsize and move into urban condominiums, there'll be a lot of older homeowners,'' Mr. Fratantoni added. 
 William H. Frey, the report's author, cautioned that the migration predictions focus on a group that has confounded prognosticators. ''The biggest mistake you can make about baby boomers is assuming they'll do the same thing as the generation ahead of them,'' he said. ''That could apply to migration as well.''
 The study also looked at how the aging-in-place phenomenon would intersect with the growth in ''new minority'' populations, specifically Hispanic and Asian. It found that while the non-Hispanic white population will increasingly remain in place in coming decades, minorities will continue to move throughout the country, since most minorities are still in the younger age groups.
 Minority populations will grow in states like New York and Florida, thus possibly mitigating some of the stagnating effects of the graying of the area's population.
 But in states like Pennsylvania, which traditionally have few minorities, ''you'll have the older, nonworking population remain,'' Mr. Fratantoni said. ''That will have a pretty profound impact on the local economy, the potential for job growth and the demand for services.''

HEADLINE: Lots of Arrivals, and No One Wants to Leave

BYLINE: By CLAIRE WILSON

 BODY:
A WAVE of immigration has hit the Staten Island town of Port Richmond, but talking to longtime residents makes you wonder how any of the newcomers manage to find places to live. Every block has tale after tale of families moving in and never moving out, moving from house to house within the town or on the same block, or coming back to buy the house next door to the one they grew up in, often from the family who had owned it for decades. 
 Dorothy Reebe, who has three children in their 20s, came to Port Richmond as a toddler, moved away briefly when she got married, then moved back with her husband. She lived in the same Port Richmond house for 25 years, then last July moved back to her childhood block, into a circa-1935 three-bedroom colonial that her parents had once owned and her sister had lived in.
''I am just very comfortable here,'' said Mrs. Reebe, who works in the accounting office at J. C. Penney in the Staten Island Mall. ''It has always been our home, and we have always had fabulous neighbors.'' 
 Arthur Cappabianca, a retired New York police sergeant who headed a local civic association for 18 years, lives in a house his parents bought for $12,000 in 1958. He spent his bachelor years and early married life in rentals on Staten Island and in Brooklyn where he was assigned and where his wife, Agnes, worked as a nurse. He bought the Port Richmond house from his parents upon their retirement in the mid-1980s.
 Mr. Cappabianca, a father of four, loves the street, with its deep, plush lawns and charming older homes, but relishes the sense of community even more. 
 ''We look after each other's houses, we pick up the mail when neighbors go away, we mow each other's lawns and I'll blow the snow away in the yard next door as long as the gasoline lasts,'' he said. ''Of all the things in the world I could worry about, the neighborhood isn't one of them. Life is O.K.'' 
 Life for the area's immigrants, mostly of Mexican origin and mostly undocumented, may not be as smooth. Numbering about 15,000, or about 24 percent of the 62,800 of Port Richmond residents, according to the New York City Department of Health, the newcomers generally rent rooms in single-family homes converted for that purpose. 
 Yet day laborers' presence on street corners has discomfited some longtimers, who wish their work-seeking routine were better organized. 
 ''Nobody wants large groups of idle unemployed men of any race or ethnic background congregating on their corner,'' said Mr. Cappabianca, echoing neighbors' sentiments. ''It needs to be managed and no one seems to be getting on the ball and managing it.'' 
 Community leaders counter that it is being managed. Social service agencies like El Centro de Hospitalidad and Nyana (short for the New York Association of New Americans), which opened 18 months ago, help provide Hispanics with jobs and other resources. Terry Troia, executive director of Project Hospitality, a social services agency, is among those who credit immigrants with a major role in revitalizing certain commercial areas in Port Richmond. 
 Those areas have ''turned around 100 percent in the past five years,'' Ms. Troia said, ''and it is the day-laborer population here that feeds the economy.'' 

What You'll Find
 Decker Avenue is one of the prettiest streets in Port Richmond, which is bordered on the north by the Kill van Kull, the east by Jewett Avenue, the south by Forest Avenue and the west by the Martin Luther King Expressway. 
 The housing stock around town is mostly older homes, in styles ranging from colonial, Victorian and Queen Anne to Shingle, with a few little bungalows and some new construction thrown into the mix.
 Some blocks are marred by blight, especially on the approach to the waterfront manufacturing district. 
 Others are picture perfect or, like Heberton Avenue, showing signs of a comeback. Once known as ''doctor's row'' for the doctors who practiced out of their homes there, this wide street is lined with Victorian mansions, a number of them restored.
 Still other blocks have rows of 1920s colonials shoehorned into 25-foot-wide lots with no driveways or off-street parking.
 A long and very eclectic commercial street, Port Richmond Avenue, and handsome houses of worship like the 1907 Temple Emanu-el or 1891 St. Philip's Baptist Church are testimony to the town's storied past. 
 On the western edge of Veteran's Park, St. Philip's congregation was founded in 1881 as a mission church for the African-American community in Port Richmond. 

What You'll Pay
 Single-family detached houses in good condition start at $285,000, according to Christopher Emmanuel, a sales associate with Exit Realty Associates, whose active listings include a completely renovated three-bedroom, two-bath side-hallway colonial for $359,000. ''There are great, affordable homes here for the first-time home buyers,'' he said. 
 Rachel Gannon, a resident who has been a broker in the area for more than 25 years, has a two-bedroom, one-bath bungalow listed at $235,000. Two of her listings recently closed under the asking price: a two-family listed at $279,000 sold for $255,000; and a single-family listed at $309,000 sold for $280,000. 
 She recently sold a side-by-side two-family house for $350,000, she said, adding that the buyers, a group of investors, sold it for $589,000 after making minimal improvements. 
 Alex Papirov, owner of the brokerage Homes-R-Us, said that among new units, a one-family detached house would sell for about $450,000 while a two-family detached house would be $550,000 or slightly higher. He has a new three-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath with a one-bedroom rental unit listed at $499,000. ''We have a very wide range,'' he said. ''Prices depend on location and how close it is to transportation.'' 
 Most rentals are in two-family houses; the only apartment block is the 43-unit Parkside Senior Housing complex in a former school. Mr. Papirov said the rent in his listing would be $650 to $700 a month. In a nine-year-old two-bedroom end unit in a town house listed at $419,000 by Mrs. Gannon, the rent on an accompanying two-bedroom apartment might be $900 a month, she said. 

What to Do
 Port Richmond residents celebrate some things that never change: the lines at Ralph's Italian Ices on Port Richmond Avenue, for instance. They have snaked around the shop's white concrete exterior every summer since the 1920s and remain a huge draw for customers from all over Staten Island. ''I don't remember a time when Ralph's wasn't crowded,'' said Robert Robbins, who lives in a wood-frame colonial on Palmer Avenue. ''The place was always packed.'' 
 Likewise, across the street is Denino's Pizzeria, whose pies are among the highest rated in the city. ''You can wait half an hour or 40 minutes to get a seat, but it's worth it,'' Mr. Robbins said. ''There's good food, decent service and there are always nice people in there.'' 
 Since September 2001, shops along Port Richmond Avenue, the main commercial drag, have become almost exclusively Hispanic-run, from grocery stores to music shops and travel agencies. As Ms. Troia, the social worker, pointed out, the storefronts on the avenue ''were all abandoned, and now there are 50, if not more, Mexican businesses, all generated by day-laborer income.''
 Once known as the Fifth Avenue of Staten Island, the street started its demographic shift in the 1970s with the opening of the Staten Island Mall 20 minutes away, and with increased retail activity on the fringes, in an area called Port Richmond Center. Within walking distance for some, the center offers chains like Staples, TJ Maxx and PetSmart. 
 Port Richmond's branch library -- designed by Carrere & Hastings, architects of the New York Public Library, and built in 1905 in Veterans Park -- was a gift of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie. And Faber Pool on Richmond Terrace, a public facility designed in 1932 in the Mission style, was named for Eberhard Faber of the pencil-manufacturing family that lived here. Parks, adjacent to the area, include the 198-acre Clove Lakes Park and the Snug Harbor Cultural Center. 

The Schools
 The three public grade schools that serve the area teach kindergarten through Grade 5. Most students at those schools, as well as those at Port Richmond High School, have the advantage of being able to walk to class. Two of the grade schools, Public Schools 20 and 21, have fewer than 500 students. A third, P.S. 19, is slightly larger, with about 540 students. 
 Some children go on to Intermediate School 51 on Houston Street, which teaches Grades 6 through 8. Among eighth graders in a student body of 1,353, 32.4 percent scored at or above grade level in English and 32.3 percent in math. 
 Port Richmond High School on St. Joseph's Avenue has an enrollment of about 1,350. Students taking the SAT in 2005 scored an average of 453 on the verbal section, compared with 497 statewide, and 458 on the math, compared with 511 statewide. 
 A private school option is St. Roch's Roman Catholic School on Villa Avenue, which teaches kindergarten through Grade 8. 

The Commute
 Port Richmond has a large network of buses to the Staten Island Ferry terminal from almost any point around town in less than 20 minutes. The ferry ride to Manhattan takes 25 minutes and is free, and the commute to Midtown from South Ferry via the 1, 4, 5, 6, R and N trains takes roughly 20 minutes. 
 For an express bus into Lower and Midtown Manhattan, the fare is $5 and the morning rush-hour ride can take up to 90 minutes. Paul Sparandara, 24, who works in medical staffing, takes the X13 to work every day from his home on Clinton Place. ''It takes me about an hour to get to my office downtown,'' he said. 
 Getting to Midtown via the Bayonne Bridge to New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Lincoln Tunnel can take up to 90 minutes. 

The History
 The colonnaded Georgian Revival Reformed Church on Staten Island, on Port Richmond Avenue, was built in 1824, but the congregation was founded by Dutch settlers in 1663 and is the borough's oldest. From those Dutch roots, Port Richmond evolved into a thriving waterfront industrial and transportation hub. 

What We Like
 Unflagging community pride is evident in the mix of modest homes on narrow lots and grand houses on wide avenues. 

Going Forward
 With convenient services, old industrial buildings waiting to be reclaimed, plentiful residential real estate and grand Victorian homes, the town might be considered ripe for gentrification. ''The potential is there for sure,'' said Channel Graham, executive director of the Preservation League of Staten Island.

HEADLINE: A Showdown on the Waterfront

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT 

 BODY:
A STANDOFF between city officials here and a 101-year-old yacht club is slowing progress on a $1.5 billion development proposal that would transform a peninsula on Bridgeport Harbor, known as Steel Point, into an upscale waterfront community. 
 The Pequonnock Yacht Club owns a two-acre waterfront plot sought by the city -- which has acquired all the surrounding land through eminent domain. Much of the peninsula is now overgrown vacant lots. The one remaining business, the Tallmadge Brothers oyster company, recently reached an agreement to move its operations to a site nearby. 
The yacht club, however, refuses to relinquish its land, which is at the tip of the peninsula, where the Pequonnock River empties into Long Island Sound. Besides its land, the club owns about six acres underwater.
 The club's 250 members, less than half of whom live in Bridgeport, have access to a two-story clubhouse with a bar and a 190-slip marina. Summer weekends are filled with fishing tournaments and fund-raising dinners. 
 About the city's redevelopment plans, Stuart Rainger, 85, the club's commodore emeritus, said, ''They're trying to take away the enjoyment of the water from regular people.'' 
 Pequonnock caters to the middle class by offering boaters one of the best deals in Fairfield County: 12-month slip rentals at $18 a foot, and annual dues of just $300. In a region where commercial marina rates are $95 to $145 per foot, Pequonnock keeps slip rentals at what Mr. Rainger calls ''a working man's cost'' by requiring members to pitch in on maintenance and repairs. 
 While Pequonnock's leaders have portrayed themselves as defenders of the little guy, Steel Point's prospective developer, Midtown Equities of New York, has presented its plan as serving a greater good in a city plagued by crime and unemployment. In addition to generating thousands of jobs and some $700 million in real estate tax revenues over 30 years, the development will open up access to the waterfront, said Daniel Pfeffer, Midtown's president. 
 ''Along the whole perimeter of the site will be a new public promenade,'' Mr. Pfeffer said. ''And it goes right through the yacht club's property.''
 Midtown's proposal for the 52-acre site calls for as many as 3,500 rental and condominium units; at least 750,000 square feet of retail, waterfront dining and entertainment venues; and a new yacht club with a marina.
 Midtown is developing a similar mixed-use project in Miami, where it is converting a former railroad yard into what it calls ''a city within a city'' consisting of 3,000 condominiums set amid street-level restaurants and shops. Having sold 1,100 units, the company is now looking to profit on its investment by selling up to 80 percent of the project, according to Mr. Pfeffer. 
 Bridgeport officials have talked about redeveloping Steel Point since 1970. Over the past decade, the city has invested about $40 million in public funds to acquire property and clean up environmental contamination on the site.
 Yet the plan has moved in fits and starts -- a previous development deal fell apart in 2000, and promised state funds were slowed by a corruption scandal that sent the city's previous mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, to prison. Now, having secured strong state support and a developer with a track record, city officials are losing patience with the yacht club. 
 ''They've asked for time to look for properties outside of town,'' said Edward Lavernoich, deputy director of the city's Office of Planning and Economic Development and chief project manager for Steel Point. ''That time has come and gone.''
 Pequonnock used a court challenge to fend off an earlier takeover attempt by the city. The case wound up before the state Supreme Court, which ruled in 2002 that the city was not justified in requiring the sale of the property because it had not established that it was essential to the redevelopment plan. 
 Negotiations are continuing, but both sides indicated that the matter might well end up in litigation again. ''I think at some point the city has to say, how long do we let this go?'' Mr. Pfeffer said. 
 The yacht club would probably have a tougher fight this time. A widely criticized United States Supreme Court decision last year involving 15 homeowners and the city of New London affirmed the right of local governments to use eminent domain for urban revitalization. ''That changed the rules,'' said Glen Smith, the club's commodore. 
 One offer on the table is essentially to fold the Pequonnock club into the yacht club that will be part of the development, and charge members a lower docking fee for the first five years, Mr. Smith said. 
 ''The problem with that offer was that we wouldn't own our own clubhouse,'' he said, ''and we wouldn't have a marina. We would be renting with them.'' 
 The club is also dissatisfied with the city's offer of $3.95 million for the property, said Mr. Smith, in part because it isn't enough to pay for a comparable spot elsewhere. Members are considering alternative sites in Stratford, Shelton and Milford, but none of the properties match what they have now. 
 The club would prefer to retain its identity by being incorporated within the development. According to Mr. Smith, it offered to spend $3 million to upgrade its operation with a new clubhouse, a public boardwalk and a new bulkhead, and a redesign of the marina with fewer slips. The answer was no, he said. 
 Club members are beginning to feel the pressure of being the lone holdout. The first time they fought the city, they were viewed as ''the good guy fighting Goliath,'' Mr. Rainger said. This time around, he said, ''we're the dirty little club holding everything up.'' Still, as a member of the club since 1961, he can't help but stand his ground. 
 ''They're going to give our property to an out-of-town developer who is going to put another yacht club here,'' he said. ''To my mind, it's un-American.'' 
 Asked for a response, Mr. Pfeffer rejected that characterization. Midtown has the community's best interests in mind, he said, whereas the yacht club members appeared to be looking out only for themselves. Redeveloping Steel Point ''will have a tremendous ripple effect,'' he said. ''How does the yacht club benefit the city of Bridgeport?''

HEADLINE: Future Home Health Aides Learn To Help Others and Themselves

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
Even after 14 years, Norma Ford has not forgotten the challenge of looking for work. 
 ''It was hard; it was very hard.'' The land of opportunity she pictured before emigrating from Guyana to New York ''was not so,'' Ms. Ford recalled recently.
But she got a break after responding to a newspaper advertisement for a training course for home health aides. She has been working as an aide since.
 Ms. Ford received instruction at Selfhelp Community Services, a social services provider in New York that has been training home health aides since 1977. The nonprofit Selfhelp, which mainly serves the elderly, has long sought trainees by seeking people who are having trouble finding work. 
 Though the pay for home health aides is low, demand is soaring. According to the Census Bureau, the population that is 65 and older -- heavy users of the aides -- is expected to almost double in the next 25 years, to 71.5 million. In New York City, employment opportunities for the aides are forecast to grow at three times the overall rate for all occupations, said Jim Brown, a labor market analyst with the State Department of Labor in Manhattan.
 Although Selfhelp has long had success in recruiting job candidates, until recently it was having a hard time retaining them. Candidates must be 18 years old or older, pass drug screening and criminal background checks, be able to work legally in the United States, and show basic critical thinking skills during an interview and training.
 ''There was a significant dropout rate,'' said Stuart C. Kaplan, chief executive of Selfhelp. A lot ''didn't make it through, or made it through, got employed, then three to six months down the road, didn't stay employed,'' he said.
 In 2004, with grants from the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation and others, Selfhelp revised its program. Mentoring support and career monitoring and advice were added to help trainees graduate and remain employed. Since April 2004, more than 500 home health aides have taken part. ''What's unique about our program is we're part of their lives,'' said Cynthia Jenkins, 37, of Manhattan, who graduated from Selfhelp's program six years ago. She is one of three full-time mentors.
 During class time, she said, ''every student knows when I close the door, that's our cocoon, it's our time.''
 ''I'm here for their questions,'' she added. 
 Having an outlet to discuss concerns and problems allows students to focus on their training and, ultimately, their jobs. 
 Ms. Jenkins said many aides were on public assistance. ''A lot are homeless and live in shelters,'' she said. She recalled a time when a woman in an abusive marriage did not show up for class. ''I called an agency and got her into a safe house. A few months after that, she moved into an apartment of her own.''
 The program has two part-time training associates; they are working home health aides who attend class 60 hours a month to share work and life experiences with trainees.
 Ms. Ford, who is one of the training associates, said: ''I motivate them. I tell them they have the power to go out and do well.''
 The staff assists trainees in ways that include obtaining a high school diploma, finding child care and avoiding eviction. Once trainees graduate and are working, mentors continue to monitor personal and work-related issues. The mentors keep track of the aides for one year, calling weekly, then every two weeks, slowly reducing contact.
 Home health aides generally work for several patients, averaging three to four hours daily, though some work full time for one patient. They typically help patients with cooking, housekeeping and taking medicine. 
 The training covers such basic medical topics as what symptoms to look for in a variety of diseases; nutrition and meal planning; home safety; and accident prevention.
 Trainees must complete three weeks of classroom instruction and pass exams; they then get at least eight hours of supervised training in a patient setting before becoming state certified. Once employed, aides check in with supervisors by phone twice each workday, and are regularly monitored on site by registered nurses.
 One recent morning, 16 trainees were learning to take blood pressures. ''This is a very tricky skill. When I was at nursing school, nobody had a pulse or blood pressure,'' said Kim Hone, a registered nurse and education coordinator, as the class laughed. ''You eventually get it, and you get it through practice.''
 Ayesha Ross of Manhattan had difficulty finding the pulse. ''I had to ask Kim to show me, but finally I got it,'' she said. She took the class because she had noticed so many newspaper advertisements for jobs that required home health aide certificates.
 Joseph R. Williams, 49, of Manhattan, who has been looking for a job for about a year, previously worked for 12 years in the claims department of an insurance company.
 He became interested in the field after volunteering at a rehabilitation center in Astoria where his 90-year-old mother lives. He said he found the elderly insightful, and enjoyed swapping stories and ''uplifting their lives a little bit.'' The residents, he said, have ''been telling me, 'You should be doing this.' ''
 ''It makes me really want to push to make it a career,'' he said.
 It is too early to have firm data on the program's effectiveness, but Vivian Torres-Suarez, chief operating officer of Selfhelp, said, ''We're seeing a gradual shift; aides are staying a little bit longer with us.'' There has been an increase in the hiring rate and in the number of aides who stay with the organization after a year, resulting in less turnover.
 Selfhelp home health aides receive standard benefits and earn $7.45 an hour upon graduation; after working 2,100 hours, the rate increases to $7.75. Patients are from all economic backgrounds; most of their fees are paid by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance.
 Though the salary is low, home health aides have ''a great opportunity to get in at entry level and advance,'' said Scott Zucker, deputy commissioner of work force development at the New York City Department of Small Business Services. 
 Some aides go on to become registered nurses. 
 Petronilla John-Lewis, 31, of Brooklyn currently works as a home health aide through Selfhelp, but expressed an interest in attending nursing school. The Selfhelp mentoring staff assisted with school applications and financial aid. Ms. John-Lewis said she now worked five days a week, some weekends, and attended nursing school afternoons and evenings at Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn. 
 ''I am determined to make a better life for myself and my daughter,'' Ms. John-Lewis said, adding that she had no family nearby, was a single parent and was the first in her family to attend college. ''Nothing is impossible in this life.''

HEADLINE: Putting in the Hours and Paying a Price 

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
I'VE always been taken with the word ''zeitgeist.'' I remember hearing it for the first time when I was in college, wondering why I had never heard it before, and tucking it away because it was one of those perfect foreign words that said what no word in English did. 
 Language adapts to changing needs, and new terms are cropping up to describe the evolving workplace. As it happens, two reports will be released this week, from two giants in the field of life/work study, and they both coin phrases that may well become part of the lexicon. 
The general message of both studies is that we spend far too much time at work, but the authors move beyond merely complaining and measure the downside not only to workers -- particularly parents -- but to business. That both groups independently examined the same territory and reached the same conclusions says something about what's in the life/work zeitgeist. 
 ''Extreme jobs'' is the phrase coined by the Hidden Brain Drain Task Force of the Center for Work-Life Policy. As defined by the task force, you have an extreme job if you work 60 hours or more a week and meet at least 5 additional characteristics from a list of 10. These include fast-paced work under tight deadlines, responsibility for profit and loss, a large amount of travel, an unpredictable flow of work, and work-related events outside business hours. 
 Based on two surveys and dozens of interviews and focus groups, the task force estimates that about 20 percent of high earners in the United States (defined as those in the top 6 percent of income levels) meet the definition of an extreme worker. That means 20 percent of those who make it to the top are working harder than any human can sustain for very long. 
 A 60-hour workweek, with a one-hour commute each way, means leaving the house at 7 a.m. every morning and not returning until 9 p.m. And more than half of extreme workers log longer hours than that. 
 ''It's the American dream on steroids,'' says Sylvia Ann Hewlett, who heads the task force, turning another phrase. Ms. Hewlett wrote the book ''Creating a Life,'' in which she argued that the most successful women are the least likely to have children.
 Ms. Hewlett points out that these extreme workers love their jobs, lest this become a ''poor me I earn so much money'' story. ''They love the thrill, the meaning, the challenge, the oversized compensation packages and the brilliant colleagues.'' 
 What they don't love is the fallout on the parts of their lives that are not work. Sixty-nine percent say their extreme jobs undermine their health, 46 percent say work gets in the way of a good relationship with their spouse, and 58 percent say it gets in the way of strong relationships with their children.
 And what about those children? That is a concern of both the task force study and of Catalyst, the research and consulting organization that aims to expand opportunities for women at work. Catalyst worked with the Community, Families and Work Program at Brandeis University to look specifically at stress on working parents at the office, which they call ''parental concern about after-school time,'' or Pcast. No, that doesn't trip off the tongue as smoothly as extreme jobs, but in the realm of human resources, where policy is made, it might well become a term of art, because both groups have couched this not just in terms of a problem for parents, but a problem for business.
 ''Pcast is not just bad for parents: it is bad for employers,'' Catalyst says. All those dashes from work when child care falls through, all those distracted hours spent at the office knowing a child is home sick -- that affects close to 50 million employees, the Catalyst study says. 
 The task force goes further, and measures what is worrying parents who hold extreme jobs. ''Has your child ever experienced any of the following because of the number of hours you work?'' they were asked. ''Watching too much television'' (40 percent of women and 35 percent of men said yes); ''acting out/discipline issues due to lack of attention'' (38 percent of women, 18 percent of men); and ''eating too much junk food'' (34 percent of women, 12 percent of men). 
 The solution, both groups say, is what Catalyst calls ''the agile workplace.'' That means a philosophy of flexibility. On the specific topic of Pcast, that could include subsidies for after-school care and backup care, and the ability to telecommute. 
 The alternative, the task force warns, is that today's distracted and overworked employees will become tomorrow's drag on the bottom line. ''The culture that celebrates the extreme ethos today may tire of it -- quite literally -- tomorrow,'' Ms. Hewlett writes. If so, she will need to coin another term. ''Expired workers,'' perhaps?

HEADLINE: A Distinction on Bias

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 It is important to study seriously the social, cultural and economic factors in the regrettable conflation of thin and healthy in our society. But it is a naive act of overcompensation to systematically deny any real ties between fatness and poor health. Scholars of fatness must not ignore the fact that many, possible most, fat people would be physically healthier were they to change.
 To be sure, fat people, like women and African-Americans, are often discriminated against. Still, it's impossible to become a woman or an African-American by eating poorly and failing to exercise. This distinction strikes me as far from trivial.

HEADLINE: Can't Pin Him Down

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
ARMANDO CHRISTIAN PEREZ walks into the restaurant an hour and 20 minutes late, extends his stubby hand and looks you in the eye with his baby blues weighed down by dark eyelashes and apologies. There was a misunderstanding, see. He had to take his children, ages 3 and 4, to a birthday party, and then distribute them to their respective mothers in different parts of this sprawling city. Put them to bed and kiss them good night.
 ''I like to keep them together, you know,'' he says. ''It's hard, but I try.'' 
That was one of the last pieces of profanity-free dialogue that Mr. Perez, the hip-hop star known as Pitbull, uttered for the next four hours as he, drink in hand and car stereo at an ear-splitting level, maneuvered his 2007 silver Mercedes through the streets of South Beach the Sunday before Thanksgiving. He spent the night hopping from Grazie, an Italian restaurant, to two clubs -- the Forge and Prive. An assortment of acquaintances, employees, old friends and hangers-on trailed behind.
 But Pitbull, 25, dressed in pinstriped pants and a long-sleeve blue shirt, concentrated his attentions and considerable charm on a high school chum, a 27-year-old woman whose name, Angelica, was tattooed on her ample bottom and revealed to all by extremely low-cut jeans. Pitbull fed her pieces of carpaccio. 
 ''This, by the way, is raw meat,'' he said with a twinkle in his eyes, and she made a cute face. 
 They washed down the carpaccio with a drink the bartender at Grazie makes especially for Pitbull and his friends -- a mixture of vodka, cranberry and an energy drink called Crunk.
 Pitbull, who had a gold-selling debut with ''M.I.A.M.I.'' (''Money Is a Major Issue'') in 2004, has just released his second album, ''El Mariel.'' The title comes from the Mariel boatlift, a chaotic influx of more than 125,000 Cubans in 1980 that neatly split the city's narrative into ''before Mariel'' and ''after Mariel.''
 Pitbull, born in 1981, knows only the latter: unprecedented growth laced by a wave of crime brought on by unemployment, cocaine and too many disenfranchised people vying for the same pie. The son of Cuban exiles, he likens himself to the Mariel refugees. Like him, he said, they were given an opportunity to begin anew on foreign soil and they ran with it. 
 ''Everyone wants to pin me down: 'He's reggaeton, he is crunk, he is a Latin rapper,' '' Pitbull said. ''But I'm all that and much more and nothing like it.'' 
 As the night progressed, Mr. Perez alternated between his two personas: Armando, who wears a pristine white cotton undershirt and calls everyone ''Papo,'' and Pitbull, the tattooed rapper who bares his teeth and holds out three fingers -- for Miami's 305 area code -- in a contrived pose whenever a camera points in his direction.
 ''Que paso, Papo?'' he said in flawless Spanish to a Latino man at the door of Prive. 
 Inside, the D.J. introduced him, and the two revved up the crowd, Pitbull dancing with his hands in the air. Two dancers in black top hats and bustiers writhed on top of the bar. Angelica had disappeared, and he was, for a moment, alone. It was past one o'clock in the morning, and he was alternating between water and shots of Patron. 
 Two young women approached him. One whispered something in his ear and pointed to her friend, standing a little too self-consciously on the side. Pitbull smiled, walked toward the woman, gently cupped her face in his hands and planted a full kiss on her mouth. Flash! Pitbull was back: bared teeth and all.

HEADLINE: Real-Time Traffic Reports? Get Real

BYLINE: By JOHN R. QUAIN

 BODY:
AS Americans we may love automobiles, but we certainly don't love other Americans with automobiles, especially when they are stopped in front of us in an endless garland of taillights stretching down the highway. A 2005 report by the Texas Transportation Institute said the average commuter wasted more than two days stuck in traffic every year.
 Of course, for every problem there's often a high-tech solution, and traffic is no exception. For fees ranging from $5 to $10 a month, drivers can try to beat the bumper-to-bumper blues by subscribing to services that transmit live traffic information to a car's navigation system (Acura, BMW and Chrysler are among the companies offering such systems) warning of impending gridlock and briskly directing drivers to take alternate routes. Well, almost.
As anyone who has tried such systems knows, you can still get trapped in traffic. So why hasn't the information superhighway been able to unclog the nation's roads? 
 The main difficulty is that no single, complete source of traffic information exists. So in each locale, providers of traffic information must gather their data about road conditions from multiple public and private sources. Also, three distinctly different types of traffic information must be combined: construction alerts, incident reports (which include accidents and events like parades) and flow data (which indicate the average speed of vehicles on a given road). Pulling all this information together to form a coherent picture is a challenge.
 Some providers, which include Navteq and Clear Channel Communications, the radio broadcasting company, get construction data from municipal departments of transportation, for example. But sometimes that information is out of date.
 Learning about sudden incidents is even trickier. Because there is no central source of live accident information, the data collectors rely on emergency medical service bulletins, fire department radio alerts and police scanners. However, minor breakdowns often are not reported and some fender benders do not snarl traffic. So companies like Clear Channel, which says there can be as many as 200 simultaneous incidents during rush hour in New York City alone, also gather reports called in by motorists in addition to checking live road cameras. 
 Unfortunately, neither construction schedules nor incident reports tell drivers how traffic is actually moving. A minor road repair at the wrong spot can back up traffic for miles, while an accident on Interstate 91, for example, before rush hour may not substantially delay travelers. That's when flow data becomes important. Most of the information on how fast traffic is moving is provided by sensors that are either embedded in the road or on poles along the highway.
 Most of the embedded, or loop, sensors have been installed by state and local municipalities. But these sensors can be foiled by snow and ice, and many were designed to gauge traffic volume, not speed. So to measure average speed, the information from the detectors has to be recalculated at a data processing center, delaying the delivery of the information by as much as 14 minutes, said Bryan Mistele, chief executive of Inrix, which provides flow information.
 A better source of flow data is roadside radar sensors, like those deployed by Traffic.com, which use solar panels and cellular networks to transmit real-time speed information back to regional offices. 
 Of course, roadside traffic sensors are expensive. It can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to create just one network of sensors. So while it may be feasible to install them along, say, the Bruckner Expressway, it doesn't make economic sense to post them along lonely stretches of I-91 in Vermont. Consequently, sensors cover fewer than 1 percent of major roads in the country, said Cy Smith, chief executive of AirSage, another provider of traffic flow data. 
 Time is another obstacle. While the information is being gathered, verified and combined into reports, traffic is changing.
 ''There's inherent latency,'' said Lance Locher, senior vice president of the Clear Channel's Total Traffic Network. Information from a caller about a wreck can be delayed by three to five minutes, he said. 
 There are three primary ways to get the information: over a cellular network and over FM radio or satellite radio broadcasts.
 Clear Channel's network sends encoded information over FM signals. Some in-car systems, like those in the 2007 BMW X5 and M5, receive and decode that traffic data at no cost. Makers of portable navigation devices, however, charge as much as $60 a year for the service. 
 Competing with Clear Channel are the satellite radio companies XM and Sirius, which charge about $10 a month for a traffic-only plan, or an additional $4 for current subscribers. XM NavTraffic is the larger of the two, covering 44 major urban areas. 
 The data channel of a cellular network works with cellphones, but the service usually means additional monthly charges starting at about $10. 
 But no matter how drivers receive the information, the time delay means that when the sultry voice of the navigation system warns of trouble ahead, drivers may already be tapping their toes on the Tappan Zee Bridge. However, that may soon change as new sources of information come online.
 Howard Hayes, a vice president at Navteq, said the most promising potential source of traffic speed information was gathered from systems that could find out where vehicles were and how fast they were traveling. These systems usually rely on two-way Global Positioning System devices.
 Inrix gets flow data from commercial trucking and car fleets that already use G.P.S. devices. Inrix said it could pinpoint a truck to within 20 feet. The problem is that taxi drivers and truckers want to avoid traffic, so their information may not show trouble spots. So Inrix has developed probability models to predict where and when traffic problems may occur. Mr. Mistele said the company incorporated school schedules, holidays, sporting events and weather information into its models. 
 Of course, the ultimate traffic information solution would be to have speed and position information on not just some vehicles but on virtually all of them. The obvious candidate for such information is the cellphone. Every cellphone transmits its location on a so-called control channel back to the carrier to send calls from one cell tower to the next. 
 IntelliOne has conducted trials showing that it can use such data to create a picture of what's happening on the road. The positioning information is anonymous, said Ron Herman, the chief executive, so there shouldn't be any privacy concerns. 
 But the information from cellphones is not as accurate as that from G.P.S. devices, so it can only pinpoint phones to within a few hundred feet. That makes it difficult to tell if a signal is coming from a vehicle on the highway or from one on a parallel service road. So AirSage and IntelliOne have to mathematically eliminate some conflicting information to determine average speeds.
 Still, assessing traffic conditions may remain something of a black art.
 ''The real package is everything,'' including incident reports and construction information, said Mr. Herman. ''We can tell you what the speeds are, but then the question is, 'What's causing the problem?' ''
 And even if you know what the problem is, there still may not be a way to avoid it.

 The information is relayed to the driver through a satellite radio channel or via an FM radio signal received by the navigation system. For cars without satellite navigation, the information can also be sent to the driver's cellphone.

GRAPHIC: Chart: ''Up-to-the-Minute Road Conditions, in Theory at Least''The satellite navigation systems of some new vehicles are equipped to display traffic conditions drawn from a variety of sources, but compiling and distributing the information remains a challenge. Designed to alert drivers to accidents, road construction and other delays, these systems can map an alternate route around the backups.Reports of traffic incidents are provided by companies that compile information from municipal governments, emergency medical services and roadside cameras. But to be useful, the companies need to know how fast the traffic is moving. This data is gathered by sensors and signals gleaned from G.P.S.-equipped cellphones.

HEADLINE: Integration's Last Leg?

BYLINE: By Susan Eaton. 
Susan Eaton, the research director at the Charles Hamilton Houston Institute for Race and Justice at Harvard Law School, is the author of the forthcoming ''The Children in Room E4: American Education on Trial.''

 BODY:
ON Monday, the United States Supreme Court is scheduled to hear a pair of cases that may provide the court's conservative majority with the hammer it needs to drive a final nail in the coffin of Brown v. Board of Education, the landmark 1954 school desegregation case. 
 A series of decisions by the Supreme Court has already constricted the ways in which school segregation can be remedied and has shortened the duration of court desegregation orders. In both cases on the docket, the justices will decide if school districts may instate voluntary policies intended to achieve racial diversity in public classrooms. If the court bans such policies, schools across the country will face new difficulties in achieving racial integration. 
In Seattle and in the Louisville, Ky., area, school officials allowed parents to choose their children's schools but set limits on how segregated the schools could become. Louisville, for instance, prohibited schools from becoming more than 50 percent or less than 15 percent black. 
 Occasionally, when parents' school choices threatened a school's racial balance, their preferences were denied. Other school districts and states have devised similarly choice-based, voluntary policies to reduce segregation. 
 But a handful of parents in Seattle and Louisville sued over the policies, claiming it violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Now, a court decision against the school districts would block one of the few proven paths to achieving the goals of diversity and equal opportunity that inspired the Brown case in the first place.
 Except, perhaps, in Connecticut. Connecticut is home to some of the poorest and most racially isolated urban areas and the most lily-white affluent suburbs in the nation. Yet no matter how the court decides, some of the best examples of the kind of schools envisioned by Thurgood Marshall and the other civil rights lawyers who argued Brown are likely to be found right here.
 Why? In 1989, a band of forward-looking civil rights lawyers representing Connecticut schoolchildren and their parents refused to let Brown v. Board of Education die. In Sheff v. O'Neill, the plaintiffs' lawyers fought for the Brown ideals, arguing that segregation and concentrated poverty in Hartford public schools deprived students of the equal educational opportunity guaranteed by the state Constitution. 
 In 1996, the state Supreme Court agreed with them, ordering the state to remedy segregation. Chief Justice Ellen Peters wrote, ''Every passing day shortchanges these children.'' (It's unlikely, though not impossible, that a Supreme Court ruling against Seattle and Jefferson County school districts will affect Connecticut schools because Connecticut's desegregation plans were adopted not voluntarily but to comply with a state court order.) 
 Now, a decade later, thousands of children in Connecticut, including Hartford and its suburbs, are assigned to waiting lists for spots in the racially diverse, academically successful, magnet schools created to bring together students from the state's mostly black and Latino cities and predominantly white suburbs. 
 With demand for placement in these schools outstripping the supply of seats, the state certainly may not have been generous enough in its remedies. But because of the Sheff ruling, Connecticut now runs the sort of model schools that prepare students for work, learning and life in our increasingly diverse nation. 
 Not all of Connecticut's magnet schools draw such diverse student bodies. But many do, including two I've visited. The University of Hartford Magnet School, on the perimeter of West Hartford, and the Montessori Magnet School, in what was once a drug-infested neighborhood near Trinity College in Hartford, carry children toward the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s ultimate goal -- fostering the ''beloved community'' in a truly integrated America. 
 These schools purposefully bridge a racial and economic divide. They aren't ''white'' schools. They aren't ''black'' schools. They aren't ''Latino'' schools. They aren't even ''urban'' or ''suburban'' schools. They are just schools -- successful schools that have posted admirable test scores over the years.
 In Connecticut, front-line educators understand that moving beyond ''desegregation'' to actual ''integration'' requires more than a favorable court decision. It takes open hearts, open minds and open attitudes -- qualities the best adults struggle to gain and most five-year-olds have in abundance.
 On the 50th anniversary of Brown, in 2004, Americans glorified the ruling and its heart-swelling declaration that ''in the field of public education, the doctrine of 'separate but equal' has no place.'' In classroom discussions, schoolchildren still learn about Brown's role in forcing the country to eradicate its separatist shame and work to achieve ''one nation indivisible.'' 
 If the Supreme Court decides to make desegregating schools even harder, Connecticut schoolchildren and their parents may soon be among the few still trying to live up to that challenge.

HEADLINE: Winter Meetings A Big Deal? Sometimes

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS

 BODY:
This is the week everyone in baseball looks forward to. It's more greatly anticipated and more popular than the World Series because everyone gets to participate in the winter meetings. A team doesn't have to win a lot of games or a certain set of games to qualify to attend the meetings. Make a hotel reservation, get a flight and the hotel lobby is yours. Any general manager can hang out all week, and no one will accuse him of lurking in the lobby.
 Fans anticipate the meetings for a different reason: the trades they expect or hope to happen. General managers like trades, too, especially if they stand to improve their teams.
 Few meetings in recent years have lived up to hopes or expectations. But since the meetings resumed in 1998 after a five-year hiatus, it's clear that Terry Ryan of the Minnesota Twins made the best trade but also made, perhaps, the worst move. In 1999, Ryan made a swap of minor league players, acquiring Johan Santana from Florida for Jared Camp. During the 2002 meetings, though, Ryan released David Ortiz. 
 Santana has won the American League Cy Young award two of the past three years, and Ortiz has finished third, second and fourth in the A.L. most valuable player voting the past three years. Ryan agreed that those moves were the top and the bottom for the Twins.
 ''We had a couple good reports on Santana, he was young and left-handed, and we had pinpointed him as a guy we had a lot of interest in, and we took a shot at him,'' Ryan said.
 Releasing Ortiz, Ryan readily acknowledged, was a big mistake. Other teams also made a mistake by passing up a chance to get Ortiz, then 27 years old. 
 ''I tried to trade David for the better part of a month and a half leading up to the meetings,'' Ryan recalled. ''I couldn't find a partner, so I wound up asking release waivers on him. I was looking for a prospect or a player who could fit in here. It was a mistake. I was wrong; I was impatient.''
 Not all trades are made and not all free agents are signed at the winter meetings. Teams make transactions before the meetings, and they make them after the meetings. But with representatives of all the teams and agents in the same hotel, the proximity can breed action. 
 There was so much free-agent action at the 1992 meetings that Bud Selig, the acting commissioner at the time, decided the weeks had become too expensive for teams and declared an end to them. The meetings, Selig decided, enabled agents to ply their wares in a way that worked to the economic detriment of the clubs, playing a general manager in one hotel room against a general manager in a room on the floor above.
 In three days of the 1992 meetings, 35 free agents were signed to a total of $225 million in contracts. If you don't think that was a lot of money, remember that those signings took place 14 years ago. Barry Bonds, at those meetings, agreed to a six-year, $43.75 million contract; his recently expired contract was for five years and $90 million.
 In the five-year period the meetings were not held, officials learned that teams could sign players to outrageous contracts no matter where the general managers and the agents were. The meetings resumed in 1998.
 Last year's meetings produced some trades that turned out to be significant. The Mets acquired catcher Paul Lo Duca from Florida, and he became an integral part of the Mets' division championship. The Mets also signed Jose Valentin as a free agent, presumably to be a backup infielder, but he became the regular second baseman.
 Before the meetings, the Mets added first baseman Carlos Delgado in a trade with the Marlins and closer Billy Wagner as a free agent.
 Teams made two significant signings of free-agent closers at the meetings. Todd Jones joined the Detroit Tigers and helped them get to the World Series, and Trevor Hoffman re-signed with the San Diego Padres and became the major leagues' career leader in saves.
 Two years earlier, the Boston Red Sox signed Keith Foulke to be their closer, and he was instrumental in their first World Series championship since 1918.
 In the year in between, Atlanta wasn't so fortunate. It traded for Dan Kolb, but he failed in his role as the team's closer, and the Braves were left without a reliable closer until they obtained Bob Wickman in a trade late last season.
 St. Louis did better in a trade at the 2003 meetings. The Cardinals and the Braves made a five-player trade, in which the key players were outfielder J. D. Drew going to the Braves and pitcher Jason Marquis moving to St. Louis.
 But another pitcher going from Atlanta to St. Louis in that deal was a minor league pitcher, Adam Wainwright. With Jason Isringhausen out with a hip ailment, Wainwright became the Cardinals' closer late last season and earned four saves in the team's successful postseason.
 Few trades produce such nuggets. But general managers keep trying. When they are together in one hotel, they occasionally get carried away and put together three-team or four-team trades. In 1999, Colorado, Oakland, Milwaukee and Tampa Bay did a four-way deal. No championships and no stars emerged from the intricate swap.
 The players in the trade were Vinny Castilla, Rolando Arrojo, Aaron Ledesma, Justin Miller, Jimmy Haynes, Jeff Cirillo, Scott Karl, Henry Blanco and Jamey Wright.

Short Stops at Shortstop
 The Red Sox are either very particular about their shortstop, or they keep making mistakes, because they will start 2007 with yet another one. Nomar Garciaparra was the last shortstop to return for a full season, in 2003.
 Garciaparra, Pokey Reese and Orlando Cabrera were the Red Sox' starting shortstops in 2004. Cabrera stabilized the infield defense after Boston obtained him at the July 31 trading deadline, but after the season, the Red Sox let him go as a free agent and signed another free-agent shortstop, Edgar Renteria.
 One year later, they traded Renteria to Atlanta and signed another free agent, Alex Gonzalez, though not until Feb. 6. Now Gonzalez, again a free agent, has moved on to Cincinnati, and the Red Sox don't have a shortstop, though General Manager Theo Epstein said last week, ''Right now our shortstop is Alex Cora, and there's a strong possibility we'll add another shortstop via trade or free agency.''
 The Red Sox have been negotiating for Julio Lugo, who is -- what else? -- a free agent. ''I won't comment on that,'' Epstein said.

A Nestful of Relievers
 The Baltimore Orioles are getting all dressed up with nowhere to go. They have stocked their bullpen with four free agents, committing a minimum of $42 million to Chad Bradford, Danys Baez, Jamie Walker and Scott Williamson. 
 Of course, the Orioles have to try to improve their team, but they play in the same division with the Yankees and the Red Sox in addition to the Toronto Blue Jays, who edged Boston for second place last season. The Orioles have endured nine successive losing seasons and have finished fourth in eight of those seasons. Their victory total of 70 last season was their lowest in four years.
 In their quest to remake their relief corps, the Orioles snatched Bradford from the Mets. ''This was such a good fit that the choice was easy,'' Bradford said, not saying, but meaning, that the Orioles gave him a much better offer than the Mets.

First-Timers, One-Teamers
 The two players on the newly released Hall of Fame ballot who are virtually certain to be elected as first-timers, Cal Ripken and Tony Gwynn, played their entire careers with one team. Ripken had 20 years and 57 days of service with Baltimore, and Gwynn spent 19 years 77 days with San Diego. A baseball year for players is defined as 172 days, or 10 days shorter than the 182-day regular season.
 Craig Biggio of Houston and John Smoltz of Atlanta are the leaders among active players for an entire career spent with one team. Biggio has been with the Astros for 18 years 99 days, Smoltz with the Braves for 18 years 72 days.

HEADLINE: War Drags On, And She Keeps Wrapping

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW WINDSOR, N.Y. 

 BODY:
It did not begin as Luz Mercado's Christmas tradition.
 Instead, it began two years ago as something at once desperate and mundane -- a mother's obsessive campaign to make Christmas seem like Christmas for her son in Iraq and the Marines serving under him.
With the holidays coming and her son, Marine Sgt. Luis Mercado Jr., requesting a Santa suit for himself and assorted goodies for the Marines in his unit, Mrs. Mercado turned her garage into a warehouse and herself into a nonprofit foundation called Support Our Heroes. Before long the donations poured in, the gift baskets were stuffed and mailed off, and it was Christmas in Iraq in a war she hoped, prayed and believed would soon be over. 
 When the next Christmas came, he was home, serving as a Marine drill inspector on Parris Island, S.C. But his buddies were still in Iraq, and she figured she owed it to other moms to do for their children what she had done for her own. So there was a second Christmas blitz, more gift baskets, more bags from Sam's Club and Wal-Mart, more stacks of Big Red gum, Red Bull energy drink and black socks to send to Iraq.
 Now the war limps on, and the pictures at www.supportourheroes.net are of Army Pfc. Matt Harvey from Cornwall, N.Y., and Marine Lance Cpl. Chris Smolinski from Newburgh, N.Y., whose platoons will be the recipients of this year's 125 gift bags of snacks, sweets, toiletries and clothes. She also sends packages of supplies throughout the year.
 It feels different from when she began. Most of the flags and yellow ribbons are gone from nearby homes. The war feels like the ailing elephant in the room of American life, too big to ignore, too grim to discuss much. The garage is pretty empty and the fund-raising is a struggle. We need new product in America, and this war feels like something long since marked down and ready to be moved. In September, she sent out 125 letters to previous donors asking for contributions. She got responses from about 10.
 But it would feel wrong to move on while the soldiers are still there, so Mrs. Mercado pushed on like someone walking uphill into a stiff wind.
 ''It's just hard,'' she said. ''People are busy. They only have so much money. I understand that. But I made a promise to keep doing this until all the soldiers are home, and that's what I plan to do.''
 It's not what she bargained for. When the war began, she thought it would last a few months, a year and a half at the most. Who expected this? It didn't help when she had to have surgery over the summer or when the war news kept getting worse.
 But Mrs. Mercado, who sells jewelry and has a 15-year-old son at home, has the laser focus of the woman who manages to get the kids to every event, bake the perfect peach pie and make the trains run on time at home. So she has managed to cook up events, raise money, buy things herself when she finds good sales.
 She has help from Pat Smolinski, an occupational therapist, and Linda Harvey, who runs a Montessori school, both of whom come across as modern war moms -- terrified and slightly ironic at the same time.
 When Mrs. Harvey stopped over on her way to yoga class the other night, Mrs. Mercado was excited to hear that Matt was due home for two weeks in January.
 ''Don't let him go back,'' Mrs. Mercado said urgently.
 ''What am I supposed to do, shoot him?''
 ''Break his leg or something. There must be a way.''
 It's not that people don't care. There was a bake sale at the Newburgh auto auction and, a tango dance fund-raiser. People are generous in dropping off things at the yoga studio Mrs. Harvey attends.
 Still, it's a struggle.
 ''People are tired of the war,'' Mrs. Smolinski said. ''And look at our economy. People tend to forget unless you're in their face constantly, and if you're in their face all the time, you're going to alienate them.''
 She sends her own CARE packages to her son two or three times a week, car magazines, Chef Boyardee ravioli, Skittles, Twizzlers, and tries to keep an even keel. ''He seems to be doing wonderfully,'' she said. ''His mother, on the other hand, is a basket case.''
 Mrs. Mercado has been there. She cried every day her son was away, followed war news intently, shivered over every casualty report. That should be over. It's not.
 She still gets that cold chill from the casualty reports, even if her son is safe in South Carolina. She still fusses over those gift bags. She prays this is a tradition that won't last past this year, but figures if it's still needed, she'll be ready to do it again.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld's Memo of Options for Iraq War

 BODY:
Following is the text of a classified Nov. 6 memorandum that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld sent to the White House suggesting new options in Iraq. The memorandum was sent one day before the midterm Congressional elections and two days before Mr. Rumsfeld resigned. 

 Nov. 6, 2006
 
 SUBJECT: Iraq -- Illustrative New Courses of Action 
 The situation in Iraq has been evolving, and U.S. forces have adjusted, over time, from major combat operations to counterterrorism, to counterinsurgency, to dealing with death squads and sectarian violence. In my view it is time for a major adjustment. Clearly, what U.S. forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough. Following is a range of options:

ILLUSTRATIVE OPTIONS

 Above the Line: (Many of these options could and, in a number of cases, should be done in combination with others) 
 Publicly announce a set of benchmarks agreed to by the Iraqi Government and the U.S. -- political, economic and security goals -- to chart a path ahead for the Iraqi government and Iraqi people (to get them moving) and for the U.S. public (to reassure them that progress can and is being made).
 Significantly increase U.S. trainers and embeds, and transfer more U.S. equipment to Iraqi Security forces (ISF), to further accelerate their capabilities by refocusing the assignment of some significant portion of the U.S. troops currently in Iraq. 
 Initiate a reverse embeds program, like the Korean Katusas, by putting one or more Iraqi soldiers with every U.S. and possibly Coalition squad, to improve our units' language capabilities and cultural awareness and to give the Iraqis experience and training with professional U.S. troops. 
 Aggressively beef up the Iraqi MOD and MOI, and other Iraqi ministries critical to the success of the ISF -- the Iraqi Ministries of Finance, Planning, Health, Criminal Justice, Prisons, etc. -- by reaching out to U.S. military retirees and Reserve/National Guard volunteers (i.e., give up on trying to get other USG Departments to do it.) 
 Conduct an accelerated draw-down of U.S. bases. We have already reduced from 110 to 55 bases. Plan to get down to 10 to 15 bases by April 2007, and to 5 bases by July 2007.
 Retain high-end SOF capability and necessary support structure to target Al Qaeda, death squads, and Iranians in Iraq, while drawing down all other Coalition forces, except those necessary to provide certain key enablers for the ISF. 
 Initiate an approach where U.S. forces provide security only for those provinces or cities that openly request U.S. help and that actively cooperate, with the stipulation being that unless they cooperate fully, U.S. forces would leave their province. 
 Stop rewarding bad behavior, as was done in Fallujah when they pushed in reconstruction funds, and start rewarding good behavior. Put our reconstruction efforts in those parts of Iraq that are behaving, and invest and create havens of opportunity to reward them for their good behavior. As the old saying goes, ''If you want more of something, reward it; if you want less of something, penalize it.'' No more reconstruction assistance in areas where there is violence. 
 Position substantial U.S. forces near the Iranian and Syrian borders to reduce infiltration and, importantly, reduce Iranian influence on the Iraqi Government.
 Withdraw U.S. forces from vulnerable positions -- cities, patrolling, etc. -- and move U.S. forces to a Quick Reaction Force (QRF) status, operating from within Iraq and Kuwait, to be available when Iraqi security forces need assistance.
 Begin modest withdrawals of U.S. and Coalition forces (start ''taking our hand off the bicycle seat''), so Iraqis know they have to pull up their socks, step up and take responsibility for their country.
 Provide money to key political and religious leaders (as Saddam Hussein did), to get them to help us get through this difficult period.
 Initiate a massive program for unemployed youth. It would have to be run by U.S. forces, since no other organization could do it.
 Announce that whatever new approach the U.S. decides on, the U.S. is doing so on a trial basis. This will give us the ability to readjust and move to another course, if necessary, and therefore not ''lose.''
 Recast the U.S. military mission and the U.S. goals (how we talk about them) -- go minimalist.
 Below the Line (less attractive options):
 Continue on the current path.
 Move a large fraction of all U.S. Forces into Baghdad to attempt to control it. 
 Increase Brigade Combat Teams and U.S. forces in Iraq substantially.
 Set a firm withdrawal date to leave. Declare that with Saddam gone and Iraq a sovereign nation, the Iraqi people can govern themselves. Tell Iran and Syria to stay out.
 Assist in accelerating an aggressive federalism plan, moving towards three separate states -- Sunni, Shia, and Kurd. 
 Try a Dayton-like process.

HEADLINE: Imports Spurring Push to Subsidize Fruit and Greens 

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: FRESNO COUNTY, Calif. 

 BODY:
For decades, the fiercely independent fruit and vegetable growers of California, Florida and other states have been the only farmers in America who shunned federal subsidies, delivering produce to the tables of millions of Americans on their own.
 But now, in the face of tough new competition primarily from China, even these proud groups are buckling. Produce farmers, their hands newly outstretched, have joined forces for the first time, forming a lobby group intended to pressure politicians over the farm bill to be debated in Congress in January.
Nobody disputes that competitive pressures from abroad are squeezing fruit and vegetable growers, whose garlic, broccoli, lettuce, strawberries and other products are a mainstay of world kitchens. But the issue of whether the United States ought to broaden farm subsidies beyond the commodity crops like corn and cotton, which have historically been protected, is a big flashpoint.
 ''This is like the tectonic plates of farm policy shifting, because you have a completely new player coming in and demanding money,'' said Kenneth A. Cook, president of Environmental Working Group, a research group in Washington that has been critical of farm subsidies, which are mandated by federal laws that date to the Great Depression. 
 Although some farmers may be suffering, American consumers have been big beneficiaries of cheap food imports. On the United States wholesale market, for example, Chinese garlic costs almost half the price of garlic that is grown domestically.
 Existing American farm subsidy policies have been the subject of violent protests outside some World Trade Organization meetings, with detractors calling them an antique way of subsidizing United States farmers at the expense of poorer ones. American fruit and vegetable growers, with their much smaller farms, have never been part of this debate, in part because their crops yielded higher returns, did not need much support, and were never organized around a single policy goal.
 But times have changed.
 Here in the fertile San Joaquin Valley, Mike Mantelli has seen firsthand the substantial changes forced by the rising tide of Chinese garlic into the United States. As the general manager of the largest American garlic company, Christopher Ranch, he remembers when there were 1,200 acres of garlic planted on a 6,000-acre farm here a decade ago. 
 Today the company plants less than 300 acres because of lower demand for California garlic, he said.
 ''The Chinese garlic totally caught us off-guard and knocked us down,'' Mr. Mantelli said recently as he checked on newly planted garlic bulbs. ''I think our industry has hit rock bottom. Maybe now we can figure out how to make it a level playing field.''
 So Mr. Mantelli has joined the coalition of about 75 growers of specialty crops who have united to grab a much bigger slice of the federal subsidy pie. 
 The group, representing growers of everything from broccoli to strawberries to nuts and flowers and wine, submitted a bill in September asking for what most likely would amount to more than $1 billion for programs they say could help their crops compete better in a tougher global marketplace.
 The farmers are not asking for the kind of direct subsidies that have been accused of distorting trade and hurting developing countries' agricultural industries. Hoping to avoid a nasty battle with powerful farm-state politicians in the Midwest and Southeast, they are asking instead for money to help market their products at home and overseas, as well as for research and conservation. 
 But whatever money the fruit and vegetable farmers might get would probably have to come out of the allocation that already goes to other sorts of farmers. As things stand, the federal farm subsidy program supplies more than $15 billion a year, primarily to growers of five crops: corn, cotton, rice, wheat and soybeans. Those crops are considered interchangeable commodities and are traded on world markets, unlike fruits and vegetables, which are called specialty crops because their taste and quality are viewed as being highly variable. 
 While some vegetable and fruit groups have previously requested more funds, they have never before mounted a united challenge. ''This is the first time these groups have weighed in with a sense of organization and commitment,'' said Clayton Yeutter, a former agriculture secretary and United States trade representative. 
 The current agriculture secretary, Mike Johanns, looks favorably on the produce growers' bill. The legislation also has the advantage that the farmers come from states with sizable representation in Congress. 
 Still, the proposal is likely to face a tough road. There are many other federal budget priorities, and farm experts say there will probably be less money allocated to the farm bill next year than in 2002, when there was a huge increase. 
 Further, while commodity growers are making courteous noises about the fruit and vegetable farmers' requests, they have historically enjoyed a near monopoly on federal subsidies.
 But fruit and vegetable farmers have been gaining influence. The group's combined cash receipts of $52.2 billion rival or exceed those of the five major commodity crops, which are expected to generate $52 billion this year.
 The produce farmers can also point to the competitive situation. California growers once dominated the garlic industry in the United States, but imports from China and Hong Kong have increased from less than 1 million pounds in 2000 to 112 million pounds last year. This year, for the first time, more Chinese garlic will be sold in the United States than California produces, Commerce Department figures show.
 China's farmers, who are broadly subsidized, have the advantage in that their nation's currency, the yuan, is tightly regulated to maximize trade opportunities. And the country has a glut of workers for the labor-intensive jobs of growing and harvesting fruits and vegetables. 
 ''Of course consumers are benefiting now,'' said Peter Morici, an economist at the University of Maryland business school and a former chief economist at the United States International Trade Commission. ''But competition should not be based on subsidies.''
 Other specialty crop groups are also struggling with foreign competition, in particular from China, which has geared its agriculture industry towards labor-intensive, higher-value fruits and vegetables. China has begun to dominate everything from apples to onions. Chinese exports have also eaten into American growers' share of markets in Japan and Hong Kong for items like broccoli and lettuce.
 Fruit and vegetable growers have the political advantage of being in states like California, Florida and Arizona, which are likely to be critical in the 2008 presidential election. But it is unclear how important the farm vote will be to the Democrats in the next election.
 Under the proposed bill, an overseas marketing program would rise 75 percent, to $350 million a year. An existing specialty crop block-grant program would leap tenfold to $500 million a year. And the government would buy at least $400 million worth of fruits and vegetables annually for school lunch programs.
 While the total cost of the proposed bill has yet to be tallied, it will probably reach a few billion dollars, coalition officials said. Whether the fruit and vegetable farmers can win that much will depend in large part on just how much money Congress allocates to farm spending next year.
 If the farmers get what they want, consumers could benefit from more information and choice at the grocery store, said Professor Morici of the University of Maryland. At the same time, American growers could become more efficient and competitive.
 ''Things that help farmers band together and compete are not inherently protectionist or harmful,'' Professor Morici said. ''It is not an unreasonable thing for a fragmented industry to ask the government for assistance to make the virtues of their industry better known.''
 He added, ''Whatever money they put for research would benefit the consumer. That would run down their price, and eventually that information would get around the world.''
 Mr. Johanns, the agriculture secretary, said in a speech last month that American farm policy needed to be ''equitable, predictable and beyond challenge.'' Noting the fruit and vegetable farmers' proposal, he said that farm programs could no longer be decided among a few commodities in a few parts of the country. ''That day has changed,'' Mr. Johanns said. 
 The vegetable and fruit growers stood by silently for decades in large part because they did not need government assistance to be successful. While generating close to half of farm receipts, the specialty crops are grown on just 11 million acres of farmland, versus 215 million for the major commodity crops. 
 In California, new financing could not come soon enough for garlic farms like the Christopher Ranch. The Christophers, fourth-generation farmers in the state, have struggled to hold their market share, and it is not hard to see why: On the wholesale market, Chinese garlic recently cost $15 to $16 for a 30-pound box, compared with $28 for a box of California garlic.
 In the late 1990s the Christopher Ranch's garlic production peaked at about 100 million pounds. Since then sales and acreage have fallen by more than 40 percent. In 2001 China began flooding the market with garlic, after managing to find ways around an import tariff of 377 percent. 
 As the demand for their garlic has fallen, the Christophers have turned to growing crops like pearl onions and shallots. The family hired a trade lawyer in Washington to try to battle tariff violations. Now they hope that the proposed crop bill will give them a chance to educate consumers and pay for more research into crop diseases.
 ''We don't want handouts,'' Mr. Mantelli said. ''You don't want to just give people subsidies, because nobody learns from subsidies. But you want to give them opportunities and resources and tools to make their industry better.''

HEADLINE: Burial Insurance Provides Peace of Mind for $2 a Week

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: JACKSON, Miss. 

 BODY:
Vickie T. White, who grew up in a small Mississippi town, remembers her parents' leaving an envelope out each week for the burial insurance man. So when her granddaughter was born, it seemed natural to buy a policy for her. 
 ''It's something everyone should think of,'' Ms. White said. ''But I wouldn't in a million years have imagined that I'd have to be using it two weeks before she turned 2.''
After a head-on collision in February left her daughter maimed and her granddaughter dead, Ms. White, a 47-year-old office worker for the City of Jackson, could afford to pick out a little white and gold coffin. ''Without that policy, I don't know what I would have done,'' she said. ''You just don't want to put your loved one away any old kind of way.'' 
 Over the decades, the burial insurance business has been marred by scams and racially discriminatory pricing. Even today experts say the policies are costlier than conventional term insurance. 
 Many lower-income people have a different perspective. They see holding burial insurance as a point of pride, as well as security. They want a dignified funeral for themselves and their kin, and they have seen the crushing debts left by funerals that may cost well over $5,000. 
 Ms. White had her granddaughter's coffin sealed in a vault. ''That may seem unusual for a baby,'' she said, ''but that was the last thing I ever could do for her, you know.''
 The burial insurance industry is tapping into a long tradition and deep feelings about last rites among many low-income Americans and especially among blacks, who started cooperative societies even in slavery to promise decent burials. 
 Many of the buyers feel they cannot afford large life insurance policies but see small policies intended to cover funerals, costing as little as $2 a week, as a priority.
 ''If I say I want to sell you life insurance, they say no,'' said Howard D. Catchings, who started selling small burial policies to blue-collar workers here in the late 1960s and became one of Jackson's most prominent and prosperous black businessmen. ''If I say burial insurance, they say yes.''
 Mr. Catchings, 67, said his agency sold up to 15,000 such policies a year -- they are simply small life insurance policies worth an average of $5,000 -- by sending 15 agents to school systems, public agencies and companies to meet the janitors, bus drivers and secretaries. When he started, he said, all the customers were black, but he now sells to a rising share of white clients. 
 Insurance associations said they did not have figures on the number of policies bought to cover burial expenses, in part because most are listed as life insurance.
 A number of smaller companies still focus on the black neighborhoods of major cities, offering $5,000 or $10,000 policies intended for funeral costs. Some agents go to homes to collect monthly premiums in cash. 
 Insurers and funeral homes also offer plans explicitly tied to funeral costs.
 On a sales visit to the Hinds County maintenance yards outside Jackson, Wye Hurd, an agent of the Catchings Insurance Agency, hardly had to make a pitch. In an elegant maroon dress, joking with potential clients, Ms. Hurd, 43, brought a spark of color to the manager's office. The customers were mainly black men in blue work clothes, their first names embroidered on chest patches, who earn perhaps $10 to $15 an hour. A dozen streamed in to buy modest policies for themselves, their spouses and children, and sometimes their grandchildren.
 ''Your premiums never change, nor does your coverage change; your benefits go into effect today, and there's no waiting period,'' Ms. Hurd told Bobby Jenkins, a 36-year-old repairman who is unmarried but has a 9-year-old son. ''For $3 a week you'll be covered for $6,000.'' 
 Mr. Jenkins quickly signed up and authorized a second $3 weekly payroll deduction to buy a separate policy for his son, worth $18,000 because payments are starting early in life. 
 ''My grandfather and parents always had burial policies on me,'' Mr. Jenkins said. ''Now it's time I should do this.'' 
 Gerald D. Jaynes, professor of economics and African-American studies at Yale, said that from the 19th century, blacks joined mutual aid societies to save for burials. Many black-owned insurance companies, including the largest one, North Carolina Mutual, started out by selling burial policies when major companies excluded black customers or set discriminatory rates. 
 For religious and social reasons, blacks fiercely want to have a respectable funeral, Mr. Jaynes said, and preachers often refer to burial as a homecoming. 
 ''People know their relatives are going to try and put on the best possible funeral for them,'' he said.
 Those without money or insurance often ''pass the hat'' at church or even make pleas on the radio for donations, and also end up negotiating with funeral homes for loans. 
 ''It can be very humiliating for the family,'' said Audrey Wiley, an owner of the Westhaven Memorial Funeral Home in Jackson, who also sells insurance. ''Many of the families we come into contact with want to do better, but they just can't afford it.'' 
 A typical funeral with a sealed metal coffin costs about $6,200, Ms. Wiley said. For less, a nonsealing coffin may be used and families may do without limousines to the cemetery, for example. Cremation, not a tradition among blacks, is also a cheaper option. 
 At the lower end, some who arrive with decades-old $600 burial policies are just wrapped in canvas, Ms. Audrey said, something that happens at her funeral home several times a year. Indigents with no relatives are buried by the county in a pauper's field -- to many, a terrifying fate. 
 J. Robert Hunter, director of insurance for the Consumer Federation of America in Washington, said that some companies had pressured unsophisticated consumers to buy burial policies and that healthy individuals could get far more insurance for the same fees if they bought, say, 20- or 30-year term policies. 
 Term policies, however, may end before death, the main thing on the minds of these customers. Burial policies can continue for life, and sellers offer policies that seem convenient and easy to understand. 
 For one thing, small policies are offered without a medical examination: buyers must simply swear that that are not currently in a nursing home or ill and are not infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. 
 The use of payroll deductions, which the Catchings agency does, or at-home premium collections can also be attractive. 
 ''This is a good product for people without checking accounts,'' Mr. Catchings said. ''The money comes out of their check before they go to the nightclubs, so they know if they die their funeral will be paid for.'' 
 ''The low income people can't afford the hundred-thousand dollar policies -- they've got to eat and pay the rent,'' he said, ''but they will buy a 2- or 3-dollar-a-week policy, and they'll buy it on their spouses and their children.''
 ''Everybody wants to have an upscale funeral,'' he said. 
 David King, an electrician and carpenter for Hinds County who is 25, unmarried and has no children, could get a $10,000 policy for $3 a week, ''and you keep the same rate forever,'' Ms. Hurd, the saleswoman, told him. 
 ''That's not very much,'' he said, signing the papers. ''Might as well get it while the getting's good.''

GREENE, LEONARD MICHAEL

 BODY:
 GREENE--Leonard Michael. November 30, 2006, age 88, of Mamaroneck, NY, after a long and courageous battle with cancer. A 1991 inductee into the National Inventors Hall of Fame, Greene patented hundreds of inventions, many integral to modern aviation, including the stall prevention devices that are now essential safety equipment on all aircraft and have saved many thousands of lives. In 1946, he founded the Safe Flight Instrument Corporation in White Plains, NY, one of a very few early aviation companies still owned by its founding family. 
An aerodynamicist and expert pilot, Greene was a life member of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots and held many aviation records and awards. In 1981, he co-founded the Corporate Angel Network, a nonprofit that arranges free transportation to treatment for cancer patients by using the empty seats on corporate flights. To date, the organization has flown nearly 25,000 cancer patients to treatment centers throughout the U.S. An avid sailor, Greene advised several America's Cup syndicates and then bought the two-time winner Courageous to compete again in 1986. Sailing under the aegis of the Yale Corinthian Yacht Club, the only undergraduate sailing club ever to participate, the Courageous Syndicates 1986 run at the Cup spearheaded Greene's campaign to restore the Corinthian ideals of amateur sportsmanship to the competition, and more broadly, to team sports in general. Following the 1997 donation of Courageous to the Museum of Yachting in Newport, RI, the famed 12-meter was named Rhode Island's State Yacht. Leonard Greene experienced poverty as a youth during the Depression, and never forgot it. As a successful businessman, he implemented innovative employment policies, barring mandatory retirement age, actively recruiting the differently abled, and providing profit sharing at his own manufacturing facility. Seeking a broader forum and greater impact for his ideas, in 1974 he founded the Institute for SocioEconomic Studies, a nonpartisan think tank dedicated to enhancing economic and social opportunity and improving quality of life. The Institute provides a national forum for innovative insights and solutions to problems of economic development, social motivation, poverty, and urban regeneration and conducts research in these areas. Through the Institute, Greene advocated a revolutionary change in tax policy that would extend economic opportunity and incentives by transforming existing social welfare spending into a generous national tax rebate. In pursuit of these interests, he was a was a member of both the Special Committee on Welfare & Income Maintenance and the Council on Trends & Perspectives of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, as well as the Income Maintenance Committee of the Community Service Society and the Work Group on Welfare Reform of the Task Force on the New York City Fiscal Crisis. Greene was author of the books Free Enterprise without Poverty (Norton, 1981), The National Tax Rebate: A New America with Less Government (Regnery, 1998), and Inventorship: The Art of Innovation (Wiley, 2001). He was president of the Institute and active in its mission to the end. Greene graduated in 1938 from the City College of New York with a B.S. in Chemistry, and went on to receive the M.S. degree in Engineering, also from CCNY, before doing postgraduate work at the Guggenheim School of Aeronautics of New York University. He was awarded the degree of Doctor of Civil Law honoris causa by Pace University in 1977. Among his many other awards and honors are the Flight Safety Foundations Air Safety Award (1949 and 1981), Award for Meritorious Service (1981), and Allied Signal/Bendix Trophy Award for Aviation Safety (1999); the National Business Aircraft Association's Pilot Safety Award (1961) and Award for Meritorious Service to Aviation (1996); the Private Sector Initiative Commendation of the President of the United States (1982 and 1984); the Foundation for Westchester Community College's Medallion Award for Distinguished Achievement in Business, Science and Humanitarianism; the Special Act Award of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Aviation Week & Space Technology's Laurels Award in the Field of Electronics (1999) and Laureate Award for Lifetime Achievement as a Pioneer in Flight Safety, Performance and Innovation (2001); and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's Contribution to American Innovation Award (2002). He was man of vision who not only imagined and developed new and better products and policies, but also cared deeply enough about the well being of others to dare to try to overturn the status quo and to leave the world a better place. Beyond his gifts for invention and innovation, perhaps his most salient quality was his capacity for enjoyment. He loved his work and his life, and brought to both a child like sense of fun and adventure that gave him a special bond with children, including his own. Born in 1918 in New York City to Max and Lyn (Furman) Greene, Leonard Greene was also proceeded in death by his siblings Helen and Elliot. On September 11, 2001, his son, Donald Freeman Greene, was killed in the terrorist attack on Unitied Flight 93. Leonard Greene is survived by his children Randall Greene of Greenwich, CT; Bonnie Le Var of Briarcliff Manor, NY; Laurie Balwin of Kalispell, MT; Douglas F. Greene of Cortez, CO; Charles F. Greene of Novato, CA; Stephen F. Greene of Ludlow, VT; Terry Greene of Somerville, MA; and many grandchildren and greatgrandchildren. He will be deeply missed by his devoted family and friends, and by his ''family'' at Safe Flight, CAN, and the Institute. A memorial service will be held on Monday, December 4, at 2pm at the ECS of Westchester, 7 Saxon WR, White Plains, NY. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to Corporate Angel Network, Inc., Westchester County Airport, One Loop Road, White Plains, NY 10604. $(6$)GREENE--Leonard Michael. The Institute for SocioEconomic Studies, its Board and its staff are deeply saddened by the passing of our beloved founder and president. His energy, vision, humanitarian focus, and above all, his curiosity and enthusiasm will be greatly missed. A dynamic leader and a radically innovative thinker, Leonard Greene was an inspiration to us all.

HEADLINE: The Tipping Point

BYLINE: By Ken Gross

 BODY:
I do not double the tax or bother with the strict 18-percent solution, or even calculate the exact value of this or that test of service; I do not twist my brain, seeking some perfect balance between cost and expectation, or weigh the consequences of missing the mark. No, mine is an easier solution to settling accounts: I simply overtip.
This uncomplicated policy has eased my way through life, although it is usually well beyond my means. Nevertheless, I have come to believe that there is a steep price one pays to stay at ease in the world, and that cost is not listed on any menu or tallied to a certainty on any bill. 
 As a result of this guiding principle, I always have a choice table at my favorite restaurant. I have the services of the superintendent of my building without suffering long, grinding domestic standstills. I have hot, fresh bagels from the bagel store when everyone else is eating cold cement. I get my laundry and dry-cleaning and food delivered with speed and good cheer. I have the good opinion of my mail person, the respect of my handyman, the regard of my house painter, the esteem of my doorman -- and, through a kind of unforced, albeit communicable deference, the admiration of my neighbors.
 It is not bribery, in any legal or moral sense, nor am I driven by some philosophical strain of ambient guilt; this is straightforward recognition on my part that there is an inherent economic injustice in the world, and I do my part to set things straight.
 Naturally, you can't go through life with a radical tipping policy and not expect to hit a few bumps in the road.
 Not too long ago my wife and I were thrown out of a fancy French restaurant right here in Manhattan. We were seated on a banquette, and I had rashly complained to the waiter that our neighbor's hair was dangling in my wife's soup. A fuss ensued, he tore up our check, pointed to 55th Street and said, quivering with Gallic indignation, ''She is a regular!''
 That guy got no tip.
 But don't get me wrong, I'm not a sucker or one of those gaudy gangsters who hand out $100 bills like Communion wafers. No, I have a healthy workingman's appreciation for the price of labor -- something I learned as a boy in the Bronx. My mother was a single parent, and all four of her sons had to kick in to survive. 
 I went to work at 13 and brought home $10 a week, which, in those days, was a salary.
 I was a helper at Leo & Chubby's, a produce market on 180th Street, and after school and on the weekends I loaded and delivered weighty bags of food to customers within a 10-block radius. In addition to a $5-a-week wage, I got tips. Leo and Chubby were Korean War veterans who were fundamentally decent men. They passed along the creed of running an honorable business. Always be polite to customers, do not cheat on weight, and, above all, be fair. However, nothing is ever quite so simple. There is a side to every business that requires some ethical ... equivocation. For example, every time Leo and Chubby got a shipment of fruit or vegetables, some portion was inevitably rotten. The bad stuff was immediately thrown out. It was a built-in loss. But there was also some portion that was dubious -- not bad, as such, but not great. It could be eaten, but not memorably. That part could not be thrown out. That was the difference between profit and loss. Leo and Chubby had a wise and fair solution: they divided the less-than-perfect fruits and vegetables among all the customers. No one would get too much. And as the loader of the deliveries, I did my part. Everyone got one mushy peach or a cottony tomato.
 Of course, I was little more than a child and I still remember that blistering August of my 13th year. Some deliveries more than others. I recall one day climbing tenement stairs, trying to balance three heavy bags as the sweat fell like tears down from my eyes. As I climbed from one floor to the next, I could read the full text of the dinner menus in the air. There was the sweet scent of cabbage on two, a potent whiff of sauerkraut on three, the thick perfume of garlic chicken on four. And there on five was a woman waiting with her arms folded, her lips pressed -- annoyed that I had kept her pots waiting.
 She ushered me through the living room and hallway and into the kitchen and watched as I carefully deposited her order on the table. Then, only when she had examined the bags and made certain that I had not stolen anything, she squeezed a coin out of her change purse as if she were giving birth. A nickel.
 There were all kinds of tippers on my route. Dime tippers. Even quarter tippers. But there was also one lady who gave me half a dollar. I don't believe she did it to show off, or to get better fruit, which from then on she did. I like to think it was a simple recognition of the effort it took to get the food to her table. She set a standard for generosity that I have tried to meet ever since. That lousy half-dollar tip has cost me a fortune.

HEADLINE: And Now a Syllabus For the Service Economy

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN. 
William J. Holstein is editor in chief of Directorship magazine.

 BODY:
CORPORATIONS need to help prepare university students for the new services-based economy, says Irving Wladawsky-Berger, I.B.M.'s vice president for technical strategy and innovation and a visiting professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Here are excerpts from a conversation:

Q. Years ago, I.B.M. worked with Columbia and other universities to establish computer sciences programs. What are you doing on campus now?

A. Information technology is becoming embedded in all aspects of business, society and our personal lives. We see an increasing requirement to apply technology, engineering and disciplined thinking and design to the people aspect of businesses. That's really what we mean by services. 
There are no universities that have had programs in applying technology to the people aspect of businesses. So once more we are working with universities around the world to help create this emerging discipline that we call services sciences.

Q. Give an example of the skills you want to see being taught.

A. Assume that you want to design an end-to-end hospital management system. The back-office parts of the hospital, the pieces that process transactions and store information, are well understood. But if you really look at the things that go on in the hospital, there is a huge number of processes that take place between people. Patients have to be discharged; physicians show up. All those processes get done in a relatively ad hoc way. If we want to apply information technology and engineering discipline to improve the quality of the service, to reduce errors and to improve productivity, you need people who know how to design a hospital system.

Q. In effect, are you using the universities to create more demand in the market for your products and services?

A. I think of it as shaping the market for the good of all businesses and society. The more we can bring technology and structured engineering thinking to bear on this increasingly complicated problem, the better off everyone will be. You're also creating the skills that are more and more required in the 21st century. The only way to improve the standard of living is through productivity gains. In advanced economies like those of the United States, Western Europe and Japan, perhaps 75 percent of the economy is services. You cannot really improve the productivity of the United States, for example, unless you tackle productivity in services.

Q. How much is I.B.M. spending on this?

A. We're investing $100 million a year, including grants and free access to I.B.M. hardware and software. That's up 30 percent over the past three years.

Q. Do you offer money in exchange for changes in curricula?

A. Usually we don't have to offer money. That is the last thing they need from us. They need real-world information. They say: ''Tell us about it. What are the real-world problems?''
 We're in dialogue with the University of California, Berkeley; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute; Georgia Tech; M.I.T., Oxford-Cambridge; Tsinghua University in China and others. We are encouraging them to start building courses and helping them in any way we can. Sometimes our own people can help them build curricula. There are times when our people are adjunct professors. By the way, that's been going on for a long time. At M.I.T., we have organized an innovation lecture series to bring to the university real case studies about the kinds of problems that exist in business, health care and government.

Q. Are other companies doing this?

A. Different companies call it different things. The members of the Council of Engineering Systems Universities (www.cesun.org.) are from all over the place -- the Air Force Institute of Technology, Carnegie Mellon University and Cornell University are members, for example. They all use totally different names. But they are all doing things that in my mind are in the general area of services sciences.

Q. Why should companies have any role in shaping what is taught in academia?

A. There is a long tradition of having a relationship between businesses and universities, particularly with engineering schools and business and management schools. Money is part of it. But increasingly what the universities want from industry is some of the concrete knowledge that they don't have. Universities are superb at the foundational courses. What they want is to make the theoretical become real. They want what they are teaching to come alive by having businesses share direct knowledge. We're working with some of the top universities in the world. Think of M.I.T. or Berkeley or Oxford. They have very strong feelings about how they develop their curricula. They are willing to take advice, but at the end of the day the faculties run their own show.

Q. Aren't you seeking a commercial advantage? Is this really a win for all parties?

A. You have to prepare people to innovate. Many companies, including I.B.M., find that an increasing portion of what they do is services. That's true for almost every company. If you want that company to become more productive and to improve its profitability and quality, you cannot ignore those processes that are services. Every company has to think about how do you apply tools and processes and disciplined thinking. It's not unlike what happened in manufacturing 25 years ago. Manufacturing is an example of how painful it is when a country does not take leadership in a particular area. I'm not sure that Detroit has ever recovered from that.

HEADLINE: A Breach of Manners Sets a Tough Town Atwitter

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
SENATOR-ELECT JIM WEBB was, perhaps, answering honestly when President Bush asked him at a White House reception how his son, serving in Iraq, was doing. 
 But it was not according to protocol, and Mr. Bush let him know.
''I'd like to get them out of Iraq, Mr. President,'' Mr. Webb replied. 
 ''I didn't ask you that,'' the president responded, according to accounts reported in The Washington Post and The Hill. ''I asked how your boy was doing.''
 The exchange had some people in Washington tut-tutting that the new senator who campaigned in his son's combat boots would have a lot of learnin' to do about the rules of polite Washington society -- never mind that Mr. Webb had served as secretary of the Navy, an institution built on protocol, in the Reagan White House. 
 The Post, looking at how his ''brash, unpolished style'' might test the limits, noted that on ''Meet the Press'' ''he dispensed with the normal banter with host Tim Russert to talk seriously about Iraq and the need for economic justice in the United States.'' Imagine!
 ''I'm surprised and offended by Jim Webb,'' said Stephen Hess, the author of ''The Little Book of Campaign Etiquette'' and a professor at George Washington University. ''If you accept somebody's invitation, you're expected to respond in socially acceptable ways. Why go to be rude? Is it so awful to be polite?
 ''He was secretary of the Navy, for heaven's sake!''
 Others laid the blame on Mr. Bush, believing he should not have sought out Mr. Webb, and not been short with him in response. 
 ''It was an uncivil reply to an uncivil remark,'' said Letitia Baldrige, a doyenne of Washington manners, calling the whole thing ''a sad exchange.''
 And even Mr. Hess had to admit the president was ''a little snippy'' in his response.
 It's true that Washington is a place predicated on protocol: where to stand, what to wear, what to say (or not to), and how to pretend to like people you don't. You can attack someone on television, but in the receiving line -- which Mr. Webb declined to go through -- you're supposed to smile as you clasp hands.
 Nancy Pelosi, the speaker-elect, campaigned against the president with sharp elbows, but she knew enough to cross her ankles and smile about extending ''the hand of friendship'' when the president invited her to lunch once her party won.
 The leader of the Senate Democrats, Harry Reid, likewise called the president a liar in the campaign, but sat beside him and smiled for the cameras after.
 The smallest deviation can upset the perceived order.
 Mr. Hess recalled that Clarence Randall, a steel executive who bitterly denounced President Harry S. Truman for seizing the steel mills during the Korean War, called him ''Mr. Truman'' instead of ''Mr. President'' in a meeting at the White House. Interviewing Mr. Randall years later, Mr. Hess said, ''It was still on his mind that he had done something very wrong.'' (At least Mr. Webb or ''the gentleman from Virginia'' as he will be known on the Senate floor, said the ''Mr. President'' part.)
 Decorum, its defenders say, serves a purpose. 
 ''It strikes me that Jim Webb may not be going to play by the rules, and eventually that will have a downside,'' Mr. Hess said. ''Is he going to do this with Harry Reid the first time they have a serious argument? It doesn't portend to being a very good colleague.''
 Judith Martin, who writes the syndicated column under the name Miss Manners, said that even discussions of war and life and death did not justify suspending the rules. ''On the contrary, diplomacy is what's supposed to stave off wars and other violence,'' she said. (She refused to comment on the Webb-Bush exchange, saying, ''It would be rude of me to declare an individual rude.'')
 Certainly, Mr. Webb, a Republican turned Democrat, is not the first to refuse to play along.
 Eartha Kitt, invited to the White House in 1968, used the occasion to criticize the Vietnam War. ''You send the best of this country off to be shot and maimed,'' she told Lady Bird Johnson. ''No wonder the kids rebel and take pot.'' (On criticizing the president in his own house, Ms. Baldrige quotes the French: ca ne se fait pas -- ''it is not done.'')
 Mr. Bush himself caused sniping among Clinton officials when, in a speech at his father's presidential library, he called his father ''a president who brought dignity and character and honor to the White House,'' in what was considered a pointed rebuke to President Bill Clinton, who sat listening.
 On the Senate floor, where jackets are still required and women were only recently allowed to wear pants instead of skirts, Vice President Dick Cheney told Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont to buzz off in far less printable terms. (The next year, when Mr. Cheney administered the oath of office to the senator, Mr. Leahy noted, ''It's better to be sworn in than sworn at.'')
 It has become routine to say that incivility has been on the rise since senators and members of Congress began spending less time in Washington, therefore developing less camaraderie. Many people blame the rise of cameras on the floor of the House and Senate for increasing acrimony.
 But students of history say incivility is as old as the republic. Richard Brookhiser, the author of ''Rules of Civility: The 110 Precepts That Guided Our First President in War and Peace,'' recounts how another president, James Monroe, was nearly attacked at the White House by his treasury secretary, William Crawford. 
 In a disagreement over some patronage appointments, Mr. Crawford raised his cane over his head: ''You damned infernal old scoundrel!'' To which Monroe responded by picking up a fireplace implement and threatening to have him removed from the premises. The two, Mr. Brookhiser said, never spoke again.
 As for Mr. Webb and Mr. Bush, it could have been worse. According to the account in The Hill, Mr. Webb's initial instinct about how to respond to the president was to slug him.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 3 about political etiquette in Washington, and the stir caused by blunt comments that Senator-elect Jim Webb of Virginia made to President Bush at a reception, misstated the way Mr. Webb will be addressed on the Senate floor by his colleagues. He will be ''the senator from Virginia'' -- not ''the gentleman from Virginia,'' which is used in the House, along with the ''gentle lady from.'' (Some senators use slight variations when addressing each other: the ''distinguished senator from'' or the ''junior'' or ''senior senator from.'')

HEADLINE: Hollywood's Multifaceted Cause du Jour

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
IN 1938 a memo sent to Harry Oppenheimer, whose family founded the De Beers diamond cartel, outlined a bold new advertising strategy: ''Motion pictures seldom include scenes showing the selection or purchase of an engagement ring to a girl. It would be our plan to contact scenario writers and directors and arrange for such scenes.''
 Ever since then, from Marilyn Monroe's baubles to J. Lo's rock, the diamond industry has used the reflected luster of celebrity to sell its wares, a shrewd marketing campaign that has helped to create a luxury business worth more than $60 billion a year.
Diamonds are love. Diamonds are a girl's best friend. Diamonds are forever. 
 Diamonds, obviously, are much more than that. They are big business. They are hardly rare. And they have been used to finance some of the most brutal warfare of the last two decades.
 It is those diamonds in particular -- known as conflict diamonds -- that have become a fashionable concern among entertainment figures, with stars ranging from Leonardo DiCaprio to Kanye West to Raekwon from the hip-hop collective Wu-Tang Clan speaking out about the need for consumer vigilance.
 Just as the power of the entertainment industry was harnessed to create a desire, it has now been turned around to spotlight the high cost of that desire.
 Next week the Warner Brothers film ''Blood Diamond'' will open in theaters across the country. Starring Mr. DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou, the tale is set against the backdrop of the chaos and carnage of the civil war that raged in the West African nation of Sierra Leone from 1991 until 2002. It was a war fought for control over the country's sizable diamond industry and paid for by the illegal export of its products.
 Sierra Leone is also the backdrop for ''Bling: A Planet Rock,'' a VH1 documentary scheduled for broadcast in February in which hip-hop stars are seen visiting Sierra Leone and speaking out about the issue. Another documentary, ''Blood Diamonds,'' to be shown on the History Channel on Dec. 23, looks back at the history of conflict diamonds, again highlighting West Africa.
 Finally, Sierra Leone's Refugee All-Stars, a band made up of musicians who fled the fighting, has just released its first album and is making its first tour of the United States, including an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show. 
 The diamond industry, well aware of the power of Hollywood image making, has taken notice. Through organizations like the World Diamond Council and the Diamond Information Center, the world's largest diamond merchants have begun a multimillion-dollar marketing campaign to offset any bad publicity. 
 The industry has enlisted some powerful allies, receiving help from no less a moral authority than Nelson Mandela, whose native South Africa is one of the world's largest diamond producers. He sent a letter to Alan F. Horn, the president of Warner Brothers, and the director Edward Zwick, saying it would be ''deeply regrettable'' if ''Blood Diamond'' led to the ''destabilization of African diamond producing countries.'' 
 Sally Morrison, a spokeswoman for the Diamond Information Center, said that when it came to that movie, the industry was worried ''that this story would not be placed in a historical context.''
 The campaign began in September as an effort to ''educate both consumers and the trade about important diamond-related issues,'' according to the World Diamond Council. In addition to placing full-page advertisements in 10 major newspapers, the diamond industry created a Web site, diamondfacts.org. Among other things, the industry stresses that under a 2003 agreement called the Kimberly Process, the major diamond merchants pledged to ensure that all diamonds entering the marketplace are monitored and verified. 
 In addition, Ms. Morrison said, diamond merchants have done their own outreach, contacting a range of people in Hollywood, from publicists to stylists, to help them understand the issues involved and the work that has been done to eliminate conflict diamonds from the marketplace. And she noted that they have worked with celebrities to show how diamond mining can help local economies in Africa. The impresario Russell Simmons, who started his own line of diamond-encrusted jewelry two years ago, is currently on an industry-organized trip to South Africa and Botswana to see how mining can have a positive impact. A similar trip was organized for the actress Ashley Judd last February. 
 The entertainment world's focus on conflict diamonds, and on Sierra Leone in particular, is in part deliberate and in part coincidental. But by far the project that is attracting the most attention is the coming Leonardo DiCaprio movie.
 Alex Yearsley, whose work with the nonprofit human rights organization Global Witness first helped spotlight the issue more than a decade ago, said that throughout much of the 1990s, when the worst abuses and atrocities were occurring, it was hard to get anyone to notice. ''The diamond industry plays an enormous role in the geopolitics of the region,'' Mr. Yearsley said. 
 Even the war in Sierra Leone, notorious for its brutality and the systematic severing of people's limbs by rebel soldiers, did not gain worldwide attention until the capital, Freetown, fell in 1999. As the war reached its climax, a script circulated in Hollywood that Mr. Zwick, the director of ''Blood Diamond,'' said involved the hunt for a diamond but was ''in the vein of an Indiana Jones movie.''
 As Mr. Zwick and his colleagues began to research the issue more deeply, he said, they were horrified by what they were learning. ''It is like a pebble thrown into the pond,'' he said. ''The ripples start to spread as they go out further.'' He said he decided instead to ''tell many of the truths'' of the war through a fictional movie, and brought in Mr. Yearsley and other experts on the diamond trade and the war as consultants. But Mr. Zwick said it was only when Mr. DiCaprio agreed to star that they got the green light for a big-budget movie. 
 Several other projects got under way following the end of the war in Sierra Leone, including the VH1 special. Its trailer shows graphic images of conflict -- children with limbs lopped off, a dead man on the ground with his heart ripped out -- juxtaposed with Western singers and rappers ostentatiously displaying their diamonds. (Last year Kanye West released the single ''Diamonds Are Forever'' but remade it as ''Diamonds From Sierra Leone'' after learning of the damage caused by the diamond trade.)
 But the documentary, which was made in partnership with the United Nations Development Project, does not dwell on the past. Instead, according to its director, Raquel Cepeda, the goal is to help countries like Sierra Leone realize more profits from their natural resources. 
 ''I am successful if I can get a rapper to talk about conflict-free diamonds,'' Ms. Cepeda said in an interview. ''We want to make social consciousness a cool thing to do when they are buying their diamonds.''
 To that end, she organized a tour of Sierra Leone with the reggaeton star Tego Calderon; Raekwon of Wu-Tang Clan; and the rapper Paul Wall, a designer of the diamond tooth caps fashionable among some rap stars. (The rapper Nas has also become involved with the issue, helping score the soundtrack for ''Blood Diamond.'')
 Where the VH1 movie focuses on the future, the History Channel documentary ''Blood Diamonds'' examines the historical role diamonds have played in fueling wars in West Africa and Angola. Like all those involved in the various projects, Bill Brummel, the executive producer of the film, said his goal was not to get people to boycott diamonds but to make them aware of the ''high human cost'' of conflict diamonds.
 That cost has been especially high in Sierra Leone, where many displaced people are even now fearful of returning to their homes, which the Refugee All-Stars are trying to encourage them to do. The band's infectiously hopeful music and powerfully personal lyrics caught the attention of Joe Perry of Aerosmith after he saw a 2002 documentary about the band. His interest helped bring the musicians to the United States, where they have opened for Aerosmith. 
 ''I believe that buying the diamonds illegally will cause trouble, and that is why Sierra Leone has been destroyed,'' Reuben Koroma, the All-Stars' lead singer and organizing force, said in an interview. ''But if these diamonds are bought legally, and the profits were used for the benefit for the nation, I think Sierra Leone would be very well off.'' Part of the problem, in Sierra Leone in particular, is that very little of the profit finds its way back to the people. The government officially gets a 3 percent commission on the rough stones, but since a diamond that sells for $5,000 in America typically comes from a rough stone worth about $500, that commission amounts to about $15.
 With all the focus on Sierra Leone and the worst aspects of the diamond trade, industry representatives recently approached the president of Sierra Leone, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, and asked him to speak out about the benefits of the diamond trade. He complained about how little his country still benefits from the stones and refused to cooperate, according to the Sierra Leone Broadcasting Service. 
 Rosalind Kainyah, the director of public affairs in America for De Beers Group, the world's leading diamond merchant, said her industry was focused on the future and empowering Africans, though ''in hindsight,'' she acknowledged, ''there could have been an earlier drive for a solution'' to the problem of conflict diamonds. 
 The intense lobbying effort illustrates what an awkward moment it is for an industry that has so carefully cultivated its Hollywood image. As Edward Jay Epstein noted in 1982 in his book ''The Rise and Fall of Diamonds,'' De Beers's advertising agency, N. W. Ayer, bragged in a 1940 report to its client that after ''a long series of conferences with Paramount officials, capped by your own efforts,'' it had ''succeeded in changing the title of a film from 'Diamonds Are Dangerous' to 'Adventures in Diamonds.' '' 
 The report also noted that the agency had gotten a scene inserted into the movie ''Skylark'' depicting Claudette Colbert selecting a diamond bracelet, and that in another film, 'That Uncertain Feeling,'' Merle Oberon wore $40,000 worth of diamond jewelry.
 In 1948 an Ayer copywriter came up with the slogan ''A diamond is forever.'' And by the time Marilyn Monroe performed ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend'' in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes'' five years later, the popular image of the diamond as the ultimate luxury item was set.
 Now, all these years later, the entertainment world is turning the tables, trying to highlight the hidden costs behind that glittery image while getting audiences to recognize that, as Mr. Zwick put it, ''Every time you put down your credit card, you are endorsing the way a corporation deals with the way it gets a resource from somewhere else.''

HEADLINE: Riding Spitzer's Coattails

BYLINE: By Gene Russianoff. 
Gene Russianoff is a senior lawyer for the New York Public Interest Research Group's Straphangers Campaign.

 BODY:
IN the past quarter-century, New York City and its suburbs have made great progress restoring the region's public transit system, whose subways, buses and commuter rail lines have benefited from more than $53 billion in investment since 1982. Improved mass transit has led to a rise in subway and bus ridership to 7.6 million on an average weekday -- a peak last seen in 1970. Riders now enjoy a range of fare discounts, including monthly passes that allow unlimited rides, reduced fares for buying in bulk and free transfers between subways and buses. 
 Moreover, for the first time in more than 60 years, an effort to expand the system is under way, with more than $1 billion in subway improvements scheduled for downtown Manhattan alone. 
Keeping this momentum going will be a critical task for Eliot Spitzer, the governor-elect. But it won't be easy. Financing for the current $21.3 billion, five-year transit rebuilding program faces an uncertain future, since it relies in part on dubious revenue projections like $1 billion expected by 2009 from the sale of land owned by the M.T.A. In addition, large deficits loom in the M.T.A.'s operating budget, starting at $805 million in 2008 and rising to $1.8 billion in 2010. 
 Mr. Spitzer will not be able to borrow his way out of this bind, as his predecessor did. Sixteen percent of the M.T.A.'s operating budget already goes to debt service; that will rise to 20 percent in 2009. The new governor will need a plan that enables him to shore up the current capital program, create a viable five-year plan to support the transit system from 2009 to 2013 and keep fares affordable and services reliable.
 Here's a roadmap.
 First, Mr. Spitzer should establish a productive environment by filling crucial transit posts with transportation professionals, not political cronies. (While top staff members at the M.T.A. and its operating agencies have been chosen largely on merit, board positions more often go to the politically connected.) He can also send a message to the system's diverse ridership by making diversity a priority in his appointments to the M.T.A. board.
 Mr. Spitzer should work to soothe the tension between transit management and labor, whose largest union is without a contract, by encouraging a fair labor agreement and by appointing a joint task force to foster better communication and, eventually, trust. 
 For transit riders, Mr. Spitzer can set the tone by frequently using public transportation himself, as Mayor Michael Bloomberg does. 
 Second, the new governor must hold the line on fares while continuing to invest in mass transit. Mr. Spitzer has rightly called fare increases a ''last resort.'' Future needs simply cannot be paid for primarily through the fare box. New York's subway and bus riders already shoulder one of the highest fare burdens in the nation, covering at least 44 percent of the cost of transportation. 
 A fare increase should be considered only as part of a comprehensive package that includes dedicated transit taxes and other fees. In the past, corporations, consumers, automobile drivers and other stakeholders have contributed to transportation revenue with earmarked taxes and fees. All these groups should rightly contribute because they all benefit from a mass transit system that fuels the region's economic growth and reduces traffic congestion.
 But given Mr. Spitzer's previously stated opposition to tax increases, other potential financing sources must also be considered. These include administrative savings; new motor vehicle and other traffic-related fees; maximizing revenue obtained through the sale of M.T.A. assets; and stopping the Albany shell game by which the state purports to contribute general funds to the M.T.A. in the form of already dedicated transit taxes.
 Third, Mr. Spitzer must move forward on major expansion projects while safeguarding the M.T.A.'s core rebuilding program. Transit advocates are heartened by Mr. Spitzer's public support for the Second Avenue Subway and for a connection between the Long Island Railroad and Grand Central Terminal. 
 Alongside these large capital programs, the new governor should support one more: Adopting ''bus rapid transit'' strategies. These consist largely of improvements to bus service, including surveillance cameras mounted on buses to deter automobiles from clogging bus lanes; priority for buses at traffic signals; pre-boarding fare payment at crowded stops; and lengthier, more ''bus friendly'' stops. The M.T.A.'s 2005-2009 capital plan includes more than $22 million for bus rapid transit pilot projects. If these projects are successful, Mr. Spitzer should increase those funds.
 Under no circumstances, however, should expansion projects go forward if that requires starving the budget for core maintenance -- from providing new subway cars to rehabilitating stations. 
 Finally, Mr. Spitzer must make the M.T.A. more accountable. In the wake of several scandals, the authority has taken steps to make decisions in a more open and transparent manner. But the M.T.A. needs real checks and balances. The new governor has the power to appoint a tough inspector general for the M.T.A., which has lacked aggressive oversight throughout the Pataki years. In addition, working with the Legislature, Mr. Spitzer can strengthen the budget office that oversees public authorities. The office is now on a short leash.
 The new governor will have many claims on his time and on state finances. As he establishes his priorities, however, he should keep in mind that transportation makes New York go round.

HEADLINE: Another New York Windfall

 BODY:
Halfway through the fiscal year, New York finds itself building up another big budget surplus -- at least $1.9 billion and almost certainly much more to come, thanks to a robust real estate market and big earnings on Wall Street. It's a cinch that any number of public officials are already mentally spending the extra money on any number of things, including tax cuts or pay raises for city workers. But if recent history is any indication, we can count on Mayor Michael Bloomberg to impose some fiscal realism. 
 Mr. Bloomberg wisely spurned a spending spree with most of the previous surplus and put $2 billion of it into a health care trust fund for municipal retirees, whose medical needs command an ever bigger piece of the city budgets. That, in turn, will help cover the city when it inevitably finds itself strapped in the future.
 His strategy also reflects a fact that can get lost when the word surplus gets everyone hyperventilating: the windfall is just that. Revenues from real estate transfers and personal and business taxes are up today, but may not be tomorrow. And while the city has been producing surpluses, budget gaps are sitting like speed bumps down the road -- the shortfall for fiscal 2009 is projected at $4 billion. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, started out in much the same way but lost much of his fiscal discipline during his second term in office. The hard economic times that followed the terror attacks of 2001 left Mr. Bloomberg with the extraordinary challenge of cutting billions of dollars in spending while trying to revive the local economy.
 By nearly any measure, Mr. Bloomberg can claim that mission accomplished. Unemployment is now at a record low 4.1 percent, with some of the best results coming in formerly distressed areas like the South Bronx, which has been a focus of the city's revival efforts. On the other end of the spectrum, Wall Street is expected to post profits approaching $15 billion, an increase of more than 50 percent from last year.
 Both the mayor and the City Council will need to resist cries for immediate gratification, especially if the spending could turn into permanent obligations that would burden the city for years to come. Paying down debt and other future commitments should be the city's foremost consideration.

HEADLINE: Riding Spitzer's Coattails

 BODY:
IN the past quarter-century, New York City and its suburbs have made great progress restoring the region's public transit system, whose subways, buses and commuter rail lines have benefited from more than $53 billion in investment since 1982. 
 Improved mass transit has led to a rise in subway and bus ridership to 7.6 million on an average weekday -- a peak last seen in 1970. Riders now enjoy a range of fare discounts, including monthly passes for unlimited rides, reduced fares for buying in bulk and free transfers between subways and buses. 
Moreover, for the first time in more than 60 years, an effort to expand the system is under way, with more than $1 billion in subway improvements scheduled for downtown Manhattan alone.
 Keeping this momentum going will be a critical task for Eliot Spitzer, the governor-elect. It won't be easy. The current $21.3 billion, five-year transit rebuilding program faces an uncertain future, since it relies in part on dubious revenue projections like $1 billion expected by 2009 from the sale of land owned by the M.T.A. In addition, large deficits loom in the M.T.A.'s operating budget, starting at $805 million in 2008 and rising to $1.8 billion in 2010.

HEADLINE: As Trucking Rules Are Eased, a Debate on Safety Intensifies

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON; Ron Nixon contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
As Dorris Edwards slowed for traffic near Kingdom City, Mo., on her way home from a Thanksgiving trip in 2004, an 18-wheeler slammed into her Jeep Cherokee.
 The truck crushed the sport-utility vehicle and shoved it down an embankment off Interstate 70. Ms. Edwards, 62, was killed.
The truck driver accepted blame for the accident, and Ms. Edwards's family filed a lawsuit against the driver and the trucking company. 
 In the course of pursuing its case, the family broached a larger issue: whether the Bush administration's decision to reject tighter industry regulation and instead reduce what officials viewed as cumbersome rules permitted a poorly trained trucker to stay behind the wheel, alone, instead of resting after a long day of driving. 
 After intense lobbying by the politically powerful trucking industry, regulators a year earlier had rejected proposals to tighten drivers' hours and instead did the opposite, relaxing the rules on how long truckers could be on the road. That allowed the driver who hit Ms. Edwards to work in the cab nearly 12 hours, 8 of them driving nonstop, which he later acknowledged had tired him.
 Government officials had also turned down repeated requests from insurers and safety groups for more rigorous training for new drivers. The driver in the fatal accident was a rookie on his first cross-country trip; his instructor, a 22-year-old with just a year of trucking experience, had been sleeping in a berth behind the cab much of the way.
 Federal officials, while declining to comment about the Edwards accident, have dismissed the assertion that deregulation has reduced safety and have maintained that in fact it has helped, though the Edwards family and many other victims of accidents have come to the opposite conclusion.
 In loosening the standards, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration was fulfilling President Bush's broader pledge to free industry of what it considered cumbersome rules. In the last six years, the White House has embarked on the boldest strategy of deregulation in more than a generation. Largely unchecked by the Republican-led Congress, federal agencies, often led by former industry officials, have methodically reduced what they see as inefficient, outdated regulations and have delayed enforcement of others. The Bush administration says those efforts have produced huge savings for businesses and consumers.
 Those actions, though, have provoked fierce debate about their benefits and risks. The federal government's oversight of the trucking industry is a case study of deregulation, as well as the difficulty of determining an exact calculus of its consequences. Though Ms. Edwards's family and the industry disagree on whether the motor carrier agency's actions contributed to her death, her accident illuminates crucial issues in regulating America's most treacherous industry, as measured by overall deaths and injuries from truck accidents. 
 The loosened standards, supporters say, have made it faster and cheaper to move goods across the country. They also say the changes promote safety; without longer work hours, the industry would be forced to put more drivers with little experience behind the wheel. Regulators and industry officials point out that the death toll of truck-related accidents -- about 5,000 annually -- has not increased, while the fatality rate, the number of deaths per miles traveled, has continued a long decline. The number of annual injuries has also been dropping slowly, falling to 114,000 last year. 
 ''This administration has done a good job, and the agency has done a good job, in advancing safety issues in a manner that takes into account all the important factors of our industry,'' said the top lobbyist for the American Trucking Associations, Timothy P. Lynch. 
 But advocates of tighter rules say the administration's record of loosening standards endangers motorists. The fatality rate for truck-related accidents remains nearly double that involving only cars, safety and insurance groups say. They note that weakening the rules has reversed a course set by the Clinton administration and has resulted in the federal government repeatedly missing its own targets for reducing the death rate.
 ''It is a frustrating disappointment that has led to a tragic era,'' said David F. Snyder, an assistant general counsel at the American Insurance Association who follows the trucking industry closely. ''The losses continue to pile up at a high rate. There has been a huge missed opportunity.''

An Industry's Influence
 In decisions that had the support of the White House, the motor carrier agency has eased the rules on truckers' work hours, rejected proposals for electronic monitoring to combat widespread cheating on drivers' logs and resisted calls for more rigorous driver training. 
 While applauded by the industry, those decisions have been subject to withering criticism by federal appeals court panels in Washington who say they ignore government safety studies and put the industry's economic interests ahead of public safety.
 To advance its agenda, the Bush administration has installed industry officials in influential posts.
 Before Mr. Bush entered the White House, he selected Duane W. Acklie, a leading political fund-raiser and chairman of the American Trucking Associations, and Walter B. McCormick Jr., the group's president, to serve on the Bush-Cheney transition team on transportation matters.
 Mr. Bush then appointed Michael P. Jackson, a former top official at the trucking associations, as deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation. To lead the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the president picked Joseph M. Clapp, the former chairman of Roadway, a trucking company, and the leader of an industry foundation that sponsored research claiming fatigue was not a factor in truck accidents, a conclusion at odds with government and academic studies.
 And David S. Addington, a former trucking industry official who led an earlier fight against tougher driving limits, became legal counsel and later chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, an advocate of easing government regulations. 
 In addition to supplying prominent administration officials, the trucking industry has provided some of the Republican party's most important fund-raisers. From 2000 to 2006, the industry directed more than $14 million in campaign contributions to Republicans. Its donations and lobbying fees -- about $37 million from 2000 to 2005 -- led to rules that have saved what industry officials estimate are billions of dollars in expenses linked to tougher regulations.
 But to the families of accident victims, the motor carrier agency has failed to fulfill a promise to significantly reduce fatalities, exacting a tragic personal price. 
 ''They are not getting much done in Washington,'' said Daphne Izer of Maine, who founded Parents Against Tired Truckers in 1994 after a Wal-Mart driver fell asleep at the wheel of his rig, killing her son and three other teenagers in the car with him. ''As a result, more people will continue to die.''
 Federal regulators disagree with that assessment of their performance. ''We have made significant progress, yet much work remains to achieve our vision,'' said David H. Hugel, the new deputy administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration. ''Our challenges also are increasing because our nation maintains the most extensive and complex transportation system in the world, and that system and number of people who use it continues to grow.'' 
 The federal government began overseeing the trucking industry in the 1930s, setting rates, limiting competition and regulating safety practices. From the start, companies won important concessions from Washington, including exemptions from minimum wage and other labor laws. The industry also resisted efforts to impose tougher safety standards, saying it could police itself. 
 In 1937, the first driving hour limits were set. Truckers were allowed drive up to 10 continuous hours but were required to rest for a minimum of 8 hours. The remaining six hours could be used for other work activities, like loading, or for breaks or meals. Truckers could drive up to 60 hours over 7 consecutive days, or 70 hours over 8 days. To enforce those rules, the government required drivers to keep logs.
 Repeated efforts over the years to tighten the rules were blocked, often as a result of vigorous industry lobbying. 
 Trucking companies have long argued that tougher standards are not necessary to promote safety, and that they would cause devastating economic pressures. Profit margins in the industry are thin, particularly after economic deregulation in 1980 prompted competition. Long hours and low pay for drivers have led to high turnover, and carriers struggle to find replacements. Those conditions, safety experts say, have contributed to widespread safety problems. 
 The practice of falsifying driver hours is an open secret in the industry; truckers routinely refer to their logs as ''comic books.'' Fines are small. The federal motor carrier agency does not have the staff to monitor closely 700,000 businesses and almost eight million trucks.
 Timothy L. Unrine, a 41-year-old driver from Virginia, said in a recent interview that he was taught to conceal excessive driving hours during training last January by his former employer, Boyd Brothers Transportation of Birmingham, Ala. Mr. Unrine said his orientation instructor told his class that government inspectors were allowed to examine a monthly logbook if it was bound. But if the staples were removed, the log was considered ''loose leaf'' and inspectors could require an examination of only those pages from the most recent seven days, Mr. Unrine said the drivers were told. 
 Company officials advised drivers to use fuel credit cards that recorded only the date, not the time, of the fuel stop, he said.
 Mr. Unrine added that the company pushed him to work longer hours than permitted, and that his logbooks were ''adjusted'' many times to make it appear he was within the limits. Several times, when he told a dispatcher he was too tired to make another trip, he said, he was ordered to do so after just a few hours' sleep.
 ''I never felt safe driving under these conditions,'' said Mr. Unrine, who left Boyd last June because of a legal dispute over medical bills from a fall. ''I talked to many drivers on the fuel islands, truck stops and rest areas. Logbooks are so fake; it scares me that there aren't more accidents on the road.'' 
 Richard Bailey, the chief operating officer at Boyd Brothers, and Wayne Fiquett, the company's vice president for safety, disputed Mr. Unrine's claims. They said that drivers might have been instructed to keep only seven days of log entries, but denied that they were encouraged to violate the rules.
 ''Nobody here will tell someone to do something unsafe,'' Mr. Fiquett said. ''If a driver is tired or over his hours, the system will not allow that driver to continue driving.''
 In 1995, Congress directed regulators to study truck driver fatigue and its safety consequences and to consider new rules. But the agency then charged with truck safety, the Federal Highway Administration, never did so. Two years later, the Clinton administration vowed to cut the annual death toll of truck-related accidents in half within a decade. In 1999, Congress created the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in response to what lawmakers considered ineffectual regulation and high casualties.
 A year later, the agency proposed tighter service hour rules. They would allow long-haul drivers to work a maximum of 12 hours a day, and require them to take 10-hour breaks between shifts. They also required installation of electronic devices to replace driver logs. 
 Advocates of tighter standards said the rules did not go far enough, while the industry said cutting driver hours could raise costs by $19 billion over a decade, five times more than government estimates. Action stalled when trucking lobbyists inserted language into a spending bill that forced the motor carrier agency to delay action until after the presidential election that November. 

Rewriting the Rules
 Industry leaders overwhelmingly supported the candidacy of George W. Bush, confident that his administration would be friendlier than one led by his opponent, Al Gore. On the campaign trail, Mr. Bush accused his Democratic rival of wanting to expand government, while Mr. Bush repeatedly expressed his desire to reduce federal regulations. 
 During the 2000 election cycle, trucking executives and political action committees gave more than $4.3 million in donations to the Republicans and less than $1 million to Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research organization.
 In the months before and after the election, a leading industry figure in the campaign against tighter driving rules was Mr. Acklie, who became chairman of the American Trucking Associations in the fall of 2000. A longtime Bush family friend and Republican fund-raiser, he led one of nation's largest trucking companies, Crete Carrier, based in Nebraska. Mr. Acklie, who stepped down from the post about a year after his appointment, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
 Another important advocate was Mr. Addington, then general counsel to the Trucking Associations. In August 2000, when two top transportation officials complained in a press release about the industry's ''raw use of political power,'' he demanded that they be investigated for possibly violating a federal law that prohibits officials from lobbying and issuing propaganda. In January 2001, he joined Mr. Cheney's office, where he is now chief of staff. Lea Anne McBride, the vice president's spokeswoman, said Mr. Addington had not been involved in issues related to his trucking activities.
 Other industry officials also joined the administration. Mr. Jackson, a former colleague of Mr. Acklie and Mr. Addington at the trucking group, became the No. 2 official at the Transportation Department, which oversees the industry. Mr. Clapp, the former head of Roadway trucking, took over the motor carrier agency and soon became involved in rewriting the rules.
 The insurance industry and safety groups provided studies showing a high percentage of accidents were caused by tired truck drivers. But after the Trucking Associations produced a study concluding that only 2 percent of accidents were caused by fatigued truckers, while more than 80 percent were caused by passenger cars, the agency decided to loosen the hourly restrictions.
 In April 2003, the agency issued rules that increased the maximum driving hours to 77 from 60 over 7 consecutive days and to 88 hours from 70 over 8 consecutive days. It capped daily work hours at 14, which included driving as well as waiting for loading and unloading. The agency also decided not to require truck companies to install electronic monitoring devices.
 The agency said the new rules would modestly decrease the number of fatalities by increasing the required time off for drivers, to 10 hours from 8. A year later, the agency set training standards for new drivers: 10 hours of training, none of it on the road. 
 Congress has provided little scrutiny of the trucking standards.
 ''There has not been the kind of in-depth examination of these issues that should have occurred,'' said Representative James L. Oberstar of Minnesota, the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Mr. Oberstar and others blamed the failure on the political muscle of the industry. From 2000 to 2004, the American Trucking Associations donated $2 million to lawmakers, mostly to Republicans who served on committees with jurisdiction over trucking issues. 
 The courts have played a more significant role. In July 2004, a three-judge panel from the federal appeals court in Washington issued a harsh opinion in a lawsuit brought by several safety organizations over the trucking work rules.
 Judge David B. Sentelle, a conservative Republican appointed by President Ronald Reagan, wrote the opinion, faulting the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for ''ignoring its own evidence that fatigue causes many truck accidents.''
 The opinion continued, ''The agency admits that studies show that crash risk increases, in the agency's words, 'geometrically' after the eighth hour on duty.'' The judges said they could not understand why the agency had not estimated the benefits of electronic monitoring, saying the agency's ''passive regulatory approach'' probably did not comply with the law. The panel struck down the hour and service rules.
 But a year later, in August 2005, the agency issued virtually identical rules, which the safety groups and the Teamsters union are again challenging in court. Oral arguments are set for Monday before another three-judge federal appeals panel here. The agency had a similar legal setback on driver training. A three-member appeals court panel called the regulation ''baffling'' and criticized the agency for ignoring its own studies on the need for more comprehensive training.
 The agency has not responded to the court's decision by issuing any new rules. 
 Meanwhile, the agency has failed, by growing margins, to meet its annual targets for lowering the death rate for truck-related accidents. 
 Mr. Hugel, the agency's deputy administrator, blames increasing traffic for the agency's inability to meet its goals. ''More trucks, combined with even more passenger vehicles,'' he said, ''leads to more roadway congestion, increased risk and a larger number of fatalities.'' 
 In a budget submission to Congress last February, though, the Transportation Department noted its repeated failure to cut the death rate and conceded that the agency ''has difficulty demonstrating how its regulatory activities contribute to reaching its safety goal.''
 Safety experts, for their part, say the numbers reflect the agency's failings.
 ''The fatalities speak to the agency's lackluster performance,'' said Jacqueline S. Gillan, vice president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an alliance of consumer, health and insurance organizations. ''These truck crashes happen one at a time in communities across the country and get little attention,'' Ms. Gillan said. ''Can you imagine what the outcry would be at the F.A.A. if we had 25 major airplane crashes a year, which is the equivalent of what is happening with trucks?''

A Family's Lawsuit
 After Ms. Edwards's death, her only son, Steve, a professional musician in Chicago, sued the trucking company, Werner Enterprises of Omaha, and the driver involved in the accident, John L. McNeal, 36. Mr. McNeal was dismissed shortly after the accident. 
 Mr. McNeal said in a sworn deposition that he had been tired from driving all day from Tennessee without a break. He had been in the cab for about 12 hours, including about 8 hours at the wheel. Because he had been driving trucks professionally for only a month, he was assigned a trainer, who had slept much of the trip.
 After Mr. McNeal acknowledged he was at fault, Werner Enterprises settled the lawsuit for $2.4 million. Werner's general counsel, Richard S. Reiser, said that the company had a strong safety record and that its training program far exceeded the federal requirements. Mr. Reiser said that Mr. McNeal was in compliance with both the old and new work hour rules but acknowledged he was unfamiliar with the proposals by safety groups that would have prevented the driver from working as long as he did that day. He also said that any driver who was tired should stop, regardless of how long he had been on the road. 
 ''The driver should be the one who says, 'If I'm tired, I should pull over,' '' Mr. Reiser said. 
 Mr. Edwards, though, thinks responsibility for safety goes beyond individual drivers, and links his mother's death to the Bush administration's decisions against imposing tighter driving limits. ''These drivers are working hard every day on the road to make a living,'' he said. ''They are overtired and underpaid.'' 
 Mr. Edwards said his mother, who had worked at a Procter & Gamble Company factory before her weakened knees forced her to retire, had been looking forward to traveling, gardening and playing with her grandchildren.
 ''If there is any silver lining, it is that he hit her so hard she never saw it coming,'' Mr. Edwards said of the accident. ''She probably was happy that she was going to be home soon.''

Loosening the Rules
 This is the first in a series of articles examining the effects of the Bush administration's deregulation strategy, which has repealed enforcement or completion of hundreds of federal rules.

HEADLINE: Rumsfeld Memo Proposed 'Major Adjustment' in Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and DAVID S. CLOUD; James Glanz contributed reporting from Baghdad.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Two days before he resigned as defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld submitted a classified memo to the White House that acknowledged that the Bush administration's strategy in Iraq was not working and called for a major course correction.
 ''In my view it is time for a major adjustment,'' wrote Mr. Rumsfeld, who has been a symbol of a dogged stay-the-course policy. ''Clearly, what U.S. forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough.''
Nor did Mr. Rumsfeld seem confident that the administration would readily develop an effective alternative. To limit the political fallout from shifting course, he suggested the administration consider a campaign to lower public expectations.
 ''Announce that whatever new approach the U.S. decides on, the U.S. is doing so on a trial basis,'' he wrote. ''This will give us the ability to readjust and move to another course, if necessary, and therefore not 'lose.' '' 
 ''Recast the U.S. military mission and the U.S. goals (how we talk about them) -- go minimalist,'' he added. The memo suggests frustration with the pace of turning over responsibility to the Iraqi authorities; in fact, the memo calls for examination of ideas that roughly parallel troop withdrawal proposals presented by some of the White House's sharpest Democratic critics. [Text, Page 28.]
 The memo's discussion of possible troop reduction options offers a counterpoint to Mr. Rumsfeld's frequent public suggestions that discussions about force levels are driven by requests from American military commanders. 
 It also puts on the table several ideas for troop redeployments or withdrawals, even as there have been recent pronouncements from American commanders emphasizing the need to maintain troop levels for the time being.
 The memorandum sometimes has a finger-wagging tone, as Mr. Rumsfeld says that the Iraqis must ''pull up their socks,'' and suggests that reconstruction aid should be withheld in violent areas to avoid rewarding ''bad behavior.'' 
 Other options called for shrinking the number of bases, establishing benchmarks that would mark the Iraqis' progress toward political, economic and security goals and conducting a ''reverse embeds'' program to attach Iraqi soldiers to American squads.
 The memo was finished one day after President Bush interviewed Robert M. Gates, the president of Texas A&M University, as a potential successor to Mr. Rumsfeld and one day before the midterm elections. By then it was clear that the Republicans appeared likely to suffer a setback at the polls and that the administration was poised to begin reconsidering its Iraq strategy. 
 The memo provides no indication that Mr. Rumsfeld intended to leave his Pentagon post. It is unclear whether he knew at that point that he was about to be replaced, though the White House has said that Mr. Bush and Mr. Rumsfeld had a number of conversations on the matter. 
 Told that The New York Times had obtained a copy of it, a Pentagon spokesman, Eric Ruff, confirmed its authenticity. ''As it became clear that people were considering options for the way forward, the secretary had some views on the subject, and this memo reflects those views,'' he said.
 At the Pentagon, Mr. Rumsfeld has been famous for his ''snowflakes'' -- memos that drift down to the bureaucracy from on high and that are used to ask questions, stimulate debate and shape policy. Mr. Rumsfeld's Nov. 6 memorandum, circulated as part of the administration's review of Iraq policy, is written in that spirit and with the same blunt aphorisms that Mr. Rumsfeld frequently uses in public.
 Unlike the lawyerly memo on Iraq policy submitted Nov. 8 by Stephen J. Hadley, the national security adviser, Mr. Rumsfeld's listed more than a dozen ''illustrative options'' that the defense secretary did not endorse, but suggested merited serious consideration. ''Many of these options could, and in a number of cases, should be done in combination with others,'' Mr. Rumsfeld advised.
 With Mr. Rumsfeld's resignation, the options no longer have the same weight. In recent weeks, some have been discarded as the Bush administration tries to adjust its military and political strategy in Iraq. But others, like increasing the number of advisers attached to Iraqi forces, live on and have also been recommended by others.
 Mr. Rumsfeld, who has presided over two wars and is one of the longest-serving Pentagon chiefs, is scheduled to leave when his designated successor, Mr. Gates, is confirmed by the Senate, expected later this month.
 Titled ''Iraq -- Illustrative New Courses of Action,'' the memo reflects mounting concern over a war that, as Mr. Rumsfeld put it, has evolved from ''major combat operations to counterterrorism, to counterinsurgency, to dealing with death squads and sectarian violence.''
 The first section of the memo contains two pages of options that Mr. Rumsfeld describes as ''above the line'' ideas worthy of consideration. Some that Mr. Rumsfeld found intriguing appear to reflect his long-held view that the United States should use relatively modest force in intervening in foreign countries to avoid creating a dependency on American power. That approach, critics have charged, left the United States unprepared to deal with the chaos that followed the ouster of Saddam Hussein.
 Mr. Rumsfeld has frequently emphasized the difficulty of stabilizing Iraq and the need to turn over responsibility to Iraqi authorities as quickly as possible. But he has also been a forceful, even cantankerous, defender of American policy, often insisting his critics were unduly pessimistic. On Oct. 31, just a week before finishing the memo, Mr. Rumsfeld told a radio interviewer, ''I feel that we are making good progress with the piece of it the Defense Department has.'' 
 One option Mr. Rumsfeld offered calls for modest troop withdrawals ''so Iraqis know they have to pull up their socks, step up and take responsibility for their country.''
 Another option calls for redeploying American troops from ''vulnerable positions'' in Baghdad and other cities to safer areas in Iraq or Kuwait, where they would act as a ''quick reaction force.'' That idea is similar to a plan suggested by Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat, a plan that the White House has soundly rebuffed.
 Still another option calls for consolidating the number of American bases in Iraq to 5 from 55 by July 2007, a considerable shrinking of the American footprint. At the same time, Mr. Rumsfeld all but dismisses the idea of setting a firm date for removing forces from Iraq, listing it as one of the less palatable ideas.
 One of the more provocative options would punish provinces that failed to cooperate with the Americans by withdrawing economic assistance and security. ''Stop rewarding bad behavior, as was done in Falluja when they pushed in reconstruction funds, and start rewarding good behavior,'' the option reads. ''No more reconstruction assistance in areas where there is violence.''
 Some military officers have said that the idea of denying assistance in some areas ignores the fact that many Iraqis are afraid to cooperate with the Americans for fear of retaliation by insurgents. 
 Falluja has been the focus of reconstruction efforts following an offensive by Americans that crippled city services and damaged scores of buildings, leaving the United States few options beyond rebuilding or evacuating the city. Now, it is considered by the Marines to be one of the few relatively stable areas in the dangerous Anbar Province. Many of the other towns in the region have become even more hostile because the economic assistance has been minimal, leaving the residents feeling neglected by the authorities in Baghdad, military officers say. 
 Then, too, work on infrastructure that sprawls across the country, like the electrical grid and the oil pipelines, network, cannot be limited to nonviolent areas. 
 ''There is an element of throwing in the towel and effectively giving up on at least some areas of the country,'' said James Dobbins, a former State Department official and director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at RAND.
 In any case, administration officials indicated this week that withholding assistance was not under serious consideration.
 Reflecting exasperation with much of the American government, another option in the memo raises the possibility of using military reservists to ''beef up'' the Iraqi government's ministries. ''Give up on trying to get other USG Departments to do it,'' he writes, referring to other United States government agencies.
 Taking a leaf out of Mr. Hussein's book, Mr. Rumsfeld seemed to see some merit in the former dictator's practice of paying Iraqi leaders. ''Provide money to key political and religious leaders (as Saddam Hussein did), to get them to help us get through this difficult period,'' one option reads.
 The list of favored options notably does not mention the ''clear, hold and build'' approach that the White House has touted as its strategy for waging counterinsurgency. That is a troop-intensive approach that calls for clearing contested areas with American and Iraqi troops, holding them with American and Iraqi forces and then carrying out reconstruction programs to win support. Nor does the list make the withdrawal of American forces explicitly contingent on improving conditions in Iraq.
 The final page of the memo is a brief list of six ''less attractive'' options, which Mr. Rumsfeld describes as ''below the line.'' They include an ''aggressive federalism plan,'' an international conference modeled on the Dayton accords that produced an agreement on Bosnia and an idea that is currently being seriously discussed by senior administration officials: temporarily sending 20,000 additional American forces or more to Baghdad to try to improve security there and regain momentum.
 Moving a large fraction of American forces to Baghdad to ''attempt to control it,'' Mr. Rumsfeld writes without further elaboration, would be ''below the line.''

Defense Official to Resign
 WASHINGTON, Dec. 2 (Agence France-Presse) -- The Defense Department's top intelligence official will resign at the end of the year, the Pentagon has announced.
 Stephen A. Cambone, under secretary of defense for intelligence, is the most senior Pentagon official to announce he is leaving since Mr. Rumsfeld tendered his resignation last month. Mr. Cambone is one of the last members of the original team that came to the Pentagon with Mr. Rumsfeld in January 2001.
 Mr. Cambone has been a key player in Mr. Rumsfeld's efforts to transform the military into a lighter, high-tech force, and in carving out a larger role for American military intelligence.
 The Defense Department expanded espionage and other covert intelligence gathering activities under Mr. Cambone, drawing criticism from some members of Congress that the department was intruding on turf traditionally dominated by the C.I.A.

HEADLINE: Denver Tries to Sell New Look to Democrats

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: DENVER, Dec. 2 

 BODY:
In the competition between Denver and New York City to play host to the Democratic Party's presidential nominating convention in 2008, Denver officials readily admit to being the new kids on the block.
 New York, they say, has advantages in fund-raising, experience in running national conventions and a track record of success for the Democrats. The last two Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Bill Clinton in 1992, both strode onto the big stage in New York. Denver last held a convention in 1908, and the nominee, William Jennings Bryan, a Democrat, was trounced by William Howard Taft.
But if Denver prevails this time -- a decision is expected by the end of the year -- party members from around the country say it will probably be by virtue of a polished and highly organized effort to turn the city's lemons into lemonade. A new location, Denver's convention-bid organizers have argued to the party hierarchy, is precisely what the Democrats need. 
 The Rocky Mountain West, they say, is competitive politically and could decide the next presidency, with ranks of disaffected Republicans ripe for the picking and resurgent Democrats ready to be mobilized.
 New and newly empowered Democrats across the region, like Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who vaulted to majority leader with last month's election, and Senator-elect Jon Tester of Montana, whose election helped swing the chamber, have been enlisted to cheer for Denver as well. A Western convention, they say, would bring recognition to a part of the country long taken for granted as the parties focused on the Midwest and the South.
 Some political experts question whether the traditionally Republican West is really up for grabs. Frustration with the Iraq war and the big budget deficits run up by Republicans in Washington in recent years, they say, may have made the Democrats a temporary fling for Western voters in the last few elections rather than a permanent love.
 And New York has some powerful allies, including both its Democratic senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has said she favors the city because it is the best choice for the party and the economy of her state, not because it might be a nice place for a nomination. Technical issues, including transportation, security and the size of the hotels will weigh heavily on the decision too, and could come down in New York's favor. 
 But party members across the country say that there is no doubt that Denver has hit on a potent combination of economic development goals and political ambition. A convention with 30,000 eating, drinking, hotel-room-using Democratic partiers and journalists would inject perhaps $160 million into the local economy, organizers say, and at the same time crown the city as an unquestioned capital of the interior West -- and the two goals are in sync.
 ''A convention can provide a stage to introduce the nominee in a way that gets the country's attention and tells a story,'' said Debbie Willhite, a longtime Democratic strategist who came here earlier this year to run Denver's bid as executive director. ''And the networks can't come in here without showing the broad plains and Rocky Mountains -- that's a very big stage.''
 A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee, Karen Finney, said the final decision would be based on many factors.
 ''Logistics, fund-raising, the political questions -- these are all factors that go into the decision, all of which are important,'' Ms. Finney said. ''Our end goal is to have the best convention possible.''
 Money is probably Denver's biggest hurdle. Running a national political convention costs about $80 million, of which the host city must raise about $55 million. Denver bid officials believe they are close to that, including more than $12.5 million in cash and in-kind corporate donations just this week, and $5 million to $10 million more that Democratic governors in nearby states have said they could draw from local contributors.
 Party members say that last month's election probably bolstered Denver's hopes by underscoring the political argument about a Western realignment and thus making it easier to raise money. 
 Democrats made gains in Montana, in Mr. Tester's election, and here in Colorado, where the election of Bill Ritter as governor put Democrats in charge of the executive and legislative branches of state government for the first time since 1960. The state's junior senator, Ken Salazar, a Democrat who was elected in 2004, has also become a standard-bearer for Hispanic voters, especially in the Southwest.
 ''It would be a mistake to have it in New York,'' Mr. Salazar said. ''The Rocky Mountain West and the Southwest are key parts of the new direction for the Democratic Party, so if it's just on the merits, there's no question that it should be held in Denver.''
 Not too surprisingly, Mr. Schumer disagreed. ''The West is an important region,'' he said. I wouldn't deny that. But we ought to have the city that's best for the convention, and I think New York is it.''

HEADLINE: Seeking Clarity On Inflation

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IS inflation getting a second wind? 
 If you look at bond yields and economic reports like one on Friday that showed weakness in manufacturing, you may not think so. But other evidence may be more worrisome. 
Economic growth and inflation often go hand in hand. Some recent reports have shown a bit of resilience in the housing market and an upward revision to the calculation of third-quarter economic output.
 Plainly spelling out the risks, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said in a speech last week that inflation remained ''uncomfortably high.'' 
 None of this has lifted rates on 10-year Treasury notes, which yield less than 4.5 percent, versus short-term rates above 5 percent. 
 John Lynch, chief market analyst at Evergreen Investments, attributes the strength in Treasuries to investors' faith in Mr. Bernanke and his ability to curb growth enough to keep inflation in check.
 That faith will be tested on Friday, when November jobs data is announced. It is a test that Mr. Lynch expects him to pass. A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that the economy added 100,000 jobs last month, up from 92,000 in October, with unemployment rising to 4.5 percent from 4.4 percent. Mr. Lynch sees a gain of 100,000 to 125,000 net new jobs.
 The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits has been running high, he noted. ''Claims have started to creep up in the last several weeks,'' he said.
 He added that the unemployment rate was anything but indicative of a more severe slump that would send bond yields even lower. ''It's hard to have a recession if 95 percent-plus of us are working,'' he said.
 A soft landing may not push bond yields much lower or help stocks much, either. Earnings growth is likely to slow with the economy, and that should limit percentage gains in share prices, to the high single digits next year, Mr. Lynch predicted. 

DATA WATCH -- The Bloomberg poll forecasts a dip in the November reading of the Institute for Supply Management's survey of the service economy, to 55.5 from 57.1; that report is due Tuesday. The University of Michigan's first reading of consumer sentiment in December, due Friday, is predicted to show a slight drop to 92, down from 92.1.

HEADLINE: In a Diner, Chewing the Fat and Burying the Dead

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Even the mathematically challenged are likely to appreciate the impassioned arithmetic of ''Two Trains Running,'' August Wilson's play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans in 1969. Numbers seem to shimmy from the mouths of the characters in this 1992 drama, which has been given a rough-edged revival by the Signature Theater Company.
 Ages, street addresses, dates and the prices of items as varied as a dish of beans, a .45 pistol and a gold-plated casket: people are forever comparing and adding up figures in the dying Pittsburgh diner that is the setting for ''Two Trains Running.''
 They are calculations meant to assess the worth of a black man in a white man's world, and the sums arrived at have the impact of a sustained wail of frustration, sorrow and spirited defiance. As the production that opened last night at the Peter Norton Space reminds us, Mr. Wilson, who died last year, had a singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues. 
 ''Two Trains Running,'' directed by Lou Bellamy, is the second of three productions in a Signature season devoted to Mr. Wilson, and it is in many ways the most ambitious. The company's first offering was a triumphant interpretation of ''Seven Guitars,'' and its last will be ''King Hedley II'' (opening Feb. 22): plays that reach for the heightened emotions and violent resolutions of classical tragedy. Talk is king in these works, as it always is with Mr. Wilson, but there is resonant dramatic action too.
 In contrast ''Two Trains'' stays firmly in a discursive mode. Along with the amiable ''Jitney,'' it is the least eventful of the 10 works that make up Mr. Wilson's great chronicle of the African-American experience in the 20th century. 
 The fiery eruptions of the age of the black power movement are reflected only obliquely in the down-home debate and storytelling that is the daily special at the diner owned by Memphis (Frankie Faison) in the Hill District of Pittsburgh. This was a daring artistic choice on Mr. Wilson's part, but it pays off in a rich societal portrait that conveys both how much and how little life has changed on the Hill since the 20th century began.
 Even more than with most of Mr. Wilson's work, the success of any production of ''Two Trains'' relies on intricately synchronized ensemble work, on a percolating give-and-take among the performers that evokes the savvy looseness of a top-flight jazz band. In the critics' preview I attended, the cast members hadn't reached that stage yet, though I suspect they may in time. And at 3 hours 10 minutes, the production felt every bit as long as it was.
 But the leisurely pace does allow scholars and fans of Mr. Wilson to savor his artful stealth in developing big themes through small details. Like the last play of the cycle that Mr. Wilson wrote, ''Radio Golf,'' to be seen on Broadway next year, ''Two Trains'' is all about money and the ways it defines, inspires and suffocates the inhabitants of the Hill.
 The talk at Memphis's diner (Derek McLane has designed the persuasively authentic set), where seven characters gather more to chew the fat than anything on the fast-shrinking menu, often centers on two very different pursuits: gambling and burying the dead. Nearly everyone on the Hill seems bound to do business with Wolf (Ron Cephas Jones), a numbers runner, and West (Ed Wheeler), whose funeral home has made him the richest man in the neighborhood.
 The possibilities of sudden wealth and sudden death dance endlessly through the conversations conducted by Wolf, West and three other locals: Sterling (Chad L. Coleman), a handsome young man recently out of prison, where he did time for robbing a bank; Risa (January LaVoy), the comely, man-wary waitress; and Holloway (Arthur French), the diner's resident cracker-barrel philosopher.
 The most dissonant voice of the group belongs to the addled, childlike Hambone (Leon Addison Brown), who keeps excitedly chanting, ''He gonna give me my ham.'' This incantation refers to the white deli owner who never gave Mr. Brown's character the ham he was promised for painting a fence. ''He gonna give me my ham,'' it emerges, is a custom-fitted version of one-size-fits-all civil-rights shibboleths of the period like ''Black is beautiful.''
 Everyone in ''Two Trains'' to some degree shares the grievance and outrage in Hambone's cry. Memphis, who is being pressured to sell his diner to the city (which plans to tear it down), and Holloway give these feelings soaring voice in classic Wilsonian arias of loss and humiliation.
 Although the dialogue is often frisky and funny and the play's conclusion generously upbeat, there remains throughout the sobering sense that only dead men know real luxury on the Hill, where people are buried in high and expensive style. Descriptions of lavish funerals abound, and the observation is made more than once that, as Sterling says, ''People don't care nothing about you 'til you dead.''
 Unfortunately Mr. Bellamy underscores the preachier aspects of the big monologues by often having them delivered downstage, directly to the audience. And the actors didn't always seem entirely sure of their lines the night I saw the play.
 This is likely to improve in time. And there are plenty of tasty renderings of the rhythmic counterpoint in which Mr. Wilson excels. Mr. Coleman's jittery Sterling, restlessly rolling coins in his hand, and Ms. LaVoy's somnambulistic Risa, who does her chores as if moving under water, provide a seductive contrast in styles as their characters gravitate toward each other.
 In the production's most memorable scene, the diner's jukebox, which has been out of order for months, comes back to life to bring these characters together. Of course there has been subliminal song in everything that has been spoken before. In the world of August Wilson, just because the jukebox is broken doesn't mean the music has died.

HEADLINE: The Future Of Web Ads Is in Britain

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
If you want a glimpse of the future of advertising, you can hire a consultant -- or you can travel to Britain.
 Online advertising is racing ahead in Britain, growing at a roughly 40 percent annual rate, and is expected to account for as much as 14 percent of overall ad spending this year, according to media buying agencies. That is the highest level in the world, and more than double the percentage in the United States.
There are big differences between the advertising markets in Britain and the Unites States. In Britain, much of the advertising is national, while there are strong local and regional ad markets in America. Still, some believe that online advertising in Britain provides somewhat of a roadmap for where online ads in the United States and elsewhere may be heading. ''The U.S. is so behind,'' said Terry S. Semel, the chief executive of Yahoo, in a recent speech in London. ''It's certainly lagging the U.K. by at least a year or two.''
 More than their American counterparts, British marketers seem to have bought into the oft-touted benefits of Internet advertising: that it is easy to track, enormously effective and a relative bargain. In Britain, as Internet ad spending surges, the overall advertising pie is not growing much at all, and traditional media are the ones losing out. 
 However, British media are nearly all aimed nationwide in contrast to the United States newspaper and television markets, where local and regional markets are big players. These local markets in the United States have, so far, been slow to move ad money online. 
 As recently as 2002, many British advertisers were reluctant to go online, too. That year, British advertising online was 1.4 percent compared with 2.5 percent in the United States, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau in Britain and the Interactive Advertising Bureau in the United States. Each bureau tracks online ad spending in their respective countries.
 In the following year, Britain overtook the United States, and it has not looked back. In 2005, nearly 8 percent of British ad dollars went online, compared with 4.6 percent in the United States. And, this year, the two bureaus say, the Internet will account for 10.5 percent of British ad spending compared with 5.6 percent in the United States. 
 Media buying agencies like Group M, the media-buying division of WPP Group, estimate that online ad spending in Britain will be even higher -- close to 14 percent of the total this year.
 Similarly, broadband access in Britain at first lagged access in the United States, but has since surged. In 2002, 15.7 percent of American households had broadband compared with only 5.1 percent of British homes, according to eMarketer. This year, Britain is ahead, with 47.4 percent of homes having broadband, which is more than the 43.9 percent in the United States.
 Some analysts say British advertisers may simply be quicker to embrace new marketing ideas than American companies. ''I'd like to think there's a cultural factor in the U.K., where we've been a bit more experimental on some of these things,'' said Rob Noss, European chief executive of MindShare Interaction, a new media division of Group M's MindShare unit.
 In the United States, major advertisers are more dependent on traditional media, particularly television. The top 50 advertisers in the United States spent just 3.8 percent of their budgets in the first half of this year on online ads, excluding search-related advertising like that sold by Google, according to data from TNS Media Intelligence.
 ''Partly driven by scale but also by legacy, there are a lot of traditional budgets that are already laid down,'' said Antony M. Young, president of the American division of Optimedia, a media-buying unit of Publicis Groupe.
 Ad buyers at the major American brand companies may be reluctant to commit larger sums to the Internet because they believe they do not have control over where their ads appear, analysts say. Many Internet advertisements in the United States are still sold through online networks that place ads on member sites. In Britain, more advertisers work directly with Web publishers, giving them greater say in where and when ads appear.
 In contrast, large advertisers in Britain appear to be leading the push onto the Internet. British financial-services companies have been particularly aggressive online spenders, in some cases allocating 30 percent or 40 percent of their advertising budgets to the Internet, Mr. Noss said. 
 Big British advertisers have also been quick to jump at the opportunities provided by paid search advertising, like that sold by Google and other search engines. Search accounts for 56 percent of Internet ad spending in Britain, compared with 42.5 percent in the United States, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau. ''We're all searchaholics,'' said Guy Phillipson, chief executive of the bureau's branch in Britain. 
 Since retailers in Britain typically operate nationally and deliver online purchases anywhere in the country, searches often lead directly to sales, said Andrew Edwards, European president of Arc, a direct marketing agency affiliated with Leo Burnett. About 3.9 percent of visits to British online retailers' sites yield purchases, compared with 2.5 percent of American site visits, according to Coremetrics, an e-commerce tracking service.
 In Britain, analysts predict that it will not be long until Internet advertising catches up with TV advertising. Group M, for instance, says the Internet could account for 25 percent of British ad spending by 2010. That would place it ahead of television, which accounts for just more than 20 percent now.
 Hardest hit has been Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster, ITV. Analysts at Numis Securities estimate that ITV's advertising revenue will fall 13 percent for 2006. Weakened by its loss of advertising, ITV has become a takeover target. 
 On average, Britons spend 23 hours a week on the Internet, according to the Internet Advertising Bureau. The Internet accounts for about a quarter of Britons' time spent with all media, according to Citigroup, nearly double the percentage in the United States. Americans use their computers an average of 14 hours a week, according to Nielsen Media Research.
 TV advertising has held strong in the United States, where about $72.56 billion will be spent on TV ads this year, according to Universal McCann, which is part of the Interpublic Group. That represents a quarter of all ad spending, and that proportion has held roughly steady since 2000.
 Local advertisers in the United States have been slow to move money online. This year, for example, local spending on online ads in the United States will be $1.3 billion -- or 8 percent of all Internet spending, according to eMarketer. But local ads make up a little more than a third of overall ad sales in the United States. 
 Ad executives said American TV networks were unlikely to lose as much ground as British networks had. ''TV's just too important for our society,'' said Martin Reidy, president of Modem Media, which is part of Digitas. ''I don't think the Internet will ever surpass it here.''
 In Britain, the growth of Internet ads seems to be bringing down the amount of money spent in the overall advertising market as well. Growth in spending on advertising and marketing services is set to slow to 0.3 percent this year, according to Group M, after growth of 4.3 percent last year and 6.7 percent in 2004. To many ad executives, this makes sense: online ads are generally much cheaper.
 ''Every pound withdrawn from traditional media either to be saved or spent online, where supply is in handsome surplus, exerts more deflationary pressure on the total market,'' said Group M in a recent report on the British ad market. ''And if online proves more productive, advertisers have the option of investing less.''

HEADLINE: Used to Big Losses, Schenectady Is Hit Hard by Plan for Hospitals

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

DATELINE: SCHENECTADY, N.Y., Nov. 30 

 BODY:
It is part of the local lore, the way people in some cities know the win-loss record of their N.F.L. team, that the General Electric Company once employed 40,000 people here and now employs about 3,000.
 From the mayor to a taxi driver waiting for his fare outside a supermarket, to the owner of one of the city's many antiques stores, almost everyone will recite the numbers -- 40,000 in the 1950s, 3,000 today -- as if they represented the score in a lopsided contest between this city's past and its present.
Still, the prospect of this once-thriving city's losing one of its two hospitals, as recommended by a state commission, seemed to some people here like an irreducible demotion in municipal rank. For one, it signaled the possible loss of hundreds of jobs in one of the last secure sectors of employment, health care, in a city where the number of major employers can now be counted on one hand.
 But almost more than that, Schenectady residents said, there is the threatened loss of a certain civic gravity, that indescribable coherence that a city with two hospitals seems to have and a city with one hospital somehow just does not. 
 ''Two hospitals were always part of the fabric of this city,'' said George Morris, a printer, bookseller and lifelong resident. ''You had a choice, and an allegiance to one hospital or the other,'' he said, an allegiance exercised at just about all the major junctures of a citizen's life, birth and death foremost.
 On Tuesday, the Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, created by the Legislature and appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki more than a year ago, recommended eliminating about 20 hospitals statewide through closings, mergers and other forms of consolidation. The commission's mandate was to propose ways of reducing the state's health-care costs. The governor or the Legislature must accept or reject the plan as a whole; the law does not allow them to pick and choose which parts of the plan to accept.
 In the Schenectady area, the commission proposed merging St. Clare's Hospital, a 200-bed Roman Catholic hospital that specializes in geriatric care and is known for serving the city's indigent, with Ellis Hospital, a 368-bed private hospital known for its cardiac and cancer treatment. It also recommended closing the Bellevue Hospital for Women in Niskayuna, a 40-bed maternity hospital just over the city line.
 The commission said Bellevue and St. Clare's were both financially ailing, with occupancy rates under 50 percent -- characteristics which, to a painfully exact degree, seemed to mimic the distinguishing features of the city itself.
 Schenectady's population, which peaked at around 110,000 when G.E.'s plant here produced airplane engines during World War II, is now around 61,000. 
 Many of the two-family homes built in the 1920s for G.E. workers are abandoned, and many more sag from years of neglect. Efforts at rehabilitation, persistent though they are, have been achingly slow to gain momentum, said Edward August, director of a housing program called Better Neighborhoods Inc. ''One of our big problems is, frankly, we've got too many houses, and not enough people to put in them,'' he said.
 Hospital and city officials were reluctant to say how many jobs might be lost as a result of the mergers of the two hospitals and the closing of the third. Though the commission asserted that its recommendations would eventually strengthen health care employment, some estimated the immediate loss at about 500 -- a staggering number in a place where the average person on the street not only recites the legacy of G.E. job losses, but can tell you pretty much what employment prospects are left.
 ''There is an insurance company named M.V.P., and the chemical company, Schenectady International,'' said Joann Aragosa, 68, a lifelong resident interviewed on the sidewalk at random the other day. ''And G.E. still does research and development here.'' She paused.
 There are some state offices, like the Lottery Commission, school bus driver's jobs, and what people here refer to as ''working for Mr. Golub,'' meaning Neil Golub, the civic-minded chairman of a chain of supermarkets called Price Chopper, said Anthony Bianco, a resident questioned while stringing Christmas lights across the front of his wood-frame home. American Locomotive is long gone. G.E.'s manufacturing work has moved South, or overseas. ''That's about it,'' he said.
 Assemblyman James N. Tedisco, the Republican minority leader, who represents part of Schenectady, said the hospital merger plan would not go unopposed. ''You know, 35 or 40 thousand people used to work for G.E., and now it's like 3,000,'' he said. ''The city has taken quite a few body blows over the years. This is kind of a head shot right here. But I think the commission hasn't looked at all the facts. We're not going to let this go.''
 A recent infusion of state and federal development aid has sparked a small building boom in the city's downtown. A movie theater and a hotel are under construction next door to the elegantly refurbished Proctor Theater, a former vaudeville palace that now hosts Broadway touring companies and regional theater productions. Mayor Brian U. Stratton has reduced the city's debt in recent years by selling its large backlog of tax liens to a private collection company, turning abandoned real estate into one of the city's most lucrative sources of income.
 But it is a lightly trafficked downtown. The city's teenage pregnancy rate is still one of the highest in the state. A decade ago, the shrinking population forced the city to consolidate its two high schools into one. 
 And while Attorney General Eliot Spitzer was not referring to Schenectady itself when he made his controversial remark this spring during the campaign for governor -- ''You drive from Schenectady over to Niagara Falls, you see an upstate economy that is devastated. It looks like Appalachia.'' -- it was received as a glancing blow to civic morale in this city, where the bond rating has inched up in the last couple of years but remains just a notch above junk.
 The prospect of consolidating the two hospitals here into one looms like the proverbial elephant in the living room: No one welcomes it, but there may be no way around it.
 ''It is horrible. Completely appalling. One hundred percent wrong,'' said Julia Gilman, a nurse at St. Clare's interviewed outside the hospital the other day. ''Hospitals are not just about 'occupancy rate.' This is just going to destroy Schenectady.''
 St. Clare's officials declined to discuss the possible merger.
 While nurses and doctors are likely to find jobs, the workers of most concern to city officials are lower-paid staff members like nursing assistants, maintenance crews and cafeteria and laundry workers -- people like one man who bought an old house and rehabilitated it with a $40,000 grant from Better Neighborhoods Inc. several years ago.
 ''He's a laundry worker in one of the hospitals,'' said Mr. August, the director of Better Neighborhoods Inc. He said the man was a hard worker, the type who might have enjoyed middle class prosperity at the G.E. of a generation ago, but who today would not have much cushion in his financial life. ''That's the guy we worry about.''
 Another question local officials raised in the first days after the release of the commission's report concerned women's access to abortion. 
 Ellis Hospital has no gynecological service, and St. Clare's, the Catholic hospital, does not perform abortions. Besides overseeing the delivery of more than 2,000 babies last year, Bellevue Hospital for Women, which was marked to close, is the only hospital in the immediate area that provides abortions, though within 20 miles there are hospitals in Albany and Troy where they are performed. Albany Medical Center, a well-respected teaching hospital, has drawn general medical patients away from the Schenectady hospitals for years. 
 ''There are policy and philosophical questions here that no one seems to have considered,'' Mayor Stratton said.
 Anne Saile, the president and chief executive of Bellevue, said her hospital also contained the only neonatal intensive care unit in the immediate Schenectady area. And such a unit ''cannot just be picked up and moved to another hospital'' like so much equipment, she said.
 The neighborhood around St. Clare's Hospital was almost empty of people the other day when Tom Salamone opened his store for business. It is a uniform shop, Image Experts, that was a place to buy mainly nurses' and doctors' scrubs when his father established it in 1968, but which now sustains itself more in sales of security guard uniforms and special order T-shirts. 
 He sells a lot of his merchandise via the Web, and sees less and less walk-in business. One of the busier operations on the street is the cinder-block building occupied by the Price Chopper School of Learning, where the supermarket chain trains its employees.
 ''I'm really not sure what effect this is going to have,'' said Mr. Salamone, 43, speaking with a reserve that suggested a familiarity with disappointment. ''I will probably do all right. We have managed before.'' G.E., he said, once employed more than 40,000 people here. ''I don't see how this can be positive, though,'' he added.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Talks On Housing Tax Breaks 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, and Daniel L. Doctoroff, the deputy mayor for economic development and rebuilding, met at City Hall yesterday to discuss how to overhaul a city tax program used to encourage housing construction. The program, 421-a, now provides incentives for developers of new apartment buildings -- and requires them to include moderately priced units in only a few neighborhoods. The mayor wants to increase the number of neighborhoods where lower-priced units are required for developers to qualify for the program, while a counterproposal from several Council members seeks the requirement for low-cost units to apply to development anywhere in the city. After the meeting, people familiar with the talks said that Ms. Quinn was trying to broker a compromise in the hope of introducing a consensus proposal at the next legislative meeting, on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Bathing in Black Gold for Health and Profit in Azerbaijan 

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

DATELINE: NAFTALAN, Azerbaijan 

 BODY:
Outside this improbable spa in a remote part of the former Soviet Union, oil rigs bob on a hardscrabble plain of rocks, shrubs and rusting industrial equipment that could easily pass for a stretch of West Texas. 
 Inside, Ramil Mutukhov, a lanky 25-year-old, prepares to be pampered and preened, scrubbed and peeled -- in a bath of pure crude oil.
He undresses, hangs his trousers and sweatshirt on a peg, pulls off socks and underwear and folds a wad of brown paper towels. He will need them later. Then he steps into a mess of what looks, smells and flows like used engine oil. ''It's wonderful,'' he says, up to his neck in oil in a sort of human lube job. 
 The petroleum spas of Naftalan in central Azerbaijan, one of the little-known but once popular vacation spots of the Soviet Union, are making an unlikely return in a country so awash in oil these days that people are swimming in it. 
 Here in Naftalan, visitors can bathe once a day in the local crude. They and doctors here say it relieves joint pain, cures psoriasis, calms nerves and beautifies skin -- never mind that Western experts say it may cause cancer. 
 Hoping to tap into the worldwide spa boom, Health Center, where Mr. Mutukhov took a dip recently, opened a year ago. Another spa is being built and two more are planned. ''Two years ago, all this was ruins,'' Ilgar Guseynov, the owner and director of Health Center, said in an interview. ''Every day, every month, Azerbaijan is growing richer.''
 At their peak in the 1980s, Naftalan spas had 75,000 visitors a year. That flow became a trickle after war broke out between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians in nearby Nagorno-Karabakh in 1988 -- and after the Soviet Union stopped offering free trips. Five of the six Soviet-era resorts were converted into glum housing for refugees. But this summer, about 350 people visited the Health Center, Mr. Guseynov said, up from 250 last summer. A 15-day course costs $450, including meals. 
 ''Azerbaijan is standing on its own feet now,'' Amir Aslan, the deputy mayor of Naftalan, said. The town is banking on growth tied to the oil spa, which he said would pull it out of poverty. He has plans for a $3 million, 20-bath spread and is seeking investors. 
 In her office overlooking the oil field that supplies Health Center, Gyultikin Suleymanova, the lead doctor, said the local crude was unusual because it contained little natural gas or other lighter fractions of petroleum, and as a result was safe. 
 Naftalan crude contains about 50 percent naphthalene, a hydrocarbon best known as the stuff of mothballs. It is also an active ingredient in coal tar soaps, which are used by dermatologists to treat psoriasis, though in lower concentrations. 
 The National Agency for Research on Cancer, an American government agency, classifies naphthalene as a possible carcinogen, though Dr. Suleymanova said that is not the case when people bathe in it. Baths are lukewarm and last 10 minutes. 
 The therapeutic benefits are a product of natural antibiotic and anti-inflammatory agents that seep into the skin, she said. Arzu Mirzeyev is the bath master. With a green frock, jeans stained with oil and a mustache, he looks for all the world like a gas station mechanic and has a job to match. He changes the oil. 
 Each bath uses about a barrel of crude, which is recycled into a communal tank for future bathers, given the cost of oil these days. Mr. Mirzeyev also uses paper towels to wipe bathers clean, a long, hard process that involves several showers. 
 He says he likes his job. Until Azerbaijan's economy ticked up in the last two years, Mr. Mirzeyev, 40 and a father of three, was a seasonal laborer in Ukraine, where wages were higher. 
 ''If we have visitors, then we have work,'' he said. 
 Unlike the oil from Azerbaijan's offshore deposits, sold internationally under the brand Azeri Light crude, Naftalan's oil is too heavy to have much commercial value. Luckily, because most of the bath attendants and patients seemed to smoke, it is not particularly flammable, either. 
 The resort has 80 rooms and 10 tubs, 5 for women, 5 for men. The tubs are not scoured between baths and, as might be expected, have perhaps the world's worst bathtub rings -- greasy and greenish brown.
 Oil has been Azerbaijan's ticket for a long time. 
 Oil seepages have been noted in Naftalan since at least the 13th century, when Marco Polo passed through and, even today, a reedy marsh, about the size of a football field, has a black patina of oil on the water. The site was a stopping place on the Silk Road to China. 
 Later, Azerbaijan's larger oil reserves on the Caspian coast were developed by the Swedish Nobel brothers, the rivals of the American oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller. 
 In a sign of the more recent past in Naftalan, a museum keeps a collection of wooden crutches left by Soviet-era visitors ''cured'' by oil at the peak of the Soviet oil spa boom in the 1970s and 1980s. 
 The museum also has a photograph of a sign that hung at the city limits back then, ''He Who Has Naftalan Has Everything.''

HEADLINE: Revisiting Putin's Soul 

 BODY:
The fatal poisoning of Alexander Litvinenko in London, along with all the other suspicious murders and attempted murders of Kremlin critics in recent months, poses fundamental questions about Russia, and how the West should treat it. 
 Since most of these crimes remain unsolved, we can only speculate about who is behind them. We would certainly prefer not to suspect that anyone connected to President Vladimir Putin is involved, even if the attacks have the hallmarks of professional assassinations. The West needs a good relationship with Russia and its cooperation in containing nuclear proliferation and fighting terrorism. No one wants to return to the time when Russia was seen as an enemy.
Yet the recent events -- a Russian defector is killed by a radioactive element, a Russian economic reformer suddenly is sickened in Ireland, a crusading Russian reporter is shot down in her doorway -- cannot simply be dismissed as unrelated occurrences, as Mr. Putin would prefer.
 What is indisputable is that a culture of lawlessness is spreading throughout Russia, and Mr. Putin has done little to stop it. On the contrary, he has weakened Russia's democracy by stuffing his administration with shadowy fellow veterans of the old K.G.B. and by fanning Russians' deep-seated feelings of insecurity and mistrust of the outside world. 
 Under the guise of restoring Russian honor, Mr. Putin's government is quashing the freedoms won by the post-Soviet press, judiciary and legislature. Government critics have been branded ''enemies of Russia'' on lists that circulate openly in government circles. The Kremlin claims to see American wiles behind every real or perceived setback. 
 The West has no choice but to continue dealing with Russia, and with Mr. Putin. But when Kremlin critics are attacked or murdered, the West must demand a full, transparent investigation and punishment for the criminals -- no matter who they are. It is time to let Mr. Putin know that we are looking hard into his soul, and we don't like what we see.

FOLLOW THE RISING EURO -- The European Central Bank will announce a decision on interest rates Thursday. The bank is widely expected to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter of a point, to 3.5 percent, with perhaps more increases to follow next year. The policy would represent an effort to head off inflation in the 12 nations that use the euro as their currency, many of which have been making economic progress. The dollar has recently fallen to its lowest level against the euro in more than a year and a half, and, if the descent accelerated, the Federal Reserve eventually might be prompted to respond with a rate rise, currency-market watchers say. Separately, Japan will announce its third-quarter gross domestic product figures Thursday. 


MUSIC MERGER -- Also on Friday, the European Union is expected to rule on the Universal Music Group's acquisition of BMG Music Publishing. The $2.1 billion deal to create the world's largest music publisher has won antitrust approval from the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department, but the situation could be trickier in Europe. Last summer, a European court invalidated regulators' approval of the 2004 merger of the music divisions of Sony and Bertelsmann, which owns BMG Music Publishing. Universal Music is a division of Vivendi.

THE WEEK IN NUMBERS -- The most significant economic indicator of the week will be the Labor Department's employment report for November (Friday). Also on tap will be the government's reports on factory orders for October and productivity for the third quarter (Tuesday); the Federal Reserve's report on consumer credit for October (Thursday); and the University of Michigan first reading of consumer sentiment for December (Friday).

SCANTY EARNINGS -- It will be a thin week for company earnings reports. Possibly the most interesting will be Toll Brothers, the home builder, which will report Tuesday and whose results could shed further light on the national real estate picture. Other notables: the Kroger Company (Monday); AutoZone and Novell (Tuesday); National Semiconductor (Thursday) and Toronto-Dominion Bank (Friday).

HEADLINE: Bush Mulls Resumed Energy Drilling Off Alaska

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
President Bush is considering whether to lift the 17-year-old moratorium on energy drilling in the waters off southwestern Alaska, a White House spokeswoman said Sunday, which would allow oil and gas companies to try to tap into more than five trillion cubic feet of natural gas that lies beneath rich fishing grounds.
 The push to market oil and gas leases in these waters, which oil and gas companies favor, is part of a larger national effort to expand domestic supplies of fossil fuel by opening up areas of the outer continental shelf, long off-limits to energy development. 
 Last summer the Interior Department recommended reopening several areas of the outer continental shelf, including the southern part of Bristol Bay, which lies just north of where the Aleutian Islands meet the Alaskan mainland, to energy exploration. The report said that 14 oil and gas companies had supported the idea. The department has estimated that such a move could create up to 11,500 jobs, part of what it describes as ''net benefits'' of $7.7 billion.
 In a letter to President Bush on Friday, a coalition of environmental groups, including the Wilderness Society, the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, citing the impact of the Exxon Valdez oil spill, called the bay ''an economically critical salmon fishery,'' adding that ''it provides essential habitat for the endangered northern right whale.''
 The executive director of Greenpeace, John Passacantando, said Sunday that the Bering Sea was ''the most intact marine ecosystem in United States waters'' and that Bristol Bay was ''among the most important parts of the Bering Sea.'' 
 Asked about the potential impact of an outer continental shelf leasing program confined to the southern waters of the bay, Mr. Passacantando said: ''The energy industry ultimately gives you things that look like the Exxon Valdez. It was because of the threat of this kind of spill that that leases were initially rescinded.''
 He was referring to a handful of oil leases that were granted in the southern part of Bristol Bay in 1988, then bought back by the federal government after the Exxon Valdez supertanker, with a captain who had been drinking, ran aground on Bligh Reef in March 1989. The tanker ruptured and spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the sound.
 The Alaska Economic Development Commission has supported opening the area to expand economic diversification, and has concluded that the impact on marine life can be ''fully mitigated,'' the Interior Department reported.
 When Congress, acting at the urging of Alaska's senior senator, Ted Stevens, a Republican, rescinded its protections for Bristol Bay in 2003, the area remained protected by earlier presidential decisions, first by President George Bush in 1991 and then, in 1998, by President Bill Clinton, who put the area off-limits to energy leasing until 2012.
 There has been widespread speculation among environmental groups and fishing industry representatives that President Bush would end the moratorium during the lame-duck session of Congress, allowing the Interior Department to proceed with its plans to market oil and gas leases in the southern section of the bay, along the north coast of the Aleutian Islands.
 The Associated Press reported over the weekend that the administration was considering ending the moratorium, a report that was confirmed by a White House spokeswoman, Emily Lawrimore. She would not comment on the merits of the debate but said the president was considering whether to end the leasing moratorium.
 Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, said in a statement Sunday that ''executive withdrawal on oil and gas leasing in Alaska's Bristol Bay, one of our nation's most sensitive fisheries, combined with House Republicans scheduling a vote next week to expand offshore drilling off Florida's coast, only underscores that G.O.P. stands for Gas and Oil Party.''
 Mr. Markey added, ''The administration should be leading efforts to increase fuel economy standards, which would dramatically reduce our dependence on foreign oil.''

HEADLINE: Chavez Wins Easily in Venezuela, Showing Wide Support

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jens Erik Gould and Jose Orozco contributed reporting.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez was re-elected in a landslide on Sunday night, as voting tallies poured in from throughout the country. Mr. Chavez's main opponent conceded defeat, paving the way for the president to begin a new six-year term.
 With 78 percent of the votes counted, Mr. Chavez was ahead with 61 percent, compared with 38 percent for Manuel Rosales, the governor of Zulia State, Venezuela's electoral council said late Sunday night as it declared Mr. Chavez the winner. Thousands of supporters filed into the streets around Miraflores, the presidential palace downtown, to hear Mr. Chavez deliver a victory speech in the rain. 
 ''Long live the socialist revolution!'' Mr. Chavez yelled to the crowd, pumping his fist in the air. His supporters, many of them dancing, reacted by chanting, ''Ooh-ah, Chavez isn't leaving!''
 The win for Mr. Chavez gives him a stronger mandate to press forward with his socialist-inspired policies in Venezuela and abroad. He signaled as much in his victory speech, invoking figures from Jesus Christ to Pancho Villa as influences for his ambitious plans.
 The tension between the campaigns of Mr. Chavez and Mr. Rosales reflected a polarized electorate in Venezuela, but by contrast the voting itself was largely tranquil, with few reports of clashes or other violence. Both candidates spent heavily in the race, with supporters for Mr. Chavez and Mr. Rosales each using American polling companies until well into Sunday evening.
 Evans/McDonough, a polling company based in Oakland, Calif., and hired by Venezuela's national oil company, released an exit poll indicating that Mr. Chavez was ahead, with 58 percent of the vote, to 40 percent for Mr. Rosales.
 The results showed Mr. Rosales doing better than had been forecast in some polls, and his advisers said that quick counts indicated that he had won in several states and Caracas. But Mr. Rosales conceded defeat in a brief speech Sunday night, while saying the margin of Mr. Chavez's victory was narrower than official results indicated. 
 ''It's been a hard fight against the mechanisms, all the dimensions of the government,'' Mr. Rosales said.
 Antonio Marquez, an official with Mr. Rosales's campaign, said: ''There's been a great deal of pressure exerted by the government to demonstrate that they won. This climate of tension is not positive for the country.''
 Other campaign officials for Mr. Rosales said soldiers had forced some polling places to remain open past the 4 p.m. closing time on Sunday to allow supporters of Mr. Chavez to vote. International observers in various parts of the country, however, said the election took place without signs of wrongdoing. 
 ''One had to be moved by the earnestness and attention to detail,'' said Martin Garbus, a trial lawyer from New York invited by Venezuela's government to observe the election in Sarare, a town in the state of Lara. ''It was a lesson in participatory democracy.'' 
 Once the official results are in, how Mr. Chavez and Mr. Rosales react will determine whether Venezuela will return to the instability and street violence that had marred earlier elections. Mr. Rosales said Sunday night that he would continue leading the political opposition in the country, but it was clear that many critics of Mr. Chavez were hoping for a stronger response. 
 Still, the margin in Mr. Chavez's favor reflected widespread support for the president as Venezuela reaps the economic benefits of high oil prices. Mr. Chavez has redirected government spending by creating an array of social welfare programs that benefit the poor. 
 In Caracas, voting at the Simon Bolivar elementary school in San Blas, a slum in the Petare district, proceeded calmly on Sunday morning. Once outside after voting, some voters put on red shirts and hats, indicating their support for Mr. Chavez. ''I'm red, very red,'' said Carlos Gelvis, an unemployed man from Petare, in a reference to a refrain of Mr. Chavez's campaign.
 Mr. Chavez voted in the 23 de Enero district, a stronghold of support for his ''Bolivarian revolution,'' which espouses distributing oil revenues to the poor. The president arrived to vote in a red Volkswagen Beetle and surprisingly extended what seemed to be an olive branch to the Bush administration.
 He responded to remarks by Thomas A. Shannon Jr., the United States assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere, in a Spanish newspaper, El Pais, which had quoted him as saying, ''The political battle that is unfolding within Venezuela is now conducted through democratic institutions.''
 Mr. Chavez said that Mr. Shannon ''at least recognized we have democracy in Venezuela,'' and added, ''I think these are good signs.'' 
 Amid all the voters clad in red clothing in 23 de Enero was Henry Borrero, who stood out with his faded blue polo shirt and his opposition to Mr. Chavez. ''I want a free country where my 21-year-old son has the freedom to choose,'' said Mr. Borrero, who accompanied his mother, who also said she had voted for Mr. Rosales. ''Not one where you need a red shirt to get a job.''

 BODY:
Rush Limbaugh's Web site has a higher concentration of Republican visitors than any other site on the Web, according to Nielsen//NetRatings, the Internet traffic measurement firm. The Web site of Black Entertainment Television occupies a corresponding position among Democrats. The numbers represent the percentages of each party registration among people who said they had browsed the sites within the preceding 30 days, as reported to NetRatings this summer. (The data was weighted to reflect the age and gender of all American Internet users.) 
 Republican-skewing sites tend to be explicitly directed at conservative readers: after Mr. Limbaugh, the highest concentrations of Republicans are at The Weekly Standard's home page and at NewsMax, a site offering a conservative tilt to news. By contrast, the most Democratic-leaning sites contain relatively nonpolitical fare intended for a mostly black audience: after BET.com come BlackAmericaWeb.com and BlackPlanet.com.
 ''The Web sites that are the most heavily composed of Democrats are not focused on politics, but on communities that are heavily Democratic,'' said Kenneth Cassar, the chief analyst for NetRatings. ''I don't know whether that tells us that Democrats haven't figured out how to make politics entertaining.'' ALEX MINDLIN

Johan van der Keuken
The Complete Collection, Volume 1
 When the cinema verite movement came along in the 1960s, one of the first reforms instituted by this new generation of documentary filmmakers was to ban the use of the omniscient narrator, the godlike voice from off screen that interpreted and fixed the images' meanings. 
 For an anthropologist like Jean Rouch in France, it was anathema for the observer to intrude on the observed, a practice that smacked of the colonialist condescension built into so many documentaries about Africa, one of Mr. Rouch's favorite locations. For the American filmmaker Frederick Wiseman, the lack of commentary seemed to reflect a commitment to the unshakeable, irreducible reality of the spectacle before his camera, as if a strict observance of surfaces would eventually reveal the essences behind them.
The Dutch filmmaker Johan van der Keuken (1938-2001), arguably Europe's most important documentary filmmaker (certainly since Mr. Rouch), was also influenced by the verite school, but he took his campaign against the arrogance of omniscience further than any documentarist before or since. Not only did he refuse overt interpretation and explanation, but he also rejected the too tidy editorial decisions that went into the selection and shaping of a subject. 
 ''Johan van der Keuken: The Complete Collection, Volume 1,'' the first in a series of boxed sets of his work to be released by Arte Video in Europe and distributed in the United States by Facets (www.facets.org), consists of three extraordinary features and several short films, which all fiercely resist being reduced to a single thesis statement. 
 ''I 3/5sheart 4/5 $'' (1986) is, in the broadest sense, about the circulation of money: in its 140 minutes it visits a hectic foreign exchange bureau in Amsterdam; private bankers on Wall Street; a racetrack in Hong Kong; a Puerto Rican mother and her son struggling to set up a restaurant along Avenue C, then devastated, in the East Village; and a raucous farmers' market back in the Netherlands.
 It's left to the viewer to decide how these different levels of economic activity interrelate, and to draw moral or political conclusions. Talking heads are certainly present (though no one is identified until the final credits), but so are less conventional elements, like Mr. van der Keuken's repeated cutaways to the iron posts that turn the sidewalks of Europe into obstacle courses; the water fountains and fire hydrants of the streets and parks of New York; the Foo dogs standing guard outside Asian banks. These moments of silence and seeming insignificance punctuate his films, momentarily lifting the viewer out of the rushing current of presentation and interpretation, and leaving an often literally cold, hard reality. 
 Volume 1 of the van der Keuken collection (a second volume has been released in Europe, and with luck will make its way to American-standard video) includes two other feature-length works. Filmed in the southwestern Indian state of Kerala, ''The Eye Above the Well'' (1988) centers on the circulation of knowledge, through means modern (the cinema) and traditional (the temple). 
 The ambitious, nearly abstract ''Face Value'' (1991) contemplates the new visage of Europe, transformed by the collapse of the Eastern bloc and recent waves of immigration. The faces captured by Mr. van der Keuken, as he moves between London and Prague, Marseilles and Amsterdam, have the precision and power of August Sander portraits, but portraits that move and intermingle, creating or uncovering relations between them. Arte Video/Facets Multimedia, $79.95, unrated. 

Lubitsch in Berlin
 The director Ernst Lubitsch is best known for the continental fantasies he created during his tenure at Paramount in Hollywood, films like ''Trouble in Paradise'' (1932) and ''Ninotchka'' (1939), which took place in a Paris of infinite elegance, wit and sexual tolerance. Lubitsch's Hollywood Europe was a highly artificial, thoroughly imagined place, but then so was the Europe he envisioned while still in Germany, as revealed by the five wonderful films being released today on four discs by Kino International under the series title ''Lubitsch in Berlin.'' All reveal a filmmaker in flight from everyday reality.
 Though these are youthful works, they already belong to the second phase of Lubitsch's career. He first broke into the business as an actor (through his work at Max Reinhardt's Deutsches Theater), playing broad Jewish caricatures in a series of highly popular comedies, which he eventually began to direct as well. He discovered he could act through the medium of other people's bodies, and soon, with the assistance of performers like Ossi Oswalda, Harry Liedtke and Emil Jannings, he became a master puppeteer, removing himself from sight while guiding every gesture and facial expression of his actors. 
 A streak of extreme, almost psychedelic stylization runs through the comedies among the new Kino releases: ''The Oyster Princess'' (1919), featuring the plump, lively Ms. Oswalda as the spoiled daughter of a New York seafood baron, and the droll, good-looking Mr. Liedtke as an impoverished aristocrat who agrees to become her husband, seems only inches away from an animated cartoon, with its grotesquely made-up supporting players, extravagant visual gags and dreamlike sets, posed somewhere between Expressionism and Futurism. (Kino has doubled ''The Oyster Princess'' with another Oswalda vehicle, the gender-bending 1920 comedy ''I Don't Want to Be a Man''). 
 ''Sumurun'' (1920), adapted from a pantomime originally staged by Reinhardt, is an Arabian Nights pastiche in which Lubitsch, in his last leading role, plays a hunchback hopelessly in love with a dancing young woman. The woman, a bundle of energy with big, burning eyes, is played by Pola Negri, a Lubitsch discovery who became an international star under his direction and got them both invited to Hollywood in 1923. 
 She is also in the Kino selection ''The Wildcat'' (1921), an unrestrained, anti-military farce in which she's a bandit's daughter who beguiles a womanizing lieutenant (Paul Heidemann, in a role that anticipates Lubitsch's use of Maurice Chevalier). 
 Though Lubitsch's growing global reputation rested at the time on the historical dramas he made with Ms. Negri (beginning with ''Carmen,'' a k a ''Gypsy Blood,'' in 1918), only one period feature is in the Kino group: the 1920 ''Anna Boleyn,'' with the glowering, massive Jannings nicely cast as Henry VIII, and the fragile Henny Porten, the biggest female star of German silent film, as Henry's unfortunate second wife (''Anna'' being the German variation of ''Anne''). 
 A sprawling spectacle with seemingly thousands of extras (recruited from the vast ranks of the unemployed in inflation-era Berlin), ''Anna'' is at its core an intimate drama of adultery: a theme that Lubitsch would soon make his own by turning it into comedy. $29.95 each, not rated.

HEADLINE: China Pursues Major Role in Particle Physics 

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Mao Zedong dreamed of splitting an electron.
 This was no idle diversion. According to natural dialectics, which formed the philosophical underpinnings of Marxism, the entire universe, from top to bottom, was seething with tension and change. As a result, Mao thought, nature should be infinitely divisible.
''Take a footlong stick and remove half every day. In 10,000 years it will not run out,'' Mao, who rarely missed the chance to chat up physicists, often said. ''This is truth. If you don't believe it, you may test it. If there is an end, there is no science.''
 Suitably inspired by such thoughts, in the 1960s Chinese physicists invented a sort of onion-layer theory of particles called the straton model, in which both protons and electrons have a common constituent. Sheldon Glashow, the physicist and Nobelist now at Boston University, once suggested that such a particle, if found, should be named the Maon.
 But Mao's Cultural Revolution, which was unleashed in 1966, closed universities and journals and set back Chinese physics for a generation. In the meantime, quarks beat out Maons as the constituents of protons. To this day the electron remains undivided. 
 Mao's enthusiasm for particle physics nevertheless left a legacy.
 Ever since 1989, in a collection of buildings occupying about a city block in Beijing, Chinese physicists have been quietly shooting electrons and their evil-twin opposites -- positrons -- around a 80-yard-diameter underground track at nearly the speed of light, and then banging them together in little fireballs of energy.
 Over the years, the work at the Beijing collider has produced results that are critical to efforts on the frontier of particle physics at more famous and much larger accelerators -- those that have racetracks miles around and trillion-electron-volt energies, like the Tevatron at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, known as Fermilab, outside Chicago, and the Large Hadron Collider, scheduled to open next year at the CERN laboratory near Geneva.
 Next fall, the Beijing collider, which is shut down for a major upgrade, will be reborn with the ability to produce 100 times as many collisions it did before, enabling physicists to investigate the quantum property called charm and resolve some standing puzzles about quarks.
 By the end of the decade, as the world's physicists shift their attention and money to the new CERN collider, experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center in Menlo Park, Calif., and the Fermilab are expected to shut down. The Beijing collider then will be one of the few other particle accelerators still doing physics experiments left in the world, and Chinese physicists are trolling for collaborators.
 ''Although collaborations are still modest, golden physics opportunities exist in China,'' Hesheng Chen, director of the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing, recently wrote in the physics magazine Symmetry.
 More important, Chinese particle physicists are poised to make a major contribution to one of the grandest collaborations of all, a proposed giant accelerator called the International Linear Collider, or I.L.C. The world's physicists have already determined that it will be the Next Big Thing, but how many billions it will cost and where it will be built have yet to be decided.
 Still in planning stages, the linear collider would be designed to carry international research beyond any new laws of physics and forms of matter that may be discovered using the new machine at CERN.
 ''China is certainly interested in the I.L.C.,'' said Dr. Chen, who is a member of the steering committee for the international collider, and one of the organizers of a meeting this week in Beijing, where Chinese scientists and industry and government leaders will start talking about what role to take in the project. 
 Jie Gao, a physicist at Beijing's Institute of High Energy Physics and a member of the big collider's design team who helped instigate this week's meeting, said he hoped the conclusion was positive, ''for the good of sciences, economy, education, a harmonious and peaceful world, and a sustainable development of human being.''
 It wasn't until the early 1970s, after the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution began to wind down, that Chinese physics began to recover. Zhou Enlai, China's premier, took advantage of Mao's enthusiasms to endorse the development of high-energy physics, including a long-dormant dream of building a Chinese particle accelerator. It didn't hurt that particle physics was closely connected to nuclear weapons.
 Zhou got support from so-called overseas Chinese scientists, who had begun to visit their homeland in droves, like Chen-Ning Yang, then of Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, N.Y., and Tsung-Dao Lee, of Columbia University, who were Nobelists and heroes in China, and who talked up the importance of basic research to Mao and others. 
 A group of Chinese physicists toured Western laboratories in 1973 and returned with their hearts set on building a collider that would bang protons together at energies of 50 billion electron volts. When Wolfgang Panofsky, the former director of the Stanford accelerator, first visited China in 1976 in the wake of the Tangshan earthquake that killed hundreds of thousands, and after the deaths of Mao and Zhou, he was struck by the desire of the Chinese people to carry on, even though many were living in tents in the streets. 
 But Dr. Panofsky and others, including Dr. Lee, argued that a more modest machine would serve China better. 
 ''We talked them out of it,'' Dr Panofsky said. In 1982, in the midst of economic difficulties, the proton machine was canceled in favor of one that would collide electrons and positrons at the much lower energy of around 2 billion electron volts. Such a machine would produce synchrotron radiation, which has medical and other uses as well as a role in particle research. The site of the accelerator was also moved from a remote area outside Beijing near the Ming tombs into the city.
 President Deng Xiaoping himself showed up to shovel dirt at the groundbreaking. 
 Dr. Panofsky remembered being in Beijing for a presentation on physics and the collider.
 ''Deng shut us up and gave an hour-and-a-half lecture on the beauty of high-energy physics,'' Dr. Panofsky said. To learn the business, a group of Chinese accelerator engineers spent a summer at the Stanford accelerator. 
 ''It was quite a scene,'' Dr. Panofsky recalled. ''We had 30 Chinese engineers in Mao suits running in and out of our lab.'' It only took four years, an astonishingly short time, to build the Beijing collider. 
 ''It was finished on time and on budget,'' said Dr. Chen, who had returned to China from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s to work at the physics institute. where he became director in 1998. The size of the Beijing collider was based on what could be achieved at the time, but it turned out to be a fortuitous choice.
 ''The energy was lower but it was more interesting,'' Dr. Chen said. 
 Particle colliders get their oomph from Einstein's famous equivalence of mass and energy. The more energy they can pack into those tiny fireballs, the closer physicists approach the conditions of the Big Bang itself, and the more massive and strange particles can be created -- as permitted by the laws of physics prevailing at those temperatures and times. 
 New particles, heralding perhaps new laws, are often first glimpsed by the mighty proton colliders. But such collisions are intrinsically messy and hard to understand because of all the junk that lives inside protons, and physicists often leave new particles behind and unstudied in their rush to build the next bigger machine and, in effect, go farther back in time. 
 The energy range of the Beijing collider, 1 to 2.2 billion electron volts per beam, contained a lot of puzzling left-behind physics, including the tau, a sort of superfat electron, for which nature has no obvious purpose, and the so-called J/psi. The J/psi, consisting of a pair of quarks each exhibiting the quantum property known whimsically as charm, set off a revolution and led to Nobel prizes when it was discovered in 1974.
 ''There is a lot going on in that energy region,'' said Frederick A. Harris, a professor of physics at the University of Hawaii, who works often at the Beijing collider. By tuning the energy of their colliding beams, the Chinese researchers have been able to measure the mass of the tau very precisely, as well as carry out detailed studies of the J/psi and similar particles. 
 In the collider's energy range, Dr. Chen said simply, ''We dominate.''
 Among the collider's achievements, Dr. Harris said, was the most precise measurement yet of a number called ''R.'' In the so-called standard model, which currently rules particle physics, this parameter measures the likelihood of fireballs produced in the collider to materialize into so-called hadrons, particles made of quarks as opposed to other, simpler particles known as muons. That involved ''changing the machine energy 91 times,'' explained Dr. Harris.
 When physicists at CERN fire up their new Large Hadron Collider, which will eventually collide protons with 7 trillion electron volts of energy, in search of new particles and clues to new unified laws of physics, the Beijing data on this parameter will be critical to their analyses.
 ''They are all dependent on measurements made in China at lower energy,'' Dr. Harris said. 
 Dr. Panofsky, of the Stanford accelerator, said: ''Most economic growth is not due to new invention, but making things faster and cheaper. High energy physics mirrors this. In China they measure things known to exist better and with higher accuracy than in the West.''
 The improvement of the Beijing collider will extend the Chinese hegemony over this energy range, allowing the experiments to gather 100 times more data on rare events.
 Recently, there has been a flurry of sightings at other particle experiments of other particles made of multiple quarks, including a proton and antiproton stuck together to make a six-quark particle first predicted by the Italian physicist Enrico Fermi in 1948. Confirmation of the existence of such particles would be an important clue for theorists who try to navigate intractable equations to calculate the properties of quarks. 
 ''Do they exist or not?'' Dr. Panofsky asked. ''Tune in next year.''Completing the Beijing improvements, Dr. Chen has said, will also free Chinese accelerator experts to concentrate their energies on the international effort to build the proposed International Linear Collider some time in the next decade. 
 The proposed I.L.C. would shoot electrons and positrons at each other with 500 billion electron volts of energy through a tunnel 20 miles long. An approximate price tag will be announced when the international collider planning team meets in Beijing this February.
 Since this collider is being planned to follow up on discoveries made at CERN, and is likely to cost several billion dollars, it probably won't be approved by the governments that would have to do the heavy financial lifting until the end of the decade -- when the new CERN collider has something to show for itself. 
 ''The I.L.C is still a mythical beast,'' Dr. Panofsky said. 
 Yet the jockeying for where to put the machine has already begun. The host country for the collider would have the advantage of being the center of 21st-century physics, but would have to bear a larger share of the cost. 
 Last spring, a report from the National Academy of Sciences urged the United States to do what it takes to get it built here rather than in Europe or Asia, or face the prospect of relinquishing traditional leadership in physics.
 Barry C. Barish, a California Institute of Technology physicist who is head of the design team for the international collider, said the ''informal plan'' is for China's role to grow in the coming years. Just how much depends on what kind of commitment the Chinese government decides to make.
 Dr. Harris said, ''The rate China is growing, this is something they could contemplate hosting in 10 years.'' Although few accelerator experts expect China to be that aggressive, nobody really knows what the future holds. Given the explosive growth of China's economy and the vow of the country's leaders to emphasize science and technology, it is natural to wonder whether some future particles will have Chinese names the way many of the bright stars in the sky have Arabic names. Thanks to the Beijing collider, said Dr. Chen, ''A new generation of accelerator engineers and data engineers is growing up.'' 
 It has helped them that ''now a person can have a reasonable life if you are interested in science,'' said Dr. Chen, who spent part of the Cultural Revolution years as a high school teacher.
 A middle generation of scientists have returned from the diaspora to pitch in. Among them is Dr. Gao, who came back to China a couple of years ago after spending 15 years in France. He is leading the design of the so-called damping rings that will keep the particle beams of the international collider tightly focused. Dr. Gao said he was struck by the pace of life in today's China. 
 ''Another big surprising change is that all Chinese are very busy in all fields, the work is busy and the life is busy,'' Dr. Gao said. ''I am terribly tired, but very happy, there are too many things to learn, to do and to improve.''

An article in Science Times yesterday about China's particle physics program misstated the title of the Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, who presided at a groundbreaking ceremony in 1982 for a particle accelerator in Beijing. He was called the paramount leader from 1978 until his death in 1997; he was never president.
 The article also misstated an affiliation for Chen Ning Yang, a Nobel laureate in physics who was born in China and has spent most of his career in the United States. He is a longtime professor of physics at Stony Brook University; he was not at Brookhaven National Laboratory in the 1970s.

HEADLINE: Cut And Walk

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
In the 1990s, we became more aware of the importance not only of I.Q. to success but also of ''E.Q.'' -- ''emotional intelligence quotient.'' Authors like Daniel Goleman explained E.Q. in part as an ability to assess, adjust to and influence the emotions of others.
 These days, as we grope for a new policy in Iraq, we desperately need that kind of emotional intelligence, particularly toward overseas nationalism. Insensitivity to nationalism may be the biggest foreign policy mistake the U.S. and Europe alike have made in the last half-century -- from Vietnam to Suez, Mexico to Algeria -- and we've been repeating it in Iraq. 
One of the essential paradoxes is that even well-meaning efforts to stabilize Iraq with our military presence inflame Iraqi nationalism and bolster nationalist extremists. Inadvertently, because we're not sensitive enough to how our actions are perceived in the Iraqi cauldron, we end up empowering extremists who destabilize the country.
 Exhibit A is the shadowy man who has won a reputation as perhaps the single most brutal mass murderer there, Abu Deraa. He is a Shiite who in the late Saddam years was apparently just a petty forger, according to Terrorism Monitor, a publication of the Jamestown Foundation.
 Abu Deraa won renown as a ''patriot'' who attacked U.S. armored vehicles. Then he diversified into criminal kidnapping, which generated cash to make him a player and finance his band of gangsters.
 The whispers about Abu Deraa and his torture of the Sunnis he captures -- he specializes in using electric drills on their skulls -- have won him increasingly mythic status. Some of the biggest and boldest attacks in Iraq are attributed to him, and he brings creativity and economies of scale to his murder enterprise. An Australian news account described how he once drove a fleet of ambulances into a Sunni neighborhood and used loudspeakers to call on young men to donate blood to help fellow Sunnis injured by Shiites. Dozens of young men came forward -- and were executed.
 Abu Deraa told Time magazine, in an interview through an intermediary, that his fight is against ''occupiers, their supporters'' and Sunni insurgents, and he painted himself as a pious Muslim driven by a ''sense of holy duty'' to attack American forces. Those arguments resonate among some Shiites, who see him as a hero and protect him, even as he helps tear his country apart.
 At bottom, Abu Deraa is a psychopathic thug who terrorizes fellow Iraqis. But he has been able to use his attacks on American forces to win political cover to foment civil war.
 So as we Americans plan our own strategy for Iraq, let's show more emotional intelligence. The Iraqi Study Group is right about needing to consult with neighbors like Syria and Iran, but that doesn't resolve another central problem in Iraq: Our open-ended military presence, perceived by Iraqis as a grab for Iraqi oil and bases, ends up legitimizing extremists like Abu Deraa and aggravating civil war.
 Our military presence risks expanding the civil war in another way. As we side more openly with the Shiite government in its struggle against Sunni insurgents, Saudi Arabia -- already nervous about the rise of Shiites -- is hinting that it may help the Sunnis defend themselves. We could end up with a war in which Iran and Iraqi Shiites battle against Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Iraqi Sunni Arabs. (That's when gas prices reach $5 a gallon.)
 So let's raise our E.Q. and take account of Iraqi emotions and nationalist sensitivities, particularly alarm about American bases on Iraqi soil. For starters, we can (as Don Rumsfeld noted in his leaked memo) quickly give back up to 50 of our 55 military bases in Iraq.
 We should also state clearly that we will not keep any permanent military bases in Iraq. That's not going to persuade the extremist insurgents, but polls suggest that such an announcement would reduce the support that extremists get from ordinary Iraqis. That's a simple step that would save American and Iraqi lives.
 The same logic argues for a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq, ending by November 2007. Granted, there is a real risk that the bloodbath will worsen significantly when we leave. But Iraqis themselves say overwhelmingly in polls that our presence is inflaming the violence rather than reducing it, and a timetable would be a useful signal that we really are going to pull out and that Iraqi factions need to conciliate and address their own problems.
 We needn't cut and run. But let's post a schedule, and then cut and walk.

HEADLINE: Risk and Reward

BYLINE: By THOMAS B. EDSALL. 
Thomas B. Edsall, who holds the Pulitzer-Moore Chair at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, is a guest columnist.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The G.O.P. is the party of risk, aggression, military assertion and dominance -- an approach that led to the implosion in Iraq and the Republicans' defeat in November. Now the Democrats have a chance to demonstrate a core difference in how the two parties calculate and manage risk. 
 In ''Fiasco,'' Thomas Ricks describes the results of the Republican approach: ''Bush's decision to invade Iraq ultimately may come to be seen as one of the most profligate actions in the history of American foreign policy. The U.S.-led invasion was launched recklessly, with a flawed plan for war and a worse approach to occupation.'' 
While inflicting destruction on the Iraqis, Bush multiplied America's enemies and endangered this nation's military, economic health and international stature. Courting risk without managing it, Bush repeatedly and remorselessly failed to accurately evaluate the consequences of his actions. 
 The embroilment in Iraq is not an aberration. It stems from core party principles equally evident on the domestic front. For a quarter-century, the Republican temper -- its reckless drive to jettison the social safety net; its support of violence in law enforcement and in national defense; its advocacy of regressive taxation, environmental hazard and pro-business deregulation; its 'remoralizing' of the pursuit of wealth -- has been judged by many voters as essential to America's position in the world, producing more benefit than cost. 
 While some Republican long shots have paid off handsomely (the Reagan administration's accelerated arms race arguably drove the former Soviet Union into bankruptcy), now the dice are turning up snake eyes. In November, voters concluded that the Bush administration had run one risk too many. After 40 years of ascendancy, the G.O.P. has provided Democrats with an opening. Will the Democratic Party, often insufficiently authoritative and bold, manage risk better? Democrats arguably suffer from their own impaired judgment: utopian faith in the power of negotiation and compromise -- naive, perhaps, in a world where the threat of bloodshed is endemic. 
 In this election campaign, the Democratic leadership offered pallid, nonspecific policy initiatives -- in the House, a ''bipartisan solution to strengthen Social Security,'' and in the Senate, a call to ''work together to strengthen Social Security and Medicare.'' 
 Nonetheless, buried in a morass of campaign-season evasion were the outlines of a potentially salable political program. Representative Rahm Emanuel, the Democratic Caucus chairman, pointed out that 16 of the seats the party won in November were suburban or exurban. He contended that the election marked the emergence of a new ''metropolitan'' populism, ''a revolt of the center against the Rovian model of polarization politics.'' In Emanuel's view, ''Prescription drugs, gas prices and economic populism are no longer associated with blue-collar downscale voters. Office park workers can be just as populist as industrial workers -- they are struggling under rising college and health care costs too. They resent giveaways to H.M.O.s; they don't want subsidies to oil companies when oil is 68 bucks a barrel. We are going to deal with the oil royalty issue, and we can cut the interest rates for student loans.''
 Serious Democratic policy makers are beginning to rigorously assess and quantify risk with an eye toward generating growth, calculating ''second-, third- and fourth-order effects,'' while aiming to avoid, for example, the ''silent trade-offs'' that the economic strategist Gene Sperling writes about, which occur when ''well-intentioned policies to protect certain workers or communities impose burdens on similarly situated or worse-off workers who were not included in the immediate cost-benefit calculations.''
 The morass in Iraq has created a Democratic moment. As the party struggles to forge a working majority, it must strike a delicate balance, argue Jason Bordoff and colleagues at the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project. Allocating excessive economic risk to individuals can harm economic growth as well as family well-being, they note. Conversely, ''poorly designed programs to protect against risks can distort economic incentives and impair overall economic performance.''
 For the Democrats to thread this needle will take a steady hand.

HEADLINE: Troubling '07 Forecast for the Old-Line Media but Not for the Online 

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE first Monday in October is known in legal circles as the start of the Supreme Court term. Similarly, on Madison Avenue, the first Monday in December has become familiar as the kickoff of the advertising forecast season.
 And yesterday a flood of forecasts indeed flowed from analysts and agencies, all generally pointing to a challenging year ahead for the traditional media along with substantial growth for all things online.
(For those wondering why early December brings the predictions, it is because two brokerage firms, Credit Suisse and UBS, have long held their annual media conferences in the first week of the month. Other firms schedule the release of their forecasts at the same time, to ride the coattails of the competing conferences.)
 Most forecasters are predicting growth in ad spending in the United States next year of 2 to 5 percent over 2006. That would represent a decline from the rate of growth in ad spending this year compared with 2005, which is expected to finish in the range of 3 to 6 percent. But it is not bad considering that 2007 will be missing two major events that help administer a hypodermic to ad budgets in even-numbered years: Olympics and national elections. 
 ''You normally see a real drop-off in a non-Olympics, non-election year,'' said Robert J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann in New York, who opened the UBS conference.
 Rather, Mr. Coen said, he believed that more marketers next year would increase ad budgets as they decide to ''start turning their attention back to long-term communications'' from a focus on cost-cutting.
 Still, reactions to the predictions for 2007 depend upon the perch from which they are considered. Those in the traditional media like television and newspapers will no doubt frown after hearing that most forecasters expect at best flat growth in ad spending for them.
 Those who sell ads on Web sites, on the other hand, are likely to be beaming at the high double-digit percentage gains being predicted for them.
 ''The trend that will continue to affect the media universe in 2007 is the ongoing shift in advertising dollars from traditional media into nontraditional media, most notably the Internet,'' Fitch Ratings concluded in an outlook report.
 Television, radio and newspapers will ''experience slow growth and ongoing audience declines,'' according to the report, ''and ad spending continues to follow consumer patterns.''
 For instance, the Newspaper Association of America is predicting that spending for ads on the Web sites of newspapers will increase a robust 22 percent next year from 2006. But ad spending in the print editions of those newspapers in 2007 will increase only 1.2 percent from this year, the association is forecasting, pulled down by a decline in classified advertising and no growth in demand from national advertisers.
 An analyst for Credit Suisse, Debra Schwartz, questioned in a report whether even the prediction for an anemic gain of 1.2 percent was ''too optimistic.''
 A forecast from the Morton-Groves Newspaper Newsletter, issued last week, may be pessimistic enough for her. The publication predicted that ad spending in newspapers next year will fall 2 percent from 2006, a bigger decline than the 1.8 percent it is forecasting for this year compared with 2005.
 (For ad spending on newspaper Web sites, the newsletter predicted an increase in 2007 of 23.3 percent from this year, coming after a gain of 34 percent it is forecasting for 2006.)
 James Conaghan, vice president for business analysis and research at the newspaper association, offered a reason for the upbeat outlook for newspaper Web sites.
 In a test recently started by Google to sell advertisements that appear in the print versions of 50 major newspapers, ''the ad volume placed in the newspapers in the first three weeks has exceeded Google's expectation for the entire three months of the test,'' Mr. Conaghan said at the UBS conference.
 ''The advertisers and the publishers are also satisfied with the results,'' he added. 
 Gordon Borrell, chief executive at Borrell Associates, who spoke with Mr. Conaghan, suggested that ''10 years out, many newspaper Web sites could be as large as the newspapers that spawned them'' in terms of ad revenue.
 In another striking example of the divergence in forecasts for the traditional and new media, Mr. Coen, whose agency is part of the McCann Worldgroup unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, predicted that ad spending on the four largest national broadcast television networks would increase just 3 percent next year from 2006.
 In contrast, ad spending by national advertisers on the Internet will grow five times as fast, at 15 percent, Mr. Coen said.
 Mr. Coen does not include search engine marketing in his estimates for Internet ad spending, classifying it as more promotional in nature. Another forecaster who does include it within his online totals -- Steve King, worldwide chief executive at ZenithOptimedia, part of the Publicis Groupe -- offered a prediction that Internet ad spending next year would grow 29 percent from 2006.
 By comparison, Mr. King offered forecasts for many traditional media for percentage gains in low single digits like 1.5 percent for local radio and 2 percent for newspapers.
 In fact, Mr. King said, he expected online ad revenue to grow at ''seven times the rate for traditional ad growth.''
 Internet ad spending as a percentage of the total for all American media will reach 7.1 percent this year, Mr. King said. He predicts that it will hit 10.4 percent in 2009.
 Mr. Coen, who offers forecasts twice a year, predicted that American ad spending in 2007 would total $298.8 billion, up 4.8 percent from $285.1 billion in 2006. That is a full percentage point lower than the 5.8 percent increase he predicted last June when he gave his initial forecast for 2007.
 Mr. Coen's total for 2006 represents an increase of 5.2 percent from 2005. By contrast, last June he forecast a gain of 5.6 percent. Twice before, in June and December 2005, he predicted an increase of 5.8 percent.
 Mr. Coen attributed the decline largely to ''the beleaguered local sector'' of ad spending, ''which hasn't done very well in traditional media,'' he said, because local advertisers ''continue to cut to the bone.''
 Also, ''consolidations are killing things'' locally, Mr. Coen said, referring to combinations of local department stores, pharmacies and hardware chains, which are reducing the ranks of potential advertisers.
 That was demonstrated -- painfully, if you own a local newspaper -- in Mr. Conaghan's presentation. In the third quarter, when Federated Department Stores replaced a host of local retail names with the Macy's brand, he said, the company's ad spending in newspapers fell about 14 percent from the same period a year ago.
 The declines were even more pronounced in certain Macy's regional markets, Mr. Conaghan said, citing decreases of 34 percent in the South, 39 percent in the Midwest and 42 percent in the West.

HEADLINE: Executive Searches, Done With Sharp Elbows

BYLINE: By SARITHA RAI

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
In October, Google snared a prize catch in India, hiring the chief technology officer at Yahoo India to head its research and development center here.
 Yahoo, meanwhile, moved a veteran executive from its headquarters in Sunnyvale, Calif., to take over as chief operating officer of its research center in Bangalore.
The moves by Google and Yahoo, known to chase after the best and the brightest, signal how hot the competition is for top-drawer talent in India. Even as companies continue to hire thousands of skilled workers at lower levels, signs point to a talent shortage that is becoming acute at the high end. 
 Though India is billed as a talent powerhouse, with the largest working-age population in the world, its top executives are being wooed from all directions as its economy booms. A large number of industries are expanding rapidly, new companies are starting up and multinationals are establishing bases in the country. 
 ''The whole country is on a dizzy growth trajectory and talented people are the most crucial factor in this rush,'' said Kishore Biyani, chief executive of the Future Group, a retailing conglomerate. ''There is a dire mismatch in the demand and availability of top people.'' 
 In fact, executive search firms say, some companies in India have begun to look globally for leadership-level hires who combine Western experience with knowledge of operating in the country. 
 ''We are scouting internationally and, increasingly, companies state that costs do not matter,'' said Umesh Ramakrishnan, vice chairman of Christian & Timbers, an executive search firm based in New York.
 Mr. Biyani's industry, retailing, is one of the fast-expanding sectors. A few months ago, the Future Group handpicked Raghu Pillai, an experienced executive from the retail conglomerate RPG Group, to be chief executive of Future Group's home retail chain stores. But weeks later, Mr. Pillai was enticed away by the retailing unit of India's energy conglomerate, Reliance Industries, to be chief executive for operations and strategy of an ambitious start-up.
 The Future Group expects more than $1 billion in revenue in the financial year ending in June 2007, and is projecting 80 to 100 percent growth annually in the next few years. Since organized retailing is a relatively new phenomenon in the country, Future and other companies are poaching talent from such industries as consumer products and hospitality. 
 But retailing is just one industry where top talent is in short supply. Engineering, technology, drug and manufacturing companies are in similar straits. 
 ''The battle for best talent is extremely fierce,'' said Deepak Gupta, the managing director and head of the India office of the executive search firm Korn/Ferry International. With globalization accelerating in the last few years, there is a finite number of people with the global mind-set and the specialized management skills who are available to companies, he said.
 Mr. Gupta said the demand for ''best in class'' people was strong even in sectors like financial services. Executives at private equity firms, hedge funds and private banking companies are in big demand as global firms like Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs expand rapidly in India. 
 As many companies go through a sudden growth spurt, plundering entire teams from rivals is becoming par for the course, as Reliance Retail did this year with the supply chain team at its rival, Bharti Enterprises. 
 Compensation levels in India have risen strikingly in the last couple of years. Mr. Gupta of Korn/Ferry said salaries of top professionals were rising even faster than the annual general market increases of 16 to 17 percent. 
 In addition to the lure of American-level compensation packages, some top jobs also come with generous perks that can include furnished luxury accommodations with chauffeurs, servants and gardeners; children's schooling at international schools; and stock options and guaranteed bonuses. 
 ''India is a much bigger player today in the globalized world'' than even a year ago, said Mr. Ramakrishnan of Christian & Timbers. He noted that demand for senior executives in fields like technology, life sciences and financial services was exploding. 
 So acute is the problem that many search specialists report that only one in three vacant top-level slots can be filled. Even the time taken to fill senior positions has doubled to 120 days.
 As new companies start up and older ones expand, there is not enough talent to go around. According to a recent study by one executive search firm, EMA Partners International, 66 percent of Indian companies changed chief executives in the last five years, with the turnover rates higher at technology firms (88 percent), financial services firms (70 percent) and drug companies (67 percent). 
 ''There are new projects, new customers, and all this requires people with solid experience,'' said Nandu S. Pradhan, who recently took over as managing director of Red Hat India. 
 Mr. Pradhan moved from top-level positions at Novell and the outsourcing firm Symphony Services, all in the last few months.
 With the talent pool thin at the top, the net is being cast for more than just overseas executives of Indian origin -- a category referred to as boomerang professionals -- but also for Americans and Europeans with an Indian connection who want to come to India ''because they feel this is where all the action is,'' Mr. Ramakrishnan said. In a sign of a maturing job market, companies in software, semiconductors, telecommunications, airlines and hospitality are looking at foreign talent.
 Max New York Life, an insurance joint venture, hired an American expatriate from Hong Kong to run its operations, and Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs moved expatriates from London and New York to develop their Indian businesses.
 But some companies have found that foreign executives can have a tough time adapting to the local business culture, impeding their success. That puts even more of a premium on the most global of local candidates.
 In somewhat of a twist, Mr. Biyani of the Future Group said that Indian top executives are often the most expensive to hire. The topmost layer of talent is a thin sliver of well-qualified Indians who are all above the radar. ''I have been able to draw foreigners to some of my top positions at half the salaries,'' he said. His group has hired professionals from South Africa, the United States and Britain. 
 Mr. Pradhan of Red Hat said the hiring of Indian executives by Western companies for foreign assignments further depleted the talent bank. ''The global executive from India is moving into senior regional and global roles, leaving behind a void in the local market,'' he said.
 Faced with the problem of finding the right talent to sustain momentum in a competitive environment, specialists predict that there will be considerable churn of top talent in the next 12 to 24 months. 
 Many companies, meanwhile, are already betting on potential and are hiring rising talent. ''Or else, how long can Yahoo and Google exchange people?'' Mr. Ramakrishnan asked.

HEADLINE: Tax Breaks Seem to Favor Affluent Areas

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
Twenty-five years after New York State overhauled its property tax system under court pressure, disparities have widened in how New York City taxes real property, with many homeowners in affluent areas disproportionately benefiting from tax breaks, an analysis has found.
 The analysis, by the city's Independent Budget Office, found that many owners of condominiums and co-ops -- especially on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side, where such buildings are concentrated -- benefit from an arcane provision of state law that artificially deflates the assessed value of their apartments. 
And house owners in two Brooklyn neighborhoods where home prices have risen markedly, Park Slope and Carroll Gardens, have the lowest effective tax rates of any part of the city, because assessment caps have blocked taxes from keeping pace with the huge rise in market values. The caps have also helped other Brooklyn neighborhoods, like Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where home prices have soared at an even higher rate. The term effective tax rate means the tax per $100 of market value.
 In 1975, the State Court of Appeals ruled that the state had failed to follow a requirement from the late 18th century that property tax assessments be based on the full market value of properties. The 61-page report found that because of changes since then, homeowners in poorer neighborhoods are no longer overtaxed compared with homeowners in richer neighborhoods, but that other disparities remain. Among the key findings:
 Renters, who typically have less money than homeowners to begin with, live in buildings that are taxed more heavily. The effective tax rate for rental apartment buildings is now 5.5 times the rate for co-ops, compared with 1.8 times in 1997. 
 While one-, two- and three-family homes account for 41 percent of the market value of all city property, they generate less than 14 percent of property tax revenues; commercial properties, which make up 16 percent of total market value, generate 43 percent.
 The effective tax rate for homeowners has actually fallen 65 percent since 1984 -- even after an 18.5 percent property tax increase phased in under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in 2003 and 2004, but the effective tax rate for owners of commercial property has dropped only 18 percent.
 The city collects 51.6 percent of its property taxes from owners of residential property and 48.4 percent from owners of nonresidential property, a far smaller difference than in other big cities, like Los Angeles (73.1 percent and 26.9 percent), Houston (62.4 percent and 37.6 percent) or Philadelphia (69 percent and 31 percent). 
 The report's conclusions suggest that New York City's property tax system, which will collect roughly $13 billion this fiscal year, is profoundly skewed, with broad implications. The heavier relative burden on commercial property may hinder economic development, while the relatively higher taxes on rental buildings help explain why many renters pay a high share of their income for housing. 
 ''The burden of paying the property tax is not shared equally among owners of residential property and, in many cases, these disparities are widening,'' said Ronnie Lowenstein, director of the Independent Budget Office. 
 After the court ruling, the Legislature overhauled the statewide property tax system in 1981 but preserved its central feature -- favorable treatment of homeowners -- and largely locked in the share of taxes paid by each class of property. 
 The growth in homeowners' taxes has been curbed partly because the 1981 law limited the assessment increases for one, two- and three-family properties to 6 percent in a single year, and 20 percent over five years, regardless of how fast market value is rising. (Assessment increases due to physical improvements are not subject to the cap.)
 But rental buildings of more than 10 units and commercial properties do not have such caps; the law requires that market-driven assessment changes be phased in over five years, so those property owners' taxes rise much more quickly in a rapidly appreciating market.
 Furthermore, assessments for co-ops and condos are often artificially deflated because a provision in the 1981 law prohibits city assessors from looking at the sale prices of these apartments when determining market value. Instead, the city imputes the value of the condo or co-op by looking at comparable rental buildings nearby, and since those buildings are often rent-regulated, the resulting assessments for co-ops and condos are deflated.
 Although Eliot Spitzer made ''middle-class property tax relief'' a centerpiece of his campaign for governor, the analysis said major change is unlikely: ''An effort to craft fundamental reforms would have to tread the same political minefield of competing interests and policy concerns as Albany legislators faced more than two decades ago.''

HEADLINE: Plan for Nascar Speedway Is Scrapped on Staten Island

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER; Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Faced with unyielding opposition from residents who complained that Staten Island's roads were already too congested, a Florida company dropped plans for a 82,000-seat Nascar speedway on the island, officials said yesterday.
 After two years, plans for the speedway -- a three-quarter-mile track to have been built on an abandoned oil tank farm near the Goethals Bridge -- were scuttled on Thursday by the board of directors of the International Speedway Corporation, said Wes Harris, a company spokesman.
''The reality of it is the board came to the conclusion that the politics was going to be such that we could not be successful,'' Mr. Harris said. 
 In May 2004, officials of the company, a Nascar affiliate based in Daytona Beach, Fla., announced plans to transform 450 acres of unused industrial land on the northwest tip of Staten Island into the New York base for the country's most popular sport. 
 In order to relieve the inevitable traffic, they had proposed a complex network of ferries, charter buses and park-and-ride lots that would have allowed fans to reach the site during the three race weekends that were expected to be scheduled each year.
 They had also promised more than $350 million in construction wages during the two years it would have taken to build the track and said the track would have contributed $200 million to the economy annually, including ticket sales, food and beverage sales and hotel bookings. To help them navigate the shoals of city politics, they hired Guy V. Molinari, a former borough president, as a lobbyist.
 But Mr. Harris acknowledged yesterday that the board finally realized that even Mr. Molinari, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment last night, could not help them overcome Staten Island's three-man City Council team, which came out in vociferous and early opposition to the track. 
 One of the councilmen, James S. Oddo, the Council's minority leader, called the company's move ''a monumental victory for the people of Staten Island'' in a statement released yesterday. Another, Michael E. McMahon, called the development ''a huge victory'' and ''delightful,'' saying he had considered the project a ''sow's ear'' from the start.
 ''I am glad that the Nascar people finally understand what I have said all along,'' Mr. McMahon said in his statement, ''that to put a 100,000-seat Nascar track on the west shore of Staten Island is what my mother would call a schnapps idea.''
 Almost from the start, the plan was met with condemnation from a diverse crowd of skeptics, including Manhattan-based environmentalists and Staten Island homemakers.
 In April, the Sierra Club issued a report saying the project would pollute the air, require filling in nearly 15 acres of fragile saltwater wetlands and harm several wildlife species.
 A few days later, a public hearing on the track devolved into fisticuffs when more than 1,000 people converged on a meeting hall in Staten Island, including a union carpenter who tussled with Staten Island's third councilman, Andrew J. Lanza.
 At the time, Mr. Lanza said he was simply trying to express his views when ''a guy put a bear hug on me, threatening me while guys standing in front of him were urging him, 'Punch him in the face.' '' After the confrontation, the police shut down the hearing, saying the auditorium's capacity had been exceeded. There was no other hearing on the matter. 
 ''We honestly don't know what happened at that hearing ourselves,'' said Michael P. Printup, an International Speedway official. There was support for the track early on, according to Mr. Printup, but after the hearing, ''something turned.''
 Mr. Harris said the company, which bought the land for $100 million, would now study other ways to use it, though he refused to say last night what those might be.
 He also refused to give up on the idea of bringing Nascar racing to the nation's largest media market, though he admitted that New York could be a tough town for business.
 In Chicago, he said, it took several tries for International Speedway to settle on a site for a track, but eventually the company was successful.
 ''The challenge with New York is everything's magnified 10 times over,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Glittery Atlantic City, 4 Walked Dark, Deadly Path

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and SERGE F. KOVALESKI; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY, Dec. 3 

 BODY:
In this seaside resort town where vice has long been a lucrative commodity, there was nothing particularly noteworthy about four crack-addled prostitutes who lost the struggle to survive in the underground economy that flourishes alongside the shimmering casinos. 
 Only two of the women had even been reported missing before their decayed bodies were found in a drainage ditch on the outskirts of town three days before Thanksgiving.
''Sometimes you don't see a girl for a few weeks, but that's the way it is,'' said Zandra Kiesel, 32, who says she has been a prostitute here for five years. ''We are just hookers. It's like nobody would miss us if we were gone.''
 In the 25 years since legalized gambling helped transform Atlantic City from a faded resort to a popular destination for weekend slots players, casino companies have reaped immense profits, but the city itself has experienced both boom and bust. Thirty-four million tourists come each year, pumping billions of dollars into the local economy and providing more than 45,000 jobs. 
 That economy has evolved into a two-tiered system catering to the addicted. Inside the casinos, where prostitutes work the sprawling halls, betting is legal and the state has even exempted gamblers from its indoor smoking ban. On the sketchy streets outside, sex and drugs are sold openly, around the clock, as dozens of prostitutes prowl the avenues and side streets just off the Boardwalk offering sexual encounters for as little as $10 -- the price of a rock of crack cocaine and a five-minute high.
 What has emerged in the days since the bodies were discovered in a spongy strip of land between the Black Horse Pike and the Atlantic City Expressway is that each of the four women came to Atlantic City to escape something: abusive relationships, relatives who objected to their drug habits, or street life in other cities considered to be more dangerous. 
 Once they were here, their drug-fueled descent landed them on the lowest rung in Atlantic City's social order, a strip of rundown motels just outside of town where prostitutes are so desperate to feed their habits that rocks of crack cocaine are the preferred method of payment.
 ''These problems have been coming up the pike from Atlantic City and have been for years,'' said James J. McCullough, the mayor of neighboring Egg Harbor Township, where the four slain women were found. ''We are feeling a lot of frustration and a certain degree of helplessness.''
 As the police hunt a possible serial killer, several officers who spoke on the condition of anonymity said there are no obvious suspects or solid leads.
 The Atlantic County prosecutor, Jeffrey S. Blitz, has more than two dozen investigators on the case, showing photographs of at least two men as they canvass neighborhoods in and around the city. But an employee at the Quality Hotel, across the street from where the bodies were found, said that when the authorities came by on Wednesday, they acknowledged they were not close to solving the case. 
 ''The police said they have no leads and are frustrated,'' she said. 
 Local lore has long been that the Police Department takes a laissez-faire attitude toward prostitution. A lawsuit settled this year bolstered that notion: the city agreed to pay an undisclosed amount to a former vice-squad detective who claimed he was demoted in 2001 for defying a directive by the police chief at the time to stop arresting streetwalkers. The city's current chief, John Mooney, declined to discuss the suit, but in the court file, officials never refute the contention that police commanders had disbanded the department's prostitution unit and discouraged arrests.
 In court papers, the detective's lawyer put it bluntly: ''They gave the green light to the red-light district.''

Kimberly Raffo
 It was Atlantic City's permissiveness that attracted Kimberly Raffo, a Brooklyn native who moved here from Pembroke Pines, Fla. 
 Sometime in 2002, relatives noticed a drastic shift in Ms. Raffo's behavior, and she seemed eager to break free from the boredom of her suburban life. Her sister, Maria Santos, said Ms. Raffo began taking culinary courses in Hollywood, Fla., started an affair with a student there, and began smoking crack cocaine. She refused to give up her lover or her habit and instead left behind her husband, two children and four-bedroom home and fled to Atlantic City, her sister said. 
 ''It's so crazy,'' Ms. Santos said. ''If you knew the woman before the last three years of her life, she was like Martha Stewart.''
 Ms. Raffo, 35, worked as a waitress in several restaurants here before turning to prostitution. Joseph Boccino, the owner of Papa Joe's, a diner on Pacific Avenue here frequented by prostitutes, said she and others seemed to enjoy the independence of working the streets, where they could make their own hours and answer only to their addictions.
 ''They didn't have pimps and they could come and go,'' said Mr. Boccino, who gave Ms. Raffo a cosmetic kit for Christmas last year.
 On the morning of Nov. 19, Mr. Boccino said, Ms. Raffo showed up at the diner shortly after it opened at 2:30 a.m. and ordered her usual breakfast: two fried eggs, American cheese and sausage on a kaiser roll, and a Mountain Dew. He said she then walked out on the street and got into a Black Nissan Maxima with out-of-state license plates. She was not seen again until the next day, when her lifeless body was one of four found face down near rusted train tracks.

Barbara V. Breidor
 Barbara Breidor, who at 42 was the oldest of the victims, knew both sides of Atlantic City. She grew up in an affluent Philadelphia suburb, and spent many summers in Margate, N.J., another well-off town down the beach from the casinos. She later worked in a shop her mother owned, selling jewelry and Native American artifacts on the Boardwalk. 
 But after her mother sold the business, Ms. Breidor worked as a waitress at the Tropicana in the late 1980s, and friends and relatives said she soon began abusing prescription painkillers. Ms. Breidor -- a bright young woman who studied briefly at Penn State, dreamed of a career in law and loved to watch the History Channel -- then moved on to heroin and cocaine, starting the addiction that defined the rest of her life. 
 When she and her boyfriend had a daughter in 1997, they let Ms. Breidor's relatives in Florida raise the child. In 2003, after the boyfriend spent time in prison for armed robbery, Ms. Breidor returned to Atlantic City in the hope of rekindling the relationship, said her sister, Francine Lentes. The reconciliation failed, but Ms. Breidor stayed for the reason so many gamblers are lured here: the prospect of making big money. 
 ''She used to say how she dreamed about getting a real nice place to lay her head down,'' said Tracy Morgan, a prostitute who worked the same tawdry strip,
 But Ms. Breidor's crack habit, which Ms. Morgan said cost as much as $300 a day, left little room for her to recapture the comfortable lifestyle of her youth. She drifted from flophouses to friends' apartments, leaving behind a trail of belongings, personal papers and bail receipts. Wherever she went, Ms. Breidor was meticulous about caring for the glass crack pipe she kept wrapped in a napkin in her pocket like some holy relic, Ms. Morgan said. 
 Desperate for drugs, Ms. Breidor began trading her body for cocaine along Black Horse Pike, where even many of Atlantic City's hardened prostitutes are reluctant to tread. By mid-October, her behavior had become so unpredictable that when she failed to return from a two-hour errand, friends waited weeks before notifying the police.

Tracy Ann Roberts
 Tracy Ann Roberts, 23, who medical examiners say was asphyxiated before she was dumped in the ravine, gravitated to Atlantic City because it seemed a promising place to make a living as an exotic dancer. But drug use left her so emaciated that club owners deemed her unfit for the stage, so she turned to the streets, said a friend, Jannette Brown, herself a former prostitute and drug addict. 
 A native of Bear, Del., about 50 miles from Atlantic City, Ms. Roberts dropped out of high school at 16 and eventually began studying to become a medical assistant. But after bearing a child and breaking up with her boyfriend, she began using cocaine heavily, drifting between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
 Ms. Roberts made her final journey here in August, trying to escape an abusive relationship. But in early November, a man who wanted to be Ms. Roberts's pimp punched her in the throat so hard that she coughed up blood and had to be hospitalized, said a friend, a 29-year-old prostitute who goes by the street name Kim Possible.
 After the attack, Ms. Roberts, who had been known for her uncommon willingness to share drugs and for the Southern accent she had retained from a brief time in Georgia, became withdrawn, her voice a whisper.
 ''Her spirit changed,'' said another prostitute who worked with Ms. Roberts. ''She wasn't the same.''

Molly Jean Dilts
 Molly Jean Dilts was the only one of the four victims who did not have a criminal record for prostitution. But people in Atlantic City said Ms. Dilts -- well known as a cherub-faced girl who called herself Amber or Princess -- could often be seen flaunting her 20-year-old body on some of the town's roughest blocks. 
 An aunt, Margret Dilts, said her niece fled home in Black Lick, Pa., just outside Pittsburgh, in mid-October after a string of tragedies: her mother died of cancer several years ago and her brother was fatally shot in 2005. Ms. Dilts, who had been arrested several times for assault, public intoxication and possession of drug paraphernalia, gave birth to a son, Jeremiah, 14 months ago, but gave the child to her relatives to raise.
 Friends said her troubles haunted her despite countless vials of crack cocaine. In the weeks before she was killed, Ms. Dilts told friends she had been making herself throw up because she was concerned that her weight was making it harder to attract men.
 One friend, Richard Hernandez, said that Ms. Dilts was a prostitute, and that she had told him she considered overdosing on pills or hanging herself. ''Molly cried a lot,'' said Mr. Hernandez, 30, who met Ms. Dilts when she was buying crack cocaine on Georgia Avenue. ''I'd always hug her, because if you started talking with her, she'd cry.''

Back to the Status Quo
 In the two weeks since the discovery of the four dead women, life here has largely returned to the sensory overload that is Atlantic City's status quo. Busloads of tourists stream off the highways and head straight for the casinos, passing the swath of land where the bodies were found, as prostitutes and drug dealers do business in plain sight. 
 Local buzz quickly turned from concern over a serial killer roaming the streets to claims by a radio talk show host that she had been given a videotape of a city councilman receiving oral sex from a prostitute on the Boardwalk. 
 ''It is important that business now gets engaged in seeking solutions,'' said Joseph Kelly, president of the Atlantic City Regional Mainland Chamber of Commerce, though he acknowledged that ''the business community doesn't have an existing plan.''
 Mayor Robert W. Levy has said little about the killings and even less about the city's approach to enforcing vice laws. Reached at his home Saturday night, he emphatically declined to discuss Atlantic City's prostitution and drug problems.
 ''This is my home, this is my night, this is my weekend,'' Mr. Levy shouted. ''I just came home from a funeral. I got nothing to say about nothing.''
 Detectives are still not certain whether the killer may have claimed more victims, and have been inquiring about other streetwalkers not seen in weeks. 
 The authorities have also been searching for links between the current case and the attacks on three prostitutes whose throats were slashed earlier this year, leaving two of them dead, though Mr. Blitz has said they appear unrelated.
 Despite those violent deaths -- and the prospect that there may actually be two serial killers preying on the city's prostitutes -- local officials say they don't expect any decrease in the number of people drawn to the excitement of Atlantic City. 
 ''There are 30 million people a year who pass through this little town with 36,000 residents,'' said William Southrey, president of the Atlantic City Rescue Mission. ''So if someone is looking for action, there are things going on all the time, legal opportunities and perverse ones.''

HEADLINE: Offering Video, Israel Answers Critics on War

BYLINE: By GREG MYRE; Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut, Lebanon.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Israel's military, which has been accused of abuses in its war against Hezbollah this summer, has declassified photographs, video images and prisoner interrogations to buttress its accusation that Hezbollah systematically fired from civilian neighborhoods in southern Lebanon and took cover in those areas to shield itself from attack.
 Lebanon and international human rights groups have accused Israel of war crimes in the 34 days of fighting in July and August, saying that Israel fired into populated areas and that civilians accounted for a vast majority of the more than 1,000 Lebanese killed.
Israel says that it tried to avoid civilians, but that Hezbollah fired from civilian areas, itself a war crime, which made those areas legitimate targets. 
 In a new report, an Israeli research group says Hezbollah stored weapons in mosques, battled Israelis from inside empty schools, flew white flags while transporting missiles and launched rockets near United Nations monitoring posts.
 The detailed report on the war was produced by the Intelligence and Terrorism Information Center at the Center for Special Studies, a private research group headed by Reuven Erlich, a retired colonel in military intelligence, who worked closely with the Israeli military.
 An advance copy was given to The New York Times by the American Jewish Congress, which has itself fought against the use of ''human shields,'' provided consultation and translated the study.
 In Lebanon, a Hezbollah official denied the study's allegations, saying its military units were based outside towns and villages and had come into populated areas only when circumstances required it. ''We tried to avoid having to fight among civilian areas, but when Israeli troops entered villages, we were automatically forced to fight them from inside these villages to defend it,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on military matters.
 Israel's critics charge that its military either singled out civilians or was reckless in its pursuit of Hezbollah. The new report is an attempt to rebut such criticism. 
 The report includes Israeli Air Force video that it says shows several instances of Hezbollah personnel firing rockets next to residential buildings in southern Lebanon and then being bombed by Israel. The adjacent buildings were presumably damaged, but there is no information on whether civilians were inside.
 ''This study explains the dilemma facing the Israeli military as it fights an enemy that intentionally operates from civilian areas,'' Mr. Erlich said. ''This is the kind of asymmetric warfare we are seeing today. It's not only relevant to Lebanon, but is also what we are seeing in the Gaza Strip and in Iraq.''
 The report says: ''The construction of a broad military infrastructure, positioned and hidden in populated areas, was intended to minimize Hezbollah's vulnerability. Hezbollah would also gain a propaganda advantage if it could represent Israel as attacking innocent civilians.''
 In video from July 23, a truck with a multi-barreled missile launcher, presumably from Hezbollah, is parked in a street, sandwiched between residential buildings. The video was transmitted from an Israeli missile approaching the truck. The screen goes fuzzy as the missile slams into the target.
 In another video, from a Lebanese village, rockets are seen being fired from a launcher on the back of a truck. The truck then drives a short distance and disappears inside a building. Seconds later, the building itself disappears under a cloud of smoke from an Israeli bomb.
 The report says that there were many such examples, and that Hezbollah has been preparing for such an engagement for years, embedding its fighters and their weapons in the Shiite villages of southern Lebanon. When Hezbollah fired its rockets from those areas, Israel faced a choice of attacking, and possibly causing civilian casualties, or refraining from shooting because of the risk, the report said.
 Elias Hanna, a retired Lebanese Army general, said of the Israeli allegations, ''Of course there are hidden invisible tunnels, bunkers of missile launchers, bunkers of explosive charges amongst civilians.''
 He added: ''You cannot separate the southern society from Hezbollah, because Hezbollah is the society and the society is Hezbollah. Hezbollah is holding this society together through its political, military and economic services. It is providing the welfare for the south.''
 Asked whether Hezbollah should be seen as responsible for the deaths of Lebanese civilians in the war, he replied: ''Of course Hezbollah is responsible. But these people are ready to sacrifice their lives for Hezbollah. If you tell them, 'Your relative died,' they will tell you 'No, he was a martyr.' The party's military preparations from 2000 till 2006 took place in their areas. They were of course done with complete secrecy, but in accordance with the civilians.''
 During the war, Israel dropped leaflets urging villagers to leave southern Lebanon and also to evacuate from Hezbollah strongholds in southern Beirut. Many did flee, but some remained and among them were hundreds who were killed. 
 In one highly publicized Israeli strike on July 30, at least 28 Lebanese civilians, including many women and children, were killed when Israel bombed a residential building in the village of Qana. Israel said it struck a Hezbollah rocket cell that had recently fired from near the building.
 In several other instances, Israel bombed vehicle convoys that were trying to leave the combat zone in southern Lebanon, killing many civilians. Human Rights Watch, a New York-based advocacy group, said shortly before the war ended that it had documented the deaths of 27 Lebanese civilians killed while trying to flee.
 Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, wrote shortly after the war that the Israeli military ''seemed to assume that because it gave warnings to civilians to evacuate southern Lebanon, anyone who remained was a Hezbollah fighter.''
 He wrote, ''But giving warnings, as required by international humanitarian law, does not relieve the attacker of the duty to distinguish between civilians and combatants and to target only combatants.''
 Amnesty International said that Israel ''consistently failed to adopt necessary precautionary measures,'' and that its forces ''carried out indiscriminate and disproportionate attacks on a large scale.''
 The group also accused Hezbollah of ''serious violations of international humanitarian law'' for deliberately attacking Israeli civilians with rockets. But it did not address the accusation that Hezbollah hid its militants among Lebanese civilians.
 The Israeli report defended the Israeli operations, saying ''airstrikes and ground attacks against Hezbollah targets located in population centers were carried out in accordance with international law, which does not grant immunity to a terrorist organization deliberately hiding behind civilians.''
 The Israeli report included video of what it said were three Hezbollah prisoners being questioned by Israeli military personnel.
 Muhammad Srour, a young Hezbollah fighter, said he had initially received training in Iran and was undergoing further training in eastern Lebanon's Bekaa Valley when the war broke out. He was sent to the front lines.
 Like many Hezbollah fighters, he traveled by motorbike, but they were frequently the targets of Israeli forces. While transporting missiles, hidden in cloth, in and around the southern village of Aita al Shaab, ''I carried a white flag,'' Mr. Srour said.
 Hezbollah operated freely from homes in the village, with the permission of residents who had fled. The departing residents either left their doors unlocked or gave their keys to Hezbollah, he said. Mr. Srour acknowledged that homes used by Hezbollah were more likely to draw fire.
 But, he said, ''better that the house is destroyed and the Israelis don't enter and come back to conquer Lebanon.''
 Another captured fighter, Hussein Suleiman, explained how he had set up a rocket-firing position on the front porch of a house on the outskirts of Aita al Shaab.
 A third Hezbollah man, Maher Kourani, said group members had worn civilian clothes, tried never to show their weapons, and traveled in ordinary civilian cars. ''We use Volvos, Mercedes, BMW,'' he said. ''We use Range Rovers, too.''
 The Israeli report makes frequent references to Hezbollah's using Lebanese civilians as human shields, though it cites only two villages where it says Hezbollah prevented residents from leaving. Mr. Erlich acknowledged that over all, Hezbollah did not use coercion against Lebanese civilians.
 Rather, he said, ''Hezbollah was operating inside a supportive population, and cynically used them to further its own goals.''
 Hezbollah fired some 4,000 rockets into northern Israel, and most Israeli civilians either fled the region or took refuge in bomb shelters.
 Over all, more than 1,000 Lebanese were killed, and a vast majority were civilians, according to the Lebanese government. Hezbollah has said that no more than 100 of its fighters were killed.
 The Israeli report disputes this, claiming that at least 450 and perhaps as many as 650 of the Lebanese dead were from Hezbollah.
 Israel suffered 159 deaths, including 41 civilians and 118 military personnel, according to the report.
 Israel withdrew its troops from southern Lebanon in 2000 after a presence of nearly two decades, much of it spent fighting Hezbollah. There was periodic cross-border shelling in the ensuing years.
 The war erupted on July 12 when Hezbollah crossed the border and attacked an Israeli jeep patrol, killing three soldiers and capturing two more, who remain held by Hezbollah, according to the group.
 The fighting stopped Aug. 14, shortly after the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701, which reaffirmed an earlier resolution calling for Lebanese militias to disarm.
 Israel says Hezbollah has only hidden its weapons and is being resupplied from its longtime patrons, Syria and Iran. Israel continues to send warplanes on reconnaissance missions over southern Lebanon, despite criticism from the United Nations forces in the region.


CORRECTION-DATE: December 7, 2006

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Tuesday about an Israeli report that accused Hezbollah militants of using Lebanese civilians as human shields during the war this summer referred imprecisely to how Amnesty International handled the issue. While it was not addressed in Amnesty's Sept. 14 report on the war, it was in a Nov. 21 report, in which the organization acknowledged the presence of Hezbollah fighters and weapons in civilian areas. But it said this was not conclusive evidence of intent to use civilians as human shields.

HEADLINE: New Orleans Picks Professor To Lead Efforts On Rebuilding

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Amid continuing criticism that the city's recovery has lagged 15 months after Hurricane Katrina, Mayor C. Ray Nagin appointed an official on Monday to manage the rebuilding efforts. 
 Mr. Nagin's new ''executive director for recovery management'' is Edward J. Blakely, a former chairman of the department of city and regional planning at the University of California, Berkeley, who helped Oakland, Calif., recover from the earthquake of 1989 and the brush fire of 1991. He is now professor of urban planning at the University of Sydney in Australia.
''There are a lot of plans, and these plans have to be brought together under one umbrella,'' Dr. Blakely said Monday at a news conference. 
 Like other facets of New Orleans's tortuous comeback, the appointment of a ''recovery czar'' for the city has been pending for months. But at Monday's announcement, Dr. Blakely's precise responsibilities were not spelled out by Mr. Nagin, only that he would ''coordinate and direct recovery efforts.'' 
 Mr. Nagin rejected a formal plan for the city's recovery months ago, because he considered it too politically divisive, as under the plan some neighborhoods were to receive greater attention than others. 
 Since then some parts of New Orleans have returned to life but many have not, particularly those most devastated by the poststorm flooding of September 2005. At least half the population remains displaced, block after block of houses are still vacant and gutted, downtown New Orleans is moribund, and some neighborhoods are reverting to green space. 
 Mr. Nagin, meanwhile, has made only intermittent pronouncements about the city's recovery, saying mostly that it should be guided by the citizens. 
 The mayor's hands-off approach -- Mr. Nagin has said he believes New Orleans's recovery should be ''market driven'' -- intensified calls for a competent manager to take charge. Monday's announcement drew a qualified welcome from some who have looked critically on the efforts to date. 
 ''What will be significant will be when they actually itemize his responsibilities,'' said Rob Couhig, a lawyer here who ran unsuccessfully against Mr. Nagin in last spring's mayoral election, and who has been serving as an unpaid adviser to the mayor. ''It's like a lot of things. You wish it happened earlier, but better today than tomorrow.'' 
 Under the loose, citizen-driven process sanctioned by the city, no single plan exists as yet for the recovery. Citizens continue to meet -- they did so again this past Saturday, some linked by satellite feeds from Houston, Atlanta, Dallas and elsewhere -- and exchange ideas for infrastructure renewal, for example, under municipal auspices. 
 Further meetings are planned, though it is unclear how much federal money will be available for whatever is eventually decided on, and there is evidence that citizens here are increasingly weary of the process, after more than a year of similar meetings. 
 Asked Monday why it had taken so long to name a recovery czar, Mr. Nagin responded: ''I wanted to make sure we had some momentum and clarity. We now have that. We now have clarity in the planning process.''

When the home she had rented for 30 years for $300 a month was sold, Alice Greenwood and her 6-year-old son joined an estimated 1,000 people living in tents along the 13 miles of beaches on the Waianae Coast of Oahu.
 ''There was no choice but to come on the beach,'' said Ms. Greenwood, 60, who is disabled because of a work-related injury eight years ago and lost her benefits a month before losing her home. 
Homelessness in Hawaii has become so pervasive that the governor has assigned a state employee to work full time at getting people off the beaches and into transitional housing. Once there, they have access to rent assistance programs and low-income housing.
 While hundreds of homeless people live on Honolulu's beaches, including the tourist center Waikiki, it is the Waianae Coast on the semiarid west shore where the problem is most visible. The population of Waianae, home to about 40,000 of Oahu's 900,000 people, is predominantly native Hawaiian and is historically low income. 
 Hawaii's economy has been strong in the last two years, and the state consistently has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. The real estate market has skyrocketed along with the job growth, and houses on the Waianae Coast that rented for $200 or $300 a month a couple of years ago are now advertised for more than $1,000.
 Nobody knows exactly how many people are living on the beach. Kaulana Park, the state's point man for the homeless, estimated that more than 1,000 people lived on the Waianae Coast beaches, but he cautioned that any count was good only on the day it was taken. And that estimate does not account for the hidden homeless: people who sleep on a relative's sofa, or in their cars, or camp in areas not as visible as the public beaches. 
 Many living on the beach have jobs, mostly in the service and construction sectors. They include families with children, who attend public schools by day and sleep in tents on the beach at night.
 Venise Lewis, 35, who lives near Ms. Greenwood at Maili Beach Park with her husband and two of their four children, said her daughters, ages 8 and 10, must finish their homework in the afternoon because there was no lighting at the beach after sunset. 
 Ms. Lewis's oldest daughter lives with a grandmother, and her son lives with the family's pastor.
 ''They don't like the idea of living on the beach,'' she said of her younger children. ''Usually when we go camping, we go home if it rains.''
 The homeless problem in Hawaii came to light in March, when the City and County of Honolulu began a cleanup of Ala Moana Beach Park, at the entrance to Waikiki, and began closing the park at night in response to complaints. 
 Hundreds of homeless people, or ''illegal campers,'' as the city calls them, moved to an emergency transitional shelter set up by the state in a warehouse close to downtown Honolulu. But some went west, closer to the Waianae Coast communities where they were raised. The city has since conducted similar cleanups at other beaches.
 Lester Chang, the city's parks and recreation director, said the number of illegal campers made it difficult for his department to keep the parks safe and clean. 
 ''I think all communities have to deal with this situation, but Hawaii is unique because it's an island,'' Mr. Chang said. ''There's no place to push them off to.''
 Honolulu officials say finding long-term solutions to the homeless problem on Oahu is the state's responsibility. The city's housing department was abolished in the late 1990s after a scandal.
 Mr. Park has been talking with New York City officials about how to adapt New York's solutions to an island state. 
 He said he was inspired by a speech last summer by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who told of how the city had secured financing for some 12,000 units of supportive housing, and of the city's program to help people stay in their homes by interceding with landlords to head off evictions. Hawaii has started a similar program.
 In late October, the state opened a transitional shelter for 30 families, including 90 children, at a converted 1940s military building in Kalaeloa, the former Barbers Point Naval Air Station. 
 On Nov. 18, the state poured the foundation for an emergency transitional shelter in Waianae that will house up to 300 people when it opens early next year. The state is looking at building shelters at eight more sites along the Waianae Coast.
 But Dino Palisbo, who has been living at Maili Beach Park with his girlfriend and their three dogs for about a year, said some people did not want to trade the freedom of the beach for the rules of a transitional shelter. ''Half of them can pay rent, but it is so high it is going to take them out of the comfort zone,'' Mr. Palisbo said. ''When a studio costs $700 or $800, how can a family put four or five kids there?''
 Others, like Ms. Greenwood, did not want to leave their communities for the state's shelter at Kalaeloa, which is 10 miles from the beach park and several miles from the nearest bus route. She plans to move to the new shelter in Waianae, set to open next spring, because it is closer to her son's school and her community activities. 
 Mr. Park said other homeless people on the beach looked up to Ms. Greenwood, who is a member of the state's Oahu Island Burial Council, which works to protect ancient Hawaiian remains. A widow, she also has four adult children, but the only daughter who lives nearby has a studio apartment too small for Ms. Greenwood and the boy she adopted, Makalii Hatchie. 
 ''She takes it upon herself to be somewhat of a leader,'' Mr. Park said. 
 Ms. Greenwood said she hoped to begin collecting Social Security benefits and settle her workers' compensation case soon so that she and her son could find a new home.
 ''Being homeless is not a crime, it is the fault of the government,'' she said. ''I can understand when it's 20, 30 people, but when it hits the thousands. ''

HEADLINE: Black Lawmakers Set to Take Crucial Posts Face Pressure

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
The impending Democratic takeover of Congress will elevate more blacks to positions of power in the Capitol than ever: 4 major House committee chairmen, as many as 16 subcommittee chairmen, the third-ranking House Democratic leader and a senator considered a credible candidate for his party's presidential nomination.
 It is so much power that Representative Charles B. Rangel, the New York Democrat set to be chairman of the pivotal Ways and Means Committee, said he hesitated to speak about it publicly. ''I don't want to scare the hell out of people,'' Mr. Rangel said, ''that blacks are now in charge of the committees and so, therefore, watch out.''
While celebrating their rise to prominence, black lawmakers face conflicting pressures from their traditional supporters on one side and the Democratic leaders on the other. Many African-American lawmakers represent poor, predominantly black districts created to ensure black representation under voting rights laws. Their safely Democratic seats have helped them rise in seniority ahead of colleagues from more politically heterogeneous districts. Many lean well to the left of the Democratic caucus as a whole. 
 Traditional party allies like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and some members of the Congressional Black Caucus say they expect their newly powerful champions like Mr. Rangel, 76, to push a long-stalled agenda that includes hearings or a commission on reparations for slavery, guaranteeing voting rights for convicted felons, prohibiting racial profiling by police or customs officers, restricting gun sales, and sharply increasing the compensation paid to people displaced by Hurricane Katrina.
 But like other leaders of the larger Democratic caucus, the black lawmakers are being cautioned to be mindful of a broader audience that includes voters in Republican-leaning swing districts, where those initiatives can be politically perilous. And black lawmakers say they feel pressure to appeal to a broader audience because their names and faces often appear as emblems of their party's liberalism in what they consider racially tinged campaign appeals by their opponents.
 ''It's going to be a delicate balance for the chairmen,'' said Representative Melvin Watt, the North Carolina Democrat who is chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. ''They want to be progressive in their agenda, but they don't want the public to react negatively to what they are doing, because they know you are leading up to a 2008 presidential election.'' (Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who is black, could be a presidential candidate.)
 Mr. Watt and others emphasized that the Democratic leadership had already embraced some black caucus priorities, like raising the minimum wage and increasing education subsidies. But the black caucus is still preparing its own agenda of items left off the Democratic leadership's program for the first 100 days of the new Congress, including more aid for the victims of Hurricane Katrina, many of whom were black. 
 The number of African-Americans in Congress has grown to 43 from just 13 at the founding of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969. But although the 2006 election elevated some caucus members to prominence, it did not add to the group's numbers. Its 43 members still make up less than 10 percent of the House and 1 percent of the Senate. By comparison, blacks make up about 13 percent of the population. 
 The previous high mark for black power in Congress was in 1993-4, when three blacks served as chairmen of less significant House committees, said David Bositis, a researcher at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, an African-American research and policy group. In addition, Carol Moseley Braun of Illinois, the second black senator since Reconstruction, was elected in 1992. 
 Many black lawmakers maintain that since then Republican partisans have often played to the racial animosities of some white voters by focusing attention on the black lawmakers who would be committee chairmen if the Democrats controlled the House. Republican speeches and other appeals often emphasized that Mr. Rangel would take over the Ways and Means Committee and that Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, at 77 the dean of the black caucus, was in line to lead the Judiciary Committee. 
 Weeks before the midterm elections, the Republican strategist Mary Matalin told The Washington Post that the party was seeking to ''hammer home what a Pelosi-Rangel-Conyers House would really mean,'' linking the two black members to Representative Nancy Pelosi, a liberal white Democrat from San Francisco in line to be House speaker. Black lawmakers say the Republican attacks usually fail to mention their white liberal counterparts like Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, soon to be chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
 Richard A. Viguerie, a conservative direct mail pioneer, said the political liability was not the lawmakers' race but the impression that the Democrats were ''a party of special interests.''
 ''With the feminists, the homosexual groups, the other interest groups, you put it all together with the black interest groups and it does not look like America,'' Mr. Viguerie said, predicting that the theme would ''get pounded'' in conservative talk radio and other outlets during the next Congress.
 ''We have to be very careful,'' said William Lacy Clay Sr., a former Democratic representative from Missouri who was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus and chairman of the postal committee before the Republican takeover in 1994. (His son, William Lacy Clay Jr., now holds his seat.) ''You can bet your life we do not live in a color-blind society,'' the elder Mr. Clay said.
 Some lawmakers, though, said the Democratic victories this year showed that racially charged attacks were losing their edge. ''It didn't work,'' said Representative Bennie Thompson, 58, a Mississippi Democrat who is set to be chairman of the Homeland Security Committee. 
 Mr. Thompson said he would not shy away from potentially controversial measures intended to undo the effects of discrimination, including ensuring that a part of domestic security contracts went to firms owned by African-Americans and other minorities, that contractors hired members of minority groups, that research money went to historically black colleges, and that border security officers did not single out travelers on the basis of race or ethnicity. 
 Representative William Lacy Clay Jr. said black lawmakers should not get distracted by the concerns of the larger Democratic caucus. ''We need to stay focused as a caucus on the people who sent us there,'' Mr. Clay said, ''and remember we are the black caucus.''
 Mr. Conyers, who has sponsored a bill creating a commission to study the idea of reparations, and Representative Juanita Millender-McDonald, a 68-year-old California Democrat who is set to lead the House Administration Committee, both declined to discuss potential agendas until the caucus formally selected the new chairmen.
 Mr. Rangel, however, said he was conscious that as Ways and Means chairman he would be accountable to a different constituency, including what he called ''wannabe Democrats'' -- moderate freshman elected in Republican-leaning districts. 
 So instead, Mr. Rangel said, he will advocate policies to help the disadvantaged of all races, which could help blacks as well. ''When God hit with Katrina, she didn't give a damn about color at all,'' he said, ''but she sure did give the poor people a hard road to travel.''

BASS, FRANK M.

 BODY:
 BASS--Frank M. Dr. Frank M. Bass, often called the Father of Marketing Science, died on December 1, 2006 at his home. At age 79, he was in his 25th year as a professor of marketing science in the School of Management at the University of Texas at Dallas. Professor Bass' research and that of his students was pivotal in establishing marketing as a quantitative science. 
Dr. Bass was a native of Cuero, Texas. He received his PhD from the University of Illinois (1954) after earning an MBA from The University of Texas at Austin (1950) and a BBA from Southwestern University (1949). He served in the U.S. Navy from 1944-1946 in Okinawa. After his MBA degree, Dr. Bass spent a year with the wholesale pharmaceutical distributor, McKesson & Robbins, where he asked myriad questions about marketing that could not be answered. When he realized that no one, either in industry or academia, knew the answers he sought, he decided to become a professor with the goal of doing research to find the answers himself. From that moment, until his death, he searched for mathematical theories that could be proven by testing with measurements (data) in order to provide answers to fundamental questions in marketing. The mathematical and statistical models he developed of generalized marketing phenomena are among the most widely used in the world. Dr. Bass held professorships at the University of Illinois, Champagne - Urbana (1951 54), The University of Texas (1954-1957) and later The Ohio State University. Because of his distinguished research record, he was invited to join a very select group at Harvard University as a fellow for the 1959-1960 Institute of Basic Mathematics for Application to Business. That year, which was sponsored by the Ford Foundation with the goal of improving management education, had a significant impact on Dr. Bass' career, and, in turn, the marketing profession. Dr. Bass joined the faculty at Purdue University in 1961, and in 1974 became the Loeb Distinguished Professor of Management at Purdue's Krannert School of Management. In 1982 Professor Bass left Purdue, one of the worlds leading management schools, for the challenge in his beloved home state of Texas of helping to build the University of Texas at Dallas (UTD) School of Management into a world-class research institution. At UTD he held the prestigious Eugene McDermott Chair. One of Dr. Bass' many landmark achievements came when he developed a remarkably accurate marketing model that tracks the sales of durable goods. The moedl has been extensively applied and scores of academic careers and hundreds of research papers have been based on the Bass Model. His 1969 Bass Model paper was named by The Institute for Operations Research and Management Sciences as one of the Top Ten Most Influential Papers published in the 50 year history of management science. Dr. Bass thought that someday his most important contribution might be viewed as his 1974 paper on stochastic brand choice. In it he showed that consumers' choices cannot be predicted on an individual basis, but only probabilistically. Just as Heisenbergs uncertainty principle in physics established that simultaneous position and momentum of a subatomic particle cannot be measured to arbitrary precision no matter how good the measuring instruments, Dr. Bass' research showed that for brand choices consumers brains have a stochastic element; and, no matter how much data one gathers on a customer, a particular instance of his or her choice of a brand cannot be predicted deterministically. Dr. Bass was one of the first marketing scholars to apply econometric methods in developing statistical estimates of the effects of advertising, promotions, and prices upon sales. His research in marketing econometrics and that of his intellectual descendants include seminal works in the field. In 1972-75 Professor Bass served as the Editor of the preeminent journal in marketing --the Journal of Marketing Research. His international stature grew as a pioneer in management sciences when in 1978-79 he served as president of the Institute of Management Sciences. He later co-founded Marketing Science, arguably the most prestigious quantitative marketing journal in the field today. Dr. Bass won numerous awards for his research including the American Marketing Association's 1979 William Odell Award, the 1986 Paul D. Converse Award, the 2002 Gilbert A. Churchill, Jr. Award and the Charles Coolidge Parlin Award for Outstanding Contributions to Marketing Research. Professor Bass has received honorary doctorates from Purdue University, The Ohio State University and the University of South Australia. In his honor the University of Groningen in The Netherlands has created a special chair and the University of South Australia has created the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute for Marketing Science. The University Texas at Dallas has established the Frank M. Bass Institute of Marketing Science. Dr. Bass inspired his students and colleagues with his passion for beautiful mathematical models of marketing phenomena but, absolutely insisted that a model is only as good as the empirical testing it has undergone. Dr. Bass was fundamentally a scientist with the same passion, the same mathematics and the same desire to find truth as other great scientists such as Newton and Einstein. As other scientists who have launched new scientific disciplines, Professor Bass sought to see the face of God in understanding the beauty of how the world of marketing works. He understood that marketing and business are as fundamental to humankind as physics in that it is through business that we humans create practical products and services for each other to improve our lives, accelerate our evolution and increase our creativity and satisfaction. He thought no small ideas. Dr. Bass was preceded in death by his first wife Annie Laurie Bass and is survived by his wife Portia Isaacson Bass, his son Douglas Bass, his step-sons Allen Isaacson and John Isaacson and seven grandchildren. Funeral services will be held on December 6, 2006 in Cuero, Texas.

HEADLINE: Trading Places 

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY; Micheline Maynard reported from Georgetown, Ky., and Nick Bunkley from Livonia, Mich.

 BODY:
Twenty years ago, Livonia, Mich., was a prosperous Detroit suburb, with upscale neighborhoods and high-end stores in a new mall selling Hermes and Chanel, which some locals wore on special occasions to dine at the romantic Fonte D'Amore restaurant. 
 The local economy was thriving because of the Big Three automakers, which operated humming factories near Livonia and employed thousands of managers who commuted about 20 miles to the auto companies' headquarters downtown.
Three hundred miles to the south, drivers back then on Interstate 75 could zip right by Georgetown, Ky., and barely notice it, with its tiny downtown, small college, quaint Victorian homes, and a spring that locals claimed was ''the birthplace of bourbon.'' The local hangout, Fava's, was about the only place for a decent meal. 
 Now, two decades later, the two cities have seemingly switched places economically. 
 Livonia is stumbling, as Detroit's automakers close factories and eliminate blue- and white-collar jobs. Just last week, Ford Motor announced that 30,000 workers had opted for deals worth up to $140,00 to leave. In all, with similar offers at General Motors, about 70,000 auto workers, or one-third of those in American plants, have decided this year to leave.
 Georgetown, however, is booming because of Toyota, which has invested more than $5 billion in a sprawling manufacturing complex, leading to the construction of new schools, hotels and dozens of smaller factories run by suppliers to Toyota.
 Their changing fortunes offer more than a tale of two auto cities. They provide a close-up look at the impact of a broader economic shift of the nation's auto industry from north to south, as Detroit falters and their surging Asian competitors invest in Southern states.
 Over the last two decades, for example, the number of automotive-related manufacturing jobs in Michigan has fallen 34 percent, according to Economy.com. By contrast, the number of automotive jobs in Kentucky rose 152 percent over that period. 
 ''There is a definite shift away from the strongholds of American manufacturing to places that were never manufacturing centers,'' said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. ''These international companies want a fresh start -- not in a town like Detroit, with a long history in the auto industry, but in an empty field where people appreciate them.''
 The shift carries with it not just thousands of well-paying jobs and billions of investment dollars, but also a sense of prosperity gained or lost. 
 In Georgetown, it means managing a rapidly growing population, being dependent on a single employer, and hoping that Toyota's march to the top of the global automobile industry continues.

Fewer Jobs and Services
 For Livonia, the shift means acknowledging that the industry that once provided its region the equivalent of civil service jobs can no longer be relied upon, forcing the city to shrink the services it can offer residents. 
 Despite signs at Livonia's border boasting of ''55 years of progress,'' Mayor Jack Engebretson recently had to lay off 90 people and cut $5 million from the city's budget. Seven elementary schools closed this fall because of falling enrollment. Wonderland, among Livonia's original shopping centers, was torn down over the summer. 
 In once-prestigious neighborhoods like Old Rosedale Gardens, even price cuts do not help owners sell their historic properties. Detroit's auto companies have also pulled back on moving employees around the world, meaning there is less of a reliable churn in the local housing market. 
 ''Three years ago we had just as many people transferring in as out,'' said Jeff Glover, a local Realtor. ''Now it's about three transferring out to one transferring in.''
 Herb Miller, 80, moved to Livonia from Detroit in 1961 when he transferred to a job at the newly built G.M. bumper plant in town. He still loves Livonia, but rising crime concerns him.
 ''It seems like about the time that everybody was writing about what a great place this is to live, things started to change,'' said Mr. Miller, recalling several murders that shook the community several years ago. 
 Although retailers have been clamoring to build on the west side of Livonia to serve wealthier exurbs, his section of town has been losing businesses. The closest shopping center, the 42-year-old Livonia Mall, is likely to be demolished within a few years. ''They've got to do something about that -- that's a dead mall,'' Mr. Miller said.
 Livonia's population, which exploded from 18,000 in 1950 to peak at almost 120,000 in the 1970s, now appears to have fallen below 100,000, according to an estimate by the Southeastern Michigan Council of Governments.
 Today, Plymouth Road, the city's longtime business corridor, is more of a reminder of the city's past success than a shopping destination. The aging owner of Fonte D'Amore closed his Italian landmark restaurant this summer. Livonia's annual holiday parade was discontinued three years ago because of budget constraints. Nearly all of its strip malls have vacancies.
 There is no mystery why Plymouth Road is hurting. Michigan has the highest unemployment rate in the country, and both General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are eliminating tens of thousands of jobs through buyout and early retirement offers.
 Workers at all three Detroit automakers live in Livonia, but it considers itself primarily a Ford town. Jobs at Ford originally helped attract residents who fled Detroit after the 1967 riots, and the company employs more than 4,000 people at its transmission plant on the west side of town.
 For now, those jobs appear to be safe, and in fact, Ford recently filed paperwork to invest about $45 million to update the factory. But with Ford trying for its third turnaround in five years, that commitment could change.
 ''There are a lot of Livonia residents that are going to face challenges as Ford goes through its reinvention of itself,'' Mr. Engebretson said. ''We're holding our breath.''
 Smaller manufacturers in Livonia have been hit hard. The city has one of the Midwest's largest industrial corridors, a six-mile strip of factories and warehouses along Interstate 96. In 1995, more than 95 percent of Livonia's 40 million square feet of industrial space was occupied. The vacancy rate has more than doubled since then.
 Officials recently started marketing the corridor with the slogan ''Industry's Highway'' in the hopes of filling some empty buildings, ideally with companies that are not in the auto business.
 ''We don't want to be tied in any significant way to any one industry because it's just not a healthy thing to do,'' Mr. Engebretson said. 
 As for Georgetown, it had no industry to speak of and only one McDonald's when Gov. Martha Layne Collins made her first trip to Japan in the mid-1980s, hoping to lure a foreign auto company. She had watched as Kentucky's northern neighbor, Ohio, landed two Honda plants and a big technology center, while to the south, Tennessee had lured both Nissan and won the Saturn plant.

An Enthusiastic Reception
 She said she believed that Georgetown was an ideal location, set near the intersection of Interstate 75 which runs north to south, and Interstate 64, which travels east to west. It is also just 15 minutes from Lexington, home to the University of Kentucky and a small airport. 
 When Toyota began narrowing its options, the state Legislature approved a $147 million incentive package to help land the factory -- 30 times what Ohio spent to land Honda, although half what Alabama would eventually spend to lure Mercedes-Benz. 
 Georgetown residents were excited by the possibilities. ''I know what it was like here before Toyota came,'' said George Lusby, the Scott County executive judge, the equivalent of a county administrator. ''Back then, the stores were half empty.''
 Still, there was criticism of the governor for seeking foreign investment, and fears among some residents that a foreign company might not be loyal to the state. ''Toyota is now accepted as part of the fabric of Kentucky, but it wasn't 20 years ago,'' said Dennis Cuneo, who recently retired as an executive in Toyota's North American manufacturing operations and is now a consultant to the automaker.
 Given that Toyota has invested more than $5 billion to date in Georgetown, ''I'd do it again tomorrow,'' Ms. Collins said.
 Among the original workers to land a job at the plant was Cheryl Jones, a manager at a local supermarket with no factory experience. Twenty years later, she is now vice president for manufacturing at Georgetown, and recently traveled to Mexico to help open a new Toyota plant there.
 ''I've been all over the world now because of Toyota and the plants that we have,'' Ms. Jones said.
 Workers in Georgetown sometimes find themselves stuck in the miniature rush hour that occurs in late afternoon, when pickup trucks and Camrys pour out of the factory and turn onto Cherry Blossom Boulevard.
 The local population has nearly doubled in 20 years, to about 20,000. There are at least a dozen new subdivisions, and some houses have been built directly across from the Toyota plant.
 So have dozens of smaller factories, creating something akin to the industrial corridor in Livonia. Prospective investors are constantly on the phone to Jack Conner, executive director of the Georgetown/Scott County Chamber of Commerce, looking for vacant land where they can build new plants.
 The buildings are not all commercial. Just this decade, Georgetown has built a recreation center, complete with an outdoor skateboard park; new elementary, middle and high schools; and is expanding a Japanese garden. The Cincinnati Bengals now hold summer practice in Toyota Stadium, also used by Georgetown College.
 Downtown Georgetown bustles with antique stores, an espresso bar in the old bank building and Fava's, which recently got a face-lift and now sells T-shirts and postcards, along with its meringue pies. The city now has three McDonald's and a Wal-Mart Supercenter.

An Uneasy Feeling
 Yet, some worry that the prosperity will not last. Employment at the plant leveled off about two years ago, at about 7,800 workers, and there is little likelihood Toyota will hire many more, except to replace those who are beginning to retire from the factory. 
 Plant managers, however, are constantly lobbying the company for new work, and landing it. This summer, Georgetown began building a hybrid version of the Camry sedan, replacing production previously done in Japan. And there is a large swath of empty space inside the factory that could be used to add another model to the plant, perhaps a crossover vehicle or a Lexus luxury model.
 ''There will never be another Toyota,'' Ms. Collins said. ''There are other companies, there are other manufacturers, but there is only one Toyota.''
 Back in Livonia, Mayor Engebretson remains optimistic that the city will regain a sense of prosperity. He readily acknowledged the challenges facing the city, which has fared better than crumbling factory towns like Flint, a national symbol of the auto industry's decline. 
 ''All in all, I think Livonia is still a very vibrant community, and I am convinced unequivocally that our brightest days still lie ahead,'' he said. ''People have fallen on hard times, but we're working awfully hard to keep the status that has been enjoyed by this community for many years.''

HEADLINE: Fly (or Not) and Buy

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Lori Okimura, a business traveler based in Los Angeles, earned more than 3,000 frequent-flier miles on Thanksgiving night and the next morning, but never left her home.
 Her secret? She took advantage of holiday shopping bonuses at the online shopping mall run by American Airlines' frequent-flier program. She was able to buy gifts from retailers like Circuit City and Target, and receive bonus miles both for purchases at these retailers and for using her Citi AAdvantage MasterCard.
 ''Instead of standing in line with 500 people in front of Target, when everybody was in a frenzy, I chose to go online,'' Ms. Okimura, who runs a sporting events marketing company, said last week. ''I got up early, had a cup of coffee and was online for four hours. I'm 90 percent done with my holiday shopping and I earned double miles.'' 
 New within the last four years, online malls operated by airlines and hotel companies have come about, experts say, in part because Americans are growing increasingly comfortable with buying online. Jupiter Research estimates that shoppers will spend $32 billion online this holiday season, generating 7 percent of all holiday merchandise sales; this is an 18 percent increase over last year's $27 billion in online holiday sales. Henry Harteveldt, a travel analyst at Forrester Research, said the malls were also another example of airlines' increasingly aggressive efforts to ''increase the amount of ancillary revenue, which is a crucial part of their business strategy to become or remain profitable.''
 For travelers with more miles or points in their accounts than dollars in their wallets, a few hotel companies and airlines permit redemption of miles or points for merchandise or gift cards. And last-minute shoppers on their way through certain airports can find shopping opportunities there.
 The online retail malls operated by airlines like American (a unit of AMR), United (part of UAL), USAirways, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, Midwest Express and Northwest Airlines, and hotel companies like Marriott International, Carlson and the InterContinental Hotels Group are entered through the Web site of the airline or hotel loyalty program. Participants can then link directly to the site of the retailer where they want to shop. When they make their purchase -- paying the same price as if they had gone directly to the retailer's site or a bricks-and-mortar store -- they receive loyalty program miles or points. The retailers pay the airline or hotel company a fee for every mile or point given to the loyalty-program participant upon purchase. These can then be redeemed for free plane tickets or hotel stays.
 During the holiday season, these miles or points can add up. This year, for example, American, United, Delta, Continental, Northwest and others are offering bonus miles for purchases, sometimes double the usual amount. Miles obtained through the USAirways program can be used to attain elite frequent-flier status. Similarly, until tomorrow, United is letting users of its Mileage Plus Visa card pay a $99 fee to be able to shop and accrue miles good for elite status. American is giving out mileage bonuses for certain purchases made with some MasterCards. And SkyMall, a company that aggregates offerings of more than 200 retailers into catalogs found online and in the seat backs of airplanes, is offering a $50 gift card for every $200 in purchases by passengers of AirTran Airways, American, Southwest Airlines and United.
 To help travelers determine the best offers, Randy Petersen, a loyalty program expert, recommends three Web sites: webflyer.com/deals/mileage--mall, a site he operates that contrasts all travel loyalty programs' deals, as well as rewardsdb.com and evreward.com, which compare offers from both nontravel and travel loyalty programs.
 Experts say there is little downside to shopping this way. ''If you choose not to earn miles through retailers that allow you to earn them, you've left value on the table,'' says Tim Winship, publisher of Frequentflier.com.
 For holiday shopping, Mr. Petersen favors Continental's online retail mall, which he says has the ''consistently richest'' offers from the best retailers, while Mr. Winship recommends American's mall, with more than 200 retailers. 
 Travelers considering accruing additional miles through holiday shopping should also consider what Mr. Winship calls ''the elephant in the room'' -- difficulties encountered by frequent fliers in obtaining bonus tickets. This development was confirmed by a report issued last month by the inspector general of the Department of Transportation, who noted a decline among some airlines in the number of award tickets issued from 2002 to 2005. 
 If travelers participate in both airline and hotel loyalty programs and can get the same holiday shopping bonus from each, Mr. Winship said, ''It makes more sense than ever to carefully consider the hotel offer,'' since awards may be more readily available and also worth more.
 For travelers rich in loyalty program miles or points, Mr. Petersen recommends offers by companies like Hilton, Starwood, InterContinental, Delta and United that allow redemptions for merchandise or gift cards.
 These redemptions make sense, Mr. Petersen says, only if they provide a ''financial benefit when you have a lot of miles and not a lot of money, or when you have too many miles that you can never use.''
 But he warns that merchandise bought this way is often overpriced: he estimates that each frequent-flier mile awarded for redemption as a flight is worth 1.5 cents, while miles redeemed for merchandise are each worth 0.5 cents.
 For travelers who have time to ponder holiday purchases only while laying over at airports, all is not lost. Late last month, Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport introduced duty-free shopping for domestic passengers at Buckaroo Tax Free in the new international terminal. The shop pays all sales taxes on purchases by domestic travelers.
 Dallas/Fort Worth and airports in Atlanta, San Francisco, Reno, Nev., Indianapolis and Minneapolis also feature new automated kiosks, operated by Zoom Systems, that sell items as diverse as iPods or Motorola cellphones and Neutrogena or Proactiv skin care products, priced competitively. Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport is also distributing coupon books offering deals from retailers like Tie Rack, Simply Books and Naturally Cashmere.
 Perhaps one of the most offbeat offers comes from Paradies Shops, which operates stores in many North American airports. The company lets the purchaser of a book read and return it, with the original receipt, within six months for a 50 percent refund. The book may be returned to any Paradies shop. This is a gift that can truly keep on giving.

HEADLINE: China Largely Silent on Telecom Strategy 

BYLINE: By VICTORIA SHANNON

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
If the world's telecommunications executives thought that bringing their industry's biggest trade show to China would spur Chinese officials into opening their vast market, they were wrong -- at least so far.
 Government officials have avoided using the ITU Telecom World 2006 conference in Hong Kong this week to say when they would allow next-generation mobile phone networks to enter the country.
With third-generation services slow to take off in Europe and the United States, telecommunications suppliers have been counting on China to provide a major lift, and most say that they are ready to jump in whenever so-called 3G network building begins in earnest on the Chinese mainland. But, so far, the industry has encountered only delays and postponements. 
 At the opening ceremony for the conference on Sunday and again Monday, Chinese leaders declined to announce a timetable. Three important decisions remain: which technology China will select, which mobile phone operators will get the licenses, and when. ''China will consider three standards for 3G,'' Wang Xudong, the minister for the information industry, said Monday. ''The timing for issuing 3G licenses will be determined by the market.''
 With India and China together adding more than 12 million cellphone subscribers a month, the two countries are the fastest-growing markets for conventional networks. These networks are good for voice calls, but too slow to allow subscribers a comfortable experience surfing the ''mobile Internet'' on a cellphone.
 With present-day mobile phone use reaching a saturation point in many industrial economies, telecommunications supply executives can seem almost wistful about the potential for 3G networks in China, a $26 billion market for such systems.
 ''This is for the government to decide, but there's no negative,'' said Frederic Rose, president of the Asia-Pacific region for the newly merged Alcatel-Lucent.
 His boss, Patricia F. Russo, and the chief executives of Ericsson, Motorola and Nortel Networks are among those meeting here with clients, suppliers and Chinese officials. But China has shown a preference for developing and choosing its own standards, and if it does so in this case, some Western companies may be left out.
 The European version of 3G is called W-CDMA, a technology with the backing of Nokia and Ericsson; one used by some American carriers is called CDMA 1000x; and China's is called TD-SCDMA. Technically, they are related, but there is little consensus on differences in quality.
 ''I expect we will get some clarity by summer,'' Mr. Rose said. ''We expect there will be 3G networks operational in the main cities for the Olympics in September 2008.''
 Alcatel-Lucent gets about a third of its revenue from the Asia-Pacific region. Mr. Rose said the company was buffered in two ways from the impact of a decision about a 3G standard. First, it is actively investing in the second-generation business, which is still growing in China.
 Second, Alcatel-Lucent is prepared to jump into any of the three standards.
 Its TD-SCDMA equipment, through its Shanghai Bell joint venture with Datang Communications of China, is already being used in pilot networks in the country. And since Datang owns most of the TD-SCDMA intellectual property, Alcatel-Lucent would generally not pay royalty fees to use it. (Datang is also working with Siemens.)
 In addition, Alcatel-Lucent makes W-CDMA equipment for the European market. And the merger of Alcatel and Lucent Technologies brought to the combined company Lucent's expertise in CDMA.
 Chinese manufacturers are also ready. ZTE and Huawei are among the biggest pushing for the TD-SCDMA standard, and they, too, make equipment for the competing standards. They would also be eager to see companies like Nokia and Motorola give up their dominance of the second-generation network business in China.
 Samsung of South Korea would like a piece of the action, as well. ''We are ready to enter that market, whether it is TD-SCDMA or W-CDMA -- whatever the standard,'' said Jeong Han Kim, senior vice president for Samsung Electronics' telecommunication network business. ''We will be a major player in that area,'' he said, citing two factories that Samsung has on the mainland. 
 Although 3G phone services like videoconferencing, Internet browsing and TV viewing may be more expensive than most Chinese can afford, Mr. Jeong said that ''China has very big potential, so it will grow very fast.'' 
 After three years of waiting, the telecommunications industry is still speculating. But there is one thing that companies can bank on, Mr. Rose said.
 ''There's no fear that 3G won't happen in China.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Says Fee On Peak Traffic Is Not Likely 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that it was unlikely that the State Legislature would allow the city to charge drivers to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan as part of a congestion pricing plan similar to one used in London. 
 Mr. Bloomberg spoke after the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, released a study yesterday that measured the economic cost of traffic-clogged streets. The group called on government officials to consider a range of solutions including a program like the one in London, which has brought about significant traffic reductions by charging drivers a fee to enter the city center.
Mr. Bloomberg, who spoke to reporters during a visit to Florida, said that congestion pricing would likely be viewed as a kind of ''commuter tax'' and that made it ''a nonstarter.''
 ''The politics of a commuter tax in Albany are probably such that we would never get it passed,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''And what I want to do is focus on those things that we can get passed to help our city.'' 
 In characterizing congestion pricing as a commuter tax, the mayor may have been referring to an aspect of the London plan that gives discounts to people in the city center, shifting some of the cost to people in outlying areas. 
 But the mayor acknowledged that something needed to be done and said the city would consider congestion pricing as one alternative. ''Do we have a congestion problem?'' he said. ''Absolutely. Is it expensive? Yes.''
 The study said that extremely heavy traffic in New York reduces the productivity of workers and delays deliveries of goods and services throughout the metropolitan region. That drives up costs to businesses, cuts into their profits and keeps them from hiring more workers. The study estimated that excess traffic across the region results in at least 37,000 fewer jobs a year. 
 Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership, said that before measures like congestion pricing were taken to discourage driving, bus and ferry service should be expanded to give more people an alternative to driving to work.
 She urged the officials to study ways to cut traffic, including congestion pricing and increased parking meter rates. 
 Ms. Wylde said that heavy traffic had a ripple effect across the region, increasing travel times from the suburbs and increasing business costs there as well.
 ''Excess congestion has a regional impact, not just in New York City,'' Ms. Wylde said. ''I am hopeful that legislative representatives in New York and New Jersey will look at this with fresh eyes and with a fresh attitude.''

HEADLINE: Venezuelans Give Chavez a Mandate to Tighten His Grip

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
If President Hugo Chavez rules like an autocrat, as his critics in Washington and here charge, then he does so with the full permission of a substantial majority of the Venezuelan people, Sunday's election here showed.
 Sent to power for a third time, Mr. Chavez seems intent on assuming the mantle from the fading Fidel Castro of chief Latin American scourge of the United States. He also has made no secret of his intent to consolidate his power further through legal and personnel changes.
He has spoken of a desire to unite his supporters in one political party and to alter legislation to allow him to remain in power past 2020. 
 Winning support for such measures may not be difficult in a country where his allies already control the legislature and the Supreme Court as well as governorships in all but two states, and where the military, the national oil company and other government bureaucracies and institutions have been systematically packed with Chavez boosters and stripped of opponents. 
 Now, facing an anemic opposition that could not win in any of Venezuela's 23 states or Caracas, Mr. Chavez is expected to tighten his grip, first and foremost over his own supporters in an effort to prevent challenges to his rule from emerging.
 ''A priority for Chavez right now is what he calls a 'revolution within a revolution,' '' said Steve Ellner, a political scientist at the Universidad de Oriente in eastern Venezuela. ''This means a purging process of those associated with corruption or excess bureaucracy. In January you're going to see some heads being chopped.''
 Venezuela leading newspapers, El Nacional and El Universal, published maps in their pages on Monday showing the entire country painted red, the color of Mr. Chavez's campaign, as a reflection of his convincing victory.
 Red, in fact, colored not just the clothing and advertisements of the Chavez campaign. Rafael Ramirez, the energy minister, described the national oil company as ''red, really red,'' in comments caught on video in which he told workers that they had no place in the company if they were not supporters of the government.
 Mr. Ramirez's words, which Mr. Chavez promptly adopted as one of his refrains, point to a creeping ''with us or against us'' radicalization in Venezuelan society that goes beyond the government-run oil company to institutions like public schools and museums. 
 That polarization may now worsen, a prospect that clearly concerns leaders of Venezuela's political opposition as they regroup after their defeat.
 ''Chavez is not a dictator,'' Teodoro Petkoff, the editor of the newspaper TalCual and a key adviser to the president's defeated opponent, Manuel Rosales, said in an interview. ''But he's not a Thomas Jefferson either.''
 The reality of Venezuela's democracy is indeed far more nuanced, as is Mr. Chavez's ''21st-century socialism'' in an oil-exporting country experiencing a boom in conspicuous consumption.
 Mr. Rosales's campaign itself illustrated that complexity. Mr. Rosales, the governor of Zulia State, rose from near obscurity to lead a movement that won nearly 40 percent of the vote nationwide. Much of the established media in the capital, Caracas, clearly supported him, although in relatively restrained coverage compared with their previous opposition to Mr. Chavez. 
 Beyond Venezuela, Mr. Chavez's rise to international prominence in Latin America and beyond has much to do with his supremacy in Venezuela. 
 With his new term and the slow demise of his hero Fidel Castro, who was too ill to attend his own 80th birthday celebrations in Havana over the weekend, Mr. Chavez may indeed solidify his place as the new the standard-bearer of the left in Latin America, where leftist candidates have won presidential elections in the last five weeks in Brazil, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela. 
 That left is indeed varied, and Mr. Chavez is not necessarily its most representative figure. But he is its most vocal one, especially when it comes to chiding President Bush.
 Mr. Chavez's prominent position will continue to depend, of course, on the price of oil, the volatile commodity at the heart of Venezuela's economy. Those prices may remain high as the war in Iraq drags on and markets gaze nervously at the Middle East. Meanwhile, paradoxically, the United States remains the largest buyer of Venezuelan oil and has in effect helped to finance Mr. Chavez's ambitions. 
 ''Chavez is getting stronger as an unintended consequence of war and globalization,'' said Kenneth Maxwell, a professor of Latin American history at Harvard.
 Despite Venezuela's tight commercial embrace of the United States, the obstacles to improving relations may now loom larger. 
 Washington remains wary of Venezuela's warm ties to Cuba, Iran and Syria. The Bush and Chavez administrations hold different views on hemispheric integration, with United States wanting to expand it, based on the model of trade agreements like Nafta, and Venezuela promoting Latin America first, before further integration with the North American economies. 
 ''The chances for improvement are minimal for the remainder of the Bush administration,'' said Daniel Hellinger, a political scientist and an expert on Venezuela at Webster University in St. Louis. ''More is involved here than the personal animosity between Bush and Chavez.''

HEADLINE: Where Traditional and Modern Meet and Sashay Along

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
For every stereotype of a Muslim country, Turkey has a fact to break it.
 It has Islamic feminists (a few) and Israeli tourists (lots). Reality dating shows have had the highest ratings on television, and Islamic fashion sashays down Turkish runways.
For decades in Turkey the competing forces of the religious and secular, Christian and Muslim, East and West, were muted, as authorities scrubbed the country of differences while they built a modern state. But Turkey has become more democratic in recent years, and those forces have burst into full view, creating a sort of modern-day identity crisis. 
 ''We have started to think very differently about our history,'' said Leyla Neyzi, a professor at Sabanci University, one of Turkey's first private colleges. ''The past is being rethought in terms of the demands of the present.''
 Nowhere is that questioning more apparent than in Istanbul, the lively port that is the cultural and intellectual center of the country.
 Aynur Dogan is a Kurdish singer with a powerful voice who grew up in war. Turkish forces and Kurdish separatists were fighting in the southern part of the country, where she lived and where speaking her native Kurdish was illegal. Kurdish music tapes were buried in the yard when government forces entered her village. Her family fled to Istanbul in 1992 to escape the fighting.
 She took an interest in Kurdish music, but in the late 1990s the only audiences were underground. In Turkish society, Kurdish was a bad word. ''It looked impossible,'' she said, smoking a cigarette in a dark Istanbul cafe with murals painted on the walls.
 By 2004, she had appeared on mainstream Turkish television singing in Kurdish. That year she released her first album, ''Kurdish Girl.'' It was temporarily banned by the government, but not before it sold large numbers of copies, and finally its sale was permitted. 
 Now she performs frequently in Europe, and a film about Istanbul's music scene has featured her singing. But there are still limits in Turkey. Sponsors of Kurdish musical events are difficult to find, and it is harder to get a venue, but young Turks in Istanbul's music shops eagerly recommend her album. 
 ''I felt there was this new group of people emerging,'' she said. 
 Many forces helped release the river of memory. One has been a steady series of changes Turkey has enacted to gain entry to the European Union. The push to join, led by the pro-Islamic government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, elected in 2002, has recently faltered, souring Turks on the process. But the changes, which have opened Turkey's society and its economy, have stuck.
 Another factor has been the changing international landscape. The Muslim world has grown angry at the West, particularly the United States, for what Muslim countries say is behavior that singles out Muslims and creates a backlash of Islamic identity. Turkey is no exception.
 But Turkey has also matured. The young professionals who walk along Istanbul's central avenues at a New York pace clutching sleek cellphones are only a few generations away from the time when Turkey became a state in 1923, yet far enough away from the secular revolution of Ataturk, Turkey's founder, to start to question it. 
 In recent years there has been a flurry of films, books and oral histories about Turkey's past, and the country feels more democratic than at any time in its short history, Ms. Neyzi said. Turkish Jews now have a museum. 
 Last year, Turkey held a conference on the killings of Armenians in the World War I era, described as genocide by many in the West but not by the Turkish government. Estimates of the deaths given by the Allies at the end of the war ranged from 600,000 to 800,000, and scholars more recently have put the figure at more than a million.
 It is a painful process. When Orhan Pamuk, a Turkish novelist who has spoken out on the Armenian issue, won the Nobel Prize for Literature, the president of Turkey did not congratulate him. That is because Mr. Pamuk is seen as a tool of anti-Turkish forces, whose views of his country can be critical, instead of being seen as a writer who made the Turkish novel universal, Ms. Neyzi said.
 ''All the skeletons in the closet are spilling out,'' said Ms. Neyzi, who chose to return to Turkey after earning a doctorate from Cornell. ''It's creating a lot of conflict in society.''
 The danger, Turks say, is that too abrupt a process can sharpen nationalist and Islamist sentiments and possibly lead to another coup by the army, a traditional safeguard of the country's secularism. There have been three in Turkey's short history.
 That, in turn, would set back efforts at change and roll back debate, and could seriously damage the significant economic gains Turkey has made in the last six years.
 To prevent that, Turkish intellectuals like Nazan Olcer, an art museum director, are bringing up the past in small bits. Shortly after the opening of the museum in 2002, it made arrangements to show a collection of an Armenian from Ottoman times. 
 ''It was a hot iron,'' said Ms. Olcer, sitting on a gilded loveseat in her office near the museum, which like Ms. Neyzi's university was financed by the Sabanci family, the Turkish equivalent of the Rockefellers, which began building public learning institutions in recent years. ''Everyone warned us not to do it.''
 In the end, people came. By the time they left, they understood a little more about the collector and were questioning some of their own assumptions, Ms. Olcer said.
 ''You remind people to think twice,'' she said. In 2005 the museum brought the first Picasso to Turkey, and this year it exhibited Rodin sculptures. The fact that the figures were nude did not seem to bother devout Turks, who came in large numbers, Ms. Olcer said.
 On Tuesday, in another dip into the past, the museum will open an exhibit about Genghis Khan, including some of the earliest Turkic writing and inscriptions.
 ''A very important dialogue is beginning,'' Ms. Olcer said. ''I want to tell them the history. Not with a heroic approach. Not with strongly accented nationalism. What they were missing was the knowledge.''

HEADLINE: Blurring Political Lines in the Military Debate 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
No military expert was more forthright in opposing the Iraq war than Anthony C. Zinni.
 General Zinni, a retired marine who once served as the top American military officer in the Middle East, contended that the threat posed by Saddam Hussein's Iraq was vastly overstated and that invading Iraq would be a burdensome distraction from the struggle against Al Qaeda.
These days General Zinni is delivering another provocative message: that leaving Iraq quickly would strengthen Iranian influence throughout the Middle East, create a sanctuary for terrorist groups, encourage even more sectarian strife in Iraq and risk turmoil in an oil-rich region. 
 ''This is not Vietnam or Somalia or those places where you can walk away,'' General Zinni said in a recent interview. (He served in both countries.) ''If we just pull out, we will find ourselves back in short order.''
 Instead, he says, the United States should leave open the door for a temporary increase in American troops, an argument he included in a broader plan prepared for the World Security Institute, a research organization, and made public on Monday. ''It may be necessary to surge them for a short term,'' he said. 
 General Zinni noted that his position was similar to that of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, a staunch supporter of the decision to invade. ''I do believe more troops are required on the ground,'' the general said. ''I believe what Senator McCain says.''
 The Iraq debate roiling Washington cuts across partisan divides and has led to some odd bedfellows. For example, the troop reduction and pullback options suggested by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld in a memo written just before he resigned reflect some convergence between him and Democratic lawmakers who have criticized the war.
 But for all the twists and turns, there is an underlying logic to the policy alignments.
 Even before the Iraq war, Mr. Rumsfeld opposed sending large numbers of troops to Iraq, arguing that a large and lengthy presence would put the United States in the position of doing things that the Iraqis should be doing for themselves. He outlined his view shortly before the war in a speech in New York called ''Beyond Nation Building,'' and it was reflected in his criticism of Gen. Eric Shinseki, the Army chief of staff at the time, who cautioned that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed in postwar Iraq.
 In offering new options for shrinking the American military footprint in Iraq, Mr. Rumsfeld, in his memo to the White House, was also giving expression to old policy predilections. His option to begin modest troop reductions to put pressure on the Iraqi government is very similar to the amendment sponsored by Senator Carl Levin, the Michigan Democrat and incoming chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, though with one notable difference: the secretary has resisted the idea of a firm timeline.
 So close is the parallel between some of Mr. Rumsfeld's favored options and the Democratic agenda that Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat and former presidential candidate, has all but claimed credit for them. ''Look, everything in the Rumsfeld memo is a summary of things that I and others laid out three years ago,'' Senator Kerry said Sunday on CNN. ''This is rather extraordinary.''
 As for General Zinni, he forcefully opposed the invasion of Iraq, in part because he thought it would undermine stability in the Middle East and because he was worried that holding a post-Hussein Iraq together would be a monumental enterprise. But now that the United States is in Iraq, he opposes a quick withdrawal for the same reasons.
 The barrel-chested officer has a well-earned reputation for blunt talk and a tortured relationship with the Bush administration after a rocky stint in which he served as a special envoy to the Middle East. In his new paper on ''The Future for Iraq,'' he argues that there is no easy fix. ''We have missed too many opportunities,'' he writes, ''and have created too much irreparable damage via the mistakes that were made, for that to be possible.''
 Having acknowledged that, he suggests economic, political, security and administrative steps to try to turn the situation around. His program calls for a new bipartisan steering group to ensure that American policies toward Iraq are efficiently carried out, job-creation programs for Iraqis, integration of Iraq's militias into government-supervised national guard units and encouragement for the Iraqi Army to promote civil affairs.
 On American troop levels, General Zinni wrote that the United States has had too few forces to carry out effectively what the administration has called a ''clear, hold and build'' strategy, which, he explains, ''requires holding and staying in an area long enough for the building process to be effective.'' While the American military is stretched thin, he writes, it could ''with difficulty, support a short-term increase in force if the increase would provide the security momentum to jump-start other programs.''
 As difficult as it is to stabilize Iraq, General Zinni insists that the alternatives are worse. 
 Swiftly redeploying forces from Baghdad to safer areas in Iraq or Kuwait, for example, would leave the United States unable to influence events in the capital and the volatile heartland, he said.
 Extracting American forces altogether, he said, is unrealistic in the short term. Iraq under the sway of extremists, he asserted, could encourage instability in the Persian Gulf. The stakes are so high, he said, that if the fighting in Iraq expands into a major civil war the United States may need to consider intervening to try to quell the fighting instead of leaving.
 ''We made a mess in the worst possible place we could have made a mess,'' he said in the interview. ''We took an Iran that was contained, and now its influence is stretched through Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and into Palestinian territories.
 ''You can't be in the region for security reasons and not deal with the biggest security problem that you created in effect. I don't see how you walk away from this one.''

HEADLINE: With the Democratic Congress, Groups Gear Up for Fight Over Paid Sick Days 

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
With the Democratic Congress expected to move quickly to raise the minimum wage, many Democrats, women's organizations and liberal groups are gearing up for a fight on another workplace issue: paid sick days.
 Supporters point to studies showing that nearly half of American workers do not receive paid sick days. But many Republicans and businesses complain that such legislation would impose another mandate on companies, driving up their costs.
Advocates of paid sick leave cite workers like Naomi Nakamura, who lost a week's pay when her 103-degree fever forced her to miss five days from her job at a video rental store in San Francisco. 
 Ms. Nakamura said, ''Some employees didn't want to lose their pay, so they showed up for work even though they had strep throat, and they just spread it to other people.''
 Last month, San Francisco voters approved a measure requiring all employers to provide paid sick days, making it the first jurisdiction in the nation with such a requirement. The vote was 61 percent to 39 percent.
 Now supporters are planning a big push for sick day legislation not just in Congress, but in Maine, Maryland, Montana and several other states. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, introduced a bill last year to require companies with at least 15 employees to provide seven paid sick days a year, but that bill languished in the Republican-led Congress.
 Now that Democrats have won control of Congress, Mr. Kennedy, the incoming chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, is more optimistic.
 ''It has a wildfire of support across the country,'' he said. ''When you talk to workers, this is, besides an increase in the minimum wage, the most important issue for these families. This is a families issue. This is a values issue.''
 Mr. Kennedy's bill, like a House bill sponsored by Rosa DeLauro, a Connecticut Democrat, would provide a total of seven paid sick days not just when workers are ill, but when members of their families are ill -- or need to go to the doctor for checkups and tests. 
 A big problem with not having paid sick days, Mr. Kennedy said, is that many parents, not wanting to miss work, let their sick children go to school, spreading their illnesses. Mr. Kennedy said his bill would guarantee paid sick days to 66 million who do not now have them.
 Business lobbyists plan to fight the effort. 
 ''Supporters of legislation like this complain about unfunded mandates in education when it comes to No Child Left Behind, but they don't hesitate to impose unfunded mandates on employers,'' said Randel Johnson, vice president for labor, immigration and employee benefits at the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''The employer community is not going to roll over on this issue.''
 Susan Eckerly, vice president for federal policy at the National Federation of Independent Business, said, ''I could see where this would pass the House, but if you put this on the floor of the Senate, it would be a good candidate for a filibuster.'' 
 Mr. Kennedy acknowledged that possibility. ''We'll need some of our Republican colleagues,'' he said. 
 Advocates plan to build a coalition like the one that won passage of the Families and Medical Leave Act in 1993 after a long struggle -- including two vetoes by the first President Bush. The coalition backing paid sick days includes the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Partnership for Women and Families, and Acorn, an association of community organizations that helped win passage of a minimum wage increase in six states on Election Day.
 ''These kinds of policies that create flexibility in the workplace are important to make families be healthy and economically secure,'' said Debra Ness, president of the National Partnership. ''You'd be hard-pressed to talk to a woman today at any point of the economic spectrum who isn't struggling with this issue.''
 Jody Heymann, a professor of social policy at McGill University, pointed to studies showing that children get well sooner when their parents take time off to care for them. She said the United States was the only industrial nation not to require paid sick days when workers are ill.
 ''Enough firms do this to show that companies can provide this and compete economically,'' Professor Heymann said. 
 But many business owners complain that mandates like paid sick days require lots of paperwork and take a one-size-fits-all approach.
 Steve Caughran, owner of a printing shop outside Fresno, Calif., said, ''Any time the government is mandating something and creates an extra burden on business, it becomes another regulatory tax and raises costs.''
 He said that to attract workers most companies needed to provide good benefits, including sick days. He said he offered most employees about 14 paid days off each year, to be taken as vacation or sick days.
 The Institute for Women's Policy Research found that 77 percent of workers in the lowest quarter by wages did not have paid sick days, while 43 percent of middle-class workers did not and 31 percent of workers in the top quarter did not.
 Leonardo Prado, a restaurant worker in San Francisco, said not having paid sick days was a financial and emotional strain. Mr. Prado, who is divorced, said that last June when his 4-year-old, Antonio, got sick for two days, he had to hire a baby sitter for $10 an hour, even though he earned $8.82 an hour as a waiter, not counting tips.
 ''It really hurt in the wallet,'' Mr. Prado said. ''You didn't have the option to say: 'I can't work this day. I have to take care of my son.' ''
 A community group in San Francisco, Young Workers United, sponsored the referendum, after many workers had complained about the issue. 
 Businesses hardly fought the measure, considering it a lost cause. ''San Franciscans have a history of voting their social conscience as long as someone else writes the check,'' said Kevin Westlye, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, which opposed the referendum.
 He said consumers would be hurt, predicting that restaurants would raise prices because of the sick days mandate and a mandate for employers to contribute toward health insurance. The higher prices, he said, might cause some restaurants to lose business -- and perhaps close.
 ''There's no such thing as a free lunch on something like this,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Airbus Says It Can Finance Plane Project 

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 4 

 BODY:
Airbus said on Monday that it had no immediate plans to seek government-backed financing for its new wide-body aircraft, the A350 XWB, avoiding another round of trans-Atlantic recriminations over aircraft subsidies. 
 Though he refused to rule out going to European governments in the future, the chief executive of Airbus, Louis Gallois, said the company could handle the initial phase of the $13.2 billion development program from its own cash resources and by sharing the costs with its suppliers.
 ''We have no imminent cash needs,'' Mr. Gallois said at a news conference in Paris.
 Airbus is currently in discussions with ''about 10'' potentially significant partners that could help shoulder both the risk and the potential reward of developing the A350, Mr. Gallois said. Airbus expects to have work allocated and partners selected by the spring, he said.
 Mr. Gallois also said that Airbus, which has been hit hard by the decline of the dollar because its planes are priced in declining dollars, would seek to acquire a ''natural hedging'' against this currency risk by outsourcing $2.4 billion of the development costs to American companies.
 ''We will be very happy to have American partners,'' he said.
 Mr. Gallois emphasized that the A350 project would support Airbus's overhaul program, known as Power8, which it developed in response to lengthy delays and production problems with its A380 superjumbo jet. The A380 was developed with aid from European governments. 
 ''The A350 XWB is not only our response to market demand,'' Mr. Gallois said. ''This program is also a crucial vehicle to transform Airbus.''
 The plans appeared to defuse, at least for the moment, a further escalation of the European-American fight at the World Trade Organization over what the United States contends are improper aircraft subsidies. Last month, the United States prepared to file a complaint against Airbus over any financial assistance it might receive for the A350, which is intended to compete with Boeing's brisk-selling 787 Dreamliner but will not enter service until 2013, four years after the American plane.
 By announcing its new development model, Airbus has mooted any fight or at least deferred it.
 ''It may simply be a tactic to defuse the W.T.O. case,'' said George Hamlin, an aerospace consultant at Morten, Beyer & Agnew in Arlington, Va. ''Or it could amount to a judgment that the company is financially mature enough to do this themselves, so why rock the boat?''
 Airbus failed to drum up more than about 100 orders for its original A350 design, so it went back to the drawing board this year and unveiled the A350 XWB, which stands for extra wide body, in July.
 John Leahy, the Airbus chief operating officer for customers, said the company might lose some of those earlier orders after the redesign, but that it would retain many, because the XWB was better. ''We'll lose some, but not as many as some of you seem to think,'' he told reporters.
 Its price will be $215 million, though discounts are common in the industry.

HEADLINE: Smaller Chicken Producer Accepts Offer From Pilgrim's Pride 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The chicken producer Gold Kist agreed yesterday to a higher buyout bid by a larger rival, Pilgrim's Pride, ending a takeover battle that began four months ago.
 The buyout, which could be completed by the end of this year, will make Pilgrim's Pride the country's top chicken producer, eclipsing Tyson Foods, according to the National Chicken Council. 
 ''To the extent this transaction obviously helps consolidation in a challenging industry, it is a good development,'' a Deutsche Bank food analyst, Eric Katzman, said in a research report.
 Pilgrim's Pride executives estimated that the merger would have the company producing about 25 percent of chicken grown in the United States, compared with Tyson's 23.5 percent.
 Pilgrim's Pride said it would buy Gold Kist for $21 a share, or $1.1 billion. The tender offer will close on Dec. 27.
 In August, Pilgrim's Pride started a $1 billion, or $20 a share, hostile takeover bid for Gold Kist after the two companies failed to agree on a deal. Gold Kist directors rejected that offer and urged shareholders to reject it, saying the company would take measures to improve performance.
 Gold Kist's directors approved the higher bid after Pilgrim's Pride said last week that 67 percent of Gold Kist's shares had been tendered under the initial $20-a-share offer, said Richard Cogdill, Pilgrim's Pride's chief financial officer .
 Pilgrim's Pride will also assume $144 million of Gold Kist's debt.
 Sharply higher corn prices this year have hurt companies that feed livestock and probably helped sway Gold Kist's directors to accept the latest offer, said Paul Aho, an economist with the consulting firm Poultry Perspective.
 Pilgrim's Pride shares rose $2.52, to $27.90, while Gold Kist shares were up 90 cents, to $20.87.

HEADLINE: Arriving Late and Without the Buzz, Films That Shouldn't Be Overlooked

BYLINE: By A.O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''Days of Glory,'' the English title of Rachid Bouchareb's new film -- called ''Indigenes,'' or natives, in French -- has a rousing, somewhat generic war-movie ring. And Mr. Bouchareb, a French director of Algerian descent who has made four previous features, sticks close to the conventions of the genre as he follows a small group of World War II infantrymen from North Africa through Italy and across France into Alsace. His combat sequences are filmed with exquisite precision and edited with admirable economy, and the quieter moments that allow the characters of the men to emerge find a perfect balance between dramatic impact and psychological authenticity. 
 In many ways ''Days of Glory,'' Algeria's official Oscar submission for best foreign language film, fits comfortably into a proud and apparently inexhaustible cinematic tradition. It is a chronicle of courage and sacrifice, of danger and solidarity, of heroism and futility, told with power, grace and feeling and brought alive by first-rate acting. A damn good war movie. 
What makes ''Days of Glory'' something more -- something close to a great movie -- is that it finds a new and politically urgent story to tell in the well-trodden (and beautifully photographed) soil of wartime Europe. That English title also evokes the opening lines of ''La Marseillaise,'' which announce that the day of martial glory has arrived for ''the children of the fatherland.'' 
 The soldiers in Mr. Bouchareb's film, from Algeria and other French colonies in North Africa, are fighting for France, but the nature of their patrimony is painfully ambiguous. Their stories are hardly unique: hundreds of thousands of ''indigenous soldiers'' fought against the Axis under the French flag, but their experiences have had at best a marginal place in popular histories of the war.
 The soldiers in Mr. Bouchareb's film are told again and again that ridding France of its German occupiers is a patriotic duty, but again and again they confront their status as second-class citizens (if that) of a republic consecrated to liberty, equality and fraternity. Some of the indignities seem trivial -- black and Arab soldiers are denied fresh tomatoes in the mess hall -- but they are part of an unmistakable pattern. Promotions go to native-born Frenchmen; the African troops fight for months without leave; and the assumption that they are unsuited for command and more easily expendable than the others seems written on every white officer's face.
 The present-day relevance of this story hardly needs to be spelled out. At least since 1789, the idea of France has represented, at least in theory, both a set of universal aspirations (enshrined, for instance, in the revolutionary Declaration of the Rights of Man) and a particular national identity. ''Days of Glory'' shows just how acute, and how intricate, this contradiction can be. Some of the North African soldiers, even as they resent the brutal colonial subjugation of their lands, persist in believing the old republican slogans, trusting that their valor on the battlefield will force their colonial masters to recognize them, at long last, as equals. 
 Some of the French, soldiers and civilians alike, seem willing to extend this recognition. At one point, the sergeant who commands a troupe of North African soldiers tells one of his superiors not to refer to the soldiers as ''natives.'' He also says that ''Muslims'' is not an appropriate name. ''What should I call them, then?'' the captain asks.
 ''The men,'' the sergeant responds. ''The men.''
 The actors who play those men -- along with Bernard Blancan, who plays that sergeant, a pied noir (a Frenchman born in North Africa) named Martinez -- shared the prize in Cannes last year for best male performance. In departing from the usual practice of singling out individual achievement, the jury acknowledged the film's great strength, which is that its political ideas and historical arguments are embedded in the distinct fates and personalities of its characters, none of whom bears the burden alone. 
 In some ways the central figure is Abdelkader (Sami Bouajila), a corporal better educated than most of his comrades. His thoughtful nature makes him both a true believer and a potential rebel; his devotion to French ideals intensifies his resentment of French practices. 
 Yassir (Samy Naceri) and his younger brother Larbi (Assad Bouab), Berbers from Morocco, have fewer illusions. Their families suffered terribly during the pacification campaigns of earlier decades, and the brothers fight not out of loyalty to France but for each other, for family honor and for material gain. 
 Said (Jamel Debbouze), who comes ''from total poverty,'' as he puts it, is both proud and servile, misjudging the sergeant's affection for him and refusing all offers of promotion or advancement. Messaoud (Roschdy Zem), an ace marksman with ''bad luck'' tattooed on his chest, has a quiet, sorrowful air. He tests the tolerance of French society and the military bureaucracy by falling in love with a Frenchwoman, a Marseillaise, as it happens, who loves him back. 
 The tensions and friendships among the men unfold episodically, and their confrontations with the varieties of French racism -- and the occasional manifestations of French decency -- are punctuated by bloody encounters with the German enemy. Mr. Bouchareb, working from a packed, efficient script by Olivier Lorelle, has an impeccable sense of narrative rhythm. For all of its characters and incidents, ''Days of Glory'' rarely feels crowded or hectic, and its occasional didacticism never prevents you from appreciating the excellence of the filmmaking. Mr. Bouchareb makes every shot count.
 The movie ends, true to Greatest Generation form, with a survivor's visit, 60 years after the war, to a cemetery, where rounded, tapered Muslim headstones are at least as numerous as white crosses. ''If I liberate a country, it's my country,'' Said declared earlier, in a moment of postbattle exuberance. The last scenes suggest a grim corollary: If you die in a country, it's your home. 
 But the contradictions persist. The children and grandchildren of Said, Abdelkader and their comrades, are still not entirely at home in France, which shed its colonies grudgingly (and in the case of Algeria, brutally) in the decades after the defeat of fascism. The ''indigenous'' soldiers saw their military pensions frozen in 1959 as their countries moved toward independence. A law passed in 2002 promised them restitution, but no funds were authorized until this year, when Jacques Chirac, the president of the republic, attended a screening of ''Days of Glory,'' a powerful exploration of injustice and resilience that arrived six decades too late, and just in time. 
 ''Days of Glory'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for combat violence and some profanity.

HEADLINE: Beyond a Daring Rescue, A Real Alaskan Odyssey 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:

In a Far Country
The True Story of a Mission, a Marriage, a Murder and the Remarkable Reindeer Rescue of 1898
By John Taliaferro
Illustrated. 400 pages. PublicAffairs. $26.95.
 The summer of 1898 was crowded with news. Teddy Roosevelt was charging up San Juan Hill. The United States annexed Hawaii. Gold fever was sweeping Alaska.
Newspapers, perhaps understandably, overlooked a strange story that had been unfolding not too far from the Alaskan gold fields. In the dead of winter an American missionary had set out with a herd of reindeer to relieve the stranded crew members of eight ice-bound whaling ships, traveling 700 miles across punishing, unfamiliar territory. By the time word of the reindeer rescue reached the mainland, no one really cared. 
 In his new book ''In a Far Country'' John Taliaferro aims to do justice to Tom Lopp, the intrepid missionary, and his team of seven Inuit (whom Mr. Taliaferro calls Eskimo ''in keeping with the common usage of the 19th and early 20th centuries''). Drawing heavily on eyewitness accounts, primarily the letters and journals of Mr. Lopp and his wife, he provides an almost day-by-day account of the arduous reindeer drive from Cape Prince of Wales, on the Bering Strait, to Point Barrow, the northernmost spot in Alaska. 
 The ''remarkable reindeer rescue'' of the book's convoluted subtitle turns out to be something less than promised. ''Somewhat unusual'' might be closer to the truth than ''remarkable.'' Or ''daring but perhaps pointless.'' 
 After three months on the trail, Mr. Lopp and his team arrived at their destination with 382 reindeer, only to discover that the reindeer meat might not be needed, after all. The crew members were getting by on short rations. True, they were living in squalid conditions, some aboard their ships, others in a foul bunkhouse nicknamed the Arctic Hole of Calcutta, but rumors of near- starvation and imminent mass death turned out to be unfounded. 
 ''The goal of the Overland Relief Expedition had never been in doubt,'' Mr. Taliaferro writes. ''What it accomplished is harder to calculate.''
 This is a rather sheepish conclusion to a story that begins as a rip-snorting yarn of man pitted against the elements. The Lopp adventure, scrupulously recreated by Mr. Taliaferro, subsides into a tale of dogged persistence and faithfulness to duty, with a few mishaps along the way. It lacks high adventure and pales even in comparison with the botched trek of some shipwrecked whalers, who make their way from ice floe to ice floe, blindly seeking the shore and, in their most desperate hours, chewing on their sealskin boots and deerskin pants for sustenance.
 So what are we left with? Quite a bit, after all. The reindeer expedition was simply one chapter in Mr. Lopp's Arctic career. An Indiana schoolteacher, he signed on with the American Missionary Association for hardship duty: preaching to the native people of Alaska, in an outpost where the bad behavior of American whalers and traders had poisoned the atmosphere. Sincere, open-minded and uncomplaining, he took a curious, amused view of his surroundings and his situation. 
 ''Too poor to trade, too stingy to marry and too effeminate to hunt,'' he wrote in a letter, describing the locals' assessment of their new preacher. 
 Actually, the villagers called him Good Tom. Before long he found his female counterpart in another Midwestern schoolteacher turned missionary, Ellen Kittredge. Together, in a frozen version of the Swiss Family Robinson, the couple reared a large family, struggled with the local language and learned to love blubber. 
 Their domestic life, described in all its particulars, makes up for the shortcomings of the reindeer expedition. The Lopps, both gifted letter writers, give colorful accounts of their daily discoveries and trials, some harrowing. Amazingly, childbirth without doctors does not count among these. Mrs. Lopp's letters make no fuss at all about her many deliveries. But the Lopps' fellow missionary, a truculent Southerner who regards the Eskimos as savages, succumbs to paranoia after too many long winter nights. His abusive behavior provokes the villagers, and two hotheads shoot him dead in his home.
 Mr. and Mrs. Lopp show the positive face of America's expansionist ambitions and messianic sense of destiny. They learn as well as teach. ''This is something I never thought of in regard to missionaries,'' Mrs. Lopp writes in a letter home. ''In a foreign country, to Christianize heathen people, they are inclined to become somewhat heathenized themselves.''
 They also try to do good. Mr. Lopp becomes obsessed with the idea that reindeer, the domesticated form of caribou, can solve most of the problems facing the Eskimos, providing them with meat, valuable skins and economic independence. Across the Bering Strait, the Chukchi of Siberia tended great herds. Mr. Lopp sets about transplanting their reindeer and their expertise to Alaska, a quest that leads him to the rescue expedition of 1898 and a lifetime of labor on behalf of Alaskans.
 Mr. Taliaferro, who has written books on Mount Rushmore and Edgar Rice Burroughs, dives a little too eagerly into the details of reindeer husbandry. Like his cross-country reindeer drive, Mr. Lopp's efforts to establish herds and get a reindeer economy up and running (a reindeer pony express was envisioned at one point) tire the reader as well as Mr. Lopp. A little reindeer is enough, although it is nice to know that Mr. Lopp wrote a children's book, ''White Sox,'' about a reindeer's coming of age, and that there was a reindeer lobby of sorts, powerful enough to persuade Mayor Jimmy Walker to proclaim New York Reindeer Week in 1926. 
 It's a good story but not a great one. The newspapers might have missed the boat on the reindeer rescue, but even today it would have a hard time getting on the front page.

HEADLINE: A Market Grows On the Lower East Side

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
FEW things can ignite a cook's shame quite so powerfully as the realization that she doesn't know the name and genealogy of every important purveyor of foodstuffs from here to the Maldives. I speak from my own sense of disquiet. Some months ago, a friend told me about the Essex Street Market, the 15,000-square-foot enclosed food hall on the lower East Side of Manhattan, and I felt as if I were a soprano hearing the name Donizetti for the first time. 
 The market has been in continual operation for the past 66 years. But it is thriving today as it never did, making available both the world of the bodega and the universe of the gourmand -- Goya groceries and hams cured from pigs fed on acorns. That the market itself is shaped like a giant shoebox only adds to the sense that it has become a diorama of the city in demographic miniature. Hasidic men and Latina women come, as they always have, and they are joined now by young people of indeterminate sexuality, vocation or coiffure.
Five years ago the market was only 60 percent full, said Jose Figuereo, one of its overseers. But because of low rents and an influx of more prosperous neighbors, 26 vendors now occupy every square foot of selling space. 
 The city's Economic Development Corporation, which runs the market, receives applications for new tenants on a weekly basis and, in a change from the past, will now rent only to food vendors. It leases space to vendors at $27 a square foot on average, less than a third the standard price food retailers pay in Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.
 A few weeks ago Paradou, a restaurant in the meatpacking district, opened a takeout shop in the market. It joins Formaggio, an outpost of a specialty shop in Cambridge, Mass., and Saxelby Cheesemongers, which arrived earlier this year, started by a winsome 25-year-old former art student named Anne Saxelby. Ms. Saxelby apprenticed on a dairy farm in the Loire Valley after graduating from college. What sort of person might shop at an artisanal cheese counter, one whose name seems borrowed from ''The Chronicles of Barsetshire''? It is easy to envision the cliche and yet Ms. Saxelby's customers do not conform to it. Among the predictable lot of young downtown mothers who swaddle their infants in hemp are aging Hispanic women, one of whom, Ms. Saxelby explained, comes in a few times a week specifically to buy a cheese called Ascutney Mountain. Jehovah's Witnesses seem to find their way to her as well. 
 ''There are people from the housing projects across Delancey who come in for milk religiously,'' she said. (Ms. Saxelby's comes from a small dairy in upstate New York and she sells it for $2.99 a quart.) ''This tosses out all your assumptions about who people are and what they are going to like,'' she added. ''You don't know who anyone is, really. Some people who you'd think are young hipsters, artist types, show up with E.B.T. cards,'' she said. Ms. Saxelby sells Trillium, a Vermont cheese made from hand-ladled goat curd for $24.99 a pound, and she advertises her acceptance of electronic benefits transfer cards, the replacement for food stamps.
 The Essex Street Market exists as an urban planner's vision of commercial utopia -- the sort of retail space now all but non-existent in New York, where increasingly segregated social classes come together to share if not the actual experience of affluence, then the readily purchasable signifiers of it. 
 While the market has welcomed purveyors like Ms. Saxelby, it has not given itself over entirely to epicurean gentrification. The indoor stalls are a good place to encounter yautia, a root vegetable that looks like the love child of a soup can and a coconut. One morning last week Maria Maldonado was buying some to make spicy fried cakes. The 40 pounds of banana leaves in her cart would wrap pasteles, a sort of Puerto Rican tamale filled with pork shoulder and olives and popular at Christmastime.
 A quick calculation determined that this was Ms. Maldonado's 2,900th visit to the market, give or take a dozen. She has been going there once a week every year since she arrived in New York from Puerto Rico in 1950. 
 ''In the old days, when I first started coming here, everyone was Jewish,'' Ms. Maldonado recalled, ''and I loved that.''
 In addition to yautia, and its cousins batata and apio -- all root vegetables used in Hispanic cooking -- it is still possible to find kosher wine here, at Schapiro's, which has kept a presence on the Lower East Side since 1899. On any given day, one might find Schapiro's current owner, Norman Schapiro, watching television in his booth at the market, surrounded by bottles of wine made from Concord grapes.
 Distinguished by jarring incongruities, the market does have a Soviet-era air about it. Rainbo's fish market is also a bakery. The smell of fresh muffins squelches the odor of the business's actual livelihood. The owners will make cakes to order, one of them in the form of a bowl of spaghetti and meatballs, which is on display in plastic form. 
 Among the several remaining shops that do not sell food is Jose's Memories and Bookstore. It sells no books and no discernible ''memories'' unless you were to expand your definition to include do-rags, watches and key chains in the guise of boxing gloves.
 If Fiorello La Guardia arrived at the market today though, one imagines he would be quite pleased with what greeted him. Mayor La Guardia established the enclosed market -- along with La Marqueta in East Harlem and the Arthur Avenue market in the Bronx, both still running -- to eliminate the street peddler culture he found so odious. About half the pushcarts in the city were on the Lower East Side, said Suzanne Wasserman, director of the Gotham Center at the CUNY Graduate Center and a scholar of lower Manhattan history. 
 La Guardia sought to regulate the markets rigorously. Among the rules stipulated by the Department of Markets, in the 1930s, was a ban on shouting, hawking and the ''use of abusive and lewd language.'' 
 The point of the markets, Ms. Wasserman explained, was to sanitize mercantile life in New York and divorce it from immigrant folkways. 
 ''La Guardia was half Italian and half Jewish, and he had a thing about explicit displays of ethnicity,'' she said.
 The Essex Street Market opened on January 10, 1940 with 475 stalls and 1,000 applications for them. Initially it did not do well because the Jewish and Italian immigrants to whom it catered preferred to shop on the street. It began to thrive as pushcarts disappeared and flourished in the 1950s with the arrival of a Puerto Rican population to the Lower East Side. For years before the current real estate boom though, the market was largely derelict.
 Jeffrey Ruhalter is a fourth-generation butcher who has spent the better part of the last four decades observing the changes in the market and the shifting demographics of the neighborhood surrounding the intersection of Essex and Delancey Streets. Mr. Ruhalter's great-grandfather Aaron Ruhalter opened a butcher shop on Orchard Street in 1923, one his grandfather moved to Essex Street Market when it opened.
 Mr. Ruhalter, who is 51, wiry and speaks in sentences that end in crescendo, now owns what he has renamed Jeffrey's Meats. Aaron Ruhalter made most of his money selling fat to a fat renderer, but Jeffrey's grandfather David and father, Allen, found healthy profits in organ meats -- lungs, kidneys and miltz (spleen). 
 ''I'd remember as a kid coming in here and trying to chop lungs,'' Mr. Ruhalter said. ''I'd sit there with a cleaver trying to pull them apart. It was a very difficult thing to do. A lung is spongy -- think about it.'' His father, he said, used to buy pigs' feet in 100-pound buckets. ''We were a poor man's butcher for a very long time, because this was a very poor neighborhood,'' he said. ''In the '80s if it had not been for food stamps we would have been out of business.''
 Though Mr. Ruhalter carries some hormone-free beef now, and strip steak and duck sausages to cater to customers who come to him from all over the city, he makes his living, he said, from the less glamorous offerings of a carnivore's table: chicken, sirloin, stew meat. 
 Anne Kwiatt, a graduate student at New York University, who recently moved to New York from Chicago, buys her meat from Mr. Ruhalter, her cheese from Ms. Saxelby and her lettuce from various Hispanic grocers. Unlike the markets in the West Village where she lives, she said, this one reminds her more of those in the Midwest. ''I went to one just like this in Milwaukee,'' she said, ''but it was a lot more hoity-toity.''

HEADLINE: What We Owe The Afghan People

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Losing the Good War'' (editorial, Dec. 5): 
 We are surely ''losing the good war'' in Afghanistan because, as in Iraq, we have failed to provide adequate security so that people can rebuild lives, repair infrastructure and become productive citizens. 
Afghanistan is not 18th-century America, where citizens picked up arms to defend their homes and the ideal of democracy. It is a country run by the Taliban, warlords and drug dealers. Without a real army or police force to protect them, Afghan citizens turn to any or all of these groups for their only semblance of security. 
 Even if President Bush had not been bent on invading Iraq, Afghanistan would still be in danger of falling back into Taliban control. We cannot defend a corrupt government or impose an American-style democracy where there is no security, infrastructure or basic economy other than the opium trade. 
 As we retreat from Iraq, as we surely will in the coming months and years, we should recommit American forces to Afghanistan and crush the Taliban once and for all. We certainly owe the people of that country a chance at a secure future.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Wealth Inequality Is Widening Worldwide

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Experts have long worried about the skewed distribution of the world's income, with vast rewards massing in the hands of a wealthy elite and precious little left over for the vast majority of the global population.
 But even as income inequality has reached near record levels in many countries, the distribution of the world's wealth -- things like stocks, bonds or physical assets like land -- has become even more narrowly concentrated than income, according to a new report by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University.
In 2000, the top 1 percent of the world's population -- some 37 million adults with a net worth of at least $515,000 -- accounted for about 40 percent of the world's total net worth, according to the report. 
 The bottom half of the population owned merely 1.1 percent of the globe's wealth. The net worth of the world's typical person -- whose wealth was above that of half the world's population and below that of the other half --was under $2,200.
 The widening gap between the global haves and the have-nots in large measure reflects the failure of less- developed countries to develop, while rich countries -- particularly the United States -- have experienced fast economic growth and a spectacular buildup of assets.
 ''Developed countries have pulled ahead of the rest of the world,'' said Edward N. Wolff, a professor of economics at New York University who is a co-author of the new study. ''With the notable exception of China and India, the third world has drifted behind.''
 Moreover, poorer nations face many obstacles to amassing wealth, including sketchy property rights and land tenure systems, and underdeveloped financial markets. Rich countries have developed financial products like 401(k) defined-contribution pension accounts, which spur wealth accumulation.
 Global inequality in wealth may well be somewhat lower today. The data in the report is six years old. Fast growth and wealth accumulation in China and India since 2000 are likely to have closed the average gap between the rich world and the poor.
 Americans have amassed much of the world's treasure. According to the report, in 2000 the United States accounted for 4.7 percent of the world's population but 32.6 percent of the world's wealth. Nearly 4 out of every 10 people in the wealthiest 1 percent of the global population were American. 
 The average American had a net worth of nearly $144,000, losing only to the average Japanese, who had $180,000, at market exchange rates; the average person in Luxembourg, who had $183,000; and the average Swiss, who had $171,000. 
 By contrast, in 2000 the average Chinese had a net worth of roughly $2,600, at the official exchange rate. China, home to more than a fifth of the world's population, had only 2.6 percent of the world's wealth. And India, with 16.8 percent of the world's people, accounted for only 0.9 percent of the world's wealth.
 Among Americans, wealth is distributed about as unequally as it is around the globe. The new study cited data from the Federal Reserve's Survey of Consumer Finances, which found that the richest 1 percent of Americans held 32 percent of the nation's wealth in 2001. (This excludes the billionaires in the Forbes list, who control roughly another 2 percent of the nation's wealth.)
 This tops the inequity in every country but Switzerland, among the 20 nations that measure these wealth disparities and are cited in the report. And it vastly outstrips the inequality in the distribution of income. A recent study by Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Thomas Piketty of the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris, found that in 2004 the top 1 percent of Americans earned a higher share of the nation's income than at any time since the 1920s. Still, that share was only 16 percent.
 The authors of the new study acknowledged that their results were a little rough. Wealth is difficult to measure accurately, and many countries do not even try. For many countries, the authors had to impute data, making several assumptions.
 Worldwide wealth comparisons become somewhat less skewed when they use so-called purchasing power parities -- the exchange rates at which products like a quart of milk or a TV set would cost the same thing everywhere. They correct distortions resulting from, for instance, the undervaluing of the Chinese yuan, and reflect more accurately the purchasing power of typical consumers in different countries.
 Using this method, the United States still comes out on top but with a smaller share -- about a quarter of the world's wealth. And China's share jumps to about 8.8 percent. 
 Income inequality shows few signs of abating in most countries. Still, there is evidence that the global gap in wealth may close somewhat over coming years. Paradoxically, the reason is the fast growth of China and India. 
 Inequality is growing rapidly in both those countries. As tens of millions of Chinese and Indians climb out of poverty, they are leaving tens of millions of less fortunate Chinese and Indians behind.
 But even as wealth and income become more unevenly distributed within China and India, these hundreds of millions of people making their way into the middle class and accumulating assets will actually make global wealth distribution more equal than it was before. 
 ''China and India are definitely an offsetting factor,'' said James B. Davies, a professor of economics at the University of Western Ontario and director of the world institute's program to study global wealth accumulation and a co-author of the report. ''If they weren't rising in the ranks of the world's wealthy, inequality would be increasing at a fairly good rate.''

LENGTH: 2001 words

HEADLINE: Minority Buyers Especially Hurt As Interest Rates Adjust Higher 

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and RON NIXON; Vikas Bajaj reported from Chicago and Ron Nixon from New York.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
In the housing boom of the last six years, millions of blacks, Hispanics and members of other minority groups achieved the dream of homeownership. While a steadily growing economy helped, experts say a new breed of high-cost home loans deserved much of the credit.
 Now, however, those gains are being threatened by those very same mortgages, many of them resetting to even higher interest rates.
Delinquencies and foreclosures, though still low by historical standards, are rising fastest among these borrowers, a group that is commonly referred to as subprime because they have troubled credit records or otherwise have difficulty obtaining a mortgage. There were almost six millions such loans outstanding at the end of June.
 The problems tend to be concentrated in areas facing other forms of economic stress as well. But while the rise in delinquencies is not expected to have much of a reverberating impact on the overall housing market and the national economy, experts say that the pain will be all too real for borrowers and many of the neighborhoods they live in. 
 Housing advocates, regulators and lenders who have anticipated the problem are trying to pre-empt it by reaching out to borrowers before they fall too far behind on monthly payments. They are moving to help them refinance, sell their property or restructure their debts.
 Shirley H. Byrd is just the kind of person in need of help. Ms. Byrd, a janitor at a Chicago Police Department precinct, has been struggling to catch up with delinquent payments on her brick home on the South Side of the city near Midway Airport. Her adjustable rate loan, which she took out in late 1998 at a 10 percent interest rate -- to refinance a previous loan -- has risen to more than 12 percent.
 In November, a housing counselor persuaded Morgan Stanley, which now owns the loan originally made by ABN Amro, to convert her loan to an 8 percent fixed-rate mortgage. Ms. Byrd, 52, said the lower rate, along with a second job at the Postal Service, should help her stabilize her finances, which had fallen into disarray because she has been supporting other family members out of work or suffering from chronic health conditions.
 ''I guess somebody up there heard me, because I have been praying,'' said Ms. Byrd, who filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2004.
 Housing experts say Ms. Byrd is fortunate that she sought help early enough so that counselors working through the National Training and Information Center, an advocacy group in Chicago, could negotiate on her behalf. Many in her situation do not fare as well, officials say, because they do not seek help or do so too late. In other instances, lenders or investors who own the loans may not agree to changes.
 Ms. Byrd and other homeowners in her situation make up a relatively small portion of the national housing market. And while lenders are starting to become more cautious, unless the troubles escalate substantially, most of the mortgage industry is not expected to be seriously scarred. 
 ''What has been missing in people's views is that these mortgages, these risky mortgages are not universally dispersed across the United States,'' said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ''These populations are spatially concentrated.''
 So far, a healthy national job market has kept the distress limited to the Great Lakes region, where manufacturing industries have sharply cut employment, and the Gulf Coast, where rebuilding efforts after the hurricanes are proceeding slowly.
 But economists worry that if the economy slows significantly in 2007, the number of poor and financially struggling households facing the potential loss of their homes could escalate sharply, adding to the troubles of the subprime industry.
 Big concentrations of subprime loans exist along the Texas border with Mexico, in California and in Southern cities with large minority populations. Within metropolitan areas, urban and minority neighborhoods tend to have more of these loans then suburban and primarily white areas.
 For instance, in Cook County, home to Chicago and nearby suburbs, nearly half of all first-lien home purchase loans made in 2005 were subprime in neighborhoods where minority groups make up 50 percent or more of the population, according to mortgage data collected by the federal government. By comparison, only 30 percent of all loans made countywide over the same period were subprime.
 These lending patterns have prompted criticism of the mortgage industry by housing advocates who say minorities are often unfairly given higher-cost loans. They point to some companies, like Ameriquest Mortgage, that have settled charges of fraudulent lending, agreeing to pay millions in fines and restitution, though without admitting any wrongdoing.
 The industry has vigorously defended itself, noting that the expansion of the market has opened up previously closed opportunities. They contend that lenders do not discriminate by race or ethnic group and that interest rates are determined by a wide variety of individual factors, including income, credit scores and the size of down payments.
 Subprime loans, which tend to run roughly three percentage points or more above the rates available to the most creditworthy borrowers, have become the fastest-growing segment of the mortgage industry. 
 As recently as 2000, there were just 719,000 such loans outstanding, about 2.4 percent of all mortgages, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. By the end of June, though, subprime loans had reached 5.7 million, or 13.4 percent of the total. More than half are adjustable-rate mortgages, compared with just 18 percent for prime loans.
 Mortgage companies, banks and investors have been aggressively marketing and trading the loans because their higher interest rates make them far more profitable than prime loans, even after taking into account greater default rates. Furthermore, until 2006 the percentage of subprime loans that went bad was falling.
 In 2005, just 5.9 percent were in foreclosure or in arrears for three months or more, a condition known as serious delinquency. That was down from 8.5 percent in 2000. As of June, the rate had risen to 6.2 percent.
 In sheer numbers, roughly 350,000 subprime loans were seriously delinquent at the end of June, over six times the number at the end of 2000.
 Industry officials say the number of subprime borrowers losing their home and encountering distress is growing and sure to increase because there have been so many more mortgages issued in recent years. But they argue that on balance, subprime lending has been beneficial because it has given people who previously did not have access to credit the ability to buy homes. It is a hotly debated contention even within the industry.
 ''We all should be proud as an industry,'' Michael W. Perry, chairman and chief executive of IndyMac Bank, a lender in Pasadena, Calif., told his peers at the Mortgage Bankers Association's annual convention in Chicago recently. ''We have created an enormous amount of wealth for Americans.''
 Seated next to him on the stage, Daniel H. Mudd, the chief executive of Fannie Mae, acknowledged that the industry had helped expand homeownership, but suggested that it may have gotten carried away during the recent boom.
 ''Ultimately, putting people in a home they cannot stay in is not a business we should be in,'' he said.
 This autumn, federal banking regulators issued new rules to tighten lending standards, aiming chiefly at adjustable-rate mortgages. The regulations require lenders to determine if loans with low introductory interest rates and terms that allow borrowers to make minimum monthly payment are suitable for their intended borrowers. Lenders can no longer make loans to applicants who do not earn enough to make payments at the highest interest rates possible under the loan's terms.
 Though well intentioned and long overdue, some experts say, the rules could add to the pain for subprime borrowers, who may no longer qualify for mortgages under the new, tougher standards just when many will need a new loan to get out of a financial bind.
 ''That could make it very difficult for these distressed borrowers to refinance,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.
 Mr. Zandi expects the homeownership rate to fall from its recent peak but remain higher than it was before the boom. Nationally, 69 percent of all households owned their own home in the third quarter of 2006, up from 66.8 percent in 1999, according to the Census Bureau; for minorities the rate increased to 51.7 percent, from 47.4 percent.
 The risk of losing a home is greatest for borrowers who face several hardships, housing experts say, not just a variable-rate loan. Rising interest rates will not by themselves force homeowners to default, but they will increase the risks for borrowers living on a fixed income, who do not have enough equity to refinance, obtain a second mortgage or who happen to be living in areas where home values are falling.
 David Rose, director of research and training at the National Training and Information Center in Chicago, said he had been struck by the growth in adjustable-rate lending to the elderly and low-income borrowers who are least able to adjust to higher payments. ''That's where the product makes the least amount of sense,'' he said.
 It was not always so. Before the meteoric rise of subprime lending, first-time borrowers with spotty credit often turned to loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration and issued by banks. Created during the Depression to stimulate the housing market, the F.H.A. insured slightly fewer than 5 percent of all home purchase loans issued in 2005, down from 19 percent in 2000.
 Even though they typically charge higher interest rates, private lenders have made the F.H.A. less relevant by providing credit on easier terms, experts say. The F.H.A., for example, requires borrowers to make a down payment of at least 3 percent of the purchase price, but many subprime lenders ask for none.
 Moreover, the F.H.A. cannot insure loans larger than $362,790, which limits its scope in California and other high-price areas, while many subprime lenders impose no limits.
 The House has approved a proposal by the F.H.A. to eliminate the minimum down payment and raise the loan limits. The measure has bipartisan support, but it is not expected to pass until 2007.
 ''We want to be able to reach deeper into the borrowers' pool and help those who are not being well served by the mortgage market,'' said Brian D. Montgomery, an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the F.H.A.
 That will do little, however, to help many subprime borrowers, who will face their first significant test in the coming year. And while the vast majority of homeowners are financially secure enough to cope with the downturn in the housing market, higher rates and a slowing economy would pose a much tougher challenge for subprime borrowers.
 ''It's going to have a material impact,'' said Richard D. Powers, general manager of Ditech.com, the Internet-based lender that does about 13 percent of its business in subprime mortgages. ''There will be clusters and pools of borrowers that will be disproportionately affected.''

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Australia's central bank kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged at a six-year high amid signs economic growth was slowing. The bank left the overnight cash rate target at 6.25 percent after raising it a quarter percentage point last month. The central bank has raised interest rates three times this year to stem inflation, which has breached its target band for the last two quarters. Australia's 6.25 percent benchmark rate compares with a 5.25 percent rate in the United States.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Canada: Bank Keeps Benchmark Interest Rate Unchanged

BYLINE: BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Bank of Canada kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged for a fourth-straight meeting, and suggested a change was not needed soon. The target rate for overnight loans between banks remains 4.25 percent, the highest since August 2001 and 1 percentage point less than the target of the United States Federal Reserve. Canada's economy is growing at the slowest pace in three years on weaker American demand; a currency trading near a 28-year high; and the impact on construction of seven rate increases that ended in May. The Bank of Canada in October cut its economic forecast because of slowing exports.

HEADLINE: Two Groups Won't Fight Health Plan

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Two of New York's most powerful interest groups, the largest health care workers' union in the state and a major hospital association, have decided not to oppose a wide-ranging state plan to shrink the hospital industry, leaders of the groups said yesterday.
 The Greater New York Hospital Association and the union, 1199 S.E.I.U. United Healthcare Workers East, had stood as the biggest potential obstacles to the plan, and many members of the State Legislature have declined to state their own positions before seeing what the groups will do. Their decision will make it easier for lawmakers to allow the plan to take effect, resisting pressure from hospitals, nursing homes and employees. 
Leaders of the two groups said yesterday that they would not take sides. But much of what they said sounded like a grudging, tacit endorsement of the plan, and they acknowledged that it would be taken as such in Albany.
 The Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century last week recommended reducing the number of hospitals by about 20, shrinking dozens of others and forcing some competitors to merge; it also proposed smaller cuts in nursing homes. Gov. George E. Pataki and Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer have embraced the report, and unless both houses of the Legislature vote it down this month, it will become law.
 Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, and Kenneth E. Raske, president of the hospital association, said the conclusion was difficult and painful, adding that they disagreed with some recommendations, though they would not say which ones. But as a whole, they said, the report amounts to an attempt at managing the inevitable.
 ''Many of the institutions that were identified were facing very difficult challenges to keep operating,'' said Mr. Rivera, whose union represents about 275,000 workers.
 Mr. Raske said: ''We've spent our entire adult lives trying to rescue hospitals, not close them. This goes against our DNA.''
 Hospitals are in worse economic condition in New York than in any other state; dozens have gone out of business in recent years, and many are on the brink. State officials formed the commission in part because they believed that closing some hospitals would mean more business for the rest.
 The hospital association and the union contended that the plan would cut health care costs by $19 billion over 10 years, more than twice the $8 billion in savings estimated by the commission. 
 Mr. Rivera and Mr. Raske said the savings should stave off Medicaid cuts to hospitals in next year's state budget -- a warning shot at Mr. Spitzer, who has said he intends to cut Medicaid spending.
 The Greater New York Hospital Association and 1199 often act together on major issues and jointly control a healthy political action fund. Their clout makes them formidable forces that Republicans and Democrats are loath to cross.
 The state's other major hospital and nursing home group, the Healthcare Association of New York State, has not yet said whether it will oppose the plan.
 The state commission said the nine hospitals and four nursing homes that are recommended for closing employ about 7,000 people. Downsizing and mergers could effectively eliminate even more hospitals and thousands of jobs.
 Commission members, however, said they did not expect anyone to be left without work for long because surviving hospitals would need to hire more workers to handle new patients and hospitals already have a hard time filling some jobs.
 Mr. Rivera said that he agreed in general, but that many of the least skilled workers would be hard to place. Even if they get new jobs, he said, they will have to commute farther to work, they will lose seniority, and many will have to change to the night shift.
 He said that most of his union's members are upset about the report, even the great majority who are not affected.
 ''There is an amazing amount of disbelief,'' he said. ''We are trying very hard to have our members understand the larger picture, but even at the institutions that aren't closing, people are concerned that 'this could eventually be me.' ''

HEADLINE: Studying Philanthropy, and Doling Out Real Cash

BYLINE: By MICHELLE YORK

DATELINE: HAMILTON, N.Y., Dec. 2 

 BODY:
Emily Katz has $10,000 to spend and, not surprisingly, she cannot wait to spend it.
 But Ms. Katz, 19, is not thinking of spending it on herself or a loved one. She and seven classmates at Colgate University, a small liberal arts college here in central New York, are taking a new seminar in philanthropy, learning how foundations operate and studying ways to give money to people in need.
''Rather than helping someone out for the day, we get to really look at the root of the problem,'' she said. 
 Many universities offer courses in philanthropy, but Colgate's is unusual because in early May, at the end of the school year, the students will award $10,000 to nonprofit organizations of their choice, after researching worthy recipients. Only a few such courses nationwide give students the opportunity to give away real money.
 ''We're helping students learn the business of philanthropy,'' said Ellen Percy Kraly, the professor who teaches the course. 
 The seminar is financed by the Brennan Family Foundation of Ohio, which has ties to the university through Jay Brennan, a family member who graduated in 1981. Earlier this year, the foundation donated $50,000 for five years of classes, with each group of students getting $10,000 a year to give away. 
 The seminar is not offered for credit, Dr. Kraly said, because it was put together quickly over the summer after the college received the Brennan grant. She expects that credit will be offered in the future.
 Part of the goal of the course, she said, is to help the local community, especially because the Colgate campus is an affluent enclave -- where tuition, board and expenses cost about $45,000 a year -- surrounded by a rural, economically depressed region. Dr. Kraly, a geography professor, is also director of the Upstate Institute, a research center of the college whose mission, according to its Web site, is to ''create linkages between Colgate University and the regional community.''
 Although the class cannot award money to an individual, it plans to choose an organization small enough so that future classes can study how the money was spent and what it achieved.
 ''We're not going to donate money to a huge corporation where it doesn't make a difference,'' said Widad Echahly, 19.
 Philanthropy courses that enable students to give away real money are also offered at Davidson College in North Carolina, the University of Virginia, Cornell and the University of Mary Washington in Fredericksburg, Va.
 ''There are very few like it around the country,'' said Robert S. Rycroft, a professor of economics who oversees the class at Mary Washington.
 Dr. Rycroft said his program and the ones at Davidson, Virginia and Cornell were sponsored by the Sunshine Lady Foundation, which is run by Doris Buffett, the sister of Warren E. Buffett, who recently made a $31 billion gift to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Last year, his students, who receive credit for the course, awarded $10,000 to a battered women's shelter and a boys and girls club. This year's class chose nonprofit groups that make home repairs for low-income families and tutor economically disadvantaged children.
 ''It couldn't have been more successful,'' Dr. Rycroft said. ''There's been a lot of interest from the community and it's generated tons of favorable publicity.''
 Recently, he received calls from three other colleges, all hoping for a philanthropy program. ''I suspect other schools will encourage alumni to make contributions so they can follow suit,'' Dr. Rycroft said.
 Students drawn to this kind of course are not necessarily planning on becoming the next billionaire entrepreneur, he and Dr. Kraly said. Rather, they are already drawn to service professions.
 Ms. Katz is a pre-med student who is thinking about joining an organization like Doctors Without Borders. Ms. Echahly has already built a lengthy resume with internships at several large nonprofit groups like the American Red Cross; she hopes to work for the homeless.
 ''I think I can see people who want to make a difference in the world,'' Dr. Kraly said of the class.
 Students have spent the first half of the course learning how foundations work. At a recent class, they were just beginning to think about their group as a mini-foundation, weighing, among other topics, how the public would react to their project. 
 In an area with great need, ''I think it's hard to justify the money going to the arts,'' said Cassandra Galante, 19.
 Later, the group worried aloud about making the right choice.
 ''Basically, where are we going to get the biggest bang for the buck,'' said Conley Stout, 20. ''And where can we have the most impact right now?''
 Dr. Kraly urged the group to consider the ''landscape of need'' as part of their coursework. ''When I think about the bigger picture, it's overwhelming,'' Ms. Katz said. ''But we're going to take it one step at a time.''

HEADLINE: Spam Doubles, Finding New Ways to Deliver Itself

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

 BODY:
Hearing from a lot of new friends lately? You know, the ones that write ''It's me, Esmeralda,'' and tip you off to an obscure stock that is ''poised to explode'' or a great deal on prescription drugs.
 You're not the only one. Spam is back -- in e-mail in-boxes and on everyone's minds. In the last six months, the problem has gotten measurably worse. Worldwide spam volumes have doubled from last year, according to Ironport, a spam filtering firm, and unsolicited junk mail now accounts for more than 9 of every 10 e-mail messages sent over the Internet.
Much of that flood is made up of a nettlesome new breed of junk e-mail called image spam, in which the words of the advertisement are part of a picture, often fooling traditional spam detectors that look for telltale phrases. Image spam increased fourfold from last year and now represents 25 to 45 percent of all junk e-mail, depending on the day, Ironport says. 
 The antispam industry is struggling to keep up with the surge. It is adding computer power and developing new techniques in an effort to avoid losing the battle with the most sophisticated spammers. 
 It wasn't supposed to turn out this way. Three years ago, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, made an audacious prediction: the problem of junk e-mail, he said, ''will be solved by 2006.'' And for a time, there were signs that he was going to be proved right.
 Antispam software for companies and individuals became increasingly effective, and many computer users were given hope by the federal Can-Spam Act of 2003, which required spam senders to allow recipients to opt out of receiving future messages and prescribed prison terms for violators. 
 According to the Federal Trade Commission, the volume of spam declined in the first eight months of last year. 
 But as many technology administrators will testify, the respite was short-lived. 
 ''At the beginning of the year spam was off our radar,'' said Franklin Warlick, senior messaging systems administrator at Cox Communications in Atlanta. 
 ''Now employees are stopping us in the halls to ask us if we turned off our spam filter,'' Mr. Warlick said.
 Mehran Sabbaghian, a network engineer at the Sacramento Web hosting company Lanset America, said that last month a sudden Internet-wide increase in spam clogged his firm's servers so badly that the delivery of regular e-mail to customers was delayed by hours. 
 To relieve the pressure, the company took the drastic step of blocking all messages from several countries in Europe, Latin America and Africa, where much of the spam was originating. 
 This week, Lanset America plans to start accepting incoming mail from those countries again, but Mr. Sabbaghian said the problem of junk e-mail was ''now out of control.'' 
 Antispam companies fought the scourge successfully, for a time, with a blend of three filtering strategies. Their software scanned each e-mail and looked at whom the message was coming from, what words it contained and which Web sites it linked to. The new breed of spam -- call it Spam 2.0 -- poses a serious challenge to each of those three approaches.
 Spammers have effectively foiled the first strategy -- analyzing the reputation of the sender -- by conscripting vast networks of computers belonging to users who unknowingly downloaded viruses and other rogue programs. The infected computers begin sending out spam without the knowledge of their owners. Secure Computing, an antispam company in San Jose, Calif., reports that 250,000 new computers are captured and added to these spam ''botnets'' each day.
 The sudden appearance of new sources of spam makes it more difficult for companies to rely on blacklists of known junk e-mail distributors. Also, by using other people's computers to scatter their e-mail across the Internet, spammers vastly increase the number of messages they can send out, without having to pay for the data traffic they generate. 
 ''Because they are stealing other people's computers to send out the bad stuff, their marginal costs are zero,'' said Daniel Drucker, a vice president at the antispam company Postini. ''The scary part is that the economics are now tilted in their favor.''
 The use of botnets to send spam would not matter as much if e-mail filters could still make effective use of the second spam-fighting strategy: analyzing the content of an incoming message. Traditional antispam software examines the words in a text message and, using statistical techniques, determines if the words are more likely to make up a legitimate message or a piece of spam.
 The explosion of image spam this year has largely thwarted that approach. Spammers have used images in their messages for years, in most cases to offer a peek at a pornographic Web site, or to illustrate the effectiveness of their miracle drugs. But as more of their text-based messages started being blocked, spammers searched for new methods and realized that putting their words inside the image could frustrate text filtering. The use of other people's computers to send their bandwidth-hogging e-mail made the tactic practical. 
 ''They moved their message into our blind spot,'' said Paul Judge, chief technology officer of Secure Computing.
 Antispam firms spotted the skyrocketing amount of image spam this summer. A technology arms race ensued. The filtering companies adopted an approach called optical character recognition, which scans the images in an e-mail and tries to recognize any letters or words. Spammers responded in turn by littering their images with speckles, polka dots and background bouquets of color, which mean nothing to human eyes but trip up the computer scanners.
 Spammers have also figured out ways to elude another common antispam technique: identifying and blocking multiple copies of the same message. Pioneering antispam companies like the San Francisco-based Brightmail, which was bought two years ago year by the software giant Symantec, achieved early victories against spam by recognizing unwanted e-mail as soon as it hit the Internet, noting its ''fingerprint'' and stopping every subsequent copy. Spammers have defied that technique by writing software that automatically changes a few pixels in each image.
 ''Imagine an archvillain who has a new thumbprint every time he puts his thumb down,'' said Patrick Peterson, vice president for technology at Ironport. ''They have taken away so many of the hooks we can use to look for spam.''
 But don't spammers still have to link to the incriminating Web sites where they sell their disreputable wares? Well, not anymore. Many of the messages in the latest spam wave promote penny stocks -- part of a scheme that antispam researchers call the ''pump and dump.'' Spammers buy the inexpensive stock of an obscure company and send out messages hyping it. They sell their shares when the gullible masses respond and snap up the stock. No links to Web sites are needed in the messages.
 Though the scam sounds obvious, a joint study by researchers at Purdue University and Oxford University this summer found that spam stock cons work. Enough recipients buy the stock that spammers can make a 5 percent to 6 percent return in two days, the study concluded.
 The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought dozens of cases against such fraudsters over the years. But as a result of the Can-Spam Act, which forced domestic e-mail marketers to either give up the practice or risk jail, most active spammers now operate beyond the reach of American law enforcement. Antispam researchers say the current spam hot spots are in Russia, Eastern Europe and Asia. 
 While spammers are making money, companies are clearly spending more of it to fight the surge. Postini says that the costs for companies trying to fight spam on their own have tripled, mostly because of increased bandwidth costs to handle bulky image spam and lost employee productivity. 
 The estimates should be taken with a grain of salt, since antispam companies are eager to hawk their expensive filtering systems, which can cost around $20,000 a year for a company of 1,000 employees. But the onslaught of junk e-mail does affect business operations, even if the impact is difficult to quantify. 
 At the headquarters of the Seattle Mariners this summer, the topic of the worsening spam problem came up regularly in executive meetings, and the team's top brass began pressuring the technology staff to fix the problem. Ben Nakamura, the Mariners' network manager, said he tried to tighten spam controls and inadvertently began blocking the regular incoming press notes from opposing teams. 
 Two weeks ago, the situation grew so dire that the team switched from software provided by Computer Associates, whose suite of security programs sat on the team's internal server, to a dedicated antispam server from Barracuda Networks, which gets regular updates from Barracuda's offices in Silicon Valley. 
 Mr. Nakamura said the new system had greatly improved the situation. On a single day last week, the team received 5,000 e-mail messages and the Barracuda spam appliance blocked all but 300. Still, some employees continue to see two or three pieces of spam in their in-boxes each day.
 Some antispam veterans are not optimistic about the future of the spam battle. ''As an industry I think we are losing,'' Mr. Peterson of Ironport said. ''The bad guys are simply outrunning most of the technology out there today.''

HEADLINE: An Incomplete Dream On the Academic Fringes

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
Driving through his neighborhood, where bars cover the windows of his house and where a rusting Oldsmobile serves as a lawn ornament, Tavares Kendrick can visualize the feel-good documentary. He wants a film crew to come here, to the southernmost tip of the city, and chronicle his rise from the ghetto to the National Football League. His story, however, appears a long way from a happy ending. 
 Kendrick, a 6-foot-5, 225-pound quarterback, was a strong-armed star at nearby Homestead High School, but he did not have the grades to qualify for a college scholarship until he enrolled in the spring of 2004 at University High, a two-room school with no teachers or educational accreditation and a curriculum of take-home, open-book examinations.
There, he said, he raised his grade-point average to a 3.0 from a 2.1 in just seven weeks. 
 Kendrick, 21, was among 28 athletes from the Miami area who polished their grades at University High in hopes of qualifying for a college scholarship. After The New York Times wrote about University High a year ago, the school closed and its former owner, Stanley J. Simmons, pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge. Yet Kendrick and other athletes who enrolled there have struggled. 
 Kendrick received a scholarship at Florida International University, though he did not fare well and left in the spring. He transferred to a California junior college but was dismissed from the football team this fall for breaking rules. He recently returned to Miami for a job handling luggage for American Airlines, making what he said was ''good money,'' $11.25 an hour. 
 Undeterred, Kendrick is seeking an agent and considers his chances of playing in the N.F.L. ''an 8.5 on a scale of 1 to 10.'' His most recent coaches are less optimistic. 
 Other athletes who enrolled at University High remain in college but have also run into problems. Demetrice Morley, widely considered the top recruit in Florida two years ago, is a starting safety at the University of Tennessee. He was suspended for the first half of the South Carolina game in October for ''not taking academics as seriously as he should, for missing class and not telling me the truth,'' Coach Phillip Fulmer said in a statement. 
 Damaso Munoz, a redshirt freshman linebacker at Rutgers, has mostly watched the Scarlet Knights' magical season from the sideline. Munoz took seven and a half credits in four months at University High, more than half the required amount for an entire high school career, according to documents obtained by The Times. He struggled to get through the N.C.A.A. Clearinghouse last year after problems with his transcript surfaced, and he has played sparingly this season. 
 Philip Simpson, a redshirt sophomore defensive lineman at Temple, missed last season because of academic issues and has also been suspended for a few games this season. Increased academic support for athletes at Temple has helped Simpson become more self-sufficient in the classroom.
 ''Is he doing better?'' said Peter D'Alonzo, the lead coordinator and a learning specialist at Temple. ''Yes. He's doing well.'' 
 Tavares Kendrick has a lot of raw ability, according to his coaches, and he desperately wants to play pro football to help out his large family. But he has held academics in little regard at the four schools he has attended since 2004, slowing his progress on the field partly because of a lack of game experience. 
 At Florida International, he said, he and his teammates would often swipe their ID cards to sign in for their 10 hours of mandatory study hall every week, then immediately leave. He said he struggled to manage his time and to wake up for class.
 His attitude carried over from high school, where he had poor attendance and said he spent many school days in the gym shooting baskets. Still, he said, he passed the mandatory high school exit exam in Florida, known as the FCAT. 
 ''Out of all of us that went to University High, out of the whole group, I was the only one to pass the FCAT,'' he said. ''I passed both parts. The only thing was that my grades was just poor. As far as smarts, that wasn't no problem.'' 
 He said his classroom performance, and the academic support, improved in his second year at Florida International. But Kendrick recalled that when he met with Coach Don Strock to say that he would transfer to another college this spring, Strock told him he was close to failing out of school. 
 Kendrick went to El Camino College in Torrance, on the outskirts of Los Angeles, where he said he paid $100 a month to live with five others from the Miami area in a one-bedroom apartment near the school. He said he slept on a futon, lived on noodles and received $50 or $60 a week from his family. 
 ''It was way worse out there,'' he said. ''And I'm from the ghetto.''
 John Featherstone, the El Camino coach, said Kendrick left in early October before he received any grades from the first part of his first semester there. He said Kendrick seemed capable of college work; he needed to pass a summer course at El Camino to qualify to play this fall. 
 ''He's like a lot of kids,'' Featherstone said. ''They don't seem to garner an appreciation for academics in high school, and unfortunately they get passed through the system. Then they come to college, and it's even harder.''
 While Kendrick said financial problems and a sick friend brought him back to Miami, Featherstone said Kendrick was no longer on the team because he broke the same rule twice. Featherstone said he encouraged Kendrick to stay and attempt to get his associate's degree. 
 Kendrick's statistics were unimpressive in his four starts at El Camino. He completed 53.9 percent of his passes, throwing six touchdown passes and four interceptions. 
 Much as he did at Florida International, Kendrick struggled to grasp the offense at El Camino. But he said he hoped to get a workout with the San Francisco 49ers because of his familiarity with the West Coast offense. 
 ''If he can't start for us, he's going to struggle at the next level,'' Featherstone said.
 Despite his mediocre showing, Kendrick had the phone turned back on at his father's house, where he lives, in case any scouts called. 
 ''I'm going to get an agent and make it happen,'' he said. ''I know for a fact I'm better than a lot of guys in the N.F.L. right now.'' 
 Just making it to college is an accomplishment for young people from this part of Miami, so much so that many see playing college sports and getting a shot at professional sports as one of the few ways out of poverty. There are plenty of N.F.L. success stories from Kendrick's neighborhood, the latest being Antrel Rolle, a cornerback for the Arizona Cardinals, but there are many more stories of squandered talent. 
 Kendrick's Pop Warner coach, Maurice Alexander, said that only 30 percent or 40 percent of the athletes with the talent to play college football actually make it to campus. ''And only about half of them stay to get their degree,'' Alexander said. 
 Kendrick's parents are unemployed. His mother, Connie Kendrick, said she never had a chance to finish her education because she had to work in the tomato and bean fields. His father, Willie Woodley, lost his lawn-care job in the Florida Keys about a year ago.
 Kendrick said he took his job with American Airlines to support his family and to pay for a cellphone and trips around the country to work out for N.F.L. teams. He is one of four children, and his older sister, LaToya Kendrick, who is 24 and lives with Kendrick's mother and grandmother in a tiny house, has seven children. 
 Kendrick's mother wouldlike him to return to college to take advantage of an opportunity she never had. But in a long interview, Kendrick spoke mostly of pro football. 
 As he traveled through his neighborhood, pointing out the old drug houses in front of which he played touch football, he visualized that documentary ending with him in an N.F.L. uniform. That, not a college degree, is what he wants most. 
 ''School,'' he said, ''is always going to be there.''

LEVY, JULIUS

 BODY:
 LEVY--Julius, died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 93. Jules, as he was called by most, had a wonderful life. He found love with the beautiful Jane Frederick and they spent more than 50 years together until her death in 2002. They enjoyed summer vacations in Mingo Springs, Maine and later traveled throughout the world learning about the cultures and histories of the places they visited, always making new friends wherever they went. Jules also found fulfillment in his passion for the law. 
His working class Brooklyn dream of being a mid-west country lawyer was interrupted by his mothers death. He returned home, transferring from the University of Missouri to Columbia University (obtaining scholarships at both). Upon graduation in 1936, he faced quotas, anti-Semitism and hard economic times. With the help of the renowned legal scholar Milton Handler, he found a job as an associate of Abe Pomerantz, a progressive-minded, Brooklyn-born trial lawyer. Jules and Abe were partners and friends until Abe's death in 1982. Together with Bill Haudek, Abe and Jules pioneered stockholder derivative, class action lawsuits and developed a renowned law practice at Pomerantz, Levy, Haudek & Block. Jules argued before the U.S. Supreme Court twice and treasured a note of apology from Justice Frankfurter. In addition to his law practice, Jules was proud of his 50 years of work on the Board of the University Settlement House on the Lower East Side. The Settlement honored him with its Distinguished Service Award in 1990. For recreation, Jules' lean, tall figure was often seen on tennis courts from mid - town Manhattan to Bronxville out to Great Neck and up to Maine. He also grew to take great pleasure in fine wine, good cheese, art and classical music. Jules will be remembered for his warmth, intellectual curiosity and reasoned approach to problems big and small, personal and political. His counsel was valued by clients, colleagues and friends. Till the end, Jules was well-cared for by Gracie, Sylvester, Romeo, the Visiting Nurse Service, Senior Bridge and Dr. Gary Horbar. The family thanks them all. Jules is survived by his four grandchildren, Jennifer, Andres, Jonathan and Nathaniel, who he loved dearly; his two daughters-in-law, Kathy Gruber and Margo Heller-Levy, who doted on him; and his two sons, Doug of Needham, Massachusetts and Fred of New York City who were with him to the end. Donations in memory of Jules can be given to either the University Settlement House Endowment Campaign, 184 Eldridge Street, NYC 10003 or the South Brooklyn Legal Services Cardozo Internship Fund, c/o John Gray, SBLS, 105 Court Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201. The family will be receiving visitors Saturday, December 9, 4-7 p.m. and Sunday, December 10, 1-3 p.m. at 320 West 87th Street, Apartment 3W. 
 $(6$)LEVY--Julius. The University Settlement community mourns the loss of Jules Levy, Board member for over 50 years, and indelible leader throughout. Jules' reasoned and humane voice, his wise counsel and his quest for social justice enriched University Settlement and all who benefited from our services. Our sympathy to the family. Alan P. Winters, Chairman Michael H. Zisser, Executive Director

HEADLINE: Letter From Europe

BYLINE: By Sam Ryan. 
Sam Ryan is a senior fellow at the Lexington Institute, a policy research group.

DATELINE: Arlington, Va. 

 BODY:
WITH nationalized health care, sky-high unemployment and blissfully short work weeks, you might think that the European Union is rolling backwards on the wheels of socialism. Meanwhile, with Wall Street, Wal-Mart and Viagra booming, the United States powers ahead, driven by capitalism and open markets. 
 Right? Not necessarily. 
On Oct. 17, only one day before a meeting of the European Commission, the chief executives of five major European letter carriers, representing 60 percent of Europe's mail volume, gathered to express their support for the complete liberalization of Europe's postal sector. In their countries, the companies demonstrated, a deregulated and competitive postal industry has led to lower prices and better service.
 A day later, the European Commission proposed that the 25 members of the European Union have until 2009 to open their letter-delivery markets to full competition. As Charlie McCreevy, the internal market commissioner for the European Union, explained: ''It is not fair that some markets are open and others are not.'' 
 So far, the impact of postal liberalization in Europe appears to be largely positive. According to a 2005 study by Ecorys Research and Consulting, postal deregulation could result in a price drop of 20 percent to 25 percent for the delivery of bulk mail in urban areas. The study also concluded that with liberalization, service would most likely improve.
 Countries that have opened up their postal markets include Britain, Finland and Sweden. In Germany, Deutsche Post's monopoly has been limited to domestic letters weighing less than 50 grams (about 1.8 ounces), and a field of competitors has already sprouted for other mail.
 Earlier this year, Austrian Post was partly privatized, and Britain ended the Royal Mail's 350-year-old monopoly on letter delivery, turning the letter carrier into a government-owned corporation. The British government is already saving money, as some departments have switched to private carriers like UK Mail and TNT Mail. 
 But even though many countries have embraced open markets, others maintain the monopoly that European Union law allows on letters that weigh less than 50 grams. Belgium, France, Italy, Spain and several others are expected to fight the commission's proposal, which still requires the approval of the European Parliament.
 Freer markets would surely be better not only for Europe's consumers and businesses, but also for American companies that do business overseas. And yet, if the United States were in this fight, we'd be on the wrong side. We'd be right there with France, blustering about how government agencies create jobs while private companies take them away.
 After all, an outsized and inefficient government-subsidized monopoly runs America's mail system, and it steadily raises rates on its captive consumers. Private competitors can enter the delivery market only if they charge at least $3 per piece or twice what the Postal Service charges, whichever is greater.
 Congress is now considering legislation that would present the first major reform of the United States Postal Service in 30 years. Despite the free-market rhetoric of our policymakers, however, this legislation makes no attempt to reduce the Postal Service's monopoly, let alone to privatize the agency. 
 Last year, Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, gambled his re-election on a plan to privatize Japan Post, a gigantic government bureaucracy with nearly 24,700 post offices. The United States government strongly supported the move, issuing a report explaining why Japan's postal liberalization would contribute to economic growth. 
 America loves to lecture other countries about the merits of open markets. But when it comes to postal reform, the real cowboy capitalists are oceans away.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Newest TV Drama Is a Bid to Block a Third Broadcaster

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 5 

 BODY:
Night after night for almost two weeks, Mexican television news has shown exposes on how poor people suffer from the high cost of medicines.
 The images of the ill and dying have been heart-wrenching. Legislators lament the lack of regulation. Corner pharmacies barely fend off failure. The new health minister concedes that high prices are a problem.
It may be merely a coincidence that Mexico's two competing television companies, Televisa and TV Azteca, have each chosen to focus on this particular social problem at the same time. 
 Their separate reporting comes to exactly the same conclusion. The culprits who drive the prices so high are two pharmaceutical distributors who together control 70 percent of the market. And both news teams single out the same one for particular opprobrium: Grupo Casa Saba, a $2 billion company controlled by the reclusive octogenarian billionaire Isaac Saba Raffoul. 
 What neither Televisa nor TV Azteca mentions is that Mr. Saba has his eye on another business: television. 
 Mr. Saba is the Mexican partner of Telemundo, the NBC Universal unit that is the No. 2 Spanish-language television broadcaster in the United States. In September, Telemundo and another company Mr. Saba owns, Grupo Xtra, formally requested a license for a broadcast television network. 
 Both Televisa and TV Azteca say that their coverage is driven only by news judgment. ''The high cost of medicines in a poor country with great health needs is a real issue, and it is not related to Saba and his other businesses,'' said Manuel Compean, a spokesman for Televisa.
 Jorge Sanchez, a spokesman for Casa Saba, denied any accusations of price-gouging and pointed to profit margins of less than 10 percent on the company's balance sheet.
 Within weeks, the license request set off a nasty dispute between Telemundo and TV Azteca, leading to lawsuits and countersuits. Last week, Telemundo asked the Federal Communications Commission in the United States to deny the renewal of the broadcasting license to KAZA, the Los Angeles affiliate of Azteca's growing network based in the United States. The dispute comes just as Felipe Calderon takes office as president. Mr. Calderon, who campaigned on a promise to increase competition, has said that Mexico should have a third broadcast company. 
 The decision over whether to authorize a new network, which would be awarded by public auction, could prove to be the new government's first big test when it comes to taking on powerful business interests. 
 Many parts of Mexico's economy are controlled by just one or a few companies that have succeeded in keeping out competition. 
 Televisa and TV Azteca control almost the entire broadcast television industry in Mexico, although Televisa is much larger, with about 75 percent of the advertising market. Last April, they won passage of a law that critics say gives them free space on the broadcast spectrum. 
 That law created a public uproar that has heightened pressure for more competition. ''There has to be at least one more open television channel,'' said Mexico's top antitrust regulator, Eduardo Perez Motta, in an interview. Last week, he called on the government to auction off more spectrum quickly.
 But both Televisa and TV Azteca declare that they are ready and willing to compete. ''Televisa has competed historically and competes every day in all of its businesses,'' Mr. Compean of Televisa said. 
 For Telemundo, the effort to gain a distribution platform for its programming is simply a question of equality. Televisa, the world's largest Spanish-language media company, distributes its popular telenovelas and reality shows through a licensing agreement with Univision, the top Spanish-language network in the United States. 
 TV Azteca is creating its own American network through agreements with stations in cities with large Spanish-speaking populations. 
 ''The point is pretty basic,'' said Donald Browne, Telemundo's president. ''We want to do the same thing in Mexico that Televisa and TV Azteca do in the United States. They are able to distribute in the United States, and we would like to have an opportunity to distribute our own product.''
 He added, ''We're looking for just a reasonable playing field -- not even even -- just to be able to show our product in Mexico.'' 
 The bad blood between Telemundo and TV Azteca particularly goes back more than a dozen years, when NBC first tried to enter the Mexican market. A deal with TV Azteca that would have allowed NBC to take a small stake in the company fell through after TV Azteca backed out, arguing that NBC did not hold up its side of the deal to provide programming and technical assistance. 
 A dozen years later, the dispute is even more bitter. After Telemundo hired a well-known producer, Alan Tacher, for its talent show ''Quinceanera,'' in which 14- and 15-year-old girls live together as they study with voice and dance coaches, TV Azteca argued that it had an exclusive contract with him. 
 Azteca won an injunction from a Mexican judge to stop production, and Azteca lawyers accompanied the police on a raid on the studio where Telemundo was filming one of the final episodes. The production was eventually moved to Miami.
 The raid is one of the main arguments in NBC's filing last week with the F.C.C. It accuses TV Azteca of strong-arm tactics against Telemundo's operations in Mexico to prevent it from ''competing lawfully against TV Azteca in its own country.'' 
 The filing also raises the long-running fraud case against TV Azteca's controlling shareholder, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in January 2005. Mr. Salinas Pliego first delisted TV Azteca's shares from the New York Stock Exchange and settled with the S.E.C. last September, paying a fine of $7.5 million. 
 Rick Cotton, NBC Universal's general counsel, said, ''If participation in the Mexican marketplace is foreclosed by the actions of TV Azteca in particular, then participation by TV Azteca in the U.S. marketplace needs to be re-examined by U.S. regulatory authorities.'' 
 TV Azteca saw the NBC filing as a direct attack. ''We are outraged,'' Azteca America's chairman, Luis J. Echarte, said in an e-mail message. ''The filing has no legal fundamentals and is clearly a media ploy that attempts to damage the reputation of TV Azteca and its subsidiaries in the U.S., and put pressure on the Mexican government into auctioning new television licenses.''
 The networks, meanwhile, can point to one accomplishment with their series on drug prices. Mexico's antitrust commission plans to begin an investigation into the market for distributing pharmaceuticals.
 Mr. Perez-Motta, the antitrust official, said: "There's nothing strange about responding to media pressure."

HEADLINE: What Statistics On Home Sales Aren't Saying

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Down in Naples, Fla., a fast-growing city on the Gulf of Mexico, there was an auction of houses about a month ago. 
 An auction isn't the usual way to sell a home, but it can make sense for people who don't want to leave their houses on the market for months at a time and also don't want to take the first offer to come along. So on a Saturday morning inside the Naples Beach Hotel and Golf Club, a few dozen houses went on the block in front of about 500 bidders.
 Based on the official housing statistics, you might have guessed that the sellers would have made out just fine, despite all the talk of a real estate slump. According to one widely followed real estate index -- tabulated by the government agency that regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the average house in Naples sold for 20 percent more this summer than it would have a year earlier. 
 But that wasn't what happened at the auction. In fact, if you were at the beach club that Saturday, you could have been excused for thinking that the real estate market was crashing. 
 One three-bedroom ranch house with a pool sold for $671,000. In 2005, the same house sold for $809,000. Another house, just steps from Naples Bay, sold for $880,000 at the auction., compared with $1.35 million a year earlier. On average, the houses that changed hands at the auction had fallen about 25 percent in value since 2005, according to Thomas Lawler, a real estate consultant who analyzed the auction's results.
 Now, Naples is not a typical housing market. House prices nearly tripled in the first half of this decade, and speculators, who are more likely than residents to sell a house in a panic, flooded into the area in recent years. But with that said, Naples is not as unusual as you may think.
 The truth is that the official numbers on house prices -- the last refuge of soothing information about the real estate market on the coasts -- are deeply misleading. Depending on which set you look at, you'll see that prices have either continued to rise, albeit modestly, or have fallen slightly over the last year. But the statistics have a number of flaws, perhaps the biggest being that they are based only on homes that have actually sold. The numbers overlook all those homes that have been languishing on the market for months, getting only offers that their owners have not been willing to accept.
 In reality, homes across much of Florida, California and the Northeast are worth a lot less than they were a year ago. The auction in Naples may have exaggerated the downturn in the market there, but not by much. Tom Doyle, a Naples real estate agent, estimated that a typical house there, sold in the normal way, would go for about 20 percent less than it did the previous fall. 
 In the Boston area, prices have fallen about 10 to 15 percent since the middle of 2005, estimated Chobee Hoy, who owns a real estate brokerage firm in Brookline. Jerome J. Manning, who runs the Massachusetts-based auction company that conducted the Naples sale, told me he thought that values had dropped about 20 percent around Boston. (The government, meanwhile, says the average price rose 1 percent from last summer to this summer. But here's all you need to know about how well the government tracks the Boston market: the index excludes any mortgage larger than $417,000.)
 In September of last year, Ms. Hoy sold a one-bedroom condominium in Brookline for $395,000. She recently sold another apartment of the same size in the same building for $300,000. Since March, her firm has been listing a house in the Fisher Hill neighborhood of Brookline that cost $995,000 when it last sold, in the summer of 2004. Ms. Hoy expects it to sell this time for less than $900,000.
 The market in northern Virginia is similar: prices are down 10 to 15 percent, according to an analysis by Mr. Lawler, a former Fannie Mae executive who's based there. In Portland, Me., the typical house has lost about 10 percent of its value in the last year and a half, said Bill Trask, the former head of the local Realtors' board.
 In New York City, where co-op boards generally bar the door to absentee speculators and creative mortgages, prices seem to have slid a bit in the last few months, but only to roughly their 2005 levels. In the New York suburbs, though, values have fallen perhaps 10 percent or more since last year. Prices also appear to be down in Sacramento and San Diego. 
 For many homeowners, of course, the decline doesn't much matter. They didn't really benefit from the run-up, and they won't suffer from the decline. And for any renters hoping to buy a home, the fall in prices is downright good news.
 Unfortunately, there are also a lot of families that took on huge mortgage debts based on the ephemeral peak values of their properties. In effect, they cashed in on the housing boom without cashing out. As Ed Smith Jr., the chief executive of Plaza Financial Group, a mortgage brokerage firm near San Diego, said, ''So many people picked up their homes, turned them upside down and shook them like a piggy bank.''
 The withdrawals have been so big that the average household in Boston now has slightly less equity in its home than it did in 2000, according to an analysis by Moody's Economy.com that took inflation into account. And that analysis used the house prices reported by the National Association of Realtors, which appear to be more accurate than the government's data right now but are still too rosy. 
 Then there are the people who bought their homes in the last couple of years and made almost no down payment. Many of them may now be underwater, owing more on their mortgages than their houses are worth. 
 Most worrisome, growing numbers of these families are falling behind on their mortgage payments, and they won't be able to bail themselves out by refinancing or selling their homes. ''We're now going to combine a high amount of debt with falling home values,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Economy.com. 
 For the broader economy, this may turn out to be just a hiccup. Big piles of debt can often look scarier than they really are. Then again, the housing slump of 2006 may also be the start of something larger. Mr. Zandi considers it to be ''the most significant threat to the global expansion.'' 
 Over the last few decades, the world's financial system has endured a crisis roughly once every three or four years. There was the stock market crash of 1987, the Asian and Mexican meltdowns in the 1990s, the dot-com implosion of 2000 and, most recently, the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001. We may now be living on both borrowed money and borrowed time.

HEADLINE: When the Dollar Talks Back

 BODY:
Talking up the dollar is a tradition among government officials, who always want to prevent an exchange-rate swing from accelerating into a dollar plunge -- an economic nightmare that would be marked by spikes in prices and interest rates. As the dollar fell over the past two weeks, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. played his role, saying that ''a strong dollar is clearly in our nation's best interest.'' And Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave a speech in which he was cautiously optimistic about economic growth and signaled that he would not cut interest rates anytime soon. 
 Growth and relatively high rates -- if they came to pass -- would be a good combination for the dollar. But as of yesterday, the dollar hadn't moved up much from its recent lows against other major currencies. Investors remain largely focused on economic weakness in the United States and gathering strength in Europe -- which portend a weaker dollar, no matter what anyone says.
A weaker currency is inevitable for a country as indebted as the United States is. During the Bush years, deficits have mushroomed -- in the federal budget and in trade. Anything that affects foreign investors' willingness to finance enormous deficits pushes the dollar down -- including better investment opportunities elsewhere, as there are now.
 The great unknowables are the timing and steepness of a sustained dollar decline. Over the past few years, investors who bet on a weakening dollar have lost money. But the current swoon is a reminder that no nation, even the United States, can borrow forever without facing up to economic consequences. 
 The government has been assuming -- correctly, so far -- that the United States is too big to fail. Administration officials seem confident that the Chinese, in particular, will continue to finance the nation's deficits, because doing so helps their exports. They also assume that China and other countries won't sell off chunks of their huge dollar holdings, lest they drive the dollar down, and with it, the value of their remaining dollar-based assets.
 That's more like a standoff than stability, and it puts way too much of the nation's well being in the hands of foreign central bankers. But it's the best the Bush crowd has had to offer, because true stability in global finance is grounded in fiscal responsibility at home, something the administration lacks. 
 Global balance requires cooperation. When Mr. Paulson travels to China this month, he will no doubt seek ways to adjust American and Chinese currencies in an orderly fashion. But there is no substitute for getting one's own financial house in order.

HEADLINE: Rise in Unit Labor Costs Revised Downward, Reducing Inflation Fears

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
A revised Labor Department report on worker productivity and earnings suggests that rising labor costs may not be spurring inflation as much as some economists have thought.
 While the new figures are likely to ease concerns about inflation, they showed that workers made considerably less than was first estimated. 
The report, issued yesterday, said that unit labor costs, a measure of what workers earn that takes into account their productivity, rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter, rather than the 3.8 percent first estimated last month.
 Revisions for the second quarter of 2006 showed a larger difference. Unit labor costs actually fell by 2.4 percent; an earlier report estimated that they had risen 5.4 percent.
 Worker productivity, which the Labor Department initially calculated to be flat, increased 0.2 percent in the third quarter. That increase was still far less than the productivity gains seen in the first half of the year.
 Strong productivity growth helps offset growing labor costs, and in that sense, some economists suggested that the small increase in productivity growth was troublesome.
 Policy makers at the Federal Reserve, including its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have said recently that inflation could increase if employers passed along higher labor costs to consumers. Mr. Bernanke said last week that the Fed would be more inclined to raise interest rates if it saw evidence of that happening.
 In a research report yesterday, Stuart Hoffman, chief economist with PNC Financial, wrote, ''With energy and commodity prices having receded from their peaks, labor costs now represent the most significant source of potential inflation pressures for the U.S. economy.'' 
 Yesterday's data, he added, ''should bring a major measure of relief'' to Fed officials.
 Nariman Behravesh, chief economist with Global Insight, wrote, ''Based on these numbers, the Fed can rest easier about the threat of inflation.'' 
 Mr. Behravesh is one of many economists who predicts that the Fed will cut short-term interest rates next year to bolster growth and prevent the economy from slowing too much. ''The only debate now seems to be about when the Fed will cut,'' he said. ''If the data continue to show weakness in the real economy with no inflation, the Fed could cut as early as March, but no later than May.''
 Two other reports released yesterday sent mixed signals about the health, and therefore the outlook, for the economy. New orders for manufactured goods in October fell by $19.3 billion, or 4.7 percent, to $390.3 billion, the largest decrease in more than six years, the Commerce Department reported, a sign that businesses were holding back spending. 
 But a gauge of nonmanufacturing activity showed an increase in November. The Institute for Supply Management's service industry index rose to a score of 58.9 from 57.1 in October, the highest level since May, on growth in businesses like retailing, health care and housing leasing and rental.

BASEBALL

LESTER FREE OF LYMPHOMA -- Doctors treating Boston Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester have told him he is free of lymphoma, and he is planning to report to training camp on time.
 ''It was my expectation from the beginning to be at spring training at some point,'' Lester, a 22-year-old left-hander, said yesterday. ''Now that everything is looking good and ready to go, I'm ready to be there on the reporting day that pitchers and catchers need to be there.''
Lester won his first five starts as a rookie this year and was 7-2 with a 4.76 earned run average when he was found to have anaplastic large cell lymphoma, a form of cancer, at the end of August, ending his season. He had four courses of chemotherapy before a scan came up clean. 
 ''I'm cancer-free right now,'' Lester said in a conference call. ''I have one more treatment Dec. 21 and then I'll be done.''
 Red Sox Manager Terry Francona said at baseball's winter meetings in Florida that he has been in touch with Lester and called the prognosis ''probably the most important thing that could happen down here.''

FOOTBALL

BOWDEN INDUCTED INTO HALL -- Bobby Bowden's Florida State Seminoles went 6-6 in his 31st season as head coach and his son Jeff resigned as offensive coordinator. The 77-year-old Bowden called it his most ''trying season'' yesterday, hours before his induction into the College Football Hall of Fame at the National Football Foundation awards banquet in New York.
 ''I could step out so easily,'' he said. ''Go retire and have a good time.''
 But, Bowden said: ''I don't want to do that. It's like a fighter. A fighter always thinks he's got one more good fight. As a coach, I still want to win a national championship.''
 Bowden, along with Penn State Coach Joe Paterno and 13 former players, were elected to the Hall of Fame in May. Paterno's induction was delayed until next year because he is recovering from leg surgery. 

PATA REWARD INCREASED -- The reward for information leading to the arrest of those responsible for the shooting death of Miami defensive lineman Bryan Pata has been raised to $21,000. Pata was shot and killed Nov. 7 outside his apartment complex. Originally, the police and Crimestoppers said there was a $1,000 reward for information leading to an arrest. The additional money is coming from donations made through the university.
 ''On the advice of Miami-Dade police, the full reward amount was not immediately released, but held until further instructions,'' the university said in a statement yesterday. 

ARENABOWL IN NEW ORLEANS -- New Orleans was awarded next year's ArenaBowl, the city's first professional championship game since Hurricane Katrina. The announcement yesterday at the New Orleans Arena was the fulfillment of a commitment made by the Arena Football League's board to bring the championship game to New Orleans when it was ''economically and logistically feasible.''

GOLF

VENTURI HAS HEART SURGERY -- Ken Venturi, the 1964 United States Open champion and a longtime golf analyst for CBS, underwent heart surgery last Friday at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif.
 ''He's under some pain and being medicated,'' Ken Terjesen, his business manager, said. ''It was a five-way bypass and they did some valve repair. The doctors were very pleased with the operation. The prognosis is good.''

HEADLINE: And Give Me a Fath Archive

BYLINE: By Eric Wilson

 BODY:
OF the offbeat gifts included in this year's Neiman Marcus holiday catalog, the fashion highlight is to be found on Page 93: the archives of the couturier Jacques Fath, a midcentury master once considered among the big three of French design, with Christian Dior and Pierre Balmain. It is available for $3.5 million. 
 The archives, comprising 3,488 illustrations in 26 volumes, are considered rare by collectors because few designers were as meticulous in their record-keeping as Mr. Fath, who executed and annotated the sketches (some with the illustrator Rene Grau) and gathered them to be neatly bound in Italy each season. That the volumes are made up of fashions from 1948 to 1956 underscores the sad ending of the designer, who was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1954 at age 42. Mr. Fath, anticipating his death, designed several seasons of couture to be carried out by his wife.
The archives are being sold by Rita Watnick, the owner of the Beverly Hills couture resale store Lily et Cie, who acquired them about nine years ago in a private sale. ''Fath, unlike any of the other houses, knew the illustrations were important,'' Ms. Watnick said. ''I would have bought them even had he not been my favorite designer.'' 
 Recently she came around to the idea of parting with them through Neiman Marcus. ''When somebody owns as much as I do,'' she said, ''the obvious answer to why is that everything needs a good caretaker. We're looking for a good home.''
 Ms. Watnick, whose collection of vintage fashion is among the most envied in America and the occasional source for an admirably dated red-carpet look worn by Demi Moore or Nicole Kidman, would not say how she acquired the Fath archives or how much she paid for them. The $3.5 million price was based on recent estimates of individual sketches, though it could be considered a reflection of luxury inflation. The archives were last offered publicly by Christie's in 1997, when their value was estimated at about $:200,000, then about $324,000. As part of the Neiman Marcus package, Ms. Watnick is including three dresses from 1951 that correspond to the illustrations.
 There is a caveat. The new owner must keep the collection together, ideally as a donation to a museum or the basis for a research center.

PERSON: Arthur Shimkin

HEADLINE: Arthur Shimkin, 84, Produced Records for 'Runny-Nosed Kids' 

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Arthur Shimkin, a Grammy Award-winning producer of children's records, including Hans Christian Andersen fairy tales and ''Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'' -- sung, appropriately enough, by Jimmy Durante (the ''Schnozzola'') -- died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 84.
 The cause was bladder cancer, his son Carl said. 
As head of the Little Golden Records division of the Simon & Schuster publishing company in the 1950s and '60s and of Sesame Street Records in the '70s, Mr. Shimkin often said that his clientele was the kid at home from school with the sniffles, and moms and dads weary of reading ''Cinderella'' for the fourth straight time.
 He was the executive producer of more than 3,000 records that sold more than 5 million copies -- including at least 500,000 of ''Sesame Street Fever,'' a takeoff on the 1977 Bee Gees hit ''Saturday Night Fever.'' He was nominated for 13 Grammys, including the one he won in 1961 for ''Peter and the Wolf,'' played by the New York Philharmonic under the baton of Leonard Bernstein. 
 Mr. Shimkin came to his career circuitously. An economics major in college, he was hired to work in Simon & Schuster's business department in 1948 and asked to come up with a new marketing concept.
 ''My father spent months reading the comment cards sent in by parents of children being read to,'' Carl Shimkin said. ''The comment that came back most was that they were worn out because their children always wanted them to read those stories over and over again. They wished there was some kind of recording so they could leave the room.'' 
 Mr. Shimkin sold the idea to Max Schuster, one of the company's founders, and the Little Golden Records label took off. It first came out with versions of classic fairy tales like ''The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' on two-sided 45 r.p.m. records. Then came long-playing albums featuring celebrities like Bing Crosby crooning Christmas carols, Alfred Hitchcock narrating ghost stories and the likes of Roy Rogers, Burl Ives and Johnny Cash singing children's favorites.
 In 1961, Mr. Shimkin produced ''Young Abe Lincoln,'' a Broadway show written specifically for children. Although the musical closed after only 22 performances at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, it returned to Off Broadway for a long run at the York Theater and has often been performed on the road and in school productions across the country. 
 A native of Brooklyn, Mr. Shimkin was born on Oct. 8, 1922. Besides his son Carl, of Queens, he is survived by his wife of 39 years, Bonnie Lee Sanders, who is a songwriter; three other sons, Tony of Manhattan, Jonathan of South Fallsburg, N.Y., and David of East Northport, N.Y.; and 5 grandchildren. 
 Mr. Shimkin graduated from Columbia University in 1943, then served in the Army Air Corps. Before joining Simon & Schuster, he was a freelance writer for several years in the late 1940s. In 1970, in association with the Children's Television Workshop, he started Sesame Street Records. In his later years, he produced records introducing basic reading, classical music and Shakespeare to children.
 ''Our audience is one runny-nosed kid who is sitting on the floor,'' Mr. Shimkin said in a 1961 interview. ''He can't go to school and he can't watch TV because there's nothing on, so he turns on a record. I want to introduce him to literature, history, music.''

HEADLINE: Rally Stalls as Investors Wait for Jobs Data and the Fed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street's two-day rally ended yesterday as investors awaited the government's jobs report and registered their disapproval of Yahoo's biggest management shake-up in more than five years.
 Investors pulled back ahead of the November payroll report, which is scheduled to be released by the Labor Department on Friday, and next Tuesday's Federal Reserve meeting. A series of recent economic reports have led to speculation that policy makers might cut rates after more than two years of increases that ended in June.
But Wall Street largely ignored an employment indicator published by ADP and Macroeconomic Advisers that indicated the Labor Department will report an increase of 158,000 jobs -- an increase that might dissuade the Fed from nudging rates downward. Economists are looking for an increase of 110,000 jobs. 
 ''You're seeing a lot of portfolio adjustments that will go right through to the Fed meeting, and some year-end window dressing will carry us through the end of the month,'' said Scott Fullman, director of investment strategy for Hapoalim Securities. ''The jobs report on Friday is obviously going to have an impact, but everyone wants to know what the Fed is thinking.''
 Technology shares struggled after Yahoo announced a makeover to help bolster the Internet portal's competitiveness against Google. The business software maker Novell was under pressure after releasing a disappointing forecast.
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 22.35 points, or 0.18 percent, to 12,309.25 after rising a total of 137 points Monday and Tuesday. Broader stock indicators also fell. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 1.86 points, or 0.13 percent, to 1,412.90, and the Nasdaq declined 6.52 points, or 0.27 percent, to 2,445.86.
 Stocks are still up on the week on the strength of a string of corporate takeover deals and indications that inflation remains in check. For the year, the Dow is up 14.85 percent, the Nasdaq has advanced 10.91 percent, and the S.& P. 500 is up 13.19 percent.
 In the bond market the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 12/32, to 101 3/32, with the yield rising to 4.49 percent from 4.44 percent late Tuesday. The dollar was mixed against other major currencies, while gold prices fell.
 Oil prices fluctuated after the Energy Information Administration reported that crude, gasoline and distillate inventories fell last week. The drop in oil inventories came as a surprise for analysts, sending a barrel of light sweet crude down 24 cents to $62.19 in New York trading. 
 ''I have a feeling with the market being viewed as glass half full, almost anything they say will lead to a drift higher for the stock market for the rest of the year,'' said Matt Kelmon, portfolio manager of the Kelmoore Strategy Funds. ''The people hoping for a hint at an ease will be disappointed, and even a knee-jerk sell-off will be followed by some end of the year buying.''
 Yahoo, the world's second-largest search engine behind Google, announced an overhaul on Tuesday to give the company a clearer direction and streamline operations. The chief financial officer, Susan Decker, was put in charge of ad sales in a move that may signal that she is in line for the company's top job.
 The stock, which has struggled this year while Google flourished, fell 57 cents to $26.86. Google rose $1.71 to $488.71.
 Oracle tumbled 98 cents, or 5.2 percent, to $17.88 after Lehman Brothers urged investors to take profits before the company reports second-quarter results on Dec. 18. The report said the technology company might post disappointing numbers from database licensing.
 Ford Motor fell 32 cents, or 4.2 percent, to $7.36 after the company increased the amount of money it plans to raise. The company seeks a revolving credit line and a convertible note sale to now raise $22 billion to $23 billion. Stocks typically fall as a company issues more bonds, whose investors are usually first in line to get paid during a bankruptcy.

HEADLINE: Lean Left? Lean Right? News Media May Take Their Cues From Customers

BYLINE: By AUSTAN GOOLSBEE. 
Austan Goolsbee is a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business. E-mail: goolsbee@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
When Matt Lauer declared on the ''Today'' show last week that NBC would start referring to the conflict in Iraq as a ''civil war,'' he inadvertently started his own civil war within the news media. Fox News refused to follow suit, saying that non-Iraqis were involved in the fighting, ''and that makes it something different.'' Accusations of partisanship arose all around. Yet newspapers around the country have been making decisions on this matter for months. The Los Angeles Times and The Christian Science Monitor have somewhat officially termed the conflict a civil war; The Washington Post has not.
 Any politician will tell you that sometimes what we call things is the most political decision of all. Political consultants like Frank Luntz, a Republican, have become legendary for their way of spinning language to partisan advantage: ''death tax'' instead of ''estate tax,'' ''war on terror'' instead of ''war in Iraq.'' But most people expect spin from politicians. When they perceive partisan slant in the news itself, they typically interpret it as evidence of underlying bias by reporters or media owners. 
But one of the most interesting things coming out of research on the economics of the media industry has been the notion that media slant may simply reflect business rather than politics.
 New research by two University of Chicago economists, Matthew Gentzkow and Jesse M. Shapiro, entitled ''What Drives Media Slant? Evidence From U.S. Daily Newspapers'' (www.nber.org/papers/w12707.pdf) compiles some compelling and altogether unusual data to answer the question.
 Dr. Gentzkow and Dr. Shapiro started in the world of the political. They parsed the words of politicians -- all the words -- from the 2005 Congressional Record. They found the 1,000 most partisan phrases uttered in the year. They measured this by comparing how frequently a phrase was used by one side or the other.
 In 2005, phrases like ''death tax,'' ''illegal aliens,'' ''Terri Schiavo,'' and ''nuclear power'' came mostly from Republicans. Phrases like ''minimum wage,'' ''public broadcasting,'' ''middle class'' and ''oil companies'' came mostly from Democrats. Using those phrases, the two economists made a simple index of partisanship that comported nicely with standard measures like a politician's score on the Americans for Democratic Action ideological scale.
 The study then analyzed 417 newspapers in the United States (accounting for some 70 percent of total newspaper circulation) as if they were politicians. The researchers measured, for example, all the times in articles about Social Security that a newspaper referred to ''personal accounts'' (Republican) or to ''private accounts'' (Democratic). Their measure of partisan slant came only from the news coverage. They did not include anything from the editorial page.
 The index matched most popular perceptions of newspaper partisanship. Papers like The Washington Times or The Deseret Morning News of Salt Lake City used Republican phrases while papers like The San Francisco Chronicle and The Boston Globe used Democratic ones. 
 But more important, once the authors had this measure, they showed that the main driver of any slant was the newspaper's audience, not bias by the newspaper's owner.
 A comparison of circulation data (per capita) to the ratio of Republican to Democratic campaign contributions by ZIP code showed that circulation was strongly related to whether the newspaper matched the readers' own ideology.
 Their measure indicates that The Los Angeles Times, for example, is a liberal paper. Its circulation suffers in Southern California ZIP codes where donations to Republicans are especially high.
 The authors calculated the ideal partisan slant for each paper, if all it cared about was getting readers, and they found that it looked almost precisely like the one for the actual newspaper. As Dr. Shapiro put it in an interview, ''The data suggest that newspapers are targeting their political slant to their customers' demand and choosing the amount of slant that will maximize their sales.'' 
 On one hand that sounds a little mercenary. On the other hand, there is certainly good news in the finding. If slant comes from customers, then the views of the owners and the reporters do not matter. We do not need to fear that some partisan billionaire will buy up newspapers and use them for propaganda. 
 Indeed, the study found that the views of the owner had no significant effect on the slant of the newspaper. The partisanship of corporate donations from the owner had no bearing on the slant of the news coverage in the paper. The slant of a newspaper group's other newspapers had no bearing, either. The New York Times Company's newspaper in Spartanburg, S.C., for example, had the same slant as other newspapers in South Carolina that the company did not own.
 So although politicians from both sides tend to accuse the news media of partisanship and negativity, the data suggests that they ought to blame the public. The papers basically reflect what their readers want to hear.
 No doubt, the battles over partisan language will continue. But to explain it, you need not try to find the inner politics of Matt Lauer, the ultimate ownership of the news media or even the facts on the ground in Iraq. A simpler approach would take a three-word phrase that never showed up on the partisan index: follow the money.

HEADLINE: At New Trade Center, Seeking Lively (but Secure) Streets

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Forget, for a moment, the long-distance view of the World Trade Center in which the twin towers were compass points of the metropolis. Remember, instead, the vast and largely isolated Austin J. Tobin Plaza, which defied almost every effort to make it welcoming. Recall the tangled spaces along Church Street and the blank walls along West Street.
 Plans for the new trade center are typically rendered from a far-off perspective. But the experience of the place will succeed or fail on a much more down-to-earth and pedestrian level: in its streets, sidewalks, plazas and parks. 
That is why the request for proposals issued last week by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is so important. It seeks architects and engineers to recreate Fulton Street and Greenwich Street through the trade center super-block, to reconfigure Liberty Street, to design sidewalks along Vesey and Church Streets and the new Liberty Park opposite the memorial. In short, to shape the public environment.
 This challenge may rival other difficult commissions on the site. That is because, like the others, it comes freighted with expectations that it can simultaneously accomplish seemingly conflicting goals.
 It must reweave the trade center site into the historical downtown street grid, while creating a discernible visual identity that sets ground zero apart as a special precinct.
 It must encourage the ceaseless pedestrian movement that creates vibrant street life and offer inviting places of respite, while establishing an impregnable security perimeter.
 It must harmonize with a divergent environment in which expressive architects like Santiago Calatrava and Frank Gehry and Norman Foster have been asked to make their strongly individual marks.
 It must do so on a broad scale. Liberty Park is described in the request as a ''public gathering place having pathways, benches, landscaped areas, park lighting,'' next to the new St. Nicholas Greek Orthodox Church (whose members gathered yesterday on the site to celebrate the parish's 90th anniversary).
 And it must do so at a minute level of detail, taking account of Asian longhorn beetles and the Americans with Disabilities Act, presenting design options for streetlights, street trees, planters, grassy areas, benches, signs, paving, gutters and the sidewalk security posts known as bollards. Proposals are due Dec. 20.
 ''I don't view this as an insurmountable task,'' said Kenneth J. Ringler Jr., the executive director of the authority. ''I think so much work has been done to this point, defining what people want the site to be.'' Above all, he said, that means the memorial plaza, by far the largest public space in the project.
 With 10 pages of architectural, electrical, engineering, environmental, geotechnical, security, structural and traffic requirements, the request for proposals is far more oriented to technical issues than to the broader questions of city planning. It asks designers to consider ways of controlling traffic to ''reduce the opportunity and size of explosive and/or other contraband delivered threats.''
 Even though the city will play no formal role in selecting the designer, Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff said yesterday that he was ''confident that what we create will achieve all our goals'' in the design of streets and sidewalks at the site. 
 ''We've come light-years in terms of our relationship with the Port Authority,'' he said. ''The level of cooperation and mutual respect and listening is at a point now where we do pretty much everything together.''
 Silverstein Properties has dealt with the trade center streetscape design twice.
 The park in front of its 7 World Trade Center tower was designed by Ken Smith Landscape Architect, with a playful nine-foot-high sculpture by Jeff Koons. And the architects of the Freedom Tower, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, worked on the plazas around the building with Peter Walker & Partners, which is also the landscape architect of the memorial.
 On the plaza at Vesey and West Streets, the designers call for tiered seating at the base of the tower to encourage pedestrians to linger. Trees would be planted on the plaza as well as the sidewalks. To cut down on wind -- that bedeviling feature of Austin Tobin Plaza -- transparent windscreens would be constructed at the north end. There would be broad stairs instead of blank walls. The bollards would be slender slabs rather than stout cylinders.
 ''We have to make this entire site very pedestrian oriented and very people friendly,'' said Janno Lieber, the World Trade Center project director at Silverstein Properties, which is developing the Freedom Tower for the Port Authority and Towers 2, 3 and 4 along Greenwich Street on its own. ''That means seating, plantings, art and smooth access to various uses including retail and other services.''
 ''The space has to be special at a pedestrian level,'' he said. ''We're trying not to go back to Austin Tobin Plaza.''

HEADLINE: Altoona, With No Immigrant Problem, Decides to Solve It 

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: ALTOONA, Pa., Nov. 30 

 BODY:
By now the pattern is familiar. New businesses move to town, creating low-paying, low-skill jobs that are quickly filled by immigrants. Most are Hispanics who speak little English. Some may be in the country illegally. After a few years, local leaders fume that school enrollment has surged, social services are stretched and crime has increased, and they blame the illegal immigrants.
 Since June, when Hazleton, Pa., some 130 miles east of here, began debating what to do about illegal immigrants, more than 60 local governments in 21 states have followed its lead and considered new ordinances to drive them away. At least 15 have approved the measures, typically intended to punish landlords who rent to illegal immigrants and business owners who employ them. 
 Altoona, an old railroad town nestled in an Appalachian Mountain valley about 100 miles east of Pittsburgh, is one of those 15. It approved its ordinance, which threatens to withdraw the business licenses of employers and rental licenses of landlords who hire or rent to illegal immigrants, in October. But it does not fit the same pattern. 
 ''If you were to look for the area for the fewest immigrant settlements in the country, you would look to south central Pennsylvania,'' said Steven A. Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a research organization in Washington that favors tougher immigration policies. ''There just aren't many immigrants -- legal or illegal -- around Altoona because there aren't many jobs.''
 If Hazleton, where the immigrant population grew sharply in just a few years, started the current trend for dealing with a surge in illegal immigrants, Altoona may be the beginning of the next wave: trying to prevent a situation from developing in the first place.
 ''We don't have a problem here with immigrants,'' said Joe Rieker, 40, one of five members of the Altoona City Council who voted in favor of the new ordinance. ''But we want to stay ahead of the curve.'' One member voted against.
 When places like Altoona pass such laws, it is a sign of a growing frustration with the federal government's lack of immigration enforcement, said Ira Mehlman, spokesman for the Federation for American Immigration Reform. The group's legal arm, the Immigration Reform Law Institute, has aided several towns, including Altoona, in writing similar laws.
 ''We certainly hope we see more towns like Altoona'' approving ordinances restricting illegal immigrants, Mr. Mehlman said. ''And as the message gets out that there aren't a lot of communities that are welcoming, it will be a deterrent.''
 But the legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union in Pennsylvania, Vic Walczak, worries that a different message is being sent.
 ''When you have towns like Altoona enacting a solution in search of a problem, you worry if there's a nativist impulse there,'' Mr. Walczak said. ''There's a fair bit of politics involved here, and illegal immigrants are an easy and effective scapegoat for a small town's problems.''
 Founded in 1849 by the Pennsylvania Railroad, Altoona grew as waves of German, Irish and Italian immigrants moved here. But immigrants have long since bypassed Altoona as the city's economic fortunes dwindled along with those of the railroad business. In the 2000 census, the city had just 295 foreign-born residents, about one-half of 1 percent of its 49,523 residents, and no one thinks that figure has changed much over the past six years.
 ''You see a car here with four Mexicans in it, I do feel bad about it, but they do stand out in an area that's mostly white and of European descent,'' said Mr. Rieker, whose wife, Vanessa, is a Peruvian immigrant going through the lengthy and complex process of becoming a United States citizen.
 But Altoona does have at least one factor in common with Hazleton: both ordinances were passed after local killings that have been attributed to illegal immigrants.
 In Hazleton, a local man was shot and killed in May. Two illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic have been charged in his death.
 In Altoona, Miguel Padilla, 27, was convicted in September in the killings of three men outside a nightclub on Aug. 28, 2005. Though he had moved to a nearby town as a boy and graduated from a high school there, Mr. Padilla was an illegal immigrant from Mexico. He had previously been arrested and his illegal status had been reported to the federal government. 
 Mayor Wayne Hippo and other members of the Council have said the Padilla case had nothing to do with the city's ordinance.
 But for local residents who support the ordinance, the murders were the biggest reason Altoona needed the ordinance.
 ''We just had three murders here,'' Sandy Serbello, 64, a lifelong resident said in explaining her support of the measure. ''We look at everybody differently now.''
 Ms. Serbello said she avoided talking to anyone she suspected of being an illegal immigrant, ''because we don't want to be one of their victims.'' 
 That is the kind of sentiment that worries the Rev. Luke Robertson, executive director of Catholic Charities in Altoona, which along with the local Roman Catholic diocese strongly opposed the ordinance.
 ''I don't think they thought through the unintended consequences,'' said Father Robertson, 49, a Franciscan priest. ''It promotes bigotry.''
 Moreover, said Bishop Joseph V. Adamec of the diocese, the ordinance could discourage businesses from opening in or relocating to Altoona when Interstate 99, which runs through town, is completed, connecting Interstates 80 and 76.
 ''They're not going to build here if we aren't welcoming,'' said Bishop Adamec, who has overseen the diocese for 19 years.
 He is not swayed by those who say that the three murders might have been prevented if the ordinance had been in effect in 2005.
 ''The one who did it, he came here when he was a boy and went to our schools,'' Bishop Adamec said. ''He didn't come here already formed. He's one of us.''

HEADLINE: In Unemployment Line, Bonds Looks for a Job 

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla., Dec. 6 

 BODY:
There were two Barry Bonds sightings at the Walt Disney World Dolphin hotel Wednesday, a surprising development because he probably did not expect that he would need to search for a job. Bonds had more of a scowl than a smile each time he rumbled through the lobby.
 Bonds, an unemployed player with 734 career home runs, has been reduced to attending baseball's winter meetings. He needs to hit 22 homers to eclipse Hank Aaron's career home run record, but he needs a place to play to be able to do so. 
Since Bonds's negotiations with the San Francisco Giants have stagnated, he presumably came here to meet directly with some Giants executives. But Jeff Borris, Bonds's agent, said Bonds did not meet with the Giants and came here to speak with other teams. Borris would not disclose these teams, although some baseball officials were skeptical and wondered if Bonds's actions were negotiating ploys.
 ''I'd love to set the record straight on who, what, when and where, but I can't do that right now,'' Borris told reporters.
 Bonds is seeking a one-year, $18 million contract with a vesting option for 2008, which is much more lucrative than the Giants are willing to give him. The Giants initially considered Bonds a $10-million-a-year player, but as salaries have escalated in a fertile market, they may be willing to pay him only a bit more. But the Giants are unlikely to reach Bonds's demands. He does not want a pay cut from the five-year, $90 million deal he finished in 2006.
 ''I don't know anything,'' General Manager Brian Sabean told San Francisco reporters. ''I'm Sergeant Schultz.''
 That Bonds and his agent felt it was necessary for Bonds to fly from California to be here is a decision that could be considered desperate. Bonds, 42, has played 21 years in the major leagues, but it is believed that he has never attended the winter meetings. 
 Other than Bonds, the only other major leaguer who was here was Nick Green, a reserve infielder who played for the Yankees last season. Green refused an outright assignment to the minor leagues and is a free agent. Green, who has a .243 average in three seasons, is the type of fringe player who pops up at these meetings. Typically, a superstar-caliber player like Bonds does not. 
 While the Giants were still determining if Bonds would be part of their future, they learned that pitcher Jason Schmidt will no longer be with them. Schmidt agreed to a three-year, $47 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, meaning San Francisco's best starting pitcher bolted to its fiercest rival.
 Meanwhile, the Giants signed catcher Bengie Molina to a three-year, $16 million deal to replace Mike Matheny. Joe Borowski, who had 36 saves for the Florida Marlins last season, signed a one-year, $4.25 million contract with the Cleveland Indians. The Oakland Athletics gave the left-handed reliever Alan Embree a two-year deal.
 One day after Sabean told San Francisco's KPIX-TV that the Giants were ''not in the same ballpark yet'' in negotiations with Bonds, he refused to talk about a player who has been with the Giants for the past 14 years. Sabean said, ''Silence is golden,'' and ''I'm staying away from left field.''
 Borris said he could not predict whether Bonds would sign a deal by the time the meetings end Thursday.
 Bonds hit .270 with 26 homers, 77 runs batted in and a .454 on-base percentage for the Giants last season. Those were solid statistics, especially for a 40-something player. Still, he has been investigated by federal prosecutors in connection with a steroid distribution case, he has deteriorated into a poor defensive left fielder, he is moody and he has an entourage. 
 When Bonds arrived here Wednesday morning, he did not speak to reporters. He was approached a few hours later between the East and West elevator banks and told ESPN that he wanted to see the Magic Kingdom. When another reporter asked Bonds about his presence at the meetings, he said, ''No comment, guys.'' 
 Bonds, who was flanked by a few of his agents, kept walking briskly until he reached an empty elevator. As Bonds waited for the elevator to depart, one of his associates, who weighed about 80 pounds less than Bonds, stood in front of it so reporters could not enter.

INSIDE PITCH
 The Chicago White Sox traded the right-hander Freddy Garcia to the Philadelphia Phillies for Gavin Floyd and a player to be named. White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams let slip during the announcement that the player was pitcher Gio Gonzalez. Garcia was 17-9 with a 4.53 earned run average for Chicago last season. Floyd was 4-3 with a 7.29 E.R.A. in 11 starts for the Phillies. Cubs General Manager Jim Hendry was hospitalized Wednesday at the winter meetings. Hendry said he was not feeling well and spoke by phone with the Cubs' team physician, who recommended that Hendry, 51, go to a hospital to be examined. Hendry was expected to remain in the hospital overnight. (AP)

LEVY, JULIUS

 BODY:
 LEVY--Julius, died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 93. Jules, as he was called by most, had a wonderful life. He found love with the beautiful Jane Frederick and they spent more than 50 years together until her death in 2002. They enjoyed summer vacations in Mingo Springs, Maine and later traveled throughout the world learning about the cultures and histories of the places they visited, always making new friends wherever they went. Jules also found fulfillment in his passion for the law. 
His working class Brooklyn dream of being a mid-west country lawyer was interrupted by his mothers death. He returned home, transferring from the University of Missouri to Columbia University (obtaining scholarships at both). Upon graduation in 1936, he faced quotas, anti-Semitism and hard economic times. With the help of the renowned legal scholar Milton Handler, he found a job as an associate of Abe Pomerantz, a progressive-minded, Brooklyn-born trial lawyer. Jules and Abe were partners and friends until Abe's death in 1982. Together with Bill Haudek, Abe and Jules pioneered stockholder derivative, class action lawsuits and developed a renowned law practice at Pomerantz, Levy, Haudek & Block. Jules argued before the U.S. Supreme Court twice and treasured a note of apology from Justice Frankfurter. In addition to his law practice, Jules was proud of his 50 years of work on the Board of the University Settlement House on the Lower East Side. The Settlement honored him with its Distinguished Service Award in 1990. For recreation, Jules' lean, tall figure was often seen on tennis courts from mid - town Manhattan to Bronxville out to Great Neck and up to Maine. He also grew to take great pleasure in fine wine, good cheese, art and classical music. Jules will be remembered for his warmth, intellectual curiosity and reasoned approach to problems big and small, personal and political. His counsel was valued by clients, colleagues and friends. Till the end, Jules was well-cared for by Gracie, Sylvester, Romeo, the Visiting Nurse Service, Senior Bridge and Dr. Gary Horbar. The family thanks them all. Jules is survived by his four grandchildren, Jennifer, Andres, Jonathan and Nathaniel, who he loved dearly; his two daughters-in-law, Kathy Gruber and Margo Heller-Levy, who doted on him; and his two sons, Doug of Needham, Massachusetts and Fred of New York City who were with him to the end. Donations in memory of Jules can be given to either the University Settlement House Endowment Campaign, 184 Eldridge Street, NYC 10003 or the South Brooklyn Legal Services Cardozo Internship Fund, c/o John Gray, SBLS, 105 Court Street, Brooklyn, NY 11201. The family will be receiving visitors Saturday, December 9, 4-7 p.m. and Sunday, December 10, 1-3 p.m. at 320 West 87th Street, Apartment 3W.

HEADLINE: Group Seeks Benefit Raise For the Jobless

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
With New York's insurance fund out of the red for the first time in several years, a pro-labor organization called on Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer yesterday to raise unemployment benefits to levels offered in neighboring states. 
 As the cost of living in New York rose, the Pataki administration resisted efforts to permanently raise contributions from employers in order to increase the size of the fund or benefits, according to the group, the National Employment Law Project.
In a telephone conversation yesterday, Andrew Stettner, the organization's deputy director for policy and a co-author a report on the subject that is to be released today, called unemployment insurance ''the state's largest response to economic hardship.'' 
 ''We're hopeful the governor will take a more balanced approach,'' Mr. Stettner said.
 About 400,000 New Yorkers who received unemployment benefits during the 12-month period that ended on Sept. 30 got maximum weekly benefits of $405 -- 28 percent of the average worker's paycheck -- compared with $521 in New Jersey, $465 in Connecticut, $497 in Pennsylvania and $528 in Massachusetts. The report calls for a rise in benefits to a maximum of $500 a week, and suggests that employers pay tax on a greater amount of workers' wages. That figure, the report says, should grow with inflation.
 The unemployment fund returned to solvency in 2006 after several years in the red. As of Dec. 1, the fund had $475 million, compared with a $186 million deficit at the same time a year earlier. 
 In addition, Robert M. Lillpopp, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Labor, said that the fund was expected to grow to more than $1 billion by the end of the first quarter of 2007.. That would return the fund to where it was in 2000, before the economic downturn that followed the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.
 But the current administration says employers should not be saddled with additional taxes.
 ''We have always felt that under the Pataki administration we should keep more money in the hands of employers,'' Mr. Lillpopp said, ''so it could help the economy rather than having it sit in the fund.''

HEADLINE: Panel Urges Basic Shift in U.S. Policy in Iraq 

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; Kate Zernike contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
A bipartisan commission warned Wednesday that ''the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating,'' and it handed President Bush both a rebuke for his current strategy and a detailed blueprint for a fundamentally different approach, including the pullback of all American combat brigades over the next 15 months.
 In unusually sweeping and blunt language, the panel of five Republicans and five Democrats issued 79 specific recommendations.
These included a call for direct engagement with Syria and Iran as part of a ''new diplomatic offensive,'' jump-starting the Israeli-Palestinian peace effort, and a clear declaration that the United States would reduce its support to Iraq unless Baghdad made ''substantial progress'' on reconciliation and security. 
 Mr. Bush has refused to deal with Syria and Iran, and as recently as last week, he assured Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki that the American commitment to Iraq would be undiminished until victory was achieved.
 But the commission, led by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton, argued that while Americans might be in Iraq for years, the Iraqis must understand that the American military commitment was not ''open ended.'' It is time, the panel said, for the United States to ''begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.'' 
 The detailed prescription called for much more aggressive diplomatic efforts in the Middle East than the Bush administration has been willing to embrace. Its calls for reconciliation and reform in Iraq and an overhaul of the American military role would also mark major departures in the American strategy. [Text of the executive summary, Page A24.] 
 Members of the commission said they believed that their recommendations would improve prospects for success in Iraq, but they said there was no guarantee against failure. 
 ''The current approach is not working, and the ability of the United States to influence events is diminishing,'' Mr. Hamilton said at a news conference on Capitol Hill. ''Our ship of state has hit rough waters. It must now chart a new way forward.'' 
 Administration officials said they expected President Bush to announce his own ''way forward'' this month. They were careful not to take issue with the report's findings in public, and said Mr. Bush had yet to make firm decisions. But some suggested that the diplomatic strategy in the report better fit the Middle East of 15 years ago, when Mr. Baker served as secretary of state. 
 What played out on Wednesday morning, from the White House to Capitol Hill, was a remarkable condemnation of American policy drift in the biggest and most divisive military conflict to involve American forces since Vietnam. It was all the more unusual because Mr. Baker was secretary of state to Mr. Bush's father, and because the bipartisan group managed to come up with unanimous recommendations.
 The report was delivered in an atmosphere of mounting anxiety about the war, a month after midterm elections that brought the Democrats to power in Congress and prompted Mr. Bush to oust Donald H. Rumsfeld as defense secretary. 
 On Wednesday the Senate voted overwhelmingly to confirm Robert M. Gates as the next defense secretary, after hearings in which he acknowledged that the United States was not winning the war and that the region could be on the brink of much broader conflict. 
 Mr. Baker, Mr. Hamilton and their eight colleagues presented their recommendations to Mr. Bush and to leaders of Congress beginning early on Wednesday, and then spoke to Mr. Maliki via conference call. Mr. Bush called the assessment ''tough'' and said each recommendation would be taken ''seriously.'' 
 Mr. Bush, one commission member said, ''was very gracious and did not push back.'' 
 Commission members said they believed that their report, which was downloaded more than 400,000 times from the computer servers of the United States Institute of Peace in the first five hours after its release, had fundamentally changed the debate. Now, said one member, the former Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, ''it really is out of our hands.'' 
 Leon E. Panetta, a commission member who served as chief of staff to President Clinton, said, ''The country cannot be at war and as divided as we are today.'' 
 The panel was careful to avoid phrases and rigid timelines that might alienate the White House. But the group also clearly tried to box the president in, presenting its recommendations as a comprehensive strategy that would work only if implemented in full. 
 That appeared to be a warning to Mr. Bush, who in recent days has said he would consider the independent panel's findings alongside studies by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the National Security Council, and has suggested that he would pick the best elements of each.
 The commission did not embrace the goal of ''victory in Iraq,'' which President Bush laid out as his own strategy a year ago, nor did its report echo the White House's early aspiration that Iraq might be transformed into a democracy in the near future. ''We want to stay current,'' Mr. Hamilton said briskly. 
 As the stated goal in Iraq, the panel chose instead the formulation that Mr. Bush has adopted most recently: to establish a country that can sustain itself, govern itself and defend itself. ''That was the latest elaboration of the goal,'' Mr. Baker said, ''and that's the one we're working with.'' 
 The findings left Washington awash in speculation over whether Mr. Bush would embark on a huge policy reversal. To do so would mark an admission that three and a half years of strategy had failed, and that his repeated assurances that ''absolutely, we're winning'' were based more on optimism than realism. 
 The committee rejected a stricter timeline for withdrawal advocated by one member, William J. Perry, a defense secretary under President Clinton, though Mr. Perry persuaded the commission to set clear goals for the withdrawal of troops.
 Jack D. Crouch II, the president's deputy national security adviser, was said by administration officials to be putting together options for Mr. Bush, and they said the president was determined to come up with an approach that, one senior aide said, ''borrowed from the panel's findings, but is distinctly his own.'' 
 Democrats largely embraced the findings. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said the group had done ''a tremendous and historic service'' by declaring ''there must be a change in Iraq, and there is no time to lose.'' 
 But other Democrats were clearly disappointed that the commission did not embrace calls for a rapid withdrawal, as Representative John P. Murtha recommended a year ago, or a partition of the country, as Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat soon to lead the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has said is necessary.
 Mr. Bush can easily accept some of the findings, including a call for a fivefold increase in American trainers working alongside Iraqi forces. 
 The commission's report included blistering critiques of current policy. It said, for example, that intelligence agencies had far too few people with an understanding of the roots of the insurgency in Iraq. 
 ''We were told there are fewer than 10 analysts on the job at the Defense Intelligence Agency who have more than two years' experience in analyzing the insurgency,'' the report said. 
 The speed and phasing of the military pullback was the most contentious issue with the commission, and the result is unlikely to satisfy critics on either side. The panel, for example, adopted the core of a proposal made by Mr. Perry to vastly increase training of Iraqi forces while simultaneously pulling back combat brigades, a ''train and retreat'' scenario that some in the military say is already under way. 
 Another Democratic member, former Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia, argued for a surge of additional troops to stabilize Baghdad, an idea the commission was not willing to embrace fully. Instead, it left open the possibility of supporting a ''short-term redeployment or surge of American combat forces to stabilize Baghdad, or to speed up the training and equipping mission, if the U.S. commander in Iraq determines that such steps would be effective.'' 
 But the key proposal, No. 21, is that the United States should tell the Iraqis that failure to meet their own milestones will only accelerate American withdrawal, or result in a reduction of American support. 
 ''If the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation, security and governance, the United States should reduce its political, military or economic support for the Iraqi government,'' the report says.
 Advocates of that approach said it was a long-overdue effort to shift responsibility onto the Iraqis. ''If Iraq continues to fail, or failed worse, it means you have put the lion's share of the blame on the Iraqis,'' said Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, a critic of the decision to invade Iraq when he served in the State Department.
 Critics of the panel's conclusion called the approach naive. ''The study group is threatening to weaken a weak government,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, one of the groups that helped sponsor the study group, which was established by Congress. And, he added: ''There is no 'Plan B.' The report does not address what happens if events spiral out of control.''
 The most controversial element of the diplomatic strategy is the panel's case for engaging Iran, though Mr. Baker and Mr. Hamilton, the chairmen, acknowledged in an interview that they thought it unlikely the Iranians would cooperate. Mr. Baker insisted that even if that effort failed, ''the world would see their rejectionist attitude.''

Make training and equipping Iraqi forces a priority and complete by early 2008.MILITARY STRATEGYWork with the Iraqi government to increase the number and quality of Iraqi Army brigades. The approach would include:An increased emphasis on training and equipping Iraqi troops rather than directly providing security forces.Moving more highly qualified U.S. officers into embedded positions with Iraqi units, down to the company level.Increasing the number in embedded positions to 12,000 to 20,000, up from the current level of 3,000 to 4,000.Setting a goal of early 2008 for completion of training, with all U.S. brigades involved with security possibly withdrawn by that time.No open-ended commitment of U.S. troops to Iraq.Restoring the U.S. MilitaryImprove civilian response to military input within the Pentagon. Retrain and restore returning troops and equipment. Examine the long-term impact of the war on recruitment and financing.Iraqi Police and Criminal JusticeTo perform their counterinsurgency mission better, the Iraqi National Police and Border Police should be transferred from the Ministry of the Interior to the Ministry of Defense. The U.S. Department of Justice should lead programs to establish courts and to transform the Interior Ministry so that it has more authority over local police forces. U.S. training should continue, and the embedding of police trainers should expand. Iraq should buy better equipment for the police. F.B.I. activity should expand.Oil Production and PolicyDraft a legal framework for investment, encourage transparency in prices and supply.OIL PRODUCTION AND POLICYImprove the performance of Iraq's oil sector by:Paying local tribes for protecting oil pipelines depending on how much oil goes through, rather than paying them a fixed amount.Posting oil contracts, volumes and prices on a Web site so they can be tracked by outside observers.Speeding up work on oil wells in the southern fields. The U.S. should no longer finance this work.Reorganizing the oil industry as a commercial enterprise. U.S. should provide technical assistance and management training.Reducing energy subsidies. ''Until Iraqis pay market prices for oil products, drastic fuel shortages will remain.''Economic and Reconstruction AssistanceIncrease U.S. assistance to $5 billion per year, from $753 million in 2006. International partners should do more than contribute money. Barriers to providing assistance quickly should be removed. Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction should be renewed.U.S. BudgetCosts for the war should be part of the annual budget, not emergency supplemental funds.U.S. PersonnelCivilian agencies should emphasize language and cultural training and train for future operations that involve many agencies. A Foreign Service Reserve Corps should be established. Better data about threats and violence in Iraq should be collected. The C.I.A. should increase training in Iraq.Map of Iraq and all bordering countries.(pg. A23)

HEADLINE: In the Panel's Words: How 'Prospects Can Be Improved' in the 'Difficult Days Ahead' 

 BODY:
Following is the executive summary of the report released Wednesday by the Iraq Study Group.
 The situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating. There is no path that can guarantee success, but the prospects can be improved. 
 In this report, we make a number of recommendations for actions to be taken in Iraq, the United States and the region. Our most important recommendations call for new and enhanced diplomatic and political efforts in Iraq and the region, and a change in the primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq that will enable the United States to begin to move its combat forces out of Iraq responsibly.
We believe that these two recommendations are equally important and reinforce one another. If they are effectively implemented, and if the Iraqi government moves forward with national reconciliation, Iraqis will have an opportunity for a better future, terrorism will be dealt a blow, stability will be enhanced in an important part of the world, and America's credibility, interests and values will be protected. 
 The challenges in Iraq are complex. Violence is increasing in scope and lethality. It is fed by a Sunni Arab insurgency, Shiite militias and death squads, Al Qaeda and widespread criminality. Sectarian conflict is the principal challenge to stability. The Iraqi people have a democratically elected government, yet it is not adequately advancing national reconciliation, providing basic security or delivering essential services. Pessimism is pervasive. 
 If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences could be severe. A slide toward chaos could trigger the collapse of Iraq's government and a humanitarian catastrophe. Neighboring countries could intervene. Sunni-Shia clashes could spread. Al Qaeda could win a propaganda victory and expand its base of operations. The global standing of the United States could be diminished. Americans could become more polarized. 
 During the past nine months we have considered a full range of approaches for moving forward. All have flaws. Our recommended course has shortcomings, but we firmly believe that it includes the best strategies and tactics to positively influence the outcome in Iraq and the region. 

External Approach
 The policies and actions of Iraq's neighbors greatly affect its stability and prosperity. No country in the region will benefit in the long term from a chaotic Iraq. Yet Iraq's neighbors are not doing enough to help Iraq achieve stability. Some are undercutting stability. 
 The United States should immediately launch a new diplomatic offensive to build an international consensus for stability in Iraq and the region. This diplomatic effort should include every country that has an interest in avoiding a chaotic Iraq, including all of Iraq's neighbors. Iraq's neighbors and key states in and outside the region should form a support group to reinforce security and national reconciliation within Iraq, neither of which Iraq can achieve on its own. 
 Given the ability of Iran and Syria to influence events within Iraq and their interest in avoiding chaos in Iraq, the United States should try to engage them constructively. In seeking to influence the behavior of both countries, the United States has disincentives and incentives available. 
 Iran should stem the flow of arms and training to Iraq, respect Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and use its influence over Iraqi Shia groups to encourage national reconciliation. The issue of Iran's nuclear programs should continue to be dealt with by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany. Syria should control its border with Iraq to stem the flow of funding, insurgents and terrorists in and out of Iraq. 
 The United States cannot achieve its goals in the Middle East unless it deals directly with the Arab-Israeli conflict and regional instability. There must be a renewed and sustained commitment by the United States to a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace on all fronts: Lebanon, Syria and President Bush's June 2002 commitment to a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine. This commitment must include direct talks with, by and between Israel, Lebanon, Palestinians (those who accept Israel's right to exist) and Syria. 
 As the United States develops its approach toward Iraq and the Middle East, the United States should provide additional political, economic and military support for Afghanistan, including resources that might become available as combat forces are moved out of Iraq. 

Internal Approach
 The most important questions about Iraq's future are now the responsibility of Iraqis. The United States must adjust its role in Iraq to encourage the Iraqi people to take control of their own destiny. 
 The Iraqi government should accelerate assuming responsibility for Iraqi security by increasing the number and quality of Iraqi Army brigades. While this process is under way, and to facilitate it, the United States should significantly increase the number of U.S. military personnel, including combat troops, embedded in and supporting Iraqi Army units. As these actions proceed, U.S. combat forces could begin to move out of Iraq. 
 The primary mission of U.S. forces in Iraq should evolve to one of supporting the Iraqi Army, which would take over primary responsibility for combat operations. By the first quarter of 2008, subject to unexpected developments in the security situation on the ground, all combat brigades not necessary for force protection could be out of Iraq. 
 At that time, U.S. combat forces in Iraq could be deployed only in units embedded with Iraqi forces, in rapid-reaction and special operations teams, and in training, equipping, advising, force protection and search and rescue. Intelligence and support efforts would continue. A vital mission of those rapid-reaction and special operations forces would be to undertake strikes against Al Qaeda in Iraq. 
 It is clear that the Iraqi government will need assistance from the United States for some time to come, especially in carrying out security responsibilities. Yet the United States must make it clear to the Iraqi government that the United States could carry out its plans, including planned redeployments, even if the Iraqi government did not implement their planned changes. The United States must not make an open-ended commitment to keep large numbers of American troops deployed in Iraq. 
 As redeployment proceeds, military leaders should emphasize training and education of forces that have returned to the United States in order to restore the force to full combat capability. As equipment returns to the United States, Congress should appropriate sufficient funds to restore the equipment over the next five years. 
 The United States should work closely with Iraq's leaders to support the achievement of specific objectives -- or milestones -- on national reconciliation, security and governance. Miracles cannot be expected, but the people of Iraq have the right to expect action and progress. The Iraqi government needs to show its own citizens -- and the citizens of the United States and other countries -- that it deserves continued support. 
 Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, in consultation with the United States, has put forward a set of milestones critical for Iraq. His list is a good start, but it must be expanded to include milestones that can strengthen the government and benefit the Iraqi people. President Bush and his national security team should remain in close and frequent contact with the Iraqi leadership to convey a clear message: there must be prompt action by the Iraqi government to take substantial progress toward the achievementof these milestones. 
 If the Iraqi government demonstrates political will and makes substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation, security and governance, the United States should make clear its willingness to continue training, assistance and support for Iraq's security forces and to continue political, military and economic support. 
 If the Iraqi government does not make substantial progress toward the achievement of milestones on national reconciliation, security and governance, the United States should reduce its political, military or economic support for the Iraqi government. 
 Our report makes recommendations in several other areas. They include improvements to the Iraqi criminal justice system, the Iraqi oil sector, the U.S. reconstruction efforts in Iraq, the U.S. budget process, the training of U.S. government personnel and U.S. intelligence capabilities. 

Conclusion
 It is the unanimous view of the Iraq Study Group that these recommendations offer a new way forward for the United States in Iraq and the region. They are comprehensive and need to be implemented in a coordinated fashion. They should not be separated or carried out in isolation. The dynamics of the region are as important to Iraq as events within Iraq. 
 The challenges are daunting. There will be difficult days ahead. But by pursuing this new way forward, Iraq, the region and the United States of America can emerge stronger.

HEADLINE: Far From Extinct 

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
After air traffic fell off sharply following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the Boeing 747, the hump-backed giant of the skies, appeared to have run out of lives. 
 The plane -- the first of which was flown in 1970 by Pan Am after being christened by the first lady, Pat Nixon -- was no longer in strong demand, as the world seemed to be moving to smaller, more fuel-efficient planes. And the new double-decker A380 from Airbus, Boeing's archrival, had captured the industry's imagination, even though it was years from being built.
The 747 ''was on a heart-lung machine,'' Howard Rubel, an aviation analyst at Jefferies & Company, recalled. ''It looked like Boeing was about to shut it down.'' 
 But a funny thing happened to the 747 on the way to the graveyard: it found a new tailwind, and a strong one at that. 
 Demand is growing for the new 747-8 Intercontinental, which was introduced a year ago. Boeing now has 73 orders for the plane after its latest lift yesterday from Lufthansa, the big German carrier, which announced it was placing a $5.5 billion order for 20 747-8s, and took options to buy 20 more. 
 ''It's taken us time to evolve the plane,'' said Larry S. Dickenson, Boeing's vice president for sales, at a news conference yesterday. ''We think we have a winner.'' 
 This reversal of fortune comes as Airbus's superjumbo A380 has stumbled, falling two years behind its delivery schedule amid persistent wiring problems and a management shake-up at the company. While Boeing takes pains to say that the two planes are not head-to-head competitors, the industry generally sees them that way. They are the only two planes in the ''very large'' category: The 747-8 is designed to carry up to 467 passengers, while the A380 can carry up to 555. 
 In large part, the 747's new lease on life is owed to global trade. Until the Lufthansa deal was announced, all 747-8 orders had been for the freighter version of the plane. Even the initial orders for the latest model were for air freighters, an unusual move in an industry that likes to kick off new models with orders from high-profile passenger carriers. 
 But, technological advances, particularly next-generation fuel-efficient engines, improved the economics of operating a four-engine passenger plane like the 747. 
 ''The new 747 is an inexpensive way for Boeing to capture some passenger orders, a lot of cargo orders and make a fair amount of money because of the Airbus 380 hiccup,'' said Jon B. Kutler, chief executive of Admiralty Partners, a private investment firm in Santa Monica, Calif., that specializes in aerospace. 
 The 747-8 is even being sold and outfitted by Boeing as a private jet much like Air Force One, which is a 747. Each plane carries a list price of about $275 million. Boeing will not identify the customers, but many in the aviation world say the orders are probably coming from people in the Middle East who are flush with oil riches. They are historically big buyers of Boeing jets for personal use. 
 Of course, these events have not gone unnoticed at Airbus, which has lost some freighter orders for its A380 to Boeing in recent weeks. Allan McArtor, chairman of Airbus North America, called the new 747-8 a brand-new Edsel, the famous new-car failure of the late 1950s.
 ''The 747 is on its last legs,'' Mr. McArtor said in an interview. ''It doesn't have any legs to stand on. Boeing is trying to breathe life into a 1960s-era design. There is only so much you can do with a plane.''
 He added: ''But it is irritating. Boeing is getting orders only because of our inability to meet demand. Had we not stumbled with the A380, there would not be orders like the Lufthansa order for the 747-8.''
 Boeing executives, not surprisingly, have a different view of the plane. ''The 747 is a plane that is tough to beat,'' said Dan Mooney, Boeing's vice president for the 747 program. ''The 747 will do what our customers are looking forward to. We now have a plane that works for them.'' 
 Today's 747, of course, is not the same as the one flown in the 1970s. The first version, the 747-100, featured a piano bar on the upper deck. Today's 747-8, which will be delivered in 2009, is longer, faster and will carry over 100 more passengers than earlier models. 
 At Mach 0.855, about 570 miles per hour, the 747-8 will be the fastest commercial plane in the sky. It can also fly 8,000 nautical miles nonstop, compared with 4,500 nautical miles for the original version. Boeing has produced a total of 1,379 747s to date and has a backlog of 91 orders 
 ''The 747 has turned into the Energizer bunny of airplanes,'' said Byron Callan, an aviation analyst with Prudential Equities Securities. 
 But the plane fell into a steep decline in the last few years. Once Airbus announced in 2000 that it would build the A380, it created the industry buzz that the 747 once enjoyed. In 1990, Boeing had 122 orders for the plane. By 2003, it had only four. 
 When Airbus announced the A380, Boeing looked flat-footed. For years, it appeared to dither about the future of the 747. It ordered up a number of 747-X studies of an advanced version of the plane, but came to no conclusion. 
 But the dithering paid off. As time marched on, so did technology. And when Boeing shifted its emphasis into developing its new 787 Dreamliner, a wide-body midsize passenger plane, many of the technologies it pioneered for that plane could be adapted to the 747, including the fuel-efficient engines developed for the 787 and a new wing design that could stretch its flying range. 
 ''We were challenged,'' said Mr. Mooney, head of Boeing's 747 program. ''We could stretch the plane, but not get range. We could get range, but not add capacity. The real breakthrough was the new 787 engines. That was the last piece of the puzzle allowing us to add additional seats as well as increase the flying range. That automatically allowed our customers to get more revenues from the plane.'' 
 Even more important to the longevity of the 747 was a design decision made in the 1960s, when the 747 was still on the drawing board. 
 While the plane was envisioned as a passenger jet, it was also designed to be easily adapted to a freighter model. The first freighter -- complete with a nose that opened up for big cargo -- entered the market in 1972. But, at the time, there was scant interest in this type of craft. 
 That changed in the late 1970s, when passenger demand hit a cyclical low and airlines found that the 747 was too big for their needs. In response, Boeing came up with the idea of helping airlines convert their 747s to freighters to sell them. 
 ''The conversion program came out of necessity,'' said Ned Laird, managing director of the Air Cargo Management Group, a consulting firm and a former Boeing executive who worked on the conversion program. ''Freight companies that could not afford a new 747 could purchase a surplus 747 at a favorable price.'' 
 The conversion program helped eliminate what otherwise would have been a glut of planes. At the moment, 747 freighters now dominate the air cargo market. Mr. Laird estimates that measured by ton-miles carried, the 747 represents about 60 percent of the freighter market, which has revenue of about $60 billion a year. 
 As manufacturing increasingly moves to Asia and worldwide commerce increases, the cargo market is growing at a faster rate than the passenger market -- about 6 percent a year, compared with passenger growth of about 4 percent, according to Air Cargo Management. (That said, the passenger market is about three times the size of the freighter market, with revenue of $185 billion last year.) 
 At the moment, there are 481 747 freighters in use. This compares with 353 in 2000. While there are many smaller cargo planes -- and the combined total of all them exceeds the number of 747 freighters in the air -- the 747 is the only big cargo plane available and is the only plane that can be used for some large loads. 
 One of Boeing's big coups was to lure Federal Express away from a freighter version of the Airbus A380. Federal Express decided to go with Boeing -- it ordered 15 smaller Boeing 777s -- because of the delivery delays in the A380. Currently, Airbus has only one main customer, United Parcel Service, for its A380 freighter. . 
 Boeing has high hopes that it may be able to peel away some passenger orders from Airbus, as well. Mr. Mooney, the 747 program manager, predicted that, over time, the bulk of 747-8s would be sold to passenger carriers. 
 Airlines have already hinted that more 747-8 passenger orders might be in the offing. Etihad Airlines, the national carrier for the United Arab Emirates and an A380 customer, said it might consider a 747-8. 
 Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airlines, also an A380 customer, said last October that the airline was considering the 747-8. Another possible buyer is British Airways, whose chief executive, Willie Walsh, complained recently that the A380 is ''too big.''
 In a matter of just a few years, the market positions of the A380 and the 747 have switched. The A380 has gone from being the plane of the future to the one in trouble. The 747, meanwhile, moved from being an also-ran to a real competitor. 
 ''One would have never thought that Boeing could have gotten a lot of orders for the 747,'' said Paul Nisbet, an aerospace analyst at JSA Research in Newport, R.I. ''But they will turn out enough to give Airbus some real heartburn with the A380.''

HEADLINE: No Stock-Class Shift, Times Co. Chief Says 

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of The New York Times Company, sought to put to rest yesterday any notion that the company might change its dual-class stock structure, a move that could make the company vulnerable to a takeover.
 ''The Ochs-Sulzberger family, which owns approximately 20 percent of the equity of our company -- more than any other investor -- has no intention of opening our doors to the kind of action that is tearing at the heart of some of the other great journalistic institutions in our country,'' Ms. Robinson told analysts. 
 Only the family trust that controls the Times Company can change its stock structure, and the company has said repeatedly that the family has no intention of doing so. Still, the newspaper industry has been rife with speculation about whether unhappy shareholders will succeed in attempts to change it. 
 Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which has a 7.7 percent stake in the Times Company, has complained that the structure gives no voice to investors other than the family. The investment fund submitted a shareholder proposal for change last month, laying the groundwork for a possible challenge at the company's annual meeting next year.
 Ms. Robinson's remarks yesterday were the strongest the company has issued so far.
 ''We have been very clear about our dual-class structure, which was in place even before we went public in 1969,'' she said. 
 ''It was put in place for a very important reason -- to protect the journalistic independence and integrity of The Times,'' especially ''in times of stress and change.''
 Her comments came as several media companies presented fairly gloomy economic outlooks to financial analysts at the annual media conference sponsored by Credit Suisse in Midtown Manhattan. 
 Ad revenue growth at the company slowed in the fourth quarter from the third quarter, she said, and 2007 will be ''another challenging year.''
 Shares of the Times Company fell 47 cents yesterday, to $24.
 Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, said in a statement that the stock was trading less on the poor advertising results and ''more on speculation regarding going private, selling assets or selling the company.'' 
 Ms. Robinson said that the Times Company and other newspaper companies ''have been dealing with a transformation unlike any we have seen in our lifetimes.'' Readers and advertisers are migrating to the Internet, ad revenues are falling or remaining flat, circulation is declining and costs are rising.
 Revenue from the Internet, while a small portion of total revenue, is growing, and many companies, including the Times Company, said they were optimistic about turning the Internet to their advantage.
 L. Gordon Crovitz, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, which is owned by Dow Jones & Company, said that although his newspaper had registered growth in ad revenue, he expected his company ''to diversify more quickly away from print.''
 Gary B. Pruitt, chief executive of the McClatchy Company, which bought the Knight Ridder newspaper company this year, said that when online readers were combined with print readers, ''more people want what we're producing today than they did yesterday, and that's not the profile of a dying industry.''
 Mr. Pruitt was particularly upbeat immediately after the Knight Ridder purchase, but he said yesterday that the industrywide slump in advertising revenue made the timing of that purchase ''bad.''
 Executives from the Gannett Company and the Washington Post Company said they were also focusing on the Internet. But no one would predict where the business was going, even in the near future. 
 Donald E. Graham, chairman of the Washington Post Company, said that the ''only honest answer'' to that question is, ''I don't know.''

HEADLINE: Spitzer Adviser Is Set to Become Budget Director

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer is planning to name a close policy adviser who comes out of the business world, Paul Francis, as his first budget director, a member of the Spitzer transition team said on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Francis, 52, who was the chief financial officer of Priceline.com, the travel Web site, for the company's first three years, has been a top policy adviser to Mr. Spitzer throughout his campaign and during the transition period. He helped create Mr. Spitzer's campaign proposal for a $2.5 billion property tax cut focused on the middle class.
His appointment is likely to be announced on Thursday, when Mr. Spitzer is scheduled to appear in Albany, said the member of the transition team, who was granted anonymity to confirm an appointment that has not been officially announced. The appointment was first reported on Wednesday afternoon by Crain's New York Business.
 The budget director's post will be one of the most crucial in the new administration: state budgets are not just ledgers, but policy documents that lay out the state's plans for everything from education to health care to transportation. 
 As budget director, Mr. Francis will find himself charged with translating the campaign's promises and proposals into workable programs, making sure the numbers add up after the Legislature negotiates changes, and trying to keep on top of an accurate forecast as to how much money will be available for the state to spend each year. 
 Mr. Francis will have to hit the ground running: Mr. Spitzer's first budget proposal is due on Feb. 1, and during the last two years lawmakers have actually passed budgets by the April 1 deadline, after 20 consecutive years of late budgets. 
 Although Mr. Francis has been immersing himself in the arcana of the state's government and tax policy for nearly two years now, his background is in business. Before joining the Spitzer campaign, he was the managing partner of the Cedar Street Group, a venture capital firm he founded in 2001.
 Before that Mr. Francis was the chief financial officer of Priceline, which is still best remembered in some circles for its television commercials featuring William Shatner; chief financial officer for Ann Taylor stores; a managing director at Merrill Lynch & Company; and a lawyer at the firms of Shearman & Sterling and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom. He worked at Skadden, Arps at the same time as Mr. Spitzer's wife, Silda Wall Spitzer. 
 At a campaign event in Saratoga Springs this summer, Mr. Francis said that Mr. Spitzer's property tax cut proposal would offer relief to all but the wealthiest 2 percent of homeowners. ''Our top priority is the middle-class homeowners, who really have seen a much greater increase in their property tax bill than the rate of inflation,'' he said then. 
 Mr. Francis is a member of the board of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed group that has long been outspoken in its criticism of both Albany's budget process and the spending plans it produces each year. 
 Diana Fortuna, the president of the budget commission, was enthusiastic about the selection of Mr. Francis. ''He's extremely smart, very serious, and he's also an impressive strategic thinker who won't fall into Albany's typical thought patterns,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Fall for Week, but Longer-Term Gauge Is Up 

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The number of United States workers seeking first-time jobless benefits plunged last week, as expected, after surging the previous week during the start of the holiday season, a government report showed yesterday. 
 First-time claims for state unemployment aid fell by 34,000, to a seasonally adjusted 324,000, in the week ended Dec. 2, the Labor Department said. The decline was in line with forecasts from Wall Street economists.
While claims fell last week, a four-week moving average hit its highest level since May. The moving average provides a better gauge of labor market trends, which are particularly hard to discern through the holiday season. It moved up to 328,750, from 325,250 the previous week. 
 ''There is at least a suggestion in the numbers that the trend in layoffs might be starting to rise,'' Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said in a note.
 The Federal Reserve reported yesterday that consumer credit fell $1.2 billion in October, an annual rate of 0.6 percent and the fastest rate of decline in 14 years. The rate was pulled down by a big drop in nonrevolving credit and may be another sign that consumer demand for autos is dropping off, economists said.
 Revolving credit gained at a 4.1 percent annual rate in October on top of a 4.9 percent increase the previous month, a sign that consumers are shifting away from home equity credit to credit cards, analysts said.
 This was the first decline in overall consumer credit since March, when it fell slightly. Analysts polled by Reuters had forecast a $4 billion increase.
 The jobless claims data -- and the monthly jobs report due out today -- are among the final pieces of data to be published before Federal Reserve policy makers meet Dec. 12 to weigh their next move on interest rates.
 Analysts expect the central bank to leave interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent, but will watch the Fed's announcement closely for clues on the future.
 The Monster Web site's employment index, which tracks job vacancies posted online, rose to 175 last month, from 172 in October.
 The year-on-year gain, however, was the slimmest since its inception in October 2003. 
 The online recruiting firm Monster said this was consistent with other recent data showing slowing economic growth in the United States.

HEADLINE: Leading Asian Economist Urges Joint Action on Dollar

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
A senior Asian Development Bank official said on Thursday that the dollar was likely to decline further, and he called for East Asian countries to make sure that their currencies rose in unison and did not gyrate.
 The remarks by the official, Masahiro Kawai, represented the first time that the bank -- or for that matter, any important monetary institution in Asia -- had urged collective action by East Asian nations to manage the current slide of the dollar. National monetary authorities in the region together hold more than $3 trillion in foreign reserves, most of it in dollars, and their huge purchases of dollars this year have played a crucial role in limiting the American currency's decline until now.
''We believe that some U.S. dollar depreciation would be necessary, and collective joint appreciation of the East Asian countries could be needed'' to manage the decline, Mr. Kawai said. ''It's very important for the East Asian currencies to appreciate collectively against the U.S. dollar.'' 
 He said further that China had accumulated excess foreign exchange reserves by intervening in the market to hold down the value of its currency, known as the yuan or the renminbi. Large foreign exchange reserves in China -- they exceeded $1 trillion in October, according to the official news media -- and elsewhere in East Asia are also making it harder for countries to control their own monetary policies, and they run the risk of incurring losses in the management of these reserves, Mr. Kawai said.
 ''If there had been no foreign-exchange market intervention,'' he added, ''the renminbi would have been appreciating at a much faster rate.''
 That stance is likely to be welcomed and echoed next week by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. when he travels to Beijing with Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, and a delegation of cabinet officials.
 Mr. Kawai is one of Japan's most influential economists and has served as an adviser to the Federal Reserve, the International Monetary Fund and the Japanese central bank, as well as chief economist for East Asia and the Pacific at the World Bank.
 Though he cautioned that the Asian Development Bank was not making its own forecast on the value of the dollar, Mr. Kawai said that the consensus among economists was that the American current-account deficit -- the broadest measure of trade -- could be substantially trimmed only if the dollar declined by an average of 30 to 40 percent when weighted by the portion of American trade conducted with each country. 
 If their currencies appreciate together, Mr. Kawai said, East Asian economies can withstand a 20 percent decline before the weakening dollar makes their exports too expensive. The United States accounts for no more than a fifth of the exports of even the biggest Asian exporters, he said. 
 So even if the value of the dollar declined 20 percent, and East Asian currencies moved as a bloc, Mr. Kawai said, the trade-weighted appreciation would be only about 4 percent -- a fifth of 20 percent. That, he said, would be manageable. 
 East Asian economies ''can cope with a significant appreciation vis-a-vis the United States if it's managed in an appropriate way,'' he said.
 Currency experts said that while the coordination suggested by Mr. Kawai would be useful, it would be hard to achieve, given the competing interests of countries in the region, their differing relationships with the United States and their varying domestic economic challenges.
 If the dollar looks as if it is certain to slide, then the central bank that sells a large chunk of its dollar reserves first may preserve a greater share of the value of its foreign currency holdings than other central banks in the region who sold later. But if every Asian central bank rushes to sell dollar reserves at the same time, then the value of all their reserves and the dollar would drop sharply, said Dariusz Kowalczyk, a currency analyst at CFC Seymour, a Hong Kong securities company.
 The opposite approach could also be a problem: if each Asian country tries to prevent its own currency from rising against the dollar so as to preserve the competitiveness of its exports in American markets, then the result could be a broad weakness in Asian currencies and a rapid accumulation of foreign exchange reserves. Many economists say this is what is already happening.
 The South Korean won fell in Asian markets on Thursday when Finance Minister Kwon Okyu expressed concern about the currency's strength. But while the won has been rising against the dollar, it has in fact fallen by 2 percent against the euro since mid-October, when the dollar's weakness became more apparent, said Ben Simpfendorfer, a Royal Bank of Scotland currency strategist in Hong Kong.
 Mr. Kawai did not spell out how Asian countries should cooperate in managing the rise of their currencies against the dollar.
 Finance ministers from the 10 members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations will gather Friday on the Philippine island of Cebu for the start of a series of meetings that will culminate next Wednesday in a meeting of heads of state and government of China, Japan, South Korea and Asean countries.
 Asian governments have shown more interest lately in cooperation in general, although that cooperation has not yet extended to monetary policy.
 ''It would be very difficult to achieve such coordination,'' Mr. Kowalczyk said. ''However, we have seen Asia coordinate in some areas where they normally compete, such as when India and China bid for foreign energy assets.'' 
 An intriguing aspect of Mr. Kawai's remarks lies in whether his comments on Chinese currency intervention, excess Chinese foreign exchange reserves and a need for Asian currency cooperation may reflect the unspoken views of his former colleagues at the Japanese finance ministry and the Japanese central bank.
 China's central bank has allowed the yuan's annual pace of appreciation against the dollar to double, to 6 percent, since Mr. Paulson's last visit to Beijing on Sept. 22. But the dollar has been falling even faster in global currency markets.
 So the yuan has been weakening against the yen and the euro, making Chinese goods even more competitive with Japanese and European products in their home markets and around the world.

HEADLINE: Antitrust Policy Ambiguity To Be on Justices' Docket

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The Supreme Court added two important antitrust cases on Thursday to its calendar for the current term. Both cases, granted at the request of defendants in private antitrust suits, are likely to lead to clarification of areas of antitrust law that have increasingly become unsettled.
 One case has been closely watched on Wall Street. It is a class-action lawsuit against more than a dozen leading investment banks and institutional investors that took part in syndicates to underwrite the initial public offerings of hundreds of technology companies in the 1990s. 
The suit, brought by purchasers of the stocks, charges that the sharing of information among the underwriters and the way in which they allocated shares to their customers amounted to an antitrust conspiracy. 
 The Federal District Court in Manhattan dismissed the lawsuit in 2003, finding that the defendants were entitled to antitrust immunity because much of the conduct they were said to have engaged in was explicitly permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, however, reinstated the suit last year, ruling that Congress had granted no such immunity. 
 The issue for the Supreme Court in this case, Credit Suisse First Boston v. Billing, No. 05-1157, is how to treat the inherently collaborative activity of an underwriting syndicate, activity that -- while it would appear to violate the Sherman Antitrust Act -- is permitted by the regulatory agency that oversees it. 
 While the eventual outcome of the case is uncertain, there is little uncertainty about the second antitrust case the court accepted. The question in that case, Leegin Creative Leather Products v. PSKS, No. 06-480, is how antitrust law should treat the minimum prices that manufacturers require retailers to charge for their products.
 In a 1911 case known as the Dr. Miles precedent, this practice of ''resale price maintenance'' was deemed always illegal under the Sherman Act. The case asks the justices to re-evaluate the precedent in light of modern economic theory, and instead to make these arrangements subject to case-by-case analysis under what is known as the rule of reason. 
 In other areas of antitrust law, the court has steadily backed away from a categorical view of antitrust liability and is highly likely to use this case as a vehicle for doing the same for resale price maintenance.
 Leegin, a privately owned company, manufactures the Brighton line of women's leather goods and does business only with retailers, mostly small specialty stores, who agree to abide by the suggested retail prices for the products. In 2002, after learning that Kay's Kloset, a store in Lewisville, Tex., was discounting Brighton products, Leegin suspended shipments. 
 The store brought an antitrust suit and won more than $1 million in damages, which are tripled under antitrust law. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, upheld the judgment. In August, the justices granted a stay to enable Leegin to file a Supreme Court appeal. Such a stay is a fairly unusual action that sends a strong signal that the justices believe that a case is worthy of their attention and that the lower court's decision was probably wrong.
 Leegin's appeal argues that ''the per se rule against resale price maintenance squarely conflicts with this court's modern antitrust jurisprudence'' and has ''no foundation in economic theory.'' It argues that minimum prices can enhance competition and help consumers by providing incentives to retailers to compete in such nonprice areas as customer service.
 If the court accepts Leegin's argument, a decision about whether any particular minimum price arrangement actually confers a consumer benefit would be subject to case-by-case appraisal under the rule-of-reason analysis that the court already applies to the setting of price ceilings and nonprice retail conditions. Formerly, the court applied a rule of categorical invalidity to those practices as well.
 In the securities underwriting case, the court will be scrutinizing a variety of practices that amount to standard conduct on Wall Street: forming a syndicate, ascertaining potential customer interest to determine the size and price of the offering, and then sharing information and markets among competitors. The plaintiffs contend that the underwriters inflated prices by improperly dividing the market and imposing unlawful conditions on their customers. 
 When the appeal reached the Supreme Court last spring, the justices asked the solicitor general's office to advise them of the federal government's view. That request presented a problem because there was no unified government view. Conduct that the Justice Department's antitrust division regarded as barred under the Sherman Act was seen by the S.E.C. as legal.
 A carefully worded brief by the solicitor general, filed last month, urged the court to take the case and find a way to reconcile ''two federal statutes critical to the efficient functioning of our economy.''
 The brief said the court of appeals failed ''to make sufficient accommodation for the securities laws' policy of encouraging certain types of collaborative activity.''
 It added, however, that the district court was also wrong to consider all conduct connected with initial public offerings to be immune from antitrust liability. The brief said the complaint in this lawsuit needed to be examined carefully to make sure that it was based on something more than ''conclusory or ambiguous allegations.''
 Briefs urging the justices to hear to hear the case were also filed by the New York Stock Exchange, NASD and other industry groups.

HEADLINE: Limits Are Seen to a Decade of Expansion as Japan's Growth Is Revised Downward 

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Japan's economy grew at a slower pace than previously reported in the most recent quarter, government officials said Friday, a sign that a long expansion may be losing steam.
 The economy grew 0.2 percent from July through September, the Cabinet Office said, revising downward a previous estimate of 0.5 percent growth. On an annualized basis, that means Japan's $4.7 trillion economy, the world's second largest, expanded by 0.8 percent instead of the 2 percent previously reported.
The new figures showed a drop in corporate investment in new factories and equipment. Consumers also spent less than previously thought, particularly on home purchases. 
 Over all, domestic demand shrank during the quarter, a reversal from the small growth that was previously reported, the data showed. 
 Only strong growth in exports kept the economy expanding at all. 
 ''One issue is what on earth is happening to consumption,'' said Richard Jerram, chief economist at Macquarie Securities in Tokyo. ''Weak data has certainly scared a lot of people.''
 A slowdown in domestic consumption is what economists have feared might happen here. While Japan's economy has been growing over all since February 2002, its longest expansion since World War II, the advance has depended heavily on strong sales of Japanese goods in foreign markets like the United States and China.
 This export-driven growth has helped the country pull out of its long doldrums and breathed new life into cities like Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan's auto capital. But for Japan to truly regain its economic health and emerge as an engine of global growth, domestic demand must become the main driver, economists say.
 In particular, this means more spending by the nation's 120 million consumers, many of whom remain cautious about their job prospects and future retirements despite recent growth. Until they feel more confident about their future, specialists warn that Japan's growth prospects remain limited.
 Economists said they had expected a slowdown, but the drop was slightly larger than anticipated. Recent surveys had shown that most expected annualized growth around 1.1 percent.
 One of the biggest changes was in private demand, the measure of all spending by individuals and companies. It slipped to a decline of 0.2 percent in the quarter from a previously reported gain of 0.4 percent.
 Housing purchases fell 0.3 percent, in contrast to a 0.1 percent rise. The pace of growth in corporate spending dropped to 1.5 percent from the previous 2.9 percent.
 In another sign of domestic weakness, imports shrank 0.5 percent instead of the 0.1 percent decline reported earlier. Exports, however, remained robust, growing at an almost unchanged 2.5 percent.
 Economists said the data also showed a shift in Japan's overseas markets. The strong exports came despite a slowdown in Japan's traditional market, the United States, indicating that the country was relying more heavily on China and other Asian nations.
 ''Can the U.S. have a recession and Japan doesn't care? Maybe,'' Mr. Jerram said. 
 Signs of a slowdown in Japan may also present a challenge to Japan's new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, who has yet to lay out a clear set of economic policies since taking office in September. Many here wondered whether Mr. Abe would continue to push for deregulation and other free-market changes advanced by his predecessor, Junichiro Koizumi. 
 Economists credit Mr. Koizumi's changes for spurring Japan's current economic revival by cleaning up the banking system and allowing a new, more aggressive type of capitalism to take root. Mr. Abe has spoken of Japan's growing social inequalities, suggesting that he may slow the pace of pro-market changes.
 An economic slowdown may also stay the hand of the nation's central bank, which ended an effectively zero-interest policy in July and began raising rates for the first time in six years. The bank has signaled that it wants to continue raising short-term interest rates from the current 0.25 percent if the economy keeps improving.
 Japanese officials played down the new growth figures, saying they showed that the economy was still growing.
 The economy is in a solid condition, the finance minister, Koji Omi, told reporters on Friday, adding that there is no change in the overall trend.

HEADLINE: 70 Years Later, A Scapegoat Gets a Break 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
''Short selling,'' thundered Representative Adolph J. Sabath, Democrat of Illinois, ''is the greatest evil that has been permitted or sanctioned by the government that I know of.'' It was, in short, the cause of the Great Depression.
 He was speaking at a House hearing in 1932 on his bill to make short selling illegal. Had such a ban been in place in 1929, he said, ''I am satisfied that not one-half of the banks that were closed nor of the factories or other plants that were closed would have been closed, and there would not be eight million or nine million people out of employment, nor would there have been over 20 million people who lost all they possessed, due to the manipulation on the stock exchanges.'' 
He was far from alone in making the argument. Short selling, said Representative M. Clyde Kelly, Republican of Pennsylvania, ''is a vicious practice, injurious to everyone except those who are seeking to profit through gambling.'' As to the merits of gambling, he quoted George Washington, ''It is the child of avarice, the brother of iniquity and the father of mischief.''
 Mr. Kelly, too, attributed high unemployment to the short sellers -- who borrowed shares they did not own, then sold them -- saying they drove down stock prices and hurt sound companies.
 Mr. Sabath's bill did not pass. But soon after the Securities and Exchange Commission was established in 1934, it sought to put limits on short sales. No longer could such sales be made any time a trader felt like doing so. Sales could be made only if the price was rising.
 That rule, with minor adjustments, has survived ever since, a monument to Depression-era distrust of what were called ''bear raids.'' In 1976, the S.E.C. tried to weaken the rule but retreated in the face of hostile public reaction.
 This week, though, the S.E.C. proposed dropping the rule. 
 You may not have read of that proposal. It was virtually ignored by the news media, and if any companies are upset about it, they have not made themselves known. A pilot program that exempted some companies from the so-called uptick rule starting in 2005 drew little attention.
 But this newfound acceptance of short sellers is deceptive. Those most exercised over the evils of shorts -- and their comments sound very much like some of the bombast of 1932 -- now say they have nothing against legitimate short selling. It is naked short selling they despise. 
 Naked short selling is the practice of selling stocks short without borrowing them. That leads to failures to deliver shares, although there is no agreement on just how bad a problem that is.
 Wall Street firms tend to see it as a minor ill, and point out that naked short sellers will still have to pay up if the stock price rises. They also say that not all failures to deliver are caused by short selling, although no one seems to have any data on just how many failures come from other causes.
 The S.E.C. adopted a rule -- called Regulation SHO, for short -- in 2004. It led to the release of lists each day of stocks with a large number of failures to deliver shares. Earlier this year, the commission proposed amendments that would toughen the rules, making it harder to execute naked short sales or to keep the positions open. Wall Street has protested that the changes could go too far, while some companies call them inadequate.
 ''We believe that some of the volatility in our stock may result from manipulative short-selling practices,'' Barry McCarthy, the chief financial officer of Netflix, a DVD-rental firm, told the S.E.C.
 An analysis he submitted indicated that the highest volume of naked shorting in his stock tended to be at the highest prices, which would seem to be an indication that the short sellers knew what they were doing. The company dropped off the failures list in late September, a few weeks before the stock shot up on good earnings.
 There is evidence that the naked shorts do not always do so well. Of the five stocks on the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq that have been on the list of large failures every day for a year or more, four are up since they began their regular appearances.
 Those who want tougher rules tend to see short squeezes that drive up prices -- by forcing shorts to buy back shares they cannot borrow -- as a matter of simple justice. Many on Wall Street see them as market manipulation, and the S.E.C. has traditionally agreed.
 Christopher Cox, the S.E.C. chairman, has tried to keep everyone happy and to obtain unanimous votes on a commission that was badly divided before he arrived. But that is not always possible, and the revised rules on failure to deliver, when the S.E.C. produces them, will be a test of his ability to find compromises.
 Normal short selling is about to become easier to do. But now, as in 1932, there are plenty of people who see the most aggressive short sellers as part of a Wall Street conspiracy to drive down prices.


CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2006

 CORRECTION:
The High & Low Finance column in Business Day yesterday misstated the pattern of trading in Netflix, a DVD rental company. Data submitted by the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission indicated that the highest volume of short selling appeared to be at relatively low prices, not relatively high prices.

HEADLINE: The Passion Of the Maya

BYLINE: By A.O. SCOTT

 BODY:
''I'm going to peel off his skin and make him watch me wear it.'' This grisly threat is delivered by one of the main bad guys in Mel Gibson's ''Apocalypto.'' The promised flaying never takes place, but viewers who share this director's apparently limitless appetite for gore will not be disappointed, since not much else in the way of bodily torment has been left to the imagination. There are plenty of disembowelings, impalings, clubbings and beheadings. Hearts are torn, still beating, from slashed-open chests. A man's face is chewed off by a jaguar. Another's neck is pierced by darts tipped with frog venom. Most disturbing, perhaps, is the sight of hundreds of corpses haphazardly layered in an open pit: a provocative and ill-advised excursion into Holocaust imagery on this director's part. 
 Violence has become the central axiom in Mr. Gibson's practice as a filmmaker, his major theme and also his chief aesthetic interest. The brutality in ''Apocalypto'' is so relentless and extreme that it sometimes moves beyond horror into a kind of grotesque comedy, but to dismiss it as excessive or gratuitous would be to underestimate Mr. Gibson's seriousness. And say what you will about him -- about his problem with booze or his problem with Jews -- he is a serious filmmaker.
Which is not to say that ''Apocalypto'' is a great film, or even that it can be taken quite as seriously as it wants to be. Mr. Gibson's technical command has never been surer; for most of its 2-hour 18-minute running time, ''Apocalypto,'' written by Mr. Gibson and Farhad Safinia, is a model of narrative economy, moving nimbly forward and telling its tale with clarity and force. It is, above all, a muscular and kinetic action movie, a drama of rescue and revenge with very little organic relation to its historical setting. Yes, the dialogue is in various Mayan dialects, which will sound at least as strange to American ears as the Latin and Aramaic of ''The Passion of the Christ,'' but the film's real language is Hollywood's, and Mr. Gibson's, native tongue.
 When I first heard about this project, and later when I saw the early trailers, I halfway hoped that Mr. Gibson might turn out to be an American (or half-Australian) version of Werner Herzog, setting out into the jungle to explore the dark and tangled regions of human nature. Once you get past the costumes and the subtitles, though, the most striking thing about ''Apocalypto'' is how comfortably it sits within the conventions of mainstream moviemaking. It is not an obsessive opera like Mr. Herzog's ''Aguirre: The Wrath of God,'' but rather a pop period epic in the manner of ''Gladiator'' or ''Braveheart,'' and as such less interested in historical or cultural authenticity than in imposing an accessible scheme on a faraway time and place.
 The setting is Central America before the arrival of the Spanish, when the Maya empire, in Mr. Gibson's version, was already in the process of collapsing from within. The basic moral conflict -- as it was in ''Braveheart,'' directed by and starring Mr. Gibson, and in ''The Patriot,'' a vehicle for him directed by Roland Emmerich -- is between a small group of people trying to live simple, decent, traditional lives and a larger, more powerful political entity driven by bloodlust and greed. This kind of conservative anti-imperialism runs consistently through Mr. Gibson's work; whether the empire in question is Roman, British or Mesoamerican, and whatever its political resonance might be, it allows the viewer to root for an unambiguously virtuous underdog. 
 ''Apocalypto'' begins with a group of young men out on a hunt and lingers for a while in their happy, earthy village, a place that might double as a nostalgic vision of small-town America were it not for the loin cloths, the tattooed buttocks and the facial piercings. Blunted (Jonathan Brewer) is nagged by his mother-in-law and teased by his buddies because he hasn't yet made his wife pregnant, but he accepts his humiliation in good humor, like the jolly fat kid on a family sitcom. 
 Meanwhile Jaguar Paw (Rudy Youngblood), whose father (Morris Birdyellowhead) is an admired hunter and warrior, snuggles down with his pregnant wife, Seven (Dalia Hernandez), and their young son, Turtle Run (Carlos Emilio Baez). There's fresh tapir meat on the grill and an old-timer telling stories by the fire. Life is good.
 Needless to say, this pastoral idyll cannot last. The ominous strains of James Horner's score indicate as much. Before long the village is set upon by fearsome marauders, led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), who rape, burn and kill with ruthless discipline and undisguised glee. The locals resist valiantly, but the survivors are led away to an uncertain fate. Seven and Turtle Run stay behind, hidden in a hole in the ground. 
 Jaguar Paw's mission will be to rescue them and also to avenge his friends and kin. First, though, he will accompany us on a Cecil B. DeMille tour of the decadent imperial capital, a place of misery, luxury and corruption, where priests and nobles try to keep famine and pestilence at bay with round-the-clock human sacrifices. 
 Neither Mr. Gibson's fans nor his detractors are likely to accuse him of excessive subtlety, and the effectiveness of ''Apocalypto'' is inseparable from its crudity. But the blunt characterizations and the emphatic emotional cues are also evidence of the director's skill. 
 Perhaps because he is aiming for an audience wary of subtitles, Mr. Gibson rarely uses dialogue as a means of exposition, and he proves himself to be an able, if not always terribly original, visual storyteller. He is not afraid of cliches -- the slow-motion, head-on sprint toward the camera; the leap from the waterfall into the river below -- but he executes them with a showman's maniacal relish. 
 And it is, all in all, a pretty good show. There is a tendency, at least among journalists, to take Mr. Gibson as either a monster or a genius, a false choice that he frequently seems intent on encouraging. Is he a madman or a visionary? Should he be shunned or embraced? Censured or forgiven? 
 These are the wrong questions, but their persistence reveals the truth about this shrewd and bloody-minded filmmaker. He is an entertainer. He will be publicized, and he will be paid.
 ''Apocalypto'' is rated R (Under 17 must be accompanied by parent or adult guardian). See the first paragraph above.

 ''Unaccompanied Minors,'' directed by Paul Feig and written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark, presents a nightmarish, dystopian vision of contemporary America in which airline deregulation and the prevalence of divorce have turned our airports into grim holding pens for feral children and embittered workers. Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life. 
At least that's how it seemed to me. To the minors I happened to be accompanying, it seemed to be reasonably good fun. Far from horrifying or enraging them, the failure of just about every grown-up except Wilmer Valderrama to behave decently and responsibly filled them with delight, much as the pervasive adult cluelessness provided the movie's main characters with opportunities for mischief and friendship.
 Set on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in Midwestern airport, ''Unaccompanied Minors'' assembles a squad of familiar adolescent movie types. There's the nice guy, unfairly labeled a loser (Dyllan Christopher); the rich girl (Gina Mantegna); the angry delinquent girl (Quinn Shephard); the anti-social fat boy (Brett Kelly). In a remarkable feat of economy, the nerd, the black kid and the Jew are all rolled into the agile, jug-eared person of Tyler James Williams. Individually and then collectively, these children run afoul of Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), who is the airport's director of passenger relations and the movie's designated Scrooge. His underling, Zach (Mr. Valderrama), is torn between the demands of his boss and his compassion for the kids.
 Mr. Black's fellow alumnus from ''The Daily Show,'' Rob Corddry, plays an environmental-activist dad who tries to rescue his children in a biodiesel-powered Mercedes. The explosion of that vehicle is one of a few moments of loud, obvious comic action that seem to have been included to justify the status of ''Unaccompanied Minors'' as a theatrically released motion picture, rather than the kiddie-cable seasonal special it should have been. In any case, this movie may be too much for sensitive parents to bear. Send your kids alone. A. O. SCOTT
 ''Unaccompanied Minors'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some crude humor and a few very mild sexual innuendoes.

A Carpet Lover's All-Star Cast
 Almost by definition, antiques dealers need survival skills. They must weather economic ups and downs, changes in fashion, fierce competition and sometimes political chaos.
 Next Thursday Sotheby's will auction a collection of carpets from the estate of the Czech-born antique-rug dealer Vojtech Blau (1922-2000), who survived a concentration camp and Communism before finding success in New York.
''He had a fantastic life story,'' said Daniel Walker, a friend who is now the director of the Textile Museum in Washington. ''He was totally self-made. He came to New York with nothing.'' Mr. Blau had steely resolve. After his release from a concentration camp in 1945 he lived in Prague, where in 1947 he apprenticed himself to a leading dealer in antique rugs. He had a quick eye and eventually became a partner. 
 After the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia, the firm, like all private businesses, was liquidated. Mr. Blau was sent to prison for four years and was forced to work in a uranium mine until 1960. He managed to reach New York in 1962. 
 ''He didn't speak English,'' his stepdaughter, Simona Blau, said in an interview. ''But he had studied rugs in Prague and knew he could help people realize a carpet was a thing of art.'' 
 Over the next 38 years Mr. Blau supplied carpets to the White House, the State Department, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to clients including Dustin Hoffman, Henry A. Kissinger and Steven Spielberg.
 He was considered one of the most knowledgeable dealers in rugs and antique tapestries in New York. ''There is no academy for this,'' Mr. Walker said. ''You almost have to be self-taught.''
 Mary Jo Otsea, a rug specialist at Sotheby's whose friendship with Mr. Blau began in 1983, said, ''He built up a loyal clientele because he took the time to explain why one piece was better than another.''
 All the while he was putting together a personal collection of antique carpets -- ''instead of stocks,'' said Jolana Blau, his wife. 
 ''These rugs were never in his inventory,'' Simona Blau said. ''He kept them in storage. It was never meant to be a comprehensive collection. He bought what he liked. It was his all-star cast.''
 That collection, now at Sotheby's, comprises mostly 19th-century rugs. It includes tribal and village rugs from the Caucasus and Turkey and finely woven formal rugs from Persia. Few examples are from the so-called ''classical period,'' that is, pre-1800. 
 ''There are a number of serious collectors of classical rugs in the Middle East and Europe, but Americans form a small percentage,'' Mr. Walker said. 
 The sale includes one spectacular classical example: a vibrant red Mughal carpet made in northern India in the early 1600s, which is estimated to sell for $200,000 to $300,000. In it leopards, tigers, deer and phoenix meander through a lush, predator-free garden. The rug may represent the Garden of Eden. 
 Total sales of the 108 items could reach $1.8 to $2.6 million, Sotheby's says. ''The estimates, which range from $5,000 to $300,000, are very conservative,'' Ms. Otsea said.
 Simona Blau and her mother, also from Czechoslovakia, came to the United States in 1968. Mr. Blau married Jolana in 1972 (they had known each other in Prague), and they worked together in his gallery. In the 1990s Simona joined them. 
 After Mr. Blau's death Simona became director of the Vojtech Blau gallery, but she has decided to stop selling rugs. She prefers dealing in antique and modern tapestries, by appointment.
 ''A tapestry is not an easy sell,'' she said. ''It's a work of art but also a decoration and has to fit a certain wall.'' 
 The Vojtech Blau gallery, housed in a 5,000-square-foot space at 31 West 21st Street in Manhattan, has pieces from the 16th century through 1950. (They can be viewed at vojtechblau.com.)
 The inventory includes a handsome 17th-century Flemish portico tapestry, depicting a gateway and formal garden in shades of blue, and a jazzy zodiac piece in yellow and black called ''Autumn Winter,'' by the French artist Jean Picart le Doux, from 1950. 
 One particular standout is a Sonia Delaunay design, ''Autumn,'' from about 1970. ''The modern pieces attract a different audience,'' said Simona Blau, who is trying to introduce tapestry to a younger audience. ''They are more accessible and their vivid colors go well with the mid-century furniture that is so popular now.''

Collecting Christmas
 On Tuesday Sotheby's is selling the Christmas collection of Jock Elliott, an advertising titan who took Ogilvy & Mather from modest beginnings in 1960 to annual billings of $2 billion. He died last year.
 The 250-lot sale includes medieval illuminated manuscripts, Yuletide illustrations, first editions of Christmas books, carols, autographed letters by Charles Dickens, pop-up books and original work by artists like Ludwig Bemelmans, Arthur Rackham and Everett Shinn
 ''I don't think anyone could equal his enthusiasm for Christmas,'' said Osborn Elliott, his brother. ''Even when we were children, he was meticulous in picking out presents for the family, mostly from the five and dime.''
 Mr. Elliott said that his brother began collecting books, cards, ephemera and prints relating to Christmas in the 1950s: ''He started collecting cactuses at age 12, until he bought all those he could afford on his meager 12-year-old allowance. After that he collected stamps, until he priced himself out of the market. Then tropical fish. After World War II it was painters of the Ashcan School. But he always had the Christmas bug.''
 Jock Elliott was also a student of his favorite holiday.
 ''Up to the 19th century Christmas as we know it had never existed in this country,'' he wrote in ''Inventing Christmas: How Our Holiday Came to Be'' (Abrams, 2002). ''No Santa Claus, no shopping for presents, no Christmas trees, no Christmas cards, no Scrooge. Between 1823 and 1848, a surprisingly short 25-year period, all these 'traditions' were invented. Hooray for the inventions, say I. They give us all a good time.''
 Parts of his collection have been exhibited at the Widener Library at Harvard (his alma mater), the Century Association and the Grolier Club. The presale viewing at Sotheby's -- full of Christmas spirit -- continues through Monday morning.

Broadway

'BUTLEY' In this uneasy revival of Simon Gray's portrait of a toxic English professor, directed by Nicholas Martin, Nathan Lane fires off witticisms as if they were silver bullets with ''Made in Britain'' engraved on them. A less-than-perfect marriage of a first-rate actor with a first-rate play (2:30). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley)

'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened 31 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise, this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE COAST OF UTOPIA: VOYAGE' The exhilarating first installment of Tom Stoppard's trilogy about 19th-century Russian intellectuals dreaming of revolution, this production pulses with the dizzy, spring-green arrogance and anxiety of a new generation moving as fast as it can toward the future. Jack O'Brien directs a fresh, vigorous and immense cast, led by Billy Crudup and Ethan Hawke (2:45). Vivian Beaumont Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'COMPANY' Fire, beckoning and dangerous, flickers beneath the frost of John Doyle's elegant, unexpectedly stirring revival of Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's era-defining musical from 1970, starring a compellingly understated Raul Esparza. Like Mr. Doyle's ''Sweeney Todd,'' this production finds new clarity of feeling in Sondheim by melding the roles of performers and musicians (2:20). Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'DR. SEUSS' HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS: THE MUSICAL' The beloved holiday classic in a new musical version that honors the spirit and the letter of the original. (The two immortal Albert Hague-Dr. Seuss songs from the television special are included). Bloated at 90 minutes, but the kids didn't seem to mind (1:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4100. (Charles Isherwood)

'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' (Tony Awards, best book of a musical and best original score, 2006) This small and ingratiating spoof of 1920s stage frolics, as imagined by an obsessive show queen, may not be a masterpiece. But in a dry season for musicals, it has theatergoers responding as if they were withering houseplants finally being watered after long neglect (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'GREY GARDENS' Christine Ebersole is absolutely glorious as the middle-aged, time-warped debutante called ''Little'' Edie Beale in this uneven musical adaptation of the notorious 1975 documentary of the same title. She and the wonderful Mary-Louise Wilson (as her bed-ridden mother), in the performances of their careers, make ''Grey Gardens'' an experience no passionate theatergoer should miss (2:40). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

* 'THE LITTLE DOG LAUGHED' The comedy of manners, a form widely believed to be extinct in the American theater, has actually resurfaced on Broadway with all its vital signs intact in Douglas Carter Beane's breezy but trenchant satire about truth and illusion, Hollywood-style. With the wonderful Julie White as the movie agent you hate to love (but just can't help it) (2:00). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARTIN SHORT: FAME BECOMES ME' This eager and amiably scattershot satire of celebrity memoirs and Broadway musicals, starring the immodestly modest Mr. Short, arrives a little late to the table for such parody to taste fresh. With serviceably tuneful songs by Scott Wittman and Marc Shaiman (of ''Hairspray'' fame) (1:45). Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'TARZAN' This writhing green blob with music, adapted by Disney Theatrical Productions from the 1999 animated film, has the feeling of a superdeluxe day care center, equipped with lots of bungee cords and karaoke synthesizers, where children can swing when they get tired of singing, and vice versa. The soda-pop score is by Phil Collins (2:30). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'THE VERTICAL HOUR' David Hare's soggy consideration of the Anglo-American cultural divide stars Julianne Moore (representing the Americans) and Bill Nighy (leading the British), directed by Sam Mendes. The Yanks don't stand a chance. With his irresistibly mannered performance as a laconic doctor, Mr. Nighy mops the floor with Ms. Moore. Actually, he mops the floor with Mr. Hare's play (2:20). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE WEDDING SINGER' An assembly-kit musical that might as well be called ''That 80s Show,'' this stage version of the 1998 film is all winks and nods and quotations from the era of big hair and junk bonds. The cast members are personable enough, which is not the same as saying they have personalities (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

Off Broadway

'ALL TOO HUMAN' Henry Miller's one-man show about Clarence Darrow is far from scintillating theater, but it's relevant (1:35). 45th Street Theater, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444. (Anita Gates)

'THE AMERICAN PILOT' The fate of an injured American soldier hangs in the balance when his plane crashes in territory held by rebels fighting a regime backed by the United States. David Greig's play strives for the topical and the universal, but mostly gets hold of the generic (2:00). Manhattan Theater Club's City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Isherwood)

'ARMS AND THE MAN' Shaw's story of a mercenary who breaks into a young Bulgarian woman's bedroom while fleeing a battle seems not to have much social bite in this rendition, but the humor still works nicely, particularly when in the hands of Robin Leslie Brown and Dominic Cuskern as the invaded household's matriarch and patriarch. Bradford Cover has an appealing, offhand delivery as the soldier (2:15). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Neil Genzlinger)

'THE ATHEIST' Chris Pine stars in Ronan Noone's generally compelling if not always credible one-man drama about a reporter who casually ruins lives trying to make his reputation with a big story (1:30). Center Stage, 48 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 868-4444. (Gates)

'THE BIG VOICE: GOD OR MERMAN?' Think of two gifted and smart gay men with years of life together deploying their considerable talents from the two pianos you happen to have in your living room. The result is a hilarious and very touching memoir of two decades of love and the funky glories of show business life (2:00). The Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, ( 212) 239-6200. (Honor Moore)

*'THE CLEAN HOUSE' Sarah Ruhl's comedy about the painful but beautiful disorder of life has arrived in New York at last in a gorgeous production directed by Bill Rauch. Blair Brown and Jill Clayburgh delight as sisters with different views on the meaning of cleaning, and Vanessa Aspillaga is equally good as the depressed maid with little affection for her work but a deep conviction that a good joke can be a matter of life and death (2:15). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'DAI (ENOUGH)' Iris Bahr's unnerving one-woman show doesn't have much to add to the Middle East debate, but it sure leaves a lasting impression. Ms. Bahr plays an assortment of characters who have the misfortune of being in a Tel Aviv cafe that is about to be visited by the havoc common to such establishments. The attack is rendered in jarring fashion, repeatedly; you watch the play on pins and needles, waiting for the next burst. Gimmicky? Sure. But viscerally effective. Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212) 307-4100. (Genzlinger)

'DARK MATTERS' Elizabeth Marvel plays a rural housewife who may be consorting with extraterrestrials in Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's risible new drama about space critters bent on beginning a new race. Pure hokum (2:00). Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, 224 Waverly Place, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444). (Isherwood)

'ESOTERICA' Eric Walton's very entertaining one-man show is a mix of magic, mentalism and intelligent chat. He does all three impressively (1:30). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'EVIL DEAD: THE MUSICAL' This likable horror comedy based on Sam Raimi's gory movies wants to be the next ''Rocky Horror Show.'' To that end, it offers deadpan lyrics, self-referential humor and geysers of stage blood (2:00) New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'THE FANTASTICKS' A revival -- well, more like a resuscitation -- of the Little Musical That Wouldn't Die. This sweet-as-ever production of Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's commedia-dell'arte-style confection is most notable for Mr. Jones's touching performance (under the pseudonym Thomas Bruce) as the Old Actor, a role he created when the show opened in 1960. Mr. Jones also directs (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

* 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'GUTENBERG! THE MUSICAL' A very funny if not terribly original satire of musical theater features what must be the worst backers' audition of all time. The excellent duo Jeremy Shamos and Christopher Fitzgerald make the pitch (2:05). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200. (Jason Zinoman)

'HOW TO SAVE THE WORLD AND FIND TRUE LOVE IN 90 MINUTES' This refreshing musical, born of the Fringe Festival, about a bookstore clerk, a slacker, a diplomat and a terrorist, has witty songs, wacky performances and an untethered sense of fun (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'JACQUES BREL IS ALIVE AND WELL AND LIVING IN PARIS' A powerfully sung revival of the 1968 revue, presented with affectionate nostalgia by the director Gordon Greenberg. As in the original, two men and two women perform a wide selection of Brel's plaintive ballads and stirring anthems (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

* 'KAOS' Martha Clarke's clever compaction of a lengthy 1984 film of the same title, by the Taviani Brothers, is based on short stories by Luigi Pirandello, set at the turn of the last century in his native Sicily. A beguiling if deadly serious blend of text, dance and music, adeptly performed and made more flavorful, if more exotic, by Ms. Clarke's decision to have the entire text spoken in Italian (1:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (John Rockwell)

'THE MILLINER' Suzanne Glass's delicate play tells of a Jewish hat-maker who, after fleeing Germany and his beloved mother and business just before World War II, longs to return to Berlin. A vixenish cabaret singer is among the things beckoning him back. The lovely hats, both worn and used as scenery, will make the bare heads of 2006 long for the old days (2:30). East 13th Street Theater, 136 East 13th Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger)

'MY NAME IS RACHEL CORRIE' A small, intense and loudly heralded one-woman drama that tells the true story of its title character, a pro-Palestinian activist killed in the Gaza strip by an Israeli Army bulldozer. Yet for all the political and emotional baggage carried by this production, adapted from Ms. Corrie's writings and starring Megan Dodds, it often feels dramatically flat, even listless (1:30). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'NO CHILD' Teachers will love Nilaja Sun's one-woman show about the challenges of teaching drama at Malcolm X High School (1:10). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

'AN OAK TREE' Tim Crouch plays a hypnotist in this elusive puzzle of a play about grief and the power of suggestion (1:05). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Zinoman)

'POST MORTEM' A grievance list of a comedy by the indefatigable A. R. Gurney, set in the near future, about the unearthing of a world-shaking play called ''Post Mortem'' by A. R. Gurney. Jim Simpson directs this likable grab bag of insider jokes, polemical satire and cosmic lamentation (1:30). The Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

'REGRETS ONLY' Old acquaintance comes under siege in Paul Rudnick's chiffon-thin comedy about the varieties of love and marriage. But no one who sees this latest offering from one of the funniest quip-meisters alive is going to doubt that Christine Baranski is a one-liner's best friend (2:00). City Center Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. (Brantley)

'ROOM SERVICE' The Peccadillo Theater Company puts a charge into this old comedy from the 1930s, thanks to a brisk pace by the director, Dan Wackerman, and a dozen dandy performances. David Edwards is the would-be producer whose bills threaten to swamp his efforts to put a show on Broadway, and Fred Berman is particularly fine as his director (2:00). The SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Genzlinger)

'SCHOOL FOR WIVES' The Pearl Theater Company's production of Moliere's satire about one misguided man's expectations of women is pleasant, occasionally quite funny and definitely on the side of common sense (1:55). The Pearl Theater Company, 80 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 598-9802. (Gates)

* 'STRIKING 12' A minimalist musical about an odd but rewarding New Year's Eve in the life of a guy who hates New Year's Eve. Performed by the indie pop band Groovelily, it's fresh and funny, and features a standout pop score (1:30). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'SUDDENLY LAST SUMMER' As the luscious (and lobotomy-threatened) damsel in distress in Tennessee Williams's famously lurid melodrama, Carla Gugino gives a gutsy assurance to a production that otherwise lacks compelling confidence. Mark Brokaw directs a cast that includes Blythe Danner, in a fascinating but misconceived performance as a smothering mother from hell (1:30). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)

'THE TIMEKEEPERS' Dan Clancy's play, which throws a Jewish artisan and a gay hustler together in a concentration camp, transcends standard Holocaust psychodrama on the strength of its characterizations and definitive performances by Seth Barrish and Eric Paeper (1:35). Barrow Group Theater, 312 West 36th Street, third floor, (212) 760-2615. (Rob Kendt)

'25 QUESTIONS FOR A JEWISH MOTHER' This is the comedian Judy Gold's fiercely funny monologue, based on her own life as a single Jewish lesbian mother and interviews with more than 50 other Jewish mothers (1:10). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Phoebe Hoban)

'TWO TRAINS RUNNING' Directed by Lou Bellamy, a rough-edged revival of August Wilson's 1992 play about the stark economics of life and death for African-Americans, set in a dying diner in Pittsburgh in the late 1960s. The pace drags in this production, but it remains a bracing reminder of Mr. Wilson's singular talent for making cold, hard numbers sing hot, molten blues (3:40). Signature Theater at Peter Norton Space, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Brantley)

Off Off Broadway

'THE FORTUNE TELLER' This morality tale for grown-ups is told through marvelously grotesque puppets and a cast, evoking Edward Gorey and Tim Burton. Written by Erik Sanko, it is an allegory of the Seven Deadly Sins, a lovely thing to look upon and listen to (the dark, brooding music is by Mr. Sanko and Danny Elfman), but for all its macabre grisliness, it needs more drama. The detailed puppets are hard to read even in this small theater, and not all of the vignettes live up to the show's initial promise. Still, there's a lot to like, starting with the narrator: an alligator named Silas Leech, voiced in the plummy tones of the musician and actor Gavin Friday (1:00). Here Arts Center, 145 Sixth Avenue, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette)

'T J AND DAVE' The comics T. J. Jagodowski and Dave Pasquesi miraculously improvise a one-hour play at every performance. This is an impressive feat of mental athletics, but the results are also observant, complex and frequently enormously funny. (1:00) Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Gates)

Spectacles

'BIG APPLE CIRCUS' One terrific show (2:15). Damrosch Park, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500 or (212) 307-4100. (Lawrence Van Gelder)

'RADIO CITY CHRISTMAS SPECTACULAR' Mingles tradition and novelty to a festive fare-thee-well (1:30). Radio City Music Hall, (212) 307-1000. (Van Gelder)

Long-Running Shows

'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'BEAUTY AND THE BEAST' Cartoon made flesh, sort of (2:30). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)

'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

'SLAVA'S SNOWSHOW' A show that touches the heart and s well as tickles the funny bone (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Van Gelder)

'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans. (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)

'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

Last Chance

'BHUTAN' Daisy Foote's drama may not be working the freshest territory -- dead-end lives in a small town -- but it sure is well told and well acted. A widow and her two teenagers are struggling financially and feeling dislocated by their town's changing social alignments; Sarah Lord is especially good as the daughter whose fascination with a neighbor's trip to Bhutan gives the play its title and overarching metaphor (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, between Barrow and Bedford Streets, West Village, (212) 239-6200; closing tomorrow. (Genzlinger)

'DURANGO' In Julia Cho's tender-hearted comedy-drama, a Korean-American family takes to the road with a trunk full of emotional baggage in tow. The narrative mostly runs in familiar grooves, but Ms. Cho has a clear, honest voice, and Chay Yew's production sets it off elegantly (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'HEARTBREAK HOUSE' A ripping revival of Shaw's comedy about the English gentry waltzing toward the abyss as the shadow of World War I looms. Philip Bosco, as the admirably sane madman Captain Shotover, and Swoosie Kurtz, as his swaggeringly romantic daughter, lead the superb cast, under the sharp direction of Robin Lefevre. Nearly a century after its composition, the play still sparkles with wit and sends a shiver down the spine too (2:30). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE' A slow, airless revival of Jay Presson Allen's 1966 play (adapted from Muriel Spark's novel) about a dangerous Scottish schoolteacher, directed by Scott Elliott and starring the wonderful (but miscast) Cynthia Nixon, who seems much too sane and centered as the deluded Miss Brody. (2:40). The Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closing tomorrow. (Brantley)

'SHOUT!' A miniskirted, go-go-booted zombie of a musical about women searching for love in London in the 1960's. You won't see anything this groovy, this far-out, this with-it outside of, oh, maybe the showroom of a Carnival cruise ship (1:30). Julia Miles Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200; closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)

'THE WHORE FROM OHIO' Hanoch Levin's black comedy about a 70-year-old beggar who hires a prostitute is vulgar but stylish, and at times an emotional revelation (1:30). La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village; (212) 475-7710; closing on Sunday. (Gates)

Movies

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.

* 'THE AURA' (No rating, 138 minutes, in Spanish) A heist, a case of mistaken identity and a lonely, epileptic taxidermist are at the heart of this melancholy, deeply satisfying noir exercise, the second and last feature directed by the Argentine filmmaker Fabian Bielinsky, who died in June. (A. O. Scott)

* 'BERGMAN ISLAND' (No rating, 101 minutes total running time, in Swedish and English) This documentary portrait of the great Swedish director, now 88 and living on the desolate Baltic Island of Faro, is extraordinarily revealing. In this extended interview, interwoven with fragments from his pictures, he recalls his life and loves and addresses his fear of death. The film underscores the intensely autobiographical nature of his art. (Stephen Holden)

'BOBBY' (R, 111 minutes) Emilio Estevez's picture, which follows a score of characters through the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles on June 4, 1968, is full of noble ambition. The day in question ended with the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, an event that hovers over the movie, even though Kennedy himself is visible only in archival clips. A huge cast (including Anthony Hopkins, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore, Ashton Kutcher, Lindsay Lohan and Mr. Estevez) labors to inject a collection of melodramatic anecdotes with portent and significance, but the individual parts of the film tend to be either overdone or vague and slight. (Scott)

* 'BORAT: CULTURAL LEARNINGS OF AMERICA FOR MAKE BENEFIT GLORIOUS NATION OF KAZAKHSTAN,' (R, 89 minutes) In this brainy, merciless comedy, a Kazakh journalist named Borat Sagdiyev, a k a the British comic Sacha Baron Cohen, invades America. America laughs, cries, surrenders. (Manohla Dargis)

'CASINO ROYALE' (PG-13, 144 minutes) The latest James Bond vehicle finds the British spy leaner, meaner and now played by an attractive piece of blond rough named Daniel Craig. Zap, pow, ka-ching! (Dargis)

'COME EARLY MORNING' (R, 97 minutes) Ashley Judd returns to the Southern, working-class milieu of her first screen triumph, ''Ruby in Paradise,'' to deliver her most natural screen performance since that film pushed her toward stardom in 1993. Aside from pungent local color, there's not much surrounding this portrait of an embittered barfly floundering through a succession of one-night stands. (Holden)

* 'DAYS OF GLORY' (R, 120 minutes, in French) Rachid Bouchareb's tale of North African soldiers fighting to free their French colonial masters from German Occupation during World War II is a potent combat picture, and also a searching and complex political drama. (Scott)

'DECK THE HALLS' (PG, 95 minutes) In the holiday tradition of stale fruitcake, ugly snowflake sweaters and food poisoning comes this piece of junk, in which Matthew Broderick and Danny DeVito compete to see who can annoy the audience more. (Scott)

'DHOOM 2' (No rating, 151 minutes, in Hindi) A slick and satisfying example of the new, thoroughly modern Bollywood, this cops-and-robbers tale is animated by old-fashioned star power. Hrithik Roshan plays the ''smartest and coolest thief alive,'' and Aishwarya Rai is the small-time crook who loves him. (Rachel Saltz)

* 'FAST FOOD NATION' (R, 106 minutes) Richard Linklater has turned Eric Schlosser's journalistic expose of the American industrial food system into a thoughtful, occasionally rambling inquiry into the contradictions of contemporary American life. Three stories examine different parts of the capitalist food chain: illegal immigrants from Mexico work in terrible conditions in a meat-processing plant; a restaurant chain executive undergoes a crisis of conscience; and a teenage burger-slinger is drawn into political activism. Mr. Linklater covers a lot of ground, and the result is an unusually funny, moving and intellectually demanding movie. (Scott)

* 'FLAGS OF OUR FATHERS' (R, 132 minutes) Clint Eastwood raises the flag over Iwo Jima once more in a powerful if imperfect film about the uses of war and of the men who fight. The fine cast includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach, who delivers heartbreak by the payload. (Dargis)

'FLANNEL PAJAMAS' (No rating, 124 minutes) The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this film, which might have been more accurately titled ''Scenes From a Mixed Marriage'' or ''Annie Hall Without Laughs.'' This smart, talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers follows a Jewish theatrical promoter and an aspiring caterer from a Roman Catholic background from courtship to marriage to separation. (Holden)

* 'FLUSHED AWAY' (PG, 85 minutes) Sewer rats, singing leeches and whimsical British anarchy -- this computer-animated feature from Aardman Animations (''Wallace and Gromit,'' ''Chicken Run'') is completely delightful. (Scott)

'THE FOUNTAIN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) Darren Aronovsky's new film spans a thousand years, as Rachel Weisz and Hugh Jackman pursue undying love and eternal life in the 16th, 21st and 26th centuries. There is some lovely visual poetry, but the ideas are pure doggerel, an ungainly mixture of sci-fi overreach and earnest sentimentality. (Scott)

'FOUR EYED MONSTERS' (No rating, 70 minutes) In this truly modern romance, a merging of reality and re-enacted scenes from reality, two young, creative Brooklynites who met online approach their developing relationship as an art project. (Laura Kern)

'FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION' (PG-13, 86 minutes) This satire of pre-Oscar nomination buzz in Hollywood is far and away the broadest comedy Christopher Guest and his improvisatory company have made. It is also the flimsiest, and unlike Mr. Guest's earlier films, it has no airs of being a fake documentary. As farce trumps satire, the humor's subversive edge is lost, along with meaningful character development, except for the brilliant exception of Catherine O'Hara. (Holden)

'HAPPY FEET' (PG, 100 minutes) The director George Miller gets happy and snappy, then goes dark and deep, in a musical about an animated penguin who was born to dance. Take hankies. (Dargis)

'HERMANAS' (No rating, 100 minutes, in Spanish) The ghost of 1970s Argentina haunts 1980s Texas in this perceptive and beautifully acted drama from the Argentine director Julia Solomonoff. After eight years of exile in Spain, Natalia (Ingrid Rubio) travels to Texas to visit her sister, Elena (Valeria Bertuccelli), a suburban wife and mother. Extensive flashbacks to the sisters' teenage years during the military dictatorship reveal a rich vein of familial guilt and long-suppressed resentment. But the movie is most successful in the rocky emotional spaces in which the women struggle to reconcile over a chasm of political discord and unanswered questions. (Jeannette Catsoulis)

'THE HISTORY BOYS' (R, 104 minutes) The current of intellectual energy snapping through this engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett's Tony Award-winning play, set in a north England boys' school in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question. (Holden)

* 'INLAND EMPIRE' (No rating, 179 minutes) David Lynch's extraordinary, savagely uncompromised new film stars a dazzling Laura Dern as an actress who tumbles down rabbit holes inside rabbit holes inside rabbit holes. As cracked as Mad magazine, though generally more difficult to parse, the film has the power of nightmares and is one of the few this year that deserves to be called art. (Dargis)

'NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER 2: THE RISE OF TAJ' (R, 98 minutes) Britain and India face off in this strained attempt to transplant the American campus comedy to more uptight shores. Now graduated from college -- and sidekick status -- Taj Mahal Badalandabad (Kal Penn) heads to Camford University in England to pursue a Ph.D. and a bad reputation. While the screenplay dives into British history, and the camera dives into every cleavage in sight, the director, Mort Nathan, harnesses smut and silliness to an oddly innocent tale of true love. (Catsoulis)

'THE NATIVITY STORY' (PG, 100 minutes) Nothing earth-shaking, but a fine performance by Keisha Castle-Hughes as Mary offers a glimpse of an interesting movie tucked inside what is otherwise an unsurprising and tasteful Christmas pageant. (Scott)

* 'SHUT UP & SING' (R, 93 minutes) Barbara Kopple and Cecilia Peck's revealing documentary follows the Dixie Chicks around for three years as the group deals with the consequences of a remark by its lead singer, Natalie Maines, who said from a London stage that they were ashamed that the president of the United States was from Texas. The movie is a fascinating study of the relationship between the media, politics and the music industry in an era in which pop musicians are marketed like politicians. (Holden)

* '10 ITEMS OR LESS' (R, 82 minutes) A sweet and modest film by Brad Silberling, in which a fading actor (Morgan Freeman) and a supermarket checkout worker (Paz Vega) spend a day together not doing much of anything. (Scott)

'TENACIOUS D IN THE PICK OF DESTINY' (R, 87 minutes) As it wobbles from one episode to the next, this rock 'n' roll comedy starring Jack Black is a garish mess, and some of it feels padded. But it has enough jokes to keep you smiling, and Mr. Black brings to it a fervent affection for the music he spoofs but obviously adores. (Holden)

'TURISTAS' (R, 89 minutes) If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in this cheap horror flick would be doing time in Attica. (Dargis)

* 'VOLVER' (R, 121 minutes, in Spanish) Another keeper from Pedro Almodovar, with Penelope Cruz -- as a resilient widow -- in her best role to date. (Scott)

'ASIAN CINEVISIONS' (Through tomorrow) The Museum of Modern Art's monthly series of Asian and Asian-American films concludes its fall-winter program this weekend.

(Gates)

'MADE IN NY' The Museum of Modern Art's three-month series of notable films made in the city rolls on. Next week's feature, to be shown on Monday and Wednesday, is Norman Jewison's ''Moonstruck'' (1987). Cher won an Oscar for her role as a Brooklyn widow who falls in love with her fiance's brother.

Ariadna Gil appears both in that film and in David Trueba's ''Welcome Home'' (2006), a young photographer's coming-of-age story. The series will also include an Edgar Neville retrospective, beginning on Sunday with ''The Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks'' (1944), a fantasy about a secret city beneath the streets of Madrid. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.com; $10. (Gates)

Pop

Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.

BACILOS (Tonight) Bacilos, from Miami, draw their rock en Espanol from across the Americas, switching gracefully and tunefully amid cumbia, salsa, bossa nova and pop ballads, and they have a Grammy Award and hit singles to show for it. This has been advertised as the band's last show in New York. At midnight, B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $39. (Jon Pareles)

* CORINNE BAILEY RAE (Wednesday) Even when she is singing about heartbreak and desperation, and griping that love is ''a type of loan with no dividends,'' it is hard not to be seduced by Ms. Bailey Rae, a 27-year-old British singer and guitarist who is this year's breakout soul star. In a sweet, tissue-thin voice that can recall Macy Gray or Sade, she sings of sisterly rituals, loves lost and her ''choux pastry heart.'' At 8 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $26.50. (Ben Sisario)

BOUND STEMS (Sunday and Wednesday) In this Chicago band's elliptical songs, meandering guitars and conversational, half-spoken vocals are woven together with a loose dream logic. Sunday at 9 p.m., with Rahim, at Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; $10.

CIARA (Sunday) This 21-year-old R&B singer had a big, flirty hit a few summers ago with ''Goodies,'' in which she turned away a suitor while teasingly declaring ''I'm no rookie'' over a steady synthesizer wolf whistle. She's back with a new album whose first single, ''Promise,'' has a less provocative message. ''I've been looking for somebody to talk to,'' she sings. ''Is that you?'' At 8 p.m., Nokia Theater, 1515 Broadway, at 44th Street, (212) 307-7171, nokiatheatrenyc.com; $35. (Sisario)

* DASHBOARD CONFESSIONAL, BRAND NEW (Tonight) Reaching a tattooed arm out to every anxious teenage soul, Chris Carrabba, the 31-year-old singer-songwriter who performs as Dashboard Confessional, has become the elder of the emo scene with a repertory of yearning, histrionic melodies and just-hang-in-there themes. (He also reveals some maturity -- gasp! -- on slower, quieter songs.) Brand New pushes emo into the realm of Pink Floyd and U2, with tangles of explosive melody and rich, complex songs about spiritual crisis. At 7:30, Madison Square Garden, (212) 465-6741, thegarden.com; $26.50 to $34.50. (Sisario)

DONNA THE BUFFALO (Tonight) Donna the Buffalo is not named for its fiddler and singer, Tara Nevins. Its good-natured rock leans toward the Appalachian side of country music, though it also dips into reggae and Cajun music, with songs that ponder love and humanity's place in the universe. At 8, Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, near the Bowery, Lower East Side, (212) 533-2111, boweryballroom.com; $18. (Pareles)

ALEJANDRO ESCOVEDO (Tonight) Mr. Escovedo's songs stare down loss and mortality with a mixture of unflinching memory and a rocker's defiance. Here his ensemble includes two violinists, a cellist and a guitarist. At 8:30, Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $43. (Pareles)

* THE EX (Wednesday) Visits from this long-running Dutch band are too rare. Devoted to leftist political ideals, the group chocks its lyrics full of topical allusions and has been known to include 140-page books about the Spanish Revolution with its albums. Admirable, sure. But in concert the Ex is blessedly all about the beat: a brawny, anxious punk-funk that never releases its tension. The effect is unforgettably visceral. With Aloha and DJ/rupture. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $12. (Sisario)

GOOD FOR THE JEWS (Thursday) The tree has been lighted in Rockefeller Center, and the department store window displays have gone up, which means that it's time for the annual ritual of comedians and rockers musing on the true meaning of being Jewish at Christmas. Among the witty reindeer joining the band Good for the Jews for this Hanukkah concert will be the singers Lisa Loeb, Tammy Faye Starlite and Julian Fleisher, and the comedians Todd Barry and Rachel Feinstein. At 8 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $15 in advance, $17 at the door. (Sisario)

PAUL GREEN SCHOOL OF ROCK MUSIC (Tomorrow and Sunday) As seen in the documentary ''Rock School,'' Mr. Green offers an extensive curriculum at his Philadelphia school, teaching youngsters the rock 'n' roll canon, as well as the fundamentals of power chords and budda-budda bass lines. Here his students offer ''Best of the '90s.'' At 2:30 p.m., Rebel, 251 West 30th Street, Manhattan, (212) 695-2747, rebelnyc.com; $10. (Sisario)

WANDA JACKSON (Tomorrow) Wild boys weren't the whole story of 1950s rockabilly. Ms. Jackson, from Oklahoma, was out on the road too, belting songs like ''Fujiyama Mama'' (a big hit in Japan) and ''Mean Mean Man.'' In the '70s she became a Christian and turned to singing church music. But in 1996 one of her fans, the honky-tonk singer Rosie Flores, sought her out for duets, and since then Ms. Jackson has been reclaiming her crown as queen of rockabilly. With the Lustre Kings. At 7 p.m., Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006, knittingfactory.com; $20. (Pareles)

LOSER'S LOUNGE TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN (Thursday) As Nick Lowe said, you've got to be cruel to be kind. Joe McGinty's enduring series, now 13 years old, both honors and skewers pop greats with clever but usually over-the-top performances, and turns its attention here to Mr. John, in the first of five shows over three nights. At 9 p.m., Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com; $25. (Sisario)

LUPE FIASCO (Tuesday) A talented and proudly goofy rapper from Chicago, Lupe Fiasco occupies an unusual middle ground between the microcosmos of alternative hip-hop and the biggest of pop worlds: he made a guest appearance on a Kanye West single and his new album, ''Food & Liquor'' (Atlantic), lists none other than Jay-Z as an executive producer. At 10 p.m., S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940, sobs.com; $26 in advance, $28 at the door. (Sisario)

AIMEE MANN (Tuesday and Thursday) Everybody does a Christmas show in New York, from sarcastic downtown Jewish comedians to Ms. Mann, a fixture of the Los Angeles independent music scene. Promoting a holiday album, ''One More Drifter in the Snow'' (SuperEgo), and looking to build an annual franchise, she performs at Town Hall. At 8 p.m., 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-7171, the-townhall-nyc.org; $29.50 and $39.50; sold out on Thursday. (Sisario)

O'DEATH (Sunday and Wednesday) This New York band draws from the starkness and spiritual purity of Appalachian folk, the noisemongering of punk and the rowdy theatricality of Tom Waits. With quiet pluckings of banjo and angry, anarchic howls, its songs jumble sacred and profane. Sunday at 8 p.m., with Phosphorescent and Stars Like Fleas, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $10.

OLLABELLE (Tuesday) Worshiping blues, country and gospel with crystalline voices and wide eyes, this vocal quintet is best in a live setting, and keeps a busy schedule in the bars of New York. Here it plays at Union Hall, a newish place in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a cozy music room downstairs. At 8 p.m., 702 Union Street, at Fifth Avenue, (718) 638-4400, unionhallny.com; $15. (Sisario)

PERNICE BROTHERS, ELVIS PERKINS (Tonight) Call it Kleenex rock: the sound is delicate, the voices soft and whispery, the mood really, really sad. The Pernice Brothers surround tales of woe with careful pop artistry that draws a little from country. The plaintive and tuneful songs of Elvis Perkins, from Providence, R.I., have been tapped for mood music on ''The OC.'' At 8:30, with Sono Oto, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $15. (Sisario)

'POWER OF THE NEW JAPANESE WOMAN' (Tonight and tomorrow night) The latest installment of John Zorn's occasional series at the Japan Society celebrates women of the Japanese avant-garde, who are anything but demure. Tonight is Afrirampo, a duo that fits right in with the chaotic noise-rock of the Boredoms and Lightning Bolt, and a trio called ni-hao! Tomorrow features, in separate sets, Yuka Honda and Miho Hatori, of the whimsical '90s experimental pop group Cibo Matto. At 7:30, 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $28; $20 for members (tomorrow's performance is sold out). (Sisario)

SIZZLA (Monday) Like Buju Banton before him, Sizzla has figured out that idealism can be just as fearsome as nihilism. He's astonishingly prolific (he releases two or three albums a year) and versatile, equally at home with roots reggae grooves and digital dancehall beats. Whether he's singing an Afrocentric love song or screaming for revenge against ''Babylon,'' his fervent voice turns every lyric into a life-or-death struggle. At 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $35 at the door. (Kelefa Sanneh)

RONNIE SPECTOR (Tomorrow and Sunday) For her annual holiday show, Ms. Spector, forever the queen of big-haired rock 'n' roll girls, has a ready repertory: her group, the Ronettes, sang ''Frosty the Snowman,'' ''I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus'' and ''Sleigh Ride'' on Phil Spector's 1963 ensemble album, ''A Christmas Gift for You.'' She's been known to belt out a ''Be My Baby'' too. Tomorrow at 9 p.m., Sunday at 8 p.m., B. B. King Blues Club and Grill, 243 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30 in advance, $34 at the door. (Sisario)

TAJ MAHAL (Monday through Wednesday) In Taj Mahal's hands, the blues are no weighty downer but a repository of breezy, evocative sounds easily connected to Caribbean and Hawaiian music. His trio includes Billy Rich on bass and Kester Smith on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; cover, $45 at tables, with a $5 minimum, or $35 at the bar, with a one-drink minimum. (Sisario)

At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7000, carnegiehall.org; $29 to $79. (Sisario)

* WE ARE SCIENTISTS, OXFORD COLLAPSE, THE GRATES (Tomorrow) We Are Scientists and Oxford Collapse, both from New York, revive postpunk in different ways. We Are Scientists sings about bohemia and boredom (''I'm sick of waking up on your floor/For the sixth or seventh night in a row'') over a spiky discopunk groove derived from Gang of Four, while Oxford Collapse looks to the tense jangle of Television and the Feelies. The Grates, from Australia, borrow their passionate, joyful amateurism from classic riot grrrl. At 9 p.m., Northsix, 66 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 599-5103, northsix.com; sold out. (Sisario)

RASHIED ALI QUINTET (Tomorrow) Rashied Ali has had a substantial career in the jazz avant-garde over the last 40 years, beginning with his percussive role in the late-period work of John Coltrane.

Sweet Rhythm, 88 Seventh Avenue South, at Bleecker Street, West Village, (212) 255-3626, sweetrhythmny.com; cover, $20, with a $10 minimum. (Nate Chinen)

* ANIMATION: MILES DAVIS'S BITCHES BREW (Tomorrow) The most influential fusion recording ever made receives a sequential but otherwise liberal interpretation at the hands of Bob Belden, who produced its essential reissue a few years ago.

MICHAEL BLAKE TRIO (Tonight) Pulse and texture shift perpetually in this trio, thanks to the earthy rhythm team of Ben Allison on bass and Jeff Ballard on drums, but the group's capricious tone is set by Mr. Blake, on tenor and soprano saxophones.

* GAL COSTA (Tonight through Sunday) Ms. Costa, one of Brazil's greatest singers, suspends her songs in midair, as if gravity had been banished. This week, as in the shows she recorded earlier this year for her album ''Live at the Blue Note'' (DRG), she leads a hushed band and uses the intimacy of the club to return to music she grew up on, particularly the bossa novas of Antonio Carlos Jobim: Brazilian classics sung with pure, knowing poise. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, www.bluenote.net/newyork; $55 at tables, $35 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Jon Pareles)

THE FOUR BAGS/TED REICHMAN AND ANTHONY BURR (Sunday) The instrumental palette of the Four Bags -- Brian Drye on trombone, Jacob Garchik on accordion, Sean Moran on guitar and Mike McGinnis on reeds -- suggests a contemporary species of chamber jazz. So does the duo of Mr. Reichman, on piano, accordion and pump organ, and Mr. Burr, on clarinet. At 8 p.m., Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501, tonicnyc.com; cover, $10. (Chinen)

* ROY HAYNES (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Haynes, the redoubtable drummer, is 81, though you'd never guess it by the freshness and ferocity of his playing. This year he released an album called ''Whereas'' (Dreyfus) that only burnished his reputation for focused fire. (Through Dec. 16.) At 9 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; cover, $40, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)

MANHATTAN TRANSFER (Thursday) For the last 30 years, this four-piece vocal group has been an adult-pop confection, but one seasoned thoroughly by jazz; nestled within its collective sound there are still particular pleasures, like the alto of Janis Siegel. (Through Dec. 17.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, West Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenotejazz.com/newyork; cover, $60 at tables, $45 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)

STEVE NELSON (Monday) Mr. Nelson brings an exploratory tilt to his vibraphone playing, whether he's cruising through the songbook or venturing into abstraction. Stark settings provide an opportunity to hear him think, which is one reason to catch this evening of duets. The other reason: his ideal duet partners, the bassist Dave Holland and the pianist Mulgrew Miller. At 8 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; $25 in advance, $30 on Monday. (Chinen)

RUDRESH/HEMINGWAY/DRESSER TRIO (Thursday) Strenuous experimentalism, but not without a point: Rudresh Mahanthappa's flinty alto saxophone tone should abrade effectively against Mark Dresser's probing bass playing and Gerry Hemingway's textural percussion. At 8 p.m., Barbes, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 965-9177, barbesbrooklyn.com; cover, $8. (Chinen)

Opera

'LA BOHEME' (Tomorrow and Wednesday) Franco Zeffirelli's overblown ''Boheme'' returns to the Metropolitan Opera for its regular airing. Rolando Villazon, the talented Mexican tenor, is a convincing Rodolfo, although his voice and charisma are somewhat dwarfed by the massive sets. Mr. Villazon's mentor and idol, Placido Domingo, leads the orchestra tomorrow; Steven Crawford conducts on Wednesday. Mimi will be sung by Maija Kovalevska, the Latvian soprano who was one of the first-prize winners in the 2006 Operalia Competition, which Mr. Domingo runs for young singers. Anna Samuil replaces Susannah Glanville as Musetta. Peter Coleman-Wright ably sings her jealous lover, Marcello. Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m., Wednesday at 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; sold out. (Vivien Schweitzer)

* 'DON CARLO' (Monday and Thursday) The powerhouse tenor Johan Botha is a hefty man and a stiff actor. But he certainly brings the vocal goods to the title role in John Dexter's production of Verdi's noble masterpiece. The winning cast includes Patricia Racette as Elisabeth, Dmitri Hvorostovsky as Rodrigo, Olga Borodina as Eboli and the astounding German bass Rene Pape as Philip II. James Levine conducts a magnificent performance. At 7 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $15 to $175. (Anthony Tommasini)

'DON JUAN IN PRAGUE' (Wednesday and Thursday) To celebrate Mozart's 250th birthday this year, some have restaged Mozart's operas; others have reimagined them. Conceived by David Chambers, ''Don Juan in Prague,'' which had its premiere at Bard's SummerScape in 2003, is Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' run through a multimedia filter of digital sound enhancement and cutting-edge images, with the avant-garde vocalist Iva Bittova as a whole new kind of Donna Elvira. The Agon Orchestra of Prague performs under Petr Kofron. At 7:30 p.m., BAM Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $60. (Anne Midgette)

Count on exceptional work from the mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kozena as Idamante, and the soprano Dorothea Roschmann as Ilia. James Levine conducts. Tomorrow at 1 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $120 to $220. (Tommasini)

'LORD BYRON'S LOVE LETTER'/'THE VILLAGE SINGER' (Tonight and Sunday) Tennessee Williams wrote a single opera libretto of his own: ''Lord Byron's Love Letter,'' set by the composer Raffaello de Banfield, first performed in 1955, and all but forgotten since (with the exception of a couple of productions). The ever-ambitious Manhattan School of Music Opera Theater continues its cultivation of neglected American opera by bringing back the work for its New York premiere, on a double bill with Stephen Paulus's ''Village Singer.'' Ari Pelto conducts. Tonight at 8, Sunday afternoon at 2:30, Broadway at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (917) 493-4428, www.msmnyc.edu; $20; $10 for students and 65+. (Midgette)

'RIGOLETTO' (Tonight and Tuesday) The strong Spanish baritone Carlos Alvarez takes over the title role in the Metropolitan Opera's revival of Otto Schenk's grimly realistic 1989 production.

At 8 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metopera.org; $205 tickets remaining tonight; $15 to $175 on Tuesday. (Tommasini)

Classical Music

* PIERRE-LAURENT AIMARD (Monday) You've heard of the 24 Chopin etudes, daunting study pieces that all aspiring pianists must tackle? Well, for the second program in his enticing Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall, this extraordinary, searching French pianist presents ''A Study of a Study,'' a varied offering of 24 etudes by Liszt, Scriabin, Rachmaninoff, Bartok, Ligeti and, yes, Chopin. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $40 and $48. (Tommasini)

AMSTERDAM BAROQUE ORCHESTRA (Sunday and Tuesday) The quirky but usually enlightening Dutch conductor and harpsichordist Ton Koopman led this orchestra in a Christmas concert of works by Bach, Buxtehude and Corelli at Carnegie Hall last night, but if you missed it, they will play it again on Sunday in Newark. If, on the other hand, you caught that concert and still want more, Mr. Koopman and company return to Carnegie on Tuesday to perform Bach's ''Musical Offering'' and ''Coffee'' Cantata. Sunday at 3 p.m., New Jersey Performing Arts Center, 1 Center Street, Newark, (888) 466-5722, njpac.org; $20 to $58. Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $50 to $60. (Allan Kozinn)

EFE BALTACIGIL (Tonight) This talented Turkish cellist has gained attention in a number of ways. He has won an Avery Fisher Career Grant and the Young Concert Artists auditions. But even more significant, for many, was his impromptu performance with Emanuel Ax when a snowstorm in 2004 prevented most of his fellow members of the Philadelphia Orchestra from getting to the concert on time. Tonight he appears as part of Carnegie Hall's Rising Stars series, with the pianist Anna Polonsky, in a program of Bach, Shostakovich, Ahmet Adnan Saygun and Franck. At 7:30, Weill Recital Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $28. (Midgette)

MARTIN BRESNICK RETROSPECTIVE (Tomorrow) To celebrate the 60th birthday of this influential composer and teacher, the Yale School of Music has brought together a small army of musicians. Among the performers are the Yale Cellos, the Yale Camerata, the clarinetist David Shifrin, the violist Jesse Levine, the pianist Lisa Moore (who is also married to the composer) and the conductor Ransom Wilson. The program, an overview of Mr. Bresnick's work, includes ''B's Garlands,'' a clarinet trio, ''Grace -- Concerto for Two Marimbas and Chamber Orchestra,'' ''For the Sexes: The Gates of Paradise,'' ''My Twentieth Century'' and ''Three Choral Songs.'' At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $15 to $25. (Kozinn)

CHAMBER MUSIC SOCIETY OF LINCOLN CENTER (Tonight and Sunday) The performance level has improved notably since the days when critics routinely referred to this ad hoc assembly of visiting musicians as the Sight-Reading Society, but even so, few New York institutions have so thoroughly outlived their usefulness. Now the society has a new creative team -- the cellist David Finckel and his wife, the pianist Wu Han -- and it tells you something about its creative vitality that a centerpiece of its programming this season is a Baroque festival, performed on modern instruments and devoted entirely to crowd-pleasers. The opening program, inventively called ''Baroque Collection,'' includes music by Telemann, Bach, Marais and Vivaldi. Tonight at 8, Sunday at 5 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5788, chambermusicsociety.org; $30 to $52 tonight, sold out on Sunday. (Kozinn)

CHICAGO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (Tonight) Pierre Boulez, the French composer and conductor, will give Mahler's huge Seventh Symphony an unaccustomed elegance when he leads the equally elegant Chicago Symphony. At 8, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $38 to $123. (Bernard Holland)

ARNALDO COHEN (Sunday) This veteran Brazilian-born pianist plays Chopin for one of the Peoples' Symphony Concerts' Sunday afternoon audiences. At 2 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 586-4680, pscny.org; $9 and $11. (Holland)

* HANDEL'S 'MESSIAH' (Tuesday and Thursday) Of all the ''Messiah'' performances that parade through New York every December, the most consistently pleasing -- and at times even thrilling -- has been the one at St. Thomas Church. John Scott leads the church's choir of men and boys, accompanied by Concert Royal, a fine period-instrument orchestra. This year there is a twist: instead of performing one of several surviving Handel versions (he revised a lot), Mr. Scott is offering the work in Mozart's colorfully expansive orchestration. The soloists are Ava Pine, soprano; Kirsten Sollek, alto; Joseph Gaines, tenor; and Sumner Thompson, bass. At 7:30 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street, (212) 664-9360, www.saintthomaschurch.org; $20 to $80. (Kozinn)

STEVEN ISSERLIS AND FRIENDS (Wednesday and Thursday) This cellist gathers the pianist Jeremy Denk, the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, the narrator Len Cariou and a high-end group of string players, including Joshua Bell. The composers are Schumann, Brahms and, briefly, Albert Dietrich. At 7:30 p.m., Zankel Hall, Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $48 to $60. (Holland)

ANGELIKA KIRCHSCHLAGER (Sunday) The smooth-voiced and much-touted Austrian mezzo, accompanied by the veteran Malcolm Martineau, performs Schumann and Schubert lieder, familiar (''An die Musik'') and less-known (''Lied des Florio''). At 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, lincolncenter.org; $48. (Midgette)

* NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC (Wednesday and Thursday) Through its ''Hear and Now'' series, the Philharmonic plays a preview on Wednesday of ''Adriana Songs,'' a new work by Kaija Saariaho, whose music is much admired for its craftsmanship, imaginative sonorities and organic richness. The composer Steven Stucky will discuss the work with Ms. Saariaho, and David Robertson will perform it with the Philharmonic. The next night it will have its official American premiere on a program with works by Debussy and Sibelius. Wednesday at 6:45 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, Lincoln Center, (212) 721-6500, nyphil.org; $10 to $35 on Wednesday, $28 to $96 on Thursday. (Tommasini)

* ORCHESTRA OF THE AGE OF ENLIGHTENMENT (Tonight) This London-based period-instrument orchestra, when it is playing its best, produces a robust, bright-edged sound that brings out the best in its repertory. Its program tonight, part of Miller Theater's Bach in Context series, includes one work by Johann Sebastian Bach (the Ricercar a 6 from the ''Musical Offering''), with works by two of his sons, J. C. Bach (the Sinfonia in B flat) and C. P. E. Bach (a group of marches). The program's center of gravity, though, is Mozart's ''Gran Partita'' Serenade. At 8, Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799, millertheater.com; $35. (Kozinn)

ORCHESTRA OF ST. LUKE'S (Thursday) Donald Runnicles, the orchestra's principal conductor, raises the British flag high in a program featuring Britten's Violin Concerto (Midori is the soloist), Purcell's G minor Chaconne, Elgar's famous ''Enigma Variations'' and Arvo Part's ''Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten.'' At 8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $23 to $75. (Holland)

ORPHEUS CHAMBER ORCHESTRA (Thursday) Bach is a new focus of this conductorless ensemble (which is commissioning six new concertos as companion pieces to the ''Brandenburgs''). And Bach cantatas are one of its happiest manifestations. In its second season of cantatas at the Metropolitan Museum, the group celebrates the holiday season by performing Nos. 40 and 133 in front of the famous Baroque Christmas tree in the Medieval Sculpture Hall. At 6:30 and 8:30 p.m., (212) 570-3949, metmuseum.org; $60. (Midgette)

VASSILY PRIMAKOV (Sunday) This Russian pianist plays Schumann in Arium's updated salon ambience. A little food and drink is included. At 4 p.m., 31 Little West 12th Street, West Village, (212) 463-8630, ariumnyc.com; $40; $20 for members. (Holland)

Jones has created ''Chapel/Chapter'' for it. Daniel Bernard Roumain has contributed the score, drawn from sacred and secular Renaissance music and gospel and folk. It includes video by Janet Wong and scenic design by Bjorn Amelan. At 7:30, 150 Convent Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 650-7100, aarondavishall.org; $25. (Dunning)

* NEW YORK CITY BALLET (Tonight through Sunday; Tuesday through Thursday) George Balanchine's prototypical ''Nutcracker'' continues until Dec. 30, with nine performances this week alone.

 Museums

* American Museum of Natural History: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to gold. An astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples, larded with fascinating facts and tales, ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100. (Roberta Smith)

BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'Watercolors by Walton Ford,' through Jan. 28. This show assembles more than 50 of Mr. Ford's large-scale watercolors of birds, animals, snakes and lushly exotic flora, produced since the early '90s. They frequently depict moments in which a wild animal encounters human culture, often to its detriment. Sometimes the threat is overt, as in pictures of animals and birds roped or wounded; in other images you merely sense that some horrible violence has occurred, or is about to happen. The moralizing of these images can become a little tedious. But this artist imparts an environmental message, couched in a lament for the irreversible loss that occurs when a sense of ethics does not govern the treatment of animals. 200 Eastern Parkway at Prospect Park, Brooklyn (718) 638-5000. (Benjamin Genocchio)

* SOLOMON R. GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'Spanish Painting from El Greco to Picasso,' through March 28. This show is carried along on its sheer star power and optical finesse. There are dozens of Goyas and Velazquezes and Zurbarans and El Grecos and Riberas and Dalis and Picassos, many famous, many not. The big point is that Spanish art did not constantly reinvent itself over time. It was a bubble culture, sustained for centuries by its political and religious isolation and its national loner mindset. Velazquez's painting of a dwarf is alone worth crossing a continent to see. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Michael Kimmelman)

* THE METropolitan museum of art: 'GLITTER AND DOOM: GERMAN PORTRAITS FROM THE 1920s,' through Feb. 19. This show's 100 paintings and drawings are by 10 artists, among them George Grosz, Christian Schad, Rudolf Schlichter and Karl Hubbuch, and most conspicuously the unrelentingly savage Otto Dix and his magnificent other, Max Beckmann. In their works the Weimar Republic's porous worlds reassemble. We look into the faces of forward-looking museum directors and cabaret performers, society matrons and scarred war veterans, prostitutes and jaded aristocrats who were watching their world slide from one cataclysm to the next. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* THE MET: 'LOUIS COMFORT TIFFANY AND LAURELTON HALL -- AN ARTIST'S COUNTRY ESTATE,' through May 20. Laurelton Hall may have burned to the ground in 1957, but this exhibition does an excellent job of reassembling what remains of this extraordinary house-museum and its gardens, which Tiffany created for himself in the early 1900s. The Gilded Age opulence of the place, which occupied 580 acres overlooking Long Island Sound -- and of the Tiffany residences preceding it -- is conveyed most blatantly by the Temple-of-Dendur-size Daffodil Terrace, in wood, marble and glass. The main events are the glass windows, vases and lamps, where Tiffany's genius for color, love of the exotic and reverence for nature coalesce into an unforgettable mystical materialism. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)

* MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: ''SAUL STEINBERG: ILLUMINATIONS,'' through March 4. A cartoonist-artist extraordinaire, Saul Steinberg (1914-99) was a veritable Leonardo of graphic drollery. His famous New Yorker cover positioning Manhattan at the center of the world may be his best-known drawing, but he took on everything -- Floridians, linguistic concepts, erotica, cowboys, Cubism, nature, architecture and women -- with visual puns, manic doodles, grandiloquent calligraphy and other inspired artifice. As this show of more than 100 Steinberg drawings, collages and constructions, arranged in chronological order, goes on, Steinberg's progress is evident: from relatively simple cartoons like ''Feet on Chair'' (1946), in which a fellow reading a newspaper parks his feet on the seat of an ornate Victorian monstrosity, to complex comments on the state of the world, like ''Street War (Cadavre Exquisis)'' (about 1972-74), derived from news clips of postcolonial troubles in the Middle East and Africa. The flow of his work amazes. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008. (Grace Glueck)

* MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'A CITY ON PAPER: SAUL STEINBERG'S NEW YORK,' through March 25. A very lively adjunct to the Morgan show, this smaller display of some 40 drawings focuses on New York. An architect, Steinberg was particularly attracted to edifices like the Chrysler Building, which appears here in one incarnation, looming majestically over humble brownstones; in another, from a perspective directly below it, looking positively squat. New York people, in Steinberg's eyes, could be monuments, too. And no one ever fully appreciated the impact of upscale New York women until Steinberg the misogynist came along. ''Fur Coats'' (1951), portrays four expensive baroque pelts wearing four women, and it's dead on. You may think you know Steinberg's work, but these two shows make it new. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672. (Glueck)

* NEUE GALLERY: 'JOSEF HOFFMANN: INTERIORS, 1902-1913,' through Feb. 26. An architect-designer who became an impresario of high taste in turn-of-the-century Vienna, Hoffmann was a believer in the Gesamkunstwerk, or ''total work of art,'' orchestrating useful objects with paintings, sculptures and architecture in a composition greater than its parts. His early, intensely 20th-century design program, based on the grid and the square, is evident here in the installation of four interiors he designed for wealthy Viennese patrons, replete with furniture, wall and floor coverings, textiles, lighting, ceramics, glass and metal work. Most impressive here is the dining room he designed in 1913 for the Geneva apartment of the Swiss Symbolist painter Ferdinand Hodler, a large, calm space with furniture that has a pre-postmodern look. Neue Gallery, 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200. (Glueck)

P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'John Latham: Time Base and the Universe,' through Jan. 8. This retrospective of John Latham spans nearly 50 years of Mr. Latham's work, which is concerned with time, preservation and decay. Among the more idiosyncratic and interesting pieces are a series of ''Cluster'' sculptures from the early 1990s, orbs of plaster embedded with books and suspended from the ceiling, which suggest cultural detritus preserved in celestial rock or geological magma. ''The N-U Niddrie Heart'' (around 1990), in which ''The Pregnancy Survival Manual'' and ''Vanished Species'' are cut up and fitted into glass armatures, with sand scattered around their bases, explores human production (and reproduction) and the passage of time. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.

Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Africa Comics,' through March 18. Intense is the word for the stealth-potency of this modest-size, first-time United States survey of original designs by 35 African artists who specialize in comic art. The work is intense, the way urban Africa can be intense: intensely zany, intensely harsh, intensely warm, intensely political. The entertainment value is high. We are on familiar Marvel Comics ground with the adventures of the charismatic Princess Wella, a Superwoman with a ceremonial staff and braids, and the schlumpy but wily character named Goorgoolou from Senegal. But more often than not, humor is sugar-coating for varying degrees of disquiet, including images of jabbing violence. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500. (Holland Cotter)

Whitney Museum of American Art: Kiki Smith: 'A Gathering, 1980-2005,' through Feb. 11. Many things fly and float in ''Kiki Smith'': men and women, harpies and angels, birds and beasts, toadstools and stars. And some things fall to earth, or rather to the museum's black stone floors, maybe to rise again, maybe not. The whole show, a midcareer retrospective, suggests a Victorian fairy tale, its tone at once light, grievous and dreamlike. But fanciful as it is, Ms. Smith's art is also deeply, corporeally realistic. It wears moral and mortal seriousness on its sleeve, if not tattooed to its wrist. It is about life and death, the essential things. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3676. (Cotter)

Galleries: Uptown

Sigmar Polke Painting is man's oldest conjuring trick, and Sigmar Polke is one of its reigning magicians. In this show new paintings and those from the 1980s, all two-sided and painted with resin, surround a small selection of German Baroque amber (Bernstein is German for amber) jewelry and exquisite tchotchkes. The show simulates a Wunderkammer, a darkened wonder cabinet of the 17th or 18th century. The paintings, made translucent by the resin, nearly defy deciphering. Doodles and abstract splashes of white paint overlay murky washes of glowing resin on both sides of their membranous support, then cast dim shadows on the wall behind, so that the pictures seem suspended in midair, floating. Michael Werner Gallery, 4 East 77th Street, Manhattan, (212) 988-1623, through Jan. 13. (Kimmelman)

Galleries: Chelsea

Aric Obrosey Mr. Obrosey's fastidious graphite depictions of woven and knotted threads have a mesmerizing, meditative quality. Care in the making encourages care in looking. In close-up the motifs combine elements of straightforward trompe l'oeil. Each strand of these lacelike compositions behaves according to strict spatial and structural rules; they may twist and turn, conform or deviate eccentrically. But reality is respected, even when the strands coalesce at the center into a mandalalike circle or a wildly knotted disco ball. And the illusions go deeper: Each strand is something like a world unto itself, with distinct, chainlike structures or decorative patterns that suggest different cultures or other crafts. The strands pulse like arteries of tiny lights in a work dedicated to Felix Gonzalez-Torres. Greater than Mr. Obrosey's drawing skill is his ability to convert what might be called Conceptual content into visual terms. McKenzie Fine Art, 511 West 25th Street, (212) 989-5467, www.mckenziefineart.com, through Dec. 20. (Smith)

Other Galleries

* 'Looking Back' This inaugural edition of a new White Columns Annual is designed, like the old-time Whitney Biennial, to offer a recap of contemporary art of the immediate past, and in this case the art of a single New York gallery season past. It's a great idea, a chance to linger over shows seen in a rush, or entirely missed, or fondly remembered. The curator, Matthew Higgs, director of White Columns, has made satisfyingly unobvious choices, and any show that includes Klara Liden and Stuart Sherman is a winner. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)

Public Art

NINA KATCHADOURIAN: 'OFFICE SEMAPHORE' Ms. Katchadourian has borrowed marine flag signaling techniques to create an interactive art project consisting of an old-fashioned tourist telescope installed at the corner of a plaza in the middle of the financial district, its lens trained on the window of an upper-floor office in a nearby skyscraper. Each day the man working in the office, or his assistant, arranges objects on his widow sill. The combination and order of the objects represent a specific message, which viewers down on the plaza can interpret using a key-chart on the telescope. 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza, corner of Liberty and William Streets; stairway entrance to the plaza is on William Street at Cedar Street; www.publicartfund.org, Jan. 14.

Last Chance

* Asia society: 'ONE WAY OR ANOTHER: ASIAN AMERICAN ART NOW' Taking its name from a 1978 hit by Blondie, this lively exhibition finds a new vitality and freedom, especially where identity is involved, in Asian-American art. The artists' roots range from Iran to Korea. Keep a special eye out for Mari Eastman's wryly beautiful paintings; Mika Tajima's glamorous deconstruction of Minimalism; and the video-performance efforts of Patty Chang, Laurel Nakadate and Xavier Cha. An added bonus: 12, or 71 percent, of the show's 17 artists are women. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org; closes on Sunday. (Smith)

Christian Jankowski: 'Us and them' This show is smart in its exploration of what might be called the banality of feigned evil, but it also feels predictable. Mr. Jankowsky gets closest to real emotion in the 11-minute ''Angels of Revenge,'' in which 12 costume contestants at a horror film convention walk slowly toward the camera while reciting their most dire revenge fantasies. A wolf man complains about having his cellphone stolen; a ''Night of the Living Dead'' type waves a chain saw; a man in a bloody chef's suit suggests a found-art Paul McCarthy video. It is hard to decide if the lameness of their efforts indicates that most people aren't violent, that horror buffs need to get a life, or that Mr. Jankowski's interventionism is temporarily in a rut. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

The Met: 'New Orleans After the Flood: Photographs by Robert Polidori,' After Hurricane Katrina, Mr. Polidori went to New Orleans, where he lived years ago, to shoot photographs of the devastation for The New Yorker. He took hundreds of pictures with a large-format camera that produced wide, superbly detailed color photographs. Mr. Polidori is a connoisseur of chaos, and the beauty of his pictures -- they have a languid, almost underwater beauty -- entails locating order in bedlam. He also photographed signs of recovery: trailers and construction equipment; a few historic homes, stripped to their frames, shorn, on the verge of new life. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Kimmelman)

* Futoshi Miyagi In his New York solo debut this young, gay, Japanese-born artist works toward self-assertion through self-effacement. He poses with strangers in their apartments for photographic records of illusional domesticity. In the gallery he recreates a picture-covered wall from his own bedroom, but includes only the tacks that held the pictures in place. He dissolves a portrait of himself, taken by a friend, in a bottle of bleach so that the features are erased. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949; closes tomorrow. (Cotter)

'Moving Pictures: American Art and Early Film, 1880-1910' What's thought to be the first movie kiss, between May Irwin and John C. Rice, occurred in 1896, photographed by the Edison Manufacturing Company as the subject of a 19-second film shown at a New York music hall. It and dozens of other early movie treasures, along with fine art of the period, are shown in this engrossing if learned survey of the links -- both planned and happenstance -- between the earliest movies and other American visual art forms at the turn of the 20th century. Throughout the show, provocative juxtapositions are made of films and paintings by Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast, Childe Hassam, George Bellows and John Sloan, among others. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, www.nyu.edu/greyart; closes tomorrow. (Glueck)

Betty Parsons: 'Painted Sculpture' In the decade before she died in 1982, at 82, Ms. Parsons began cobbling together scraps of lumber, boats and signs that washed up on the beach near her summer house on the North Fork of Long Island. She added unobtrusive touches of color: mostly stripes that waver somewhere between Mondrian and festive war paint, but also circles and dabs, often in response to nail holes or the faded hues from the wood's earlier life. The resulting works qualify as an endearing yet somehow rigorous folk-modernism. Art Gallery of the Graduate Center, City University of New York, 365 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, www.gc.cuny.edu; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

Catherine Yass: 'Lock' How big is the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River? Judging by the size of its locks, very. Their monumentality and what they tell us of nature's power and man's ability to harness it are the chief subjects of this imposing two-screen film installation. Shot from a crane high on a barge during passes through the dam's locks, the facing screens provide a fore and aft view of the journey, perfectly synched. The gallery feels like the barge's invisible middle section. You don't quite realize the immensity of the structures until you notice the tiny figures moving along gangways at the barges' edges. As a metaphor for the new China, it is pretty intimidating. Galerie LeLong, 528 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 315-0470, www.galerielelong.com; closes tomorrow. (Smith)

HEADLINE: Don't Count on Iran to Pick Up the Pieces

BYLINE: By Kenneth M. Pollack. 
Kenneth M. Pollack is the director of research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and the author of ''The Persian Puzzle: The Conflict Between Iran and America.''

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
AS anticipated, the Iraq Study Group has recommended that the United States begin talks with Iran to solicit its assistance in stabilizing Iraq. This recommendation seems so sensible that the Bush administration's past reluctance to follow it is hard to fathom. Still, administration officials are right to counter that talking to Iran is not a policy, let alone a solution to our problems in Iraq. 
 The real questions are these: What do we say to the Iranians if we can get them to the table? What can they do in Iraq? What would they be willing to do in Iraq? And what will they want in return? 
We should have engaged Iran in Iraq years ago. Before and during the war in Afghanistan, the Iranians were quite helpful to the United States. They shared our hatred of Al Qaeda and the Taliban, and they provided us with extensive assistance on intelligence, logistics, diplomacy and Afghan internal politics. After we turned our sights on Saddam Hussein, the Iranians suggested that they would be willing to cooperate on that too. Unfortunately, the Bush administration declined the offer, preferring to lump Tehran with Baghdad and Pyongyang in the ''axis of evil.'' 
 None of this should suggest that Iran was helping us for reasons other than blatant self-interest, or that it had suddenly given up its antipathy toward us. But it was demonstrating real pragmatism and being very helpful on issues of mutual concern, which should have been good enough. 
 Today, large numbers of Iranian intelligence agents have infiltrated Iraq, where they seem to be providing money, weapons and other supplies to virtually all of Iraq's Shiite militias. There are reports that Hezbollah is training Iraqi Shiite militiamen in Lebanon at Iran's behest. And the Shiite warlords all know that in an all-out civil war, Iran would be their only backer. 
 All of that gives the Iranians influence over the Shiite militias -- influence that could be helpful to the United States as it tries to forge a new strategy toward Iraq.
 We should be careful, however, not to exaggerate Iran's influence. The problems in Iraq were not caused by the Iranians, nor can Iran solve them all. 
 Most Iraqis dislike the Iranians. In fact, ''dislike'' is too mild a term. In 2004 and early 2005, when it still seemed as if the United States-led reconstruction of Iraq might succeed, Shiite politicians were bending over backward to demonstrate that they were independent of Iran for fear their constituents would not support them otherwise. 
 Furthermore, while Iranian support is no doubt gratefully received, the evidence suggests that it is now more a supplement than a necessity for the major militias. At this point, the main Shiite groups -- the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, the Mahdi Army, and the Fadhila Party among others -- have considerable support among the population and are accused of making enormous amounts of money off oil smuggling and organized crime. Plus, there is no shortage of weapons in Iraq, with additional supplies readily available on the regional black market.
 So Tehran can influence the behavior of the Shiite groups, but it probably would have a hard time forcing them to do things they do not want to do -- like disbanding their militias, accepting a national reconciliation agreement, participating in an equitable oil-sharing scheme or accepting any of the other major changes that the Bush administration is seeking. If Iran were to threaten to end its support for these groups, they would most likely tell Tehran to get lost. What's more, the Iranians seem to understand this, having so far proven reluctant to try to force any of the Shiite groups to radically change course. 
 The limits on Iranian influence are a double-edged sword. They mean that we cannot count on Iran to solve Iraq's problems, but they also mean that we need not offer the Iranians the world in return for their assistance. Right now, Tehran and its bombastic president are riding high in the Middle East, and they will doubtless want something in return for helping us deal with Iraq. For instance, they may demand that the United States drop its objections to their nuclear program or cave in to Hezbollah's demands for a greater say in Lebanon. 
 Especially given the likely limits on what Iran can deliver in Iraq, these would not be prices worth paying. Instead, the United States should emphasize a shared interest in preventing Iraq's further implosion, as chaos there could easily spread to Iran -- a danger most of Tehran's leaders seem to appreciate. 
 In exchange for Iran's assistance, Washington should recognize Iran's legitimate interests in Iraq, keep it (generally) apprised of military operations, and possibly even develop a liaison relationship with the Iranian military and intelligence services by which the two sides could exchange limited information, thereby dampening Iranian fears of malign American intentions.
 Much of this could be accomplished by forming a standing contact group made up of Iraq's neighbors -- similar to the international support group proposed by Baker-Hamilton. The Iraqi government and the coalition forces would regularly brief this group and seek its advice, which should be ignored only with good reason. In return, the members of the contact group would commit to providing specific kinds of economic, political, diplomatic and even military support. 
 There are at least three good reasons to try this approach. First, no neighboring state is likely to significantly alter strategy unless they all do. Second, our efforts to work with Iran in Iraq cannot come at the expense of our traditional allies among the Sunni states of the region: Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Finally, the problems in Iraq have become so daunting and so intertwined that we need every ounce of help we can get from every source available. 
 We can't simply expect Iran to save Iraq for us. Even all of Iraq's neighbors working in concert would play just a supporting role. Only the United States, working with those forces in Iraq still fighting the good fight, can possibly alter Iraq's catastrophic course. 
 We need a new, feasible plan of our own. Only then will we know how best Iran can help, and what we are willing to pay for that help. Talking to Iran without such a plan would be fruitless, if not folly.

HEADLINE: 10 Republicans Dominate Senate's Pet Projects, With Bruno's $6.4 Million Topping List

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM; Amanda Cox contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, and nine other Republican senators have spent nearly a third of the roughly $150 million the Republican-controlled State Senate has set aside for pet projects in the last two years, according to records released Thursday. 
 That leaves many of the other 62 senators scrapping for leftovers in the pork barrel, highlighting the inequity in how such funds are distributed around the state and particularly to districts represented by Democrats. But civic groups have criticized both parties because the Democrats, who control the State Assembly, have dominated spending on local initiatives in that chamber. 
Every year, lawmakers set aside about $200 million in a pot of money known as the Community Projects Fund-007 -- $30 million for the governor and about $85 million each for the Assembly and Senate. The legislative leaders allocate that money to thousands of pet projects ranging from Little Leagues to civic associations to veterans groups at the request of lawmakers. More senior, loyal or politically endangered members receive larger allocations. 
 The projects, known as member items, were only selectively disclosed until a court challenge by The Times Union of Albany forced the Legislature to begin releasing detailed records in recent weeks. Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer has promised to require that each of the member items be described in the budget, as was once standard practice. 
 In the Senate, Mr. Bruno, as expected, led the pork pack, accounting for $5.7 million last year alone and $6.4 million over the last two years. Mr. Bruno and other senators, however, still have millions of dollars left to spend in the current fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2007.
 Mr. Bruno spread taxpayer dollars to all corners of his Albany-area district. He gave $250,000 to the Center for Economic Growth, a regional economic development organization on whose board Mr. Bruno sits. He gave $190,000 to Troy for a mechanical street sweeper and $5,000 to a local Elks Lodge to pay for a defibrillator and the training to use it. 
 He provided $100,000 to the New York State Theater Institute, which already receives more annual state operating aid than any other theater in New York State -- and whose office is named for Mr. Bruno. He sent financing to 10 Little League or baseball clubs, as well as seven softball, Pop Warner football and hockey teams, including $50,000 to provide lighting for several ball fields in Saratoga County. A post for Italian American war veterans received $32,000 for work on their kitchen. 
 He also contributed to well over a dozen firefighting squads, to charities that feed the poor, to legal aid societies and to groups that provide support for people with serious diseases, including multiple sclerosis. 
 Behind Mr. Bruno on the list of top Senate spenders was his friend and ally, Senator Owen H. Johnson of Long Island, who spent $6 million in member item dollars over the last two years, and whose largest single project was $219,000 to fix up an American Legion post in his district. 
 Senator Dean G. Skelos, another powerful Long Island Republican whom many see as Mr. Bruno's heir apparent, spent $5.1 million, the third most of any senator. 
 Over all, the Senate has spent roughly $150 million over the last two years on such projects, leaving it with about $20 million more to spend in the current fiscal year. 
 ''It's an awful, awful system,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''The process shouldn't be based on seniority and political power, it should be based on population size and need.''
 The revelations come as the state faces a multibillion-dollar deficit and taxes that many groups say are among the highest in the nation. Cash member items are also only one of several ways lawmakers funnel money to pet projects.
 John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Republicans, said both houses received equal amounts of money. ''Members of the majority do have a greater say than those of the minority in terms of the directions of those monies,'' he said. ''But all 212 legislators play a significant role in the $115 billion that goes out the door every year.'' He also said that the member item pool represented a small fraction of the overall budget. 
 One of Mr. Bruno's member items made public in recent weeks has come under scrutiny. He has steered $500,000 to Evident Technologies, a company whose former co-chairman, Jared Abbruzzese, is being investigated by the State Lobbying Commission for providing private flights to Mr. Bruno at no cost. Mr. Abbruzzese has also been a donor to Senate Republican Committee and is one of the backers of Empire Racing, which is bidding to take over the state's thoroughbred racing franchise, a decision Mr. Bruno will be instrumental in making. 
 Mr. Bruno's use of member item money to help Evident Technologies was reported by The Associated Press on Wednesday.
 Mr. McArdle said the Senate was encouraged to make the Evident investment by a top official at a nanotechnology center run by the State University of New York, ''as part of the effort to attract high tech, emerging companies.''
 Last week, Mr. Bruno joked about revelations that Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, was spending more than $7 million a year on member items. Mr. Silver's money, however, was sometimes directed to statewide programs instead of to his district, in what Mr. Silver's aides described as an attempt to offset budget cuts by Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Mr. Bruno did provide some support for programs outside his district, but to a lesser extent. 
 ''Yeah, I was surprised as heck, wow, Shelly, $7 million up there in his district,'' Mr. Bruno said last week. ''Do you realize how I've been shorted around here?''


CORRECTION-DATE: December 30, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 8 about the control wielded by Joseph L. Bruno, the New York Senate majority leader, and nine other Republican state senators over $150 million for pet projects referred incorrectly to the total number of state senators. There are 52 other senators besides Mr. Bruno and the nine Republicans -- not 62, which is the total number of senators.

HEADLINE: Is This Hospital Really Needed? Perhaps Not, But It Is Loved

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY, N.Y., Dec. 7 

 BODY:
It was just four years ago that the 50-bed Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry was code red, having defaulted on its federal mortgage for the second time. Residents of the neighboring river towns, as they are known, feared it would go under.
 But the hospital was saved when it was taken over by St. John's Riverside Hospital, a larger institution a 10-minute drive away in Yonkers. St. John's helped it to recruit top specialists and to turn a profit for the first time in years.
So when the state commission charged with right-sizing the hospital industry in New York recommended that Dobbs Ferry close, the staff and supporters felt they had been sideswiped.
 ''We're not dying -- we're a shining star,'' said Gregory M. Fisk, chairman of the hospital's board. ''We should be an example to the hospital industry in New York of how to turn around a financially distressed institution. To have this come out of left field is just mind-boggling.'' 
 Many residents in the area expressed similar sentiments. Hours after the commission presented its plan last week, calls began pouring in from those who saw the hospital as an intimate, efficient place to turn to in a health crisis.
 Elderly women who teetered into the lobby on canes offered to march in protest. A letter-writing campaign began.
 ''I had three kids, and I spent a lot of time in that emergency room for broken thumbs and football injuries,'' said Fran Rockwood, a real estate agent who lives in the neighboring village of Hastings-on-Hudson. ''It's terrific; a real local family hospital. I would be very sad to lose it.''
 But the Commission on Health Care Facilities in the 21st Century, appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki, considered the state as a whole, examining the haphazard geography of the hospital industry, as well as overlapping services. The Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry, the second-oldest hospital in Westchester County, was deemed expendable because of its proximity to St. John's, the county's oldest, as well as to Phelps Memorial Hospital Center in Sleepy Hollow and White Plains Hospital.
 The report noted that only about 30 of the Dobbs Ferry hospital's 50 certified beds were in operation in 2004, and only 20 of them were usually filled. Hospital officials say it is now 26. St. John's has 405 beds.
 Ensconced in a comfortable bedroom community, the Dobbs Ferry hospital provides little care to ''vulnerable populations,'' the report said; 5 percent of inpatients had Medicaid coverage in 2004. And the commission said the hospital made only a small contribution to the region's economy.
 ''Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry is a prime example of excess capacity, which the commission was charged to eliminate,'' the report stated. 
 For residents, the potential loss has also stirred anxieties related to class and race, with the artists, publicists, psychologists and financial consultants of the cozy villages of Irvington, Ardsley, Dobbs Ferry and Hastings wary of seeking care in Yonkers, the state's fourth-largest city, with its poorer and more racially mixed population. The board of the Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry is sprinkled generously with members of Ardsley Country Club, one of the most elite golf clubs in the area.
 The commission's report made only passing reference to those tensions, acknowledging that assertions had been made -- by whom it did not say -- that Dobbs Ferry surgeons would not transfer to St. John's ''because of physician and patient preference to avoid Yonkers.'' 
 ''A hospital should not remain open in order to serve the convenience of a small number of physicians,'' the report asserted. 
 Jim Foy, president and chief executive officer of Riverside Health Care System, which oversees both hospitals, said the uneasiness of residents having to go to Yonkers had more to do with the realities of a big-city emergency room.
 ''The doctors and nurses are just as good but the problem is volume,'' he said, referring to St. John's.
 ''You come into Dobbs Ferry and you'll be seen by a doctor in a half hour. We can't promise you that at St. John's.'' 
 Hospital officials and state legislators who represent the district have warned, too, that the closing of Dobbs Ferry could wind up jeopardizing the very institution that saved it. St. John's Riverside last year lost $2.5 million and is projecting a $6 million loss this year. The Community Hospital at Dobbs Ferry, by contrast, made $747,000 in profit last year and is expecting to make close to that in 2006.
 Mr. Foy pointed out that the hospital in Dobbs Ferry contributes $2 million a year to Riverside Health Care System's fixed overhead costs like laundry, food service and administration.
 ''Tomorrow Dobbs Ferry is closed, and I don't get rid of one refrigerator in my kitchen or one washing machine,'' he said. To make up the loss, he said, the hospital is already considering scrapping its school-based asthma program, as well as its sponsorship of a health clinic in southwest Yonkers, the poorest section of the city.
 The commission addressed that concern in the report, but dismissed it, saying that it was ''not persuaded that an unnecessary hospital should remain open simply to subsidize other hospitals.'' It also cast doubt on the long-term profitability of the Dobbs Ferry hospital, given that it lost money ''for 15 straight years.''
 Richard L. Brodsky, a state assemblyman whose district includes Dobbs Ferry, said the placement of the hospital on the hit list was an ''example of how the commission can get it wrong.'' The plan, which calls for closing or shrinking dozens of hospitals across the state, will become law unless the governor or the Legislature rejects it as a whole; lawmakers may not scratch individual hospitals from the list. 
 Like others, Mr. Brodksy is worried about the impact on St. John's. ''You have a small hospital whose profits are used to sustain a large urban hospital,'' he said. ''Over the next three or four years, if we're going to have to spend more money than we saved at Dobbs Ferry to keep St. John's going, then what's the virtue of the system?''
 One way that the hospital here was able to pull itself back from the brink of insolvency was the recruitment of Dr. Roy Ashikari, who earned his reputation as acting chief of breast service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. The Ashikari Breast Center has attracted patients from as far away as California and Japan. 
 In an interview at the hospital, Dr. Ashikari, who has held positions at Mount Sinai Hospital, Beth Israel Medical Center and Westchester Medical Center, said he came to Dobbs Ferry after growing tired of what he described as the impersonal, time-consuming care at large teaching hospitals.
 ''With breast cancer, you don't need big equipment,'' Dr. Ashikari said. ''What we need is the best patient care -- person to person, and that's what we have here. I can walk into the president's office any time I want to.'' Ronald J. Corti, the hospital's chief executive, confirmed that with a roll of his eyes, saying Dr. Ashikari had even come in to complain about the food served to patients.
 For longtime patients like Gerard Bochicchio, who raised six children in Irvington and now lives in Eastchester, the loss of the hospital transcends any bureaucratic calculations.
 Mr. Bochicchio, 73, credits the hospital with saving his life in August of 2005. That's when he stormed out of a hospital emergency room closer to his Eastchester home after a triage nurse there told him to take a seat. He was bleeding profusely from his rectum afterhe had two polyps removed and ignored his doctor's orders not to resume his blood-thinner medication.
 He got in his car and drove to the hospital in Dobbs Ferry, where, he said, he had taken his children many times for ''nicks and bruises and stitches.'' He said he was greeted by a doctor at the emergency-room entrance, ushered into an examination room, and had emergency surgery to cauterize the polyp sites. 
 ''I'll be beholden to Dobbs Ferry forever,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: City Debt Growing 

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN; Compiled by John Sullivan

 BODY:
Debt issued to finance the city's capital projects grew by 8.2 percent in the last fiscal year, according to an annual report City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. released yesterday. By July 1, the city had incurred $39.7 billion in general obligation debt, including contracts and liabilities, out of a limit of $53.3 billion, and its debt is expected to rise to $55 billion, out of a limit of $65.2 billion, by 2009. In the 2006 fiscal year, which ended on June 30, debt per capita was $6,801, up from $2,490 in the 1990 fiscal year, a growth rate that far outpaced the rate of inflation and the growth in city tax revenues. Although the city has strong bond ratings, it has a high debt level compared with other large American cities, Mr. Thompson said. SEWELL CHAN

HEADLINE: Long a Laggard, Wages Start to Outpace Prices 

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS and DAVID LEONHARDT; Thayer Evans contributed reporting from Houston.

 BODY:
After four years in which pay failed to keep pace with price increases, wages for most American workers have begun rising significantly faster than inflation.
 With energy prices now sharply lower than a few months ago and the improving job market forcing employers to offer higher raises, the buying power of American workers is now rising at the fastest rate since the economic boom of the late 1990s.
The average hourly wage for workers below management level -- everyone from school bus drivers to stockbrokers -- rose 2.8 percent from October 2005 to October of this year, after being adjusted for inflation, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Only a year ago, it was falling by 1.5 percent. 
 In recent years, many Americans grew anxious about the future and economists questioned whether the recovery from the 2001 recession would ever produce genuine gains for ordinary workers. 
 The fall in unemployment to 4.4 percent and the recent surge in wages, however, raise the prospect that the job market could be on the brink of another strong run, much like the one that lifted incomes in the late 1990s.
 ''The labor market is pretty tight right now, so it's not a huge surprise that we've started to see big wage gains,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist for the research firm Global Insight. ''I think the big surprise is that it took so long.''
 Still, there are a number of economic forces at work that raise doubts about whether the recent gains are the start of another boom. It is also possible, economists say, the improvement may turn out to be little more than a temporary spike.
 For now, though, with the number of unemployed Americans actively seeking work at a five-year low, help-wanted signs are proliferating again and many businesses are having a harder time finding employees.
 That means even lower-wage workers like Mercedes Herrera, an immigrant from Mexico who cleans at San Felipe Plaza, a high-rise office building in Houston, are enjoying more leverage with their employers. Last month, Ms. Herrera's union, the Service Employees International Union, settled a monthlong strike and secured raises of more than $2 an hour over the next two years for some 5,300 janitors in Houston. 
 The pay of Ms. Herrera, a 37-year-old mother of four, will increase to $6.25 an hour on Jan. 1, from $5.65 now. ''It's going to be a big difference in my personal finances,'' she said, speaking through a translator. With the extra money, she said, she hoped she would no longer have to ask for food from churches.
 ''We've always had to save for things that we have to buy,'' she said. ''We've had to create our own miracles in order to sustain ourselves.''
 After years of stagnant, even declining real wages for the typical worker, the recent jump has also delivered a rare bit of good news for a White House coping with an unpopular war and the aftermath of the Democratic victory in the midterm elections.
 The pay increases are ''huge, even relative to a period that we think of as quite good,'' said Edward P. Lazear, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. ''The question obviously will be, How long will it be sustained?''
 That question will begin to be answered today when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report. Forecasters expect the pay gains -- which began in earnest in September, when gas prices sank -- to extend into November.
 But the economy has slowed significantly in recent months, and some analysts predict the housing slump will cause a further slowdown next year that will be a drag on incomes. 
 ''The biggest issue is which direction the macroeconomy is headed,'' said Jason Furman, an economist at New York University who served as an adviser to President Bill Clinton. ''And there is probably a bit more uncertainty than usual about that.''
 If wages rise for only a few months, the current expansion, on the verge of entering its sixth year of growth, would still stand out as an unusually bad one for workers -- indeed, the only one since World War II without a sustained pay increase.
 In the third quarter, which included the early weeks of the recent pay increases, the share of the nation's economic output going to workers' pay and benefits fell to its lowest level in 40 years, according to the Commerce Department. 
 Further, the average hourly wage for a worker in a nonmanagerial position, $16.91 an hour in October, was about the same as it was in 2003 when inflation is taken into account.
 Some economists and incoming Congressional Democrats argue that economic trends like globalization and computerization have fundamentally altered the job market over the last decade or so. In this view, the solid pay increases of the late 1990s, stretching over multiple years, were caused by the technology bubble more than anything else and are unlikely to be repeated anytime soon.
 ''It's a good job market, but it's not the great job market it was back in the late '90s,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist with Moody's Economy.com. ''It was the tightest job market that, arguably, we've ever seen.''
 At the height of the 1990s boom, the job market became so hot that Burger King was offering $5,000 bonuses to lure managers away from rival restaurants. The unemployment rate hit a low of 3.8 percent in the spring of 2000. Optimism among workers soared, according to polls.
 In the exit polls conducted on Election Day last month, on the other hand, only 30 percent of voters said they expected life to improve for the next generation of Americans.
 For now, however, paychecks are growing fatter in nearly every corner of the economy. Average hourly earnings for workers outside management grew faster than inflation in every major sector but manufacturing from October 2005 to October 2006, according to Moody's Economy.com. For workers in leisure and hospitality, financial services and natural resources, for example, wages grew more than 4 percent, after accounting for inflation.
 After years of sharply rising income inequality, the recent rise in wages also appears to be increasing pay for both rich and poor. From July through September, the inflation-adjusted hourly pay of workers near the bottom of the wage scale -- those making less than 90 percent of all workers but more than the worst-off 10 percent -- rose 0.1 percent. 
 That compares with 0.4 percent wage growth for those close to the top, those making more than 9 out of 10 other workers, according to an analysis of Labor Department statistics by the Economic Policy Institute. Wage growth for both groups is likely to pick up in the final quarter of the year. 
 Last year, inflation-adjusted wages of workers at the 10th percentile fell 1.8 percent, compared with a gain of 0.3 percent at the 90th percentile.
 The most obvious cause of the recent turnaround is the fall in energy prices. Nominal wages have been accelerating since the beginning of 2004, but inflation, led by soaring gas prices, kept Americans from noticing any real rise in their pay during much of that time. Since the price of a gallon of regular gasoline peaked for the year at $3.03 in early August, prices at the pump have steadily declined. The national average is now down to about $2.29 a gallon.
 That has taken a tremendous weight off wages, which finally started to outpace inflation in August. Inflation ran at a rate of 1.3 percent from October 2005 to October of this year, the lowest level since mid-2002. Earlier this year, inflation was running as high as 4.3 percent. 
 Wages have risen so swiftly that some economists worry that they could push inflation up on their own, by forcing companies to raise prices. Last week, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned that the central bank might have to raise interest rates again. ''One factor that we are watching carefully is labor costs,'' he said.
 The implications for higher inflation aside, Mr. Lazear, the White House economist, said he believed -- and hoped -- the trend would continue. ''It's not unreasonable to think that real wage growth will be sustained for a significant period of time simply because the labor market is so tight,'' he said.
 Workers -- many having cut their savings and taken on more debt as wages failed to keep pace with inflation -- would welcome that.
 Alanzo Brown, who handles hazardous materials for a chemical company in Houston and recently completed a course that qualifies him for a raise, is expecting his pay to rise $4 an hour soon, to $19. At 29, Mr. Brown hopes to start saving more money so he can move from a rented apartment into his own home. 
 ''I'm really trying to get into this saving thing,'' Mr. Brown said.

HEADLINE: National Briefing South: Louisiana: Grants For Small Businesses 

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

 BODY:
Responding to fears that hundreds of small businesses may disappear in the economic backwash from last year's hurricanes, Louisiana announced a $100 million grant program for companies with up to 25 employees. The plan, which will be financed by reallocating economic development money, requires approval by the state legislature and the federal government. Small shops and local manufacturers have received little help from government programs, which have focused on housing. ''It's a beginning -- we're finally being listened to,'' said Laura Y. Drumm, president of Second Wind, a small-business group that has been pushing for a grant program. LESLIE EATON

HEADLINE: World Bank Study Faults Its Work in Rural Africa 

BYLINE: By CELIA W. DUGGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The World Bank, the premier financier of antipoverty programs in developing countries, has too often failed to tackle effectively the deprivation in the African countryside, home to most of the continent's poor people, the bank's internal evaluation office said in a report released Thursday. 
 The bank's strategy in Senegal, for example, favors cities, while in Malawi the bank neglects efforts to help the rural poor improve productivity on and off the farm, the report says.
The evaluation team found that in about half the 48 countries it studied across the developing world, the bank's aid to rural areas produced disappointing results.
 The bank's managers, in a written response in the report, said they shared the team's concerns and had strengthened the focus on rural poverty and increased lending for rural development in recent years.
 The evaluation team's critique was part of a broad assessment of the bank's performance that concluded that it tended to spread itself too thin, underestimate resistance to its efforts to combat corruption and patronage, and pay too little attention to ensuring that economic growth improved the lot of the poor.
 The Independent Evaluation Group, which produced the report, answers to the bank's board, not to its president, Paul D. Wolfowitz, or its management.
 The report, its annual review, laid out arresting examples of the bank's shortcomings. As the bank has sought to increase access to education in poor countries, the report says, it has paid too little attention to learning outcomes. In Uganda, for example, attendance has soared since the country made primary education free in 1996. But now, 94 children are in each classroom and three students share each textbook.
 Vikram Nehru, speaking for the bank's management, replied that the bank had tried to reach both goals. ''We ourselves are not satisfied with the improvements in quality, not that we haven't tried,'' he said.
 Education has been a priority for Mr. Wolfowitz, the Bush administration's choice to lead the bank, but he is even more identified with fighting corruption in the developing world.
 The evaluation team found that though the bank had encouraged countries to adopt anticorruption laws and had helped finance agencies to carry them out, the agencies often had little enforcement capability. Similarly, the bank has financed efforts to professionalize the civil service in countries where the political will to follow through is lacking. 
 The bank's management said it agreed with much of the analysis of its record on civil service reform and anticorruption measures. The bank is now more focused on improving the management of particular public services, Mr. Nehru said. It is also trying to stir public demand for better government by working with private groups and research organizations in developing countries.

HEADLINE: Uneasy Exiles Await Those Who Flee the Chaos in Iraq

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Suha Maayeh contributed reporting from Amman, and Rasha Elass from Damascus, Syria.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Dec. 6 

 BODY:
Every day at dusk as the streets of this brooding city empty, people like Halima Reyahi scramble to become invisible again. 
 She sticks to side streets, her eyes scanning for the increasingly frequent police dragnets and checkpoints set up in search of illegal Iraqi immigrants like her. The loneliness of her exile is magnified by the fact that all four of her sons have been turned away repeatedly at the Jordanian border.
Ms. Reyahi is one of nearly two million Iraqis who have fled the vicious chaos of their country since the American invasion nearly four years ago, flooding neighboring states, especially Jordan and Syria, but also Lebanon and Egypt. 
 As they leave Iraq at a rate of nearly 3,000 a day, , the refugees are threatening the social and economic fabric of both Jordan and Syria. In Jordan, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis are trying to blend into a country of only 6 million inhabitants, including about 1.5 million registered Palestinian refugees. The governments classify most of the Iraqis as visitors, not refugees. 
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated in a report released last month that more than 1.6 million Iraqis have left since March 2003, nearly 7 percent of the population. Jordanian security officials say more than 750,000 are in and around Amman, a city of 2.5 million. Syrian officials estimate that up to a million have gone to the suburbs of Damascus, a city of three million. An additional 150,000 have landed in Cairo. Every month, 100,000 more join them in Syria and Jordan, the report said.
 In a report released this week, Refugees International, a Washington-based advocacy group, put the total at close to two million and called their flight ''the fastest-growing humanitarian crisis in the world.'' Its president, Kenneth Bacon, said, ''The United States and its allies sparked the current chaos in Iraq, but they are doing little to ease the humanitarian crisis caused by the current exodus.'' 
 Every night, hulking orange and white GMC Suburbans and sedans pull into the taxi garage in downtown Amman stuffed with Iraqis and their belongings, adding to the growing social problems they pose while fueling growing fears that Iraq's sectarian tensions will spill over here.
 As Iraq seems to disintegrate into warring factions of Sunnis, Shiites and Kurds, the risk that their dispute will be transferred here and increase local social problems is frightening the authorities. As a result, restrictions on Iraqis have been tightened in Egypt, Syria and Jordan, which has been increasing patrols seeking to evict those who have overstayed their visas.
 Most of the emigres bring tales of horror and sadness. Ali Ghani, a onetime champion Iraqi body builder, said that his father had been grabbed from their house in Iraq, apparently because he was a Shiite; his body was later found in the street. Several other friends have met a similar fate, he said.
 Partly as a result of such strife, refugees here claim, there is a growing sectarian dimension to the official crackdown. They say the authorities of this officially Sunni country have paid more attention to deporting Iraqi Shiites, fearing that their militias are trying to organize here.
 ''There is only disrespect for us now,'' said Qais Attiyeh, 36, a Shiite sculptor who says he has been granted refugee status in Amman. ''And now I increasingly find Jordanians who ask me, 'Are you a Shiite or a Muslim?' '' he said, referring to extremist Sunnis' rejection of Shiism as a branch of Islam. 
 ''I read their facial expressions and tell them what they like to hear,'' he said. 
 Faris Braizat, a researcher at the Center for Strategic Studies at Jordan University, said, ''It's becoming clear that with these kinds of numbers we are creating a massive problem further down the road.'' Jordanians, once proud of their Iraqi neighbors, have become unwilling to continue sacrificing for them, he said. 
 The first wave of Iraqis, mostly doctors, intellectuals and teachers, came here after the Persian Gulf war in 1991, escaping Saddam Hussein's Iraq. After the American invasion of 2003, a similarly wealthy wave of former government figures, businessmen and investors came here with billions of dollars that they soon began investing in real estate and businesses. Their arrival drove up prices but was also credited with helping the economy. As their numbers grew and much poorer people started to arrive, however, the problems began. 
 In particular, when Iraqi suicide bombers attacked three Amman hotels in 2005, this country's attitude toward Iraqis changed abruptly. The attack was organized by Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which was led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian. Jordanian officials stepped up immigration enforcement, turning away many Iraqis at the border and making it harder for Iraqis to renew their visas. 
 It remains the case that those able to deposit $150,000 in Amman banks are granted residency almost instantly here. A few have also been sponsored by employers or have married Jordanian women. But the vast majority, poor and with few options, enter on visitor visas and soon become illegal, opening them up to exploitation and abuse. 
 Human Rights Watch called on the Jordanian government last week to grant Iraqis temporary protection and legalize their status. The group also called on the Jordanians to halt the deportation of Iraqis who registered for temporary protection and to admit asylum seekers, in addition to exempting Iraqis who registered their status from having to pay stiff fines. 
 Iraqis are increasingly blamed for Jordan's ills. Those with cash are blamed for doubling, and even tripling, property prices, as well as for buoying prices on everything from tomatoes to cigarettes. (Less attention has been paid to the broader market forces that led to the rise.) 
 The average price of a three-bedroom apartment in upscale West Amman has risen to up to $150,000 from about $50,000. Apartments that once rented for $400 now rent for $1,200, pricing out the average Jordanian, who earns between $500 and $750 per month. 
 Khaled Saeed, who owns a DVD shop in downtown Amman, was saving for years to buy an apartment near Amman's Sports City complex. He had his eye on one building where, just a few years ago, apartments sold for the equivalent of $35,000. 
 Then the Iraqis came, he said.
 ''When I finally came to buy it after some time, I found that the price had risen to 45,000 dinars,'' he said, amounting to almost $65,000. ''So I've changed my mind about the Iraqis. Now I just wish they would leave so that life would go back to normal.''
 Late this summer the government loosened restrictions on private education for Iraqis without residency here, flooding Jordanian schools with new students. Principals have found themselves in the awkward position of telling families they have to go elsewhere. 
 Inflation, too, has doubled to 6 percent from about 3.5 percent in 2005, fueled in part by reduced subsidies on oil and gasoline, and by growing demand from Iraqis, economists say. 
 Many refugees say the crackdown has focused attention on Shiites, even as the government has hunted down Al Qaeda. Even before this, Shiite prayer halls, known as Husseiniyas, were strictly banned here. Security officials have been wary of Shiites seeking to organize and preach Shiite teachings. A prominent sheik representing Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani of Iraq was deported late this summer. 
 In the Jordanian town of Muta, the site of a historic battle between Muslim and Byzantine armies,the shrine of the Shiite saint Jaffar al-Tayyar, a pilgrimage site, has come under particularly close scrutiny lately. Last week, security men crawled around the site, keeping an eye on the comings and goings of visitors. 
 Shiite pilgrims have been banned from sleeping overnight at the site and are now allowed to stay only briefly, a shop owner at the shrine said. Where thousands once came, the number of visitors has dropped markedly, he said, for fear of the security men, and his sales have plummeted. 
 Security men at the site said they were concerned about attacks against Shiites there, rather than trouble from the Shiites themselves.
 Still many Shiites say they are increasingly bearing the brunt of the growing frustration with the Iraqis here.
 ''When you say 'deported,' people typically think 'Shia' now,'' one former Jordanian official said. ''They are afraid that they will connect with the groups in Iraq.''
 Security officials say they have sought to weed out both Sunnis and Shiites who intend to cause trouble in Iraq, and do not differentiate between the sects. ''We don't have a problem with someone trying to advance his Shiite faith,'' the security official said. ''But we do have a problem with someone proselytizing and being political.'' 
 The Iraqi exodus has sent ripples through Syria, too, where the government has maintained an open-door policy for Iraqis, attracting mainly poor Iraqis who have flocked to neighborhoods like Sayeda Zeynab, the site of a Shiite shrine, creating little ghettos. 
 There, too, rents have risen, more than doubling in poorer areas like Jaramana, a suburb of Damascus. Some officials have begun warning of impending electricity and water shortages in Syria because of the influx of Iraqis. The price of heating oil and gasoline is expected to rise along with the increased demand.

HEADLINE: Homebuilders, and Worries Over Jobs, Lead a Decline

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News

 BODY:
Stocks fell yesterday for a second day on anticipation that this week's jobs report would show worsening unemployment. Homebuilders led the decline.
 Toll Brothers and the Ryland Group dropped the most in almost two months after the Credit Suisse Group downgraded the housing industry. Home Depot had a big loss and said that 19 years of stock-options backdating caused it to underreport expenses by $200 million.
''A worse-than-expected unemployment report would fuel fears that the economic slowdown is worse than expected,'' said Frederic Dickson, chief market strategist at D. A. Davidson & Company, which manages $17 billion in Great Falls, Mont. ''That's causing some of the investor apprehension we've seen.'' 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished down 5.61 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,407.29, extending its decline from a six-year high two days ago. The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 30.84 points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,278.41.
 Apple Computer had its biggest tumble in four months, weighing on the Nasdaq composite index. The Nasdaq lost 18.17 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,427.69.
 An increase in oil prices also weighed on share prices. Crude futures rose 0.5 percent, to $62.49 a barrel, on falling United States inventories and speculation that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would cut output.
 The Labor Department is expected to say today that the jobless rate edged up to 4.5 percent last month from a five-year low of 4.4 percent, according to the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Employers probably hired 100,000 more workers, according to the survey.
 ''I wouldn't be surprised if the unemployment rate is worse than expected,'' said Tim Hartzell, who manages $2 billion as chief investment officer at the Kanaly Trust Company in Houston. ''Investors are taking money off the table.''
 Earlier yesterday, the government said that initial jobless claims fell to 324,000 last week. Economists expected a drop to 325,000.
 D. R. Horton, the homebuilder, slipped 32 cents, to $27.21. Toll, the luxury homebuilder, decreased $1.17, to $31.84. The Ryland Group fell $2.04, to $54.44.
 Home Depot slid 99 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $38.93. The company said it failed to record $200 million of expenses over 19 years as it ''routinely'' changed dates of stock-option grants. A five-month internal investigation found no evidence of ''intentional wrongdoing'' by managers or the board, it said.
 Apple slumped $2.79, or 3 percent, to $87.04. The company's iPhone, a device combining its iPod music player with a mobile phone, may be delayed to as late as the second quarter of 2007, CIBC World Markets analysts wrote.
 The Interpublic Group of Companies fell 79 cents, or 6.4 percent, to $11.54 for the worst performance in the S.& P. 500. Wal-Mart Stores dropped the Draft FCB unit of Interpublic as its new advertising agency. The decision ''is the result of new information we have obtained over the past few weeks,'' a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, Mona Williams, said.
 Corning, a maker of liquid-crystal display glass, fell 84 cents, to $21.05. Its chief financial officer, James Flaws, said the company had seen some reduction in glass orders.
 Eli Lilly & Company, the drug maker, lost 87 cents, to $53.99. Its 2007 earnings forecast trailed analysts' estimates because its planned purchase of the Icos Corporation will reduce profit more than some analysts expected. Lilly expects net income of as much as $3.35 a share next year. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated profit of $3.38, excluding acquisition and plant-closing costs.
 In the bond market, the 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 1014/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.48 percent from 4.49 percent.

HEADLINE: Happy Birthday. Vacate Your Office.

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and KAREN DONOVAN

 BODY:
As November drew near, A. Paul Victor, who spent decades at the law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges defending corporate clients, kept a close eye on the calendar.
 For Mr. Victor, the dreaded date, Nov. 6, was his 68th birthday -- the mandatory retirement age at the law firm.
The problem was Mr. Victor was not ready to turn in his BlackBerry and give up meetings with clients around the globe for a regular golf date. So, saying his goodbyes after 38 years as a partner at Weil Gotshal, Mr. Victor moved a few blocks south -- to the Midtown Manhattan offices of the rival firm Dewey Ballantine, where he was named a partner in its antitrust group.
 ''I don't think that Weil Gotshal was overly thrilled that a partner who had been with them as long as I have went off to another place, but they understand it,'' said Mr. Victor, casually dressed in a light blue sweater as he sat in his new office at Dewey, piled high with yet-to-be-unpacked cardboard boxes. ''Ultimately, it was their decision.'' 
 It is a decision that a growing number of large white-shoe law firms are grappling with as aging, yet healthy, baby boomer lawyers look to remain vital and integral rainmakers at the firms where they built their careers.
 Those desires, however, are bumping up against the harsh new realities and economics that rule inside the clubby walls of many law firms.
 In the past, a gray-haired semiretired partner could remain in his hard-earned corner suite, playing the role of a mentor or adviser to younger lawyers. Yet as law firms adopt a more corporatelike structure that emphasizes revenue and profits per partner, those options are becoming more limited.
 That corner office and, more important, the chunk of the firm's annual profit pool, is being designated to hungry up-and-coming lawyers and associates rather than the legal eagles who once ruled the roost.
 Unlike corporate America, which, for the most part, dropped mandatory retirement ages decades ago, many big law firm partnerships are keeping up the practice of pushing out older lawyers to make room for new blood.
 In a survey last year of 46 law firms with 100 or more lawyers, about 57 percent of them reported a mandatory retirement age, ranging from 65 to 72, according to a survey conducted by Altman Weil, a management consulting firm for law firms in Newtown Square, Pa. 
 Anecdotally, mandatory retirement ages seem to be skewing younger at a time when good health and longer life expectancy are increasing. For instance, mandatory retirement at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett is 65, but retirement benefits are capped at 62 and few partners stick around after that.
 ''There needs to be a re-evaluation of retirement issues in the legal community -- 65 isn't old anymore,'' said Leslie D. Corwin, a lawyer with Greenberg Traurig, who has represented law and accounting firms in disputes, mergers and liquidations. Greenberg Traurig has no retirement policy in place.
 A particularly brutal battle over the issue of aging lawyers is being fought in federal court in Chicago, where the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a lawsuit accusing Sidley Austin of age discrimination.
 Lawyers are closely watching the Sidley case because it could ultimately lead to the restructuring of law firm partnerships; partners are not protected by the antidiscrimination laws because they are considered owners rather than employees.
 The lawsuit was filed nearly two years ago on behalf of 32 older partners who the commission contends were discriminated against in 1999, when they were suddenly demoted or forced to retire.
 ''Our view is that the reason the lawyers were expelled is because of their age, and that's a violation of federal law,'' says John C. Hendrickson, the regional lawyer for the E.E.O.C. in Chicago. ''I think as the legal profession has become more like a business, the younger people who are coming up are more anxious to get a bigger piece of the pie and the way to do that is to get rid of the elders.''
 The legal tussle, which appears to be headed to trial, is getting ugly. Last month, the commission filed a protective order to block attempts by Sidley to uncover the subsequent job performance of the former partners, hoping to bolster its claims that they were demoted because of performance, rather than age. Sidley contends the firm did not have a mandatory retirement policy.
 While many bar associations around the country are trying to steer lawyers facing mandatory retirement policies to pro bono work, other associations are trying to change the mind-set behind the policies themselves.
 Mark H. Alcott, president of the New York State Bar Association, has created a committee that has started to approach law firms about their policies.
 ''I'm calling on the profession to recognize that forced retirement of partners is archaic, it's not necessary, and I'm trying to change the culture rather than impose liability and legal solutions on law firms,'' said Mr. Alcott, a litigation partner at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. 
 A Paul Weiss spokeswoman said the firm had mandatory retirement at 70.
 When Mr. Victor joined the ranks of lawyers at Weil Gotshal in 1968, he remembers it was a time of change for the firm and the industry. ''It was kind of the breakdown of the old-boy network and opportunities arose,'' he recalled. ''Things broke down and everything opened up and it was fair game for virtually anybody with talent and skill and some luck to attract clients.''
 One of his first and biggest cases involved defending the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company of Japan, which owns Panasonic, against United States television manufacturers that accused the company of dumping television sets into the United States market and hurting their business.
 ''The Matsushita stuff really became a career for a while,'' he said. Eventually the case went to the Supreme Court, where it set a precedent cited today for summary judgments in lawsuits.
 A little more than a year ago, Mr. Victor broached the subject of his retirement at a retreat for the Weil Gotshal antitrust group at a resort outside Miami. ''Basically I gave them a proposal that indicated I wanted to continue what I'm doing for at least two more years,'' Mr. Victor said. ''And then I wanted to continue doing something perhaps other than what I'm doing for another two years. Some kind of reduced role, but I really didn't know what that meant.'' 
 Mr. Victor said that in June and July he spoke with nearly every member of the firm's management committee about staying on after he reached retirement age. In early August, while Mr. Victor was traveling in California, he got in touch with someone on the management committee who said the firm decided not to allow any exceptions to its retirement policy.
 ''To be a healthy institution, you have to encourage people to hand off business to the younger generation,'' said Richard J. Davis, a partner and Weil Gotshal's general counsel, who volunteered that he is now 60.
 Over the next 10 years, the firm expects to face this question with a lot of partners. ''You can always make some exceptions; I think it's fair to say those should be relatively rare.''
 Mr. Victor, however, had other options. He was being courted by people from four other law firms, including Jeffrey L. Kessler, an antitrust lawyer with Dewey Ballantine who had left Weil Gotshal a few years ago. (Mr. Victor declined to identify the other firms.)
 ''We take a flexible view with someone who has the willingness to continue to practice at a high level,'' Mr. Kessler said. He added that most of Mr. Victor's clients appear to be following him in the move.
 Dewey has no mandatory retirement age. (The firm has a ''presumption'' that the retirement age is 65, but management reviews each case, Mr. Kessler said.)
 Yet Dewey is also no stranger to claims of age discrimination.
 The firm is facing a lawsuit filed by a former partner, Joseph K. Dowley, who was one of 15 partners terminated in 2003. Mr. Dowley's suit contends that 11 of those 15 partners were 50 or older, and age discrimination is among the allegations. In April, a federal district judge in Washington dismissed the claims, finding they were subject to an arbitration agreement. Mr. Dowley has appealed, and his lawyer declined to comment.
 Mr. Kessler also declined to comment.
 For now, many law firms are saying goodbye to productive partners, holding the line on mandatory retirement.
 Mr. Davis of Weil Gotshal said the firm ''will do well in maintaining the client relationships Paul had.'' He added that Weil's policy allows retired partners like Mr. Victor to practice elsewhere in competition with the firm, while keeping all of their retirement benefits. Some firms tie retirement benefits to noncompete clauses.
 Enforcing mandatory retirement ''inherently has some risk,'' he said, ''but on an overall basis, we think it's the right approach.''

HEADLINE: With an Eye on Inflation, Europe Raises Rate Again

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point on Thursday, its sixth such move in a year, and signaled more increases were likely next year as it sought to head off higher inflation.
 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, acknowledged that the economy of the 12-country euro zone could be hurt again by higher energy prices. But he struck a sanguine note about growth, saying it would be steady into 2007 thanks to strong global expansion, renewed business investment and a pickup in household spending.
After a year in which the bank carefully telegraphed its plans well in advance, including the increase on Thursday, Mr. Trichet refused to specify precisely when the bank might move next. But with a stern warning that it will act ''in a firm and timely manner,'' he left little doubt that the bank thought that higher rates would be needed to squelch inflation. 
 ''We are there to ensure price stability,'' he said. ''It is as simple as that. There is no ambiguity.''
 The bank's move put its key rate at 3.5 percent. The Bank of England, also meeting on Thursday, left its benchmark rate unchanged at 5 percent.
 Mr. Trichet hinted that higher rates were likely next year once Europe weathered the shock of a sharply higher value-added tax in Germany.
 When the German tax increases to 19 percent from 16 percent on Jan. 1, its largest one-time increase ever, Mr. Trichet said the central bank would take time to digest economic data early in the year to assess its effect on growth.
 ''What is unclear is exactly the impact that it will have,'' he said. 
 Still, Mr. Trichet's mix of signals tilted decisively toward worries that inflation could rise if previous oil price increases make energy-related products more expensive, or if companies pass on wage increases to consumers. 
 Soon after Mr. Trichet spoke, Axel A. Weber, the president of the Bundesbank, chimed in with an even more explicit call for higher rates next year.
 ''Financing conditions are favorable, more favorable than they need to be in my opinion in the long term, to be compatible with inflation-neutral growth,'' said Mr. Weber, who is a member of the central bank's 18-member rate-setting body.
 Currency markets have driven down the value of the dollar against the euro in recent weeks as it became apparent that the central bank was likely to push up rates next year. Rising rates increase the appeal of assets denominated in euros. The dollar has also weakened in the face of evidence that a housing slowdown in the United States could spill over into the rest of the economy and force the Federal Reserve to ease its own monetary policy. But Mr. Trichet endorsed the view of the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who expects a cooling but still-expanding economy in the United States next year.
 ''A smooth slowing down is what we are observing and very likely what we will continue to observe,'' Mr. Trichet said.
 He also served notice that the central bank might not offer as much guidance on future intentions as it did this year.
 The bank vowed in its statement to ''monitor very closely'' all risks of inflation, a formulation that has previously suggested a rate increase two months later. But Mr. Trichet explicitly rejected the notion that the bank had February in mind, saying it could ''act at any time.''
 The change may also reflect the fact that after a year of rate increases, the central bank is nearing the neutral rate of interest -- one that neither promotes nor hampers growth -- and it needs to preserve its flexibility to slow or even halt its tightening cycle as the outlook for inflation changes.

HEADLINE: Watergate Reform, R.I.P.

 BODY:
The table stakes for the next presidential campaign are now estimated by the reigning consultant-croupiers of politics at $100 million for openers. That sad fact suggests that the 2008 contest will likely go down in history for seeing to the effective demise of one of the most encouraging post-Watergate reforms, the creative use of public financing as an alternative to big-money donors. 
 Public financing had worked well for decades, inviting fresh arrays of candidates. But it was left half-dead in 2004 when President Bush and Senator John Kerry declined the $44 million subsidy for the presidential primaries. This freed them to raise more than $200 million each in private, unlimited money. They did opt for public subsidies in the general election, accepting $74 million each as the spending limit. But that formula is expected to be extinct in 2008 as the finalists wage a far more expensive campaign -- one that could hit $1 billion.
The breakdown of the public system need not have happened if Congress had acted to update the formula to keep pace with campaign inflation. Larger spending limits and subsidies are needed, along with a more generous checkoff donation than the current $3 per taxpayer. 
 A strong repair bill is in the works, along with proposals to re-educate taxpayers about the sleaze-free bargain of public financing. The bill is too late for the '08 campaign, but the new Democratic majority in Congress has a good opportunity to rescue the formula for 2012. Otherwise the nation will slip back toward the Watergate era's politics for sale.

HEADLINE: With Foe's Change of Heart, Iraq Watchdog Is Likely to Survive

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ; David Rohde contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
A bill that would extend the life of the federal agency that oversees billions of dollars of reconstruction money in Iraq appeared headed to passage after a key House Republican dropped his opposition on Thursday and declared that he would vote for the bill.
 The agency was praised Wednesday by the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, which recommended that the oversight agency ''should be renewed for the duration of assistance programs in Iraq.'' 
 Some degree of American financial assistance is likely to flow to Iraq for as long as American troops are stationed there. But that kind of extension for the agency, the Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, had been opposed by Duncan Hunter, the California Republican who recently declared himself a likely candidate for president in 2008.
 In October, members of Mr. Duncan's staff inserted an obscure provision into a huge defense authorization bill that would force the inspector general's office to begin shutting down almost immediately. Because the office, led by a Republican lawyer, Stuart W. Bowen Jr., has repeatedly uncovered instances of wasted money, shoddy construction and criminal fraud in the rebuilding program, the move caused an outcry among Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.
 A bill to reverse the termination, introduced by Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, with several Democratic and Republican co-sponsors was passed in the Senate on Wednesday. But an identical bill introduced in the House by Representative Ike Skelton, Democrat of Missouri, appeared to have little chance when the majority leadership made no move to bring it to a floor for a vote.
 Suspicion fell on Mr. Hunter, but as the day wore on Mr. Skelton said that in a reversal, the erstwhile opponent of an extension was in fact helping shepherd the bill through the House. Late Thursday, a staff member for the House majority leader, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, said that the bill would definitely move to the floor for a vote on Friday and that it was likely to pass.
 Mr. Hunter said through a spokesman that he would vote for the bill. Although Mr. Hunter did not explain his change of heart, it came after Robert M. Gates, the next defense secretary, expressed strong support for the office during his confirmation hearings on Wednesday, the praise by the Iraq Study Group and a weeks of outpouring of indignation over the termination by politicians and editorial pages across the country.
 ''This is a case where I'm pleased that Congress was able to act so quickly to rectify what could have been a major problem,'' Ms. Collins said in an interview, adding that she believed that the measure would pass easily. 
 A White House spokesman said that he would not comment on whether the president would sign the bill until the measure had passed the House. 
 But Mr. Skelton, who earlier in the day had expressed exasperation that his bill could expire without a vote, sounded elated. ''I am greatly pleased that the Republican leadership of the House finally recognized the value of this legislation and agreed to bring it to the floor,'' he said in a statement.
 Mr. Bowen's office had little comment on the bill over than to say that they would abide by the decisions of Congress. But the battle over the special inspector general did not go unnoticed in Iraq, where Mr. Bowen's work is well known.
 Barham Salih, a deputy Iraqi prime minister whose portfolio includes economic issues, said in an interview that Mr. Bowen's office was important in helping Iraq overcome ''the scourge of corruption.''
 ''It's not just an economic issue, it's a security issue,'' said Mr. Salih, explaining that in Iraq, graft often benefits groups that are trying to undermine the government. ''What we have in Iraq today is a political economy that feeds the insurgents.''

HEADLINE: China Trip By Paulson Lifts Stakes

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 

 BODY:
As Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. prepares for his passage to China with six Cabinet members and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, pressure is mounting on him to produce results or face a wave of protectionist measures in the new Congress next year.
 Mr. Paulson conferred this week with business leaders urging him to bring about changes in China's economic practices, particularly its regulated economy, manipulation of currency levels to spur exports and its failure to crack down on piracy of software, pharmaceuticals and other items. 
At the same time, Mr. Paulson 's aides were also conferring with Chinese representatives preparing for his Dec. 13-15 trip. Both sides cautioned not to expect breakthroughs on the big issues, in part because the Chinese cannot be seen as kowtowing to American pressure.
 American officials now say they hope that there will be some actions to be announced in Beijing aimed at imparting the sense that the ''strategic economic dialogue'' begun in September is not just an academic exercise.
 A Chinese official involved in the preparations said there would probably be a package of ''deliverables,'' which is Washington jargon for announcements at big diplomatic meetings to show that something has been accomplished.
 Leaders of Congress say that the pressure on Mr. Paulson to achieve something is acute, and that it is coming from both Democrats and Republicans.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who is to serve as Speaker of the House next year, has already signaled a tougher line on China, raising the stakes for the Treasury chief.
 ''Many of us in the Congress will be watching closely for tangible results from Secretary Paulson's trip,'' Ms. Pelosi said through a spokesman, asserting that the administration's policies on China have generally been ineffective across the board. 
 Ms. Pelosi has had a long record of criticizing China. In 1991, she and two colleagues slipped away from handlers during a Congressional tour and placed flowers at Tiananmen Square, where demonstrators had been routed two years before. Chinese guards briefly detained television crews filming the event.
 The potential for disrupting the ''dialogue'' with China could come as early as Monday, when the Bush administration plans to report that China has not lived up to commitments it made when it joined the World Trade Organization five years ago.
 The report, to be submitted by Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative, was not timed for the Paulson trip. Rather, it was required by Congress when China joined the trade organization. But the report could unsettle the atmosphere of the trip, some officials say they fear.
 The United States has charged that China engages in illegal subsidies of goods like steel and auto parts, in violation of its trade commitments, and has failed to prosecute cases of counterfeit or pirated models of designer accessories, DVD's and CD's, pharmaceuticals, airplane parts and automobile parts.
 The Treasury chief, accompanying an unusual delegation that will include cabinet members and Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, plans to discuss a range of issues in the hope of moving China to change over time and persuading lawmakers to be patient.
 This approach has won praise from many veterans of negotiations with China, who note that free market advocates in China are in constant battles with advocates of continued state control and that consensus is not easily achieved.
 ''It is not as if the prime minister of China can push a button,'' Pascal Lamy, director general of the World Trade Organization, said in a recent interview. ''There are constituencies and vested interests. You can't deal with the Chinese by banging on the table, going to the balcony and saying, 'This is what I want.' ''
 There is a lively debate in Washington over whether pressure from Congress helps or hurts. Many lawmakers say that, though Mr. Paulson publicly opposes the protectionist measures discussed on Capitol Hill, he uses the threat of these measures to get China to act.
 This fall, Mr. Paulson persuaded Senators Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, and Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, to pull back their bill threatening tariffs on Chinese goods if China does not let its currency fluctuate.
 But Mr. Schumer and Mr. Graham now plan to draft a new bill to force the issue with China and work with Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who will be chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican who is the departing chairman. 
 The Chinese, for their part, openly hope that Mr. Paulson's engagement will enable him to persuade lawmakers how much China has accomplished and the constraints that prevent further action, thereby tamping down protectionist fever among lawmakers.
 ''We understand the political complexities of the United States,'' said the Chinese official, who spoke anonymously under Chinese government ground rules. ''But when it comes to political issues,'' the official said, referring to protectionist sentiment in Congress, ''we hope the politicians will listen to the experts.'' 
 John M. Engler, the former governor of Michigan who is now president of the National Association of Manufacturers, was one of the business leaders who met with Mr. Paulson this week. ''I'm not sure rabbits will spew forth from any hats,'' he said. 
 ''But there's little doubt that this engagement will be comprehensive,'' he added. ''There nothing to compare it to. It's not just two top officials. It's a very broad exchange of ideas with a coordinated agenda. I think Paulson has a pretty good idea of what he needs to accomplish on this.''
 American businesses argue that if China changes its currency policies, it will make Chinese goods more expensive in the United States. This would result in higher prices for toys, games, apparel, audio and video equipment and communications equipment made in China, possibly helping these goods made at home.
 On the other hand, the United States hopes to sell more planes and aerospace products, semiconductors, electronic components, plastics and farm products to China if the price of these goods is lowered because of currency changes. Lawmakers from districts where these goods come from are in the forefront of lobbying for the changes.

HEADLINE: The Year of the Dividend 

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
ONE reason Wall Street is poised to turn in a solid performance in 2006 -- the Standard & Poor's 500 is up nearly 13 percent this year as of yesterday -- may surprise you.
 ''Three years after a tax cut that was supposed to light a fire under the category, dividend-paying stocks are finally taking off,'' Megan Barnett writes in SmartMoney. ''Through September, the top 100 dividend payers in the Standard & Poor's 500 had returned 14 percent to investors, handily outperforming stocks with no yields, which had logged 5 percent returns.''
There are both positive and negative factors driving the surge. 
 The tax cut, which caps the federal government's share of dividend payments at 15 percent, is apparently finally taking hold and, according to Ms. Barnett, ''as baby boomers age, they covet the steady income of dividends.''
 On the negative side, unrest in the Middle East, falling real estate prices and high gas prices make owning stocks that pay dividends more appealing.
 History, too, is on the investor's side, Ms. Barnett writes: ''Since 1926, 40 percent of the total return in the S.& P. 500 has come from reinvested dividends.'' 
 The magazine set out to find stocks that were paying a dividend greater than the 4.8 percent yield on a 10-year Treasury bond, and then screened for companies with a market value of more than $1 billion, a history of increasing their dividends and an estimated earnings growth of at least 5 percent and ''we were also careful to eliminate distressed firms whose yield has gone up only because the stock has tanked.''
 The magazine lists five stocks that filled the bill: Regal Entertainment, Ship Finance International, Southern Copper, Vodafone and Washington Mutual.

REIT RICHES -- The red-hot commercial real estate market shows no immediate signs of cooling, Bloomberg Markets reports. That is good news for investors in real estate investment trusts, which are companies that own apartments, office buildings, shopping centers, hotels, etc., and pass most of the rental income on to their investors.
 The market is particularly booming outside the United States, writes Peter Woodifield, noting that ''the return from REITs worldwide has more than doubled since the beginning of 2003, as low interest rates and robust economic growth have boosted the values'' of their holdings.
 Starting next month, Britain will allow REITs, and some 30 are expected to be publicly traded.
 Britain follows Brazil, France, Hong Kong, Mexico, Russia, the United States and 13 other nations that ''have created trusts to make commercial property more accessible to more investors,'' Mr. Woodifield writes. ''The frenzy includes Japan, where 24 trusts have sold shares to the public since the start of last year.'' 

WHAT'S IN A NAME? -- You know that data brokers are constantly trying to find personal information about you that they can sell to direct marketers that want to offer you life insurance, a new credit card and the like.
 But do you actually know what you are worth to them?
 According to Dave Ramsey, writing in Quick & Simple, a weekly magazine published by Good Housekeeping, here are the going rates:
 Bankruptcy details: $26.50
 Workers' comp history: $18
 Unpublished phone number: $17.50
 Cellphone number: $10
 Social Security number: $8
 Date of birth: $2
 Address: 50 cents
 It doesn't add up to much. Still, maybe you should ask for a piece of the action.

FINAL TAKE -- When a company's middle name used to be ''fried,'' it needs to work hard to get attention in this health-conscious age, and KFC (nee Kentucky Fried Chicken) certainly can't be faulted for pluck.
 Last month, the company unveiled the latest iteration of its Colonel Sanders logo and it was hard to miss. The company created an 87,000 square-foot version in the Nevada desert that was visible from space, Chain Leader reports, adding that KFC is also lobbying to put an image of its founder, Harland Sanders, on a postage stamp.
 No word if you'll taste the colonel's 11 herbs and spices when you lick the back. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Shares Up Modestly on Jobs Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Wall Street ended an erratic week with a moderate advance yesterday after a report indicating a robust job market heading into the holiday season eased concerns that the economy was losing steam too quickly. The major indexes all posted gains for the week.
 The Labor Department report showed that slightly more jobs were created last month than expected, which diminished worry about a drop in the dollar and a weaker-than-expected reading from the University of Michigan's consumer confidence figure. 
The jobs report ''breaks the streak of several weak economic indicators you've had until today,'' said John Shin, an economist at Lehman Brothers Holdings.
 Wall Street has pored over economic data in recent months as it tries to determine whether the health of the economy warrants the run-up seen in stocks since September. Mr. Shin said the jobs figure raised Wall Street's hopes about economic data expected next week, including retail sales figures.
 The Dow Jones industrial average was up 29.08 points, or 0.24 percent, at 12,307.49.
 Broader stock indicators also gained. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.55 points, or 0.18 percent, to 1,409.84, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 9.67 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,437.36.
 The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.27 points, or 0.03 percent, to 792.56.
 This week, the Dow rose 0.93 percent, Nasdaq gained 1 percent, and the S.& P. 500 added 0.94 percent. The gains help set the major indexes up for double-digit gains this year, with the Dow up 14.84 percent; the Nasdaq, 10.52 percent; and the S.& P. up 12.94 percent.
 Light crude oil fell 46 cents, to $62.03 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note declined 16/32, to 100 20/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.54 percent from 4.48 percent. 
 Investors were eyeing the jobs report all week as they tried to square their concerns about consumer spending and inflation.
 Wall Street wants employment to remain strong so consumers feel emboldened to keep spending through the holidays, but it does not want wages to rise too quickly and make the inflation-wary Federal Reserve less likely to cut short-term interest rates eventually.
 The central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet Tuesday, and while the meeting will be closely watched, Wall Street does not generally expect a change in interest rate policy. The Fed has left rates unchanged at its last three meetings after having raised them 17 consecutive times since 2004.
 The Labor Department found that employers added 132,000 jobs last month -- greater than the expected increase of 105,000 -- and that unemployment ticked up to 4.5 percent from a five-year low of 4.4 percent in October. Investors did not view the unemployment increase as worrisome, as they had expected that workers would file into the market to seek holiday jobs.
 ''The average hourly earning is up over 4 percent now,'' said Alan Gayle, senior investment strategist at Trusco Capital Management. ''That's good news for consumer pocketbooks but it's further buttressing the Fed's concern about potentially higher inflation.''
 Enthusiasm over the jobs report outweighed concern over the University of Michigan's preliminary consumer confidence reading for December, which came in at 90.2, compared with the reading of 92 that analysts had expected and the 92.1 posted in November.
 3M, one of the 30 stocks in the Dow index, fell $1, to $78.56, after a Prudential Equity Group analyst lowered his rating on the company.
 Banks were also in focus, with speculation that Bank of America might make a bid for Barclays of Britain. Bank of America shares fell 83 cents, to $51.66. Barclays shares rose $2.46, or 4.4 percent, to a new yearly high of $58.25.
 Citigroup gained $1.14, or 2.3 percent, to $51.85, amid rumors that it could be split up. The stock broke through a previous 52-week high of $51.33.
 Heelys, a maker of children's sneakers that have built-in wheels, began trading on the Nasdaq after an initial public offering and gained $11.60, or 55 percent, to $32.60.
 Yum Brands, which operates Taco Bell and other restaurant chains, fell $1.36, or 2.2 percent, to $59.72, amid growing concern about an outbreak of E. coli in some of its restaurants. An analyst at Wachovia lowered his rating on the company to market perform from outperform.

HEADLINE: Signs of Lean Times for Home Equity, the American Piggy Bank 

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
MUCH of the growth of the United States in recent years has been financed by homeowners' rising wealth. But now the growth in that wealth has almost vanished.
 The government reported this month that it estimated the equity of Americans in their homes -- what the homes are worth less the money owed on mortgages -- rose a scant 0.1 percent in the third quarter. At an annual rate, that was just 0.5 percent, the smallest gain in more than a decade.
From late 2003 through the first quarter of this year, the gain in home equity was running at more than 10 percent a year, more than enough to keep Americans feeling richer and to provide cash -- through refinancings or home equity loans -- for other uses. 
 The amount of money being borrowed has also begun to slow, although not nearly as rapidly as the increase in the value of real estate might indicate. In the third quarter, the outstanding balances of mortgage loans rose at an annual rate of 7.9 percent. That is less than half the pace of just two years ago, and the lowest figure for any quarter since early 2001, when the economy was going into recession.
 That American homes face more leverage than they once did is clear from the chart showing mortgages as a percentage of value over the last half century. 
 Over all, homes are still worth more than twice what is owed on them, which hardly sounds alarming even if relative debt levels doubled over the 50 years.
 The real issue is the spread of that debt. There is no question that more homes now have very high loan-to-value ratios, or that more mortgages have features that could cause monthly payments to soar. Either could cause severe distress for some homeowners if home prices fall or a recession threatens incomes. Owners could find they own homes worth less than they owe or that they cannot afford the new monthly payment. A wave of defaults could come even when most homeowners have ample financial flexibility.
 It used to be that in eras when home values rose rapidly, the amount of outstanding mortgages rose more slowly. That stood to reason, because most homes were not sold in any given year and mortgages were primarily used to buy homes. Those who owned homes might have felt wealthier, but they did not take on additional debt.
 That stayed true even in the late 1990's, when home prices were rising at a good clip and mortgage balances rose more slowly. But the relationship has vanished. For the best two and a half years of the real estate boom -- ending this past March -- the value of home equity in America rose at a very impressive annual rate of 11.8 percent. But the total amount of mortgages outstanding rose at a rate of 13.5 percent.
 Some of that borrowing came from home buyers who needed to borrow to pay the high prices, and some from homeowners refinancing their homes. But a lot also came from an increased willingness of Americans to use home equity lines of credit -- and from the expansion of the asset-backed securities market that funds many such loans. The amount outstanding under them rose at a compounded annual rate of 22.9 percent over that period.
 It seems like a paradox: the more homes are worth, the more many owners owe, even if they purchased the homes many years before for far less than they are now worth.

HEADLINE: Employers Added 132,000 Jobs Last Month 

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The nation's employers added a respectable 132,000 jobs last month, the government reported yesterday, despite big losses in construction and manufacturing from the unwinding of the housing boom and a slowing economy.
 The unemployment rate ticked up negligibly, to 4.5 percent, from 4.4 percent in October, still signaling a tight labor market and healthy demand for workers, leading many economists to predict that the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates unchanged in the months ahead.
''The economy continues to absorb job losses in construction and manufacturing well,'' analysts at Bear Stearns Economics wrote. ''With the labor market tight and average hourly earnings growth continuing to rise, the gains in employment do not support the view that the Fed will be cutting rates in 2007.'' 
 But others disagreed, arguing that the housing market will deteriorate further, halting the steady job growth of recent months and the improving wages of millions of production workers. 
 ''What I am hearing from some of my colleagues is that this is as bad as housing and the economy are going to get,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics. ''I think that is completely wrong.''
 Whatever the future holds, the Fed's policy makers are likely to leave the key interest rate they control unchanged at 5.25 percent when they meet in Washington on Tuesday. If they are concerned about a weakening economy they are also concerned that inflation is still higher than they prefer, a view several of the policy makers, including the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have stated in recent speeches.
 ''There is nothing here to move the Fed out of its sideline seat,'' said Joshua Shapiro, chief domestic economist for MFR Securities.
 The stock market, reflecting this view, moved up only modestly in trading yesterday, while interest rates on bonds rose a bit after the employment report came in slightly stronger than expected.
 The job growth in November came mostly in health care, restaurant and hotel employment, and in high-end occupations like accounting, engineering services, computer design, legal services and management consulting. State and local governments also contributed significantly, adding 15,000 jobs last month, mostly in education.
 The gains were more than enough to offset a loss of 44,000 jobs in construction and in manufacturing, particularly in the auto industry and in the production of furniture and wood products used in home construction.
 Until last month, hiring in commercial construction -- office buildings, stores and the like -- had offset the job losses in home building. But the hiring in the commercial sector failed to grow in November, contributing to an overall loss in construction-related employment of 40,000 workers. 
 ''I describe what is going on as a two-tier economy,'' said Richard Berner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley, who is more optimistic about the future than Mr. Shepherdson. ''We are in the midst of a housing recession,'' Mr. Berner said, but ''the sharp declines in construction activity and in housing prices will soon fade.''
 Mr. Berner argues that consumers are not as dependent as the pessimists contend on the wealth they extract from their homes to drive their spending. The more important factors today, he said, are the recent decline in energy prices and, above all, rising incomes. 
 The average hourly wage of millions of production workers has been rising at a year-over-year rate of 4.1 percent -- surpassing inflation -- and that trend continued in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
 The 3 cent increase, to $16.94, however, was only half the October rise.
 Retail employment, which had declined fairly steadily over the last year, shedding more than 80,000 jobs, spurted unexpectedly in November, even allowing for holiday hiring. The improvement came mainly in specialty stores selling sporting goods, beauty and health care products and some lines of clothing. Employment fell at general merchandise stores, however, reflecting sluggish sales at big chain stores. 
 A number of economists expect a further economic slowdown next year. ''It is too optimistic to assume that consumers will just take in stride what is happening,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist at Global Insight. ''Year after year, spending growth has exceeded income growth, and we should now expect a period in which spending growth falls short of income growth.''
 A separate report, issued yesterday by the University of Michigan's pollsters who survey consumer sentiment monthly supported Mr. Gault's and Mr. Shepherdson's view. The preliminary index for December dropped to 90.2, from 92.1, mainly because of a sharp drop in expectations.
 ''The survey does not reveal the source of their collective angst,'' Mr. Shepherdson wrote, ''but we'd guess that a combination of falling home prices and worries about the wider economy are hurting.'' 
 With the year nearly over, job growth is not far off the pace of 2005, when the economy was stronger and housing was still in full swing. The average monthly job growth was 149,000 through November, compared with 165,000 a month for all of last year. A revision in the preliminary estimates for September and October added, on net, 42,000 jobs for those months, helping to raise this year's average. 
 Jared Bernstein at the Economic Policy Institute, trying to explain the strong job growth, noted that the economy, even in its weakened condition, was expanding at twice the growth rate of labor productivity. That may be forcing employers to hire to keep up with demand.
 Mr. Gault said that employers might be reluctant to cut their work force levels in a tight labor market, fearing they might have difficulty finding good workers if the economy rebounded. That is particularly an issue, he said, when the slowdown is mainly in ''autos and housing and the rest of the economy is holding up pretty well.''

HEADLINE: An Orchestra Delivers Seasonal Tidings and Interpretive Tweaks 

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
Largely lacking indigenous early-music-making at the highest level, New York must rely heavily on big-name groups from abroad to show how such performances should go. So the delectable seasonal program Ton Koopman and the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra and Choir offered on Thursday evening at Carnegie Hall shaped up as a highlight of the waning musical year. And it was indeed a lively outing, though it cannot be said that the level of interpretation and execution was always lofty. 
 Contrasting settings of the Magnificat framed the program, which ended with Bach's fast-paced D major masterpiece, a marvel of economy. The evening opened with an even terser, quainter Magnificat by Dietrich Buxtehude, an organist and composer Bach greatly admired, and it proved a delight, pure and simple.
Nothing that followed was entirely simple or pure. Mr. Koopman, on some historical basis or other, presented Arcangelo Corelli's lovely ''Christmas'' Concerto (Op. 6, No. 8) in a version for winds as well as the specified strings, and he seemed intent on driving the point home, encouraging twittery ornamentation from the outset.
 All of which seemed unexceptionable and even engaging until the concluding Pastorale, typically a model of melting, lullabylike repose. Mr. Koopman coaxed out a different kind of pastoral sense, turning the movement into a sort of peasant dance, with countrified fiddling and piping, all given a raucous swing.
 It made a listener grateful that what was to follow was not the second cantata from Bach's ''Christmas Oratorio,'' with its exquisite pastoral Sinfonia, but the first, ''Jauchzet, frohlocket.'' It went well enough, with excellent work from the chorus, but the trumpeters struggled in a manner all too familiar to New Yorkers. Playing the notoriously intractable valveless trumpet (and, for that matter, many another period instrument) is inevitably an inexact art, but the strangled sounds here went beyond the mere inexactitude of, for instance, some of the string and woodwind intonation.
 The Bach Magnificat, after intermission, seemed well on its way to remedying all of that when misfortune struck in the aria ''Esurientes implevit bonis.'' The mezzo-soprano soloist, Bogna Bartosz, who was having a good evening until then, made her initial entry a measure or two early, leaving Mr. Koopman to scramble until he could pull his vamping forces back together.
 Still, it was a good performance, despite Mr. Koopman's interpretive oddities. Most notably, in the chorus ''Omnes generationes,'' where Bach follows a momentary break with a harsh chord that most performers amplify, Mr. Koopman turned dainty, echoing other abrupt dynamic shifts throughout the evening.
 Those sudden turns were only emphasized by the unfailing responsiveness of the chorus. Among the vocal soloists, Klaus Mertens, a German bass, was particularly impressive: clear, precise and expansive.
 In all, it was at least never dull.

The orchestra will perform the same program on Sunday at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, (800) 466-5722, and a Bach program on Tuesday at Zankel Hall, (212) 247-7800.

HEADLINE: A Nod for Atlantic Yards, and Then a Lawsuit

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
The board of the state agency sponsoring the proposed Atlantic Yards project near Downtown Brooklyn voted unanimously yesterday to approve it, while also voting to authorize any building condemnations that may be required.
 Within hours of the vote, 13 tenants living in two buildings on the proposed project site filed suit against the agency, the Empire State Development Corporation, charging that the board had authorized the buildings' condemnation without permission from state housing officials to erase the tenants' rent-stabilized leases.
The buildings, at 473 Dean Street and 624 Pacific Street, were bought in the last two years by the project's developer, Forest City Ratner, which is also the development partner in building a new Midtown headquarters for The New York Times Company. 
 The 22-acre residential and commercial project in Brooklyn, which would include a basketball arena for the Nets, still faces a final decision by the state's Public Authorities Control Board, and any condemnations would not happen immediately if approval is given. 
 But George S. Locker, a lawyer for the tenants, said that Forest City and the development agency's chairman, Charles A. Gargano, who presided over yesterday's vote, had deliberately misled the tenants about the potential for condemnation.
 ''His public statements about eminent domain, and Forest City Ratner's, have in common that they were both dishonest and deceptive,'' Mr. Locker said, ''and they were both designed to give reassurances about the noncondemnation of tenants when in fact that's exactly what's going to happen.'' 
 It would be up to a State Supreme Court justice in Manhattan, where the suit was filed, to decide what legal import Mr. Gargano's comments have. But even by the standards of development-speak, where hyperbolic promises and grand rhetorical gestures are the norm, some of those comments have left allies and opponents alike perplexed.
 Last May, Mr. Gargano suggested that the condemnations had already occurred, telling a reporter that the development agency ''didn't need to use eminent domain'' and that ''the amount of condemnation that we had to do was very small.'' 
 During a subsequent television appearance, Mr. Gargano characterized the condemnations that might occur as ''friendly,'' meaning unchallenged, though several apartment owners have long said that they planned to fight the condemnations in court. (Under the state's eminent domain law, the condemnations of the Pacific and Dean Street buildings would be friendly because Forest City Ratner owns them, not the tenants; Mr. Locker argues that housing laws nevertheless give the tenants rights ignored by the development agency.)
 On a radio program on Thursday, a day before the vote on future condemnations, Mr. Gargano seemed to indicate that no such decision would be made. ''There is nothing about that tomorrow,'' he said in an interview on WNYC.
 Asked about those statements at a news conference yesterday, Mr. Gargano grew testy and denied that he had made them. When the statements were read to him, he suggested that he had been misheard. Later in the day, he called this reporter to clarify his previous comments.
 ''Obviously, I knew very clearly that this project had not yet used condemnation,'' Mr. Gargano said. ''And I have known from the beginning that if they had to use condemnation, it would be very small.'' 
 He declined to comment directly on the new lawsuit yesterday.
 The board meeting itself was largely anticlimactic. In approving the project, the board formalized a reduction in the project's size, to 8 million from 8.7 million square feet -- about the size of the original plan unveiled in 2003. The slightly lower price tag, at slightly less than $4 billion, will still be significantly higher than originally projected. 
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Gov. George E. Pataki both issued statements praising the board's vote, as did James P. Stuckey, the Forest City official in charge of the project, who said it offered ''very real benefits for Brooklyn,'' like jobs and housing.
 Supporters and opponents have already turned their focus to a coming vote by the Public Authorities Control Board, which will have the final say. The votes on that board are controlled equally by the Republican governor; Sheldon Silver, the Democratic Assembly speaker; and Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican Senate majority leader.
 All three publicly support the project, but Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki have clashed over other large development efforts. The project's supporters are worried that Mr. Silver will decide to postpone the vote, as yet unscheduled, until next year, when Eliot Spitzer will be the governor.
 Mr. Gargano said yesterday that he was confident that the project would be approved by the Public Authorities Control Board by the end of the year. He said his staff members had been involved in discussions with Mr. Silver's and Mr. Bruno's staff members. ''They are given all of the information they possibly need,'' Mr. Gargano said.
 Many community groups, local and national civic organizations, and some elected officials continued yesterday to call on Albany officials to delay final approval of the project until questions about its financing and environmental impact were resolved.

HEADLINE: E. Coli Fears Inspire a Call For Oversight

BYLINE: By MARIAN BURROS

 BODY:
Facing a loss of consumer confidence in fresh fruits and vegetables because of repeated outbreaks of food-borne illness, three major produce industry groups have for the first time called for government regulation in an industry that until now has had none.
 One of the groups, Western Growers, says it has gone further, meeting over the past six weeks with state officials in California to draw up an agreement that would call for a formal system of farm inspections, regulations of water and soil quality and sanitation and even cease-and-desist orders for violations. 
The agreement may be ready by spring, said Tim Chelling, vice president of communications for the group, which represents growers in California and Arizona who account for half the nation's produce. ''Anyone who ignores this,'' Mr. Chelling said, ''will be out of business.''
 Since the outbreak of E. coli 0157:H7 linked to green onions served at Taco Bell restaurants, there have been more than 200 confirmed or suspected cases this week in New York, New Jersey and four other states. 
 It is the latest instance of food-borne illnesses tied to raw vegetables. E. coli 0157:H7 linked to bagged spinach killed 3 people and sickened 206 others in 26 states and Canada this fall. 
 In mid-October, sales of bulk and bagged spinach were down 60 percent compared with a year ago, and sales of other packaged salads were down as much as 10 percent, according to the United Fresh Produce Association, another industry group.
 James Gorny, the senior vice president for food safety and technology for the association, said government involvement, which the industry had long resisted, had become necessary. 
 ''At this point, because of the seriousness of the issue, we are open to any and all solutions including regulation at the federal or state level,'' Mr. Gorny said. ''Certain segments of the industry are under the gun to do everything possible.''
 ''These are significant failures and the industry has done some deep soul-searching to make certain we are not missing important risk factors,'' he added. ''No stone is being left unturned.''
 But Dr. David Acheson, chief medical officer of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition in the Food and Drug Administration, was cautious. 
 ''If they feel taking that approach is going to get us a safer product, then it's certainly important to look at that,'' Dr. Acheson said. He warned, though, that the agency, which is seriously understaffed, did not have the resources to enforce such regulations.
 The agency now has little authority over the industry. There are fewer than 2,000 F.D.A. inspectors for more than 12,000 facilities, 250 inspectors fewer than in 2003.
 Produce-related outbreaks of disease rose to 86 in 2004, the latest year for which there is data, compared with 29 in 1997, when the states started electronic reporting to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
 Mr. Gorny said a coalition of industry officials and consumer groups were working to get more F.D.A. financing for inspectors and food safety research. 
 A longtime advocate of strong government regulation of agriculture, Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, who will probably be the chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture in the House Appropriations Committee in the next Congress, called the industry request unprecedented.
 She said Congress and the F.D.A. had abdicated their responsibility. ''With an agency that doesn't believe in regulatory authority to do anything, that puts our public at great risk,'' she said.
 Michael Doyle, an epidemiologist with the University of Georgia and a leading authority on food-borne illness, said the moves were long overdue. 
 ''For years we've been trying to get people to eat more produce, and now we have had these safety issues over and over again and now people have heard the message that produce is not safe,'' said Mr. Doyle, a frequent consultant with the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. ''It's something we've known, and I blame the industry big time because they have known they had this problem since the '90s and they refused to address the issue.''
 Until recently, he said, ''the industry believed the major problems were not in the fields or processing facilities, but in homes and restaurants where cross-contamination with beef products was occurring.''
 But with the recent spinach contamination, government officials, using DNA tests, were for the first time able to positively link harmful bacteria to a farm. 
 ''We have a smoking gun,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''We have the definitive data to show industry that the problems go back to the fields and processing plants.''
 Spokespeople for the three trade groups, which also include the Produce Marketing Association, deny that anyone has ever suggested home cooks and chefs were to blame. 
 ''I'm not saying it's consumers' responsibility,'' said Kathy Means, vice president of government relations for the Produce Marketing Association. ''But consumers can feel some control by proper produce handling.'' 
 Ms. Means said that unlike bacteria in contaminated meat, which are killed by cooking, bacteria in vegetables and fruits eaten raw are not. 
 Despite the industry's newfound enthusiasm for regulation, food safety advocates say any new measures may face resistance in Washington.
 Caroline Smith DeWaal, food safety director for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said that even if the F.D.A. were given more authority over produce, ''you need a commitment from the administration that they will support you.''
 Based on experiences over the past six years, she said, there is little indication that would happen.

HEADLINE: Billions Later, Plan to Remake The Coast Guard Fleet Stumbles

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
Four years after the Coast Guard began an effort to replace nearly its entire fleet of ships, planes and helicopters, the modernization program heralded as a model of government innovation is foundering.
 The initial venture -- converting rusting 110-foot patrol boats, the workhorses of the Coast Guard, into more versatile 123-foot cutters -- has been canceled after hull cracks and engine failures made the first eight boats unseaworthy.
Plans to build a new class of 147-foot ships with an innovative hull have been halted after the design was found to be flawed.
 And the first completed new ship -- a $564 million behemoth christened last month -- has structural weaknesses that some Coast Guard engineers believe may threaten its safety and limit its life span, unless costly repairs are made. 
 The problems have helped swell the costs of the fleet-building program to a projected $24 billion, from $17 billion, and delayed the arrival of any new ships or aircraft. 
 That has compromised the Coast Guard's ability to fulfill its mission, which greatly expanded after the 2001 attacks to include guarding the nation's shores against terrorists. The service has been forced to cut back on patrols and, at times, ignore tips from other federal agencies about drug smugglers. The difficulties will only grow more acute in the next few years as old boats fail and replacements are not ready.
 Adm. Thad W. Allen, who took over as Coast Guard commandant in May, acknowledged that the program had been troubled and said that he had begun to address the problems. ''You will see changes shortly in the Coast Guard in our acquisition organization,'' Admiral Allen said. ''It will be significantly different than we have done in the past.''
 The modernization effort was a bold experiment, called Deepwater, to build the equivalent of a modest navy -- 91 new ships, 124 small boats, 195 new or rebuilt helicopters and planes and 49 unmanned aerial vehicles.
 Instead of doing it piecemeal, the Coast Guard decided to package everything, in hopes that the fleet would be better integrated and its multibillion price would command attention from a Congress and White House traditionally more focused on other military branches. And instead of managing the project itself, the Coast Guard hired Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, two of the nation's largest military contractors, to plan, supervise and deliver the new vessels and helicopters.
 Many retired Coast Guard officials, former company executives and government auditors fault that privatization model, saying it allowed the contractors at times to put their interests ahead of the Guard's. 
 ''This is the fleecing of America,'' said Anthony D'Armiento, a systems engineer who has worked for Northrop and the Coast Guard on the project. ''It is the worst contract arrangement I've seen in all my 20 plus years in naval engineering.''
 Insufficient oversight by the Coast Guard resulted in the service buying some equipment it did not want and ignoring repeated warnings from its own engineers that the boats and ships were poorly designed and perhaps unsafe, the agency acknowledged. The Deepwater program's few Congressional skeptics were outmatched by lawmakers who became enthusiastic supporters, mobilized by an aggressive lobbying campaign financed by Lockheed and Northrop.
 And the contractors failed to fulfill their obligation to make sure the government got the best price, frequently steering work to their subsidiaries or business partners instead of competitors, according to government auditors and people affiliated with the program. 
 Even some of the smaller Deepwater projects raise questions about management. The radios placed in small, open boats were not waterproof and immediately shorted out, for example. Electronics equipment costing millions of dollars is still being installed in the new cutter, even though it will be ripped out because the Coast Guard does not want it. An order of eight small, inflatable boats cost an extra half-million dollars because the purchase passed through four layers of contractors.
 For the Department of Homeland Security, which took over responsibility for the Coast Guard in 2003, Deepwater joins its already long list of troubled programs, including its airport checkpoint measures, its biodefense efforts and its widely condemned handling of the response to Hurricane Katrina.
 The Homeland Security Department's inspector general has warned that the department cannot repeat this experience as it begins a $7 billion plan to tighten the border. The department is taking a similar management approach with that plan, relying on the Boeing Corporation to develop, supervise and execute the strategy.
 Spokesmen for Northrop and Lockheed, and the partnership they formed to run Deepwater, declined repeated requests for interviews, saying they would leave it to the Coast Guard to discuss the project. The companies also declined to respond to written questions.
 Admiral Allen said the Coast Guard engineers and procurement staff team would now play a much larger role in overseeing the project in an effort to rein in its private sector partners, adding that the mistakes made were unacceptable.
 ''Our people are demoralized by it, they don't deserve it, and it really impedes our ability to execute our mission,'' he said.

Early Warnings
 On a clear, calm morning in Key West, Fla., one day last month -- perfect weather for running drugs and migrants -- six of the eight converted Coast Guard patrol boats were broken down or out of service. Their crews had little to do but shine the ships' already gleaming bells and clean its guns.
 The Deepwater plan called for transforming the 110-foot boats into larger, more versatile cutters with rebuilt hulls, new communications and surveillance gear and a 13-foot extension to make room for a small boat launch ramp. 
 Even before the refurbishing began in 2003, though, Coast Guard engineers expressed doubts that the boats could bear the extra weight the changes would impose. ''You could have buckling of the structure of the ship,'' Chris Cleary, of the Engineering Logistics Center at the Coast Guard, said he recalls pointing out. But Bollinger Shipyards, a business partner of Northrop and Lockheed, insisted the conversion would succeed.
 As the work got under way, the Coast Guard provided only limited oversight. It did not fill dozens of its seats on joint management teams set up for the project. And the Coast Guard assigned seven inspectors to monitor the work, compared with 20 on a similar-size job.
 ''In theory, we were going drive a 110-foot cutter up to the pier, drop it off and come back in 34 weeks to pick up a 123-foot cutter,'' said Lt. Benjamin Fleming, the Coast Guard's representative at the shipyard in Lockport, La. ''We were putting a lot of trust and faith in our partners.''
 Michael De Kort, a former Lockheed project manager, said the results quickly became apparent.
 The VHF radio on the small launch would be exposed to the elements but was not waterproof, Mr. De Kort said. The classified communications equipment had not been properly shielded to protect messages from eavesdropping. Cameras intended to provide 360-degree surveillance had two large blind spots.
 Mr. De Kort said he had repeatedly warned his Lockheed supervisors of the problems, but was rebuffed. ''We have an approved design and we aren't going to change it,'' Mr. De Kort said he was told. He was later laid off from the company. Lockheed officials declined to comment.
 In September 2004, more serious flaws in the boat conversion program became obvious after the first one, the Matagorda, was launched. As it traveled in relatively heavy seas from Key West to Miami, large cracks appeared in the hull and deck. 
 Giant steel straps that looked like Band-Aids were affixed to the side of the boats, and the vessels were barred from venturing out in rough water. But cracks and bulges continued to scar the Matagorda and other converted ships, followed by a series of mechanical problems. 
 Bollinger, it turned out, had overestimated how much stress the modified boats could handle, a miscalculation it cannot fully explain. ''The computer broke for some reason,'' said T. R. Hamlin, a senior Bollinger manager. ''Whether it was a power surge or something, who knows?'' The cursory oversight by the Coast Guard meant the mistake was not caught in time.
 After spending about $100 million on the first eight boats, the Coast Guard suspended the conversion plan. Last week, Admiral Allen ordered the boats taken out of service, citing concerns about crew safety. 
 Facing a shortage of patrol boats, the contractors and the Coast Guard decided to speed development of a larger ship, the Fast Response Cutter. The hull was to be built from glass-reinforced plastic, known as a composite, something never tried on a large American military ship.
 While acknowledging that it might cost much more to build the 58 planned cutters with composite hulls instead of steel, Northrop and Lockheed claimed the boats would last longer and require less maintenance, saving money over the long run.
 Coast Guard engineers again were doubtful that Northrop's design would work, citing concerns about weight, hull shape and fuel consumption. The Coast Guard also found inconsistencies in the cost data Northrop used to justify the new hull. 
 One former Northrop executive said the company was pushing the plan not because it was in the best interest of the Coast Guard, but because Northrop had just spent $64 million to turn its shipyard in Gulfport, Miss., into the country's first large-scale composite hull manufacturing plant for military ships.
 ''It was a pure business decision,'' said the former executive, who disagreed with the plan and would speak only anonymously for fear of retribution. ''And it was the wrong one.''
 That became clear when a scale model of the Fast Response Cutter was placed in a tank of water -- and flunked the test. After three years and $38 million, Northrop Grumman's plan was suspended.

Financial Aid
 The Coast Guard recognized from the start that it might need help financing a project as big as Deepwater, and that was part of the reason it turned to Lockheed and Northrop.
 ''They have armies of lobbyists, they can help get dollars to get the job done,'' explained Jim McEntire, a retired captain who had served as a senior Coast Guard budget official. ''The White House and Congress listen to big industrial concerns.''
 That assistance would prove valuable. Just months after the contract was awarded in June 2002 through a competitive bidding process, the Coast Guard began to study whether the $17 billion Deepwater budget would be inadequate, given additional costs for antiterrorism equipment. In 2005, the service informed Congress that the program would cost $24 billion over 20 years and that the annual allocation would need to double, to $1 billion.
 By then, though, the patrol boat conversion had been halted. Deepwater's costs were ballooning, but the Coast Guard was having a hard time explaining exactly how it would spend more money. Government auditors were starting to churn out reports warning of serious management weaknesses. 
 That record disturbed some members of Congress. In May 2005, the House Appropriations Committee slashed the program's annual budget request nearly in half to register its frustration. 
 At a hearing two months later, Representative Harold Rogers, a Kentucky Republican who oversees the Homeland Security budget, instructed the Coast Guard to fix its problems and restrain costs. ''You simply took the most expensive, all-inclusive Cadillac Seville and we're going to have to, with our limited funds, fit you into something a bit more appropriate,'' Mr. Rogers said. ''I hope it's more than a Chevrolet.'' 
 To fight back, the Coast Guard and contractors relied on Congressional allies, led by Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, Representative Frank A. LoBiondo, Republican of New Jersey, and Representative Gene Taylor, Democrat of Mississippi.
 Mr. Taylor and Mr. LoBiondo had formed a group called the Congressional Coast Guard Caucus. It began in the late 1990s with 4 members and today has more than 75.
 The enthusiasm of the three leaders for the Deepwater project was not simply about meeting the Coast Guard's needs. Maine is home to Bath Iron Works, a major ship builder that Ms. Snowe said might benefit from increased Deepwater spending. While that was a factor, she said it was not her primary motivation.
 Ms. Snowe and Mr. LoBiondo, the leaders of the Senate and House panels that oversee the Coast Guard, said they pushed for more spending only after the service's leaders reassured them during hearings that they were addressing the program's problems. They both also said they were convinced that the Coast Guard desperately needed Deepwater because its helicopter engines were routinely breaking down and the hulls of old ships were failing.
 ''We don't want to waste money; we don't want ineffective programs,'' Ms. Snowe said in an interview. ''At the same time, we can't allow the Coast Guard to languish.''
 Mr. Taylor's district is home to Northrop Grumman's shipyard in Pascagoula, Miss., which is building the Coast Guard's largest ship, and Northrop and its employees are one of his biggest sources of campaign contributions. He worked along with two key Republicans in Mississippi -- Senator Trent Lott, whose father was once a pipe fitter at the Pascagoula shipyard, and Senator Thad Cochran, the chairman of the Senate appropriations committee -- to win more money.
 Mr. LoBiondo's district is home to the Coast Guard's national training center, and Lockheed Martin built its Deepwater equipment testing center just outside his district. He is also one of the top Congressional recipients of Lockheed contributions.
 The contractors ran advertisements aimed at lawmakers in Washington publications, delivering ominous messages about the need to stop terrorists before they reach American shores. The Navy League, a nonprofit group partly financed by Lockheed and Northrop, orchestrated telephone calls, letters and visits to lawmakers, reminding them that hundreds of contractors across the country were already working as suppliers on the project. 
 And the Coast Guard got an important boost when it was widely praised for its helicopter rescues after Hurricane Katrina. 
 The lobbying effort paid off. In September 2005, Congress agreed to increase the annual financing for Deepwater to nearly $1 billion.

Late Scramble
 If there was a single ship that could prove to skeptics that the Coast Guard and its contractors could get the job done right, it would be the National Security Cutter, a ship unlike anything the Coast Guard had ever built. Bigger than any existing cutter, it was more like a warship, designed to patrol with Navy vessels. 
 It would carry sophisticated weapons systems, surveillance equipment, a helicopter and two unmanned aerial vehicles, all vital in its effort to intercept boats suspected of carrying terrorists, drug dealers or illegal immigrants. It was designed to monitor 56,000 square miles a day, an area four times as large as that covered by any other Coast Guard ship.
 Because the ship was so expensive -- each was expected to cost about $300 million -- the Coast Guard decided to build only 8 to replace its fleet of 12 large cutters.
 There was just one catch. Even before the cutter began taking form at the Pascagoula shipyard on the Gulf of Mexico, familiar problems cropped up.
 The Coast Guard's engineers believed the design proposed by Northrop and Lockheed had serious structural flaws that could result in the hull collapsing or premature cracking of the hull and deck, according to Mr. Cleary and his boss, Rubin Sheinberg, chief of the Coast Guard's naval architecture branch.
 When they alerted the contractors and Coast Guard officials, they were largely brushed off, the men said. In March 2004, their supervisor protested, saying the Coast Guard should delay construction.
 ''Significant problems persist with the structural design,'' Rear Adm. Erroll M. Brown wrote to the Deepwater project director. ''Several of these problems compromise the safety and the viability of the hull, possibly resulting in structural failure and unacceptable hull vibration.''
 The Coast Guard decided to move ahead anyway, figuring it would be less disruptive to fix any problems later. As the shipbuilding progressed, other Coast Guard officials began to openly complain that some decisions by the contractors appeared to be motivated by a drive to increase profits, not to best serve the Coast Guard.
 Lockheed, for example, ordered computerized consoles for the ship that it had developed for a Navy aircraft carrier. But they were too big for the cutter, said Jay A. Creech, a retired Coast Guard captain working as a contractor on Deepwater. 
 A consultant hired by the Coast Guard to review Northrop and Lockheed's purchasing decisions found that of $210 million worth of contracts awarded in 2004, just 30 percent involved a formal competitive process. Northrop in particular was faulted for failing to aggressively seek bids to ensure the best price.
 Northrop and Lockheed ''lack the independence needed to make objective decisions in the best interests of the Coast Guard,'' an August 2006 report by the Homeland Security inspector general said. 
 Others say that giving the contractors so much authority was a mistake from the start. ''A contractor with a profit motive is never a trusted agent,'' said Joe Ryan, a Coast Guard consultant who has helped with the Deepwater project. ''They are the vendor, and they are selling you something.'' 
 Problems began to accumulate elsewhere. In Texas, a prototype of the unmanned aerial vehicle that was to be placed on the ship's deck crashed this year. After the crash, the project, by Bell Helicopter, also faced a money crunch and was put on hold, pushing delivery back to at least 2013, six years after the first national security cutter is scheduled for active duty. Without the two aerial vehicles, the cutter's surveillance range is reduced by more than half.
 By the time the ship was christened last month, its price had grown to $564 million, nearly twice its original cost. (The average price for the eight ships is expected to be $431 million.) And by then, Coast Guard officials had conceded that the ship had structural flaws. Navy experts had evaluated the ship and confirmed many of the earlier warnings.
 Admiral Allen said he had been given assurances that the ship was not at risk of a catastrophic hull failure and would not pose a safety threat to its crew. But the Coast Guard has decided to make structural modifications to the vessel and require design changes for the third cutter. Work is too far along to change course on the second cutter.
 Four years into the Deepwater project, the Coast Guard, according to its original plan, was supposed to have 26 new or rebuilt ships, 12 new planes and 8 unmanned vehicles, but none are available. Now, officials are scrambling to find an off-the-shelf design for a new cutter and make modest repairs to keep their aging patrol boats operable. 
 ''We don't have the ships we need, and we don't have a way to get them anytime soon,'' said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, who will take over the House Appropriations Committee next month. ''It's inexcusable.''
 The Coast Guard, which would not disclose the management fees it has paid Northrop and Lockheed, is renegotiating the contract to ensure that the companies honor a commitment to open the work to competition and deliver what they promise.
 And Admiral Allen and other Coast Guard officials say the Coast Guard's engineers are being given more power to supervise the work. Admiral Allen is also creating a division to oversee the procurement and maintenance of its ships and airplanes. ''That is the main gap that needs to be closed,'' he said.
 The Deepwater experiment, one contracting expert said, underscores the need for the Coast Guard to be a smart buyer, even if it has hired high-priced advice.
 ''The government still needs to be in there so they know what decisions are being made and if the decisions are in their best interest,'' said Michele Mackin, an assistant director at the Government Accountability Office. ''It is still their money. And they are going to be flying the planes and running the ships.''

 2002: $0.3
 2006: $0.6

High-speed boat would be launched from cutters with a range of 20 miles. Would be used for intercepting and boarding suspect vessels.

The Coast Guard ended up paying too much because it bought the boats through four layers of contractors. Radios on the boats were not properly waterproofed at first.

Maritime Patrol Aircraft
2002: $37
2006: $47

Transport and surveillance craft, including search and rescue. Would be a logistical workhorse of the Coast Guard fleet. Would have chemical, biological and nuclear detection capabilites.

First plane is being tested. The plane is based on a proven and widely used design.

High-Altitude Endurance Unmanned Air Vehicle
Being leased; no final cost

Plane would provide long-range surveillance over large areas for extended periods of time.

Tests in Alaska, where the Coast Guard has large patrol areas, were repeatedly canceled because it could not operate in bad weather.

HV-911 Eagle Eye Unmanned Air Vehicle
2002: $7
2006: $11

Surveillance craft would take off and land vertically and would not need a runway.

This year, the prototype crashed when the engine unexpectedly shut off during testing. The advance radar system has not materialized as promised. Delayed till 2013.

HH-65C Multimission Cutter Helicopter
2006: $7.3

Replace failing engines in this workhorse Coast Guard helicopter. Upgrade electronics and surveillance systems and add weapons.

Half of the 95 helicopters have been upgraded with new engines, giving them 40 percent more power. Program is behind schedule and over budget.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 9 about the problems of a Coast Guard modernization project called Deepwater and its management by the defense contractors Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin incorrectly described a campaign in mid-2005 by the Navy League, a nonprofit group, in support of the project. The organization wrote letters to lawmakers urging them to restore funds for the program; the group says it did not remind them that hundreds of contractors across the country were working as suppliers on the project. The error was pointed out by the Navy League shortly after the article appeared, and again on Jan. 2. This correction was delayed because those responsible initially decided no correction was warranted and were slow to follow up on additional complaints.

HEADLINE: The Agonies of Zimbabwe

 BODY:
One problem with labeling states as pariahs is that it's all too easy to forget about them. Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe is a prime example: it is under economic sanctions by the United States and the European Union and few tourists go there, so the suffering of its people is largely out of sight and out of mind. Yet things are truly terrible. 
 The latest indication comes in a United Nations-financed report by Zimbabwe's own social welfare ministry. More than 63 percent of the rural population, and 53 percent of the urban population, couldn't meet "basic food and non-food requirements" in 2003, the last year for which figures were available, and things have gotten far worse since. Malnutrition among children is up 35 percent, people without access to health care is up 35 percent, H.I.V./AIDS afflicts 18.1 percent of the population, unemployment is over 70 percent, life expectancy is down to 36.
Mr. Mugabe's government blames sanctions, weather, former colonial rule, market conditions. Yet the real culprit is Mr. Mugabe, who has run Zimbabwe since 1980. Now 82, the president is a master at the blame game, accusing the West of colonialism and racism when it criticizes his scheme to redistribute white-owned commercial farms among blacks, or the cruel expulsion of 750,000 slum dwellers from cities, or whatever else he does.
 There's not much the West can do; more sanctions would only bring more suffering. But Africans could make a difference, if they joined in condemning Mr. Mugabe. For understandable reasons, African leaders have been reluctant to publicly criticize fellow Africans. But as Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, declared yesterday, ''human rights are perhaps more in need of protection in Africa than in any other continent.''
 The suffering Zimbabwean people are in desperate need of protection, the sooner the better.

HEADLINE: Really Old School

BYLINE: By Jeffrey E. Garten. 
Jeffrey E. Garten, former dean of the Yale School of Management, is a professor of international trade and finance there.

DATELINE: New Haven 

 BODY:
AT a summit meeting of leaders next week in the Philippines, senior officials from India, Singapore, Japan and perhaps other countries are scheduled to discuss the revival of an ancient university in India called Nalanda. It is a topic unlikely to receive much mention in the Western press. But no one should underestimate the potential benefits of this project to Asia, or the influence it could have on Asia's role in the world, or the revolutionary impact it could make on global higher education.
 Americans are used to thinking about the rising powers of Asia -- China, India, South Korea and even some of the smaller countries -- primarily as formidable economic competitors. In the case of Beijing, we also recognize the potential for superpower political and military status. But there are at least two questions that are key to Asia's future that we do not generally ask. 
First, for all the talk about the rise of Asia in the ''knowledge age'' that we live in, are these countries ultimately constrained in their potential to be great nations by their lack of top-flight systems of higher education?
 And second, is the Asian region any more than a series of nation-states obsessed with guarding their sovereignty -- and do they have the ability to interact peacefully and constructively, much as the European Union is trying to do, to pool their individual strengths for the betterment of their region and the world beyond it? 
 The possibility of rebuilding Nalanda University goes to the heart of both those issues. Founded in 427 in northeastern India, not far from what is today the southern border of Nepal, and surviving until 1197, Nalanda was one of the first great universities in recorded history. It was devoted to Buddhist studies, but it also trained students in fine arts, medicine, mathematics, astronomy, politics and the art of war. 
 The university was an architectural and environmental masterpiece. It had eight separate compounds, 10 temples, meditation halls, classrooms, lakes and parks. It had a nine-story library where monks meticulously copied books and documents so that individual scholars could have their own collections. It had dormitories for students, perhaps a first for an educational institution, housing 10,000 students in the university's heyday and providing accommodations for 2,000 professors. Nalanda was also the most global university of its time, attracting pupils and scholars from Korea, Japan, China, Tibet, Indonesia, Persia and Turkey. 
 The university died a slow death about the time that some of the great European universities, including those in Oxford, England, and Bologna, Italy, were just getting started, and more than half a millennium before Harvard or Yale were established. Its demise was a result of waning enthusiasm for Buddhism in India, declining financial support from successive Indian monarchs and corruption among university officials. The final straw was the burning of the buildings by Muslim invaders from what is now Afghanistan.
 But Nalanda represents much of what Asia could use today -- a great global university that reaches deep into the region's underlying cultural heritage, restores many of the peaceful links among peoples and cultures that once existed, and gives Asia the kind of soft power of influence and attraction that it doesn't have now. The West has a long tradition of rediscovering its ancient Greek and Roman roots, and is much stronger for that. Asia could and should do the same, using the Nalanda project as a springboard but creating a modern, future-oriented context for a new university.
 At the Asian summit meeting next week, a consortium led by Singapore and including India, Japan and others will discuss raising the $500 million needed to build a new university in the vicinity of the old site and perhaps another $500 million to develop the roads and other infrastructure to make the institution work. The problem is that the key Asian officials are not thinking big enough. There is more talk about making Nalanda a cultural site or a center for philosophy than a first-rate modern university. The financial figures being thrown around are a fraction of the endowments of Harvard, Yale or Columbia today. A bolder vision is in order. 
 The rebuilt university should strive to be a great intellectual center, as the original Nalanda once was. This will be exceedingly difficult to achieve; even today, Asia's best universities have a long way to go to be in the top tier. In a recent ranking of universities worldwide, Newsweek included only one Asian institution, the University of Tokyo, in the world's top 25. In a similar tally by The Times of London, there are only three non-Western universities in the top 25. 
 The original Nalanda might have been the first to conduct rigorous entrance exams. The old university had world-class professors who did groundbreaking work in mathematical theorems and astronomy. It produced pre-eminent interpreters and translators of religious scriptures in many languages. 
 The new Nalanda should try to recapture the global connectedness of the old one. All of today's great institutions of higher learning are straining to become more international in terms of their student body, their professors, their research and their course content. But Asian universities are way behind. A new Nalanda, starting as it will from scratch, could set a benchmark for mixing nationalities and cultures, for injecting energy and direction into global subjects and for developing true international leaders.
 In the old days, Nalanda was a Buddhist university, but it was remarkably open to many interpretations of that religion. Today it could perform a vital role consistent with its original ethos -- to be an institution devoted to religious reconciliation on a global scale. 
 Today, Nalanda's opportunity is to exploit what is lacking in so many institutions of higher education. That includes great medical schools that focus on delivering health care to the poor, law schools that emphasize international law, business schools that focus on the billions of people who live on two dollars a day but who have the potential to become tomorrow's middle class, and schools that focus intensely on global environmental issues. Can Asia pull this off? Financially, it should be easy. China's foreign exchange reserves just broke all global records and reached $1 trillion. And Japan's mountain of cash isn't that far behind. 
 But the bigger issue is imagination and willpower. It is not clear that the Asian nations are prepared to unite behind anything concrete except trade agreements, either for their benefit or the world's. It appears doubtful that with all their economic prowess, and their large armies, they understand that real power also comes from great ideas and from people who generate them, and that truly great universities are some of their strongest potential assets. I would like to be proved wrong in these judgments. How Asia approaches the resurrection of Nalanda will be a good test.

HEADLINE: As 109th Congress Expires, Jockeying Starts for 110th

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
The 109th Congress stumbled toward an angry close early Saturday as the Republican majority used its last hours of power to try to enact broad tax and trade legislation while Democrats accused Republicans of saddling them with a fiscal mess to clean up when they take control next month.
 With minutes to spare before a midnight deadline on Friday, Congress approved a stop-gap measure to keep money flowing to federal agencies at current or reduced levels through Feb. 15, because this Congress has not passed regular annual spending bills. 
The failure to dispose of the most basic Congressional work sparked recriminations over who was to blame as leaders of the House Appropriations Committee lashed out at the Senate. Representative David R. Obey of Wisconsin, the senior Democrat on the spending panel, called the temporary financing ''a blatant admission of abject failure by the most useless Congress in modern times.'' 
 As a result of the spending impasse, Democrats will be forced to deal with the leftover money issues as soon as the new Congress convenes in January.
 ''It is not just that they turned out the lights -- they took the light bulb,'' said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who will join the Democratic leadership in the next Congress.
 Even as the 109th Congress was expiring, the parties were maneuvering for the 110th. During the midterm election campaign, Democrats pounded Republicans for taking pay increases while not increasing the federal minimum wage, and they had planned to take action Friday to block the next Congressional raise. But Republicans added to the stop-gap measure a provision to block any Congressional raise until Feb. 15. 
 Throughout the day, House and Senate leaders put most of their energy behind legislation to normalize trade with Vietnam, grant trade benefits to Haiti and Andean countries, restore about $38 billion in popular tax breaks, block a cut in Medicare payments to doctors and open a stretch of the eastern Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas exploration.
 While the House approved the tax and trade legislation, Senate opposition threatened speedy acceptance. A few critics raised objections to the Vietnam trade proposal, the prospect of cheaper textile imports from Haiti and the overall costs. The leadership was trying to ease those complaints and send lawmakers home.
 Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire and the chairman of the Budget Committee, said the trade and tax measures represented the sort of fiscal management that caused voters to turn out Republicans in the House and the Senate in last month's elections.
 ''They did so, I think in large part, because they were tired of our hypocrisy as a party on the issue of fiscal responsibility,'' Mr. Gregg said, citing the inclusion of such special-interest provisions as more than $4 billion to clean up abandoned coal mines. ''It would appear that their concerns are justified.''
 Some frustrated lawmakers said the chaotic ending of the session was fitting, with major legislation assembled behind closed doors by senior lawmakers and then rushed to the floor. That was typical, they said, of how business had been done in a highly partisan atmosphere. ''This is another example of how not to legislate,'' said Representative Sander M. Levin, Democrat of Michigan.
 The incoming Senate Democratic and Republican leaders said Friday that they would try to set a new tone, beginning the new session on Jan. 4 with a joint closed caucus to explore ways to work together.
 ''Senate Republicans intend to be as cooperative as possible to help the Senate get off to a good start next year,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the incoming Republican leader, who agreed to the meeting proposed by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.
 The legislation approved Friday was full of incentives to attract enough support to get it over the finish line. The tax measure, for instance, passed the House on a 367-45 vote. It extends a research and development tax credit sought by the business community, renews an income tax deduction for college tuition costs, allows taxpayers in states without income taxes to deduct sales taxes on their returns and allows teachers to deduct up to $250 for supplies bought with their own money.
 The trade portion of the legislation drew more opposition in both the House and the Senate, particularly the push to establish normal trade relations with Vietnam and grant trade benefits for Haiti and the South American nations of Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador. It passed the House on a 212-to-184 vote and was shipped to the Senate.
 The Bush administration sought the normal trade status with Vietnam, saying it would allow American companies to take advantage of that nation's entry into the World Trade Organization and its booming economy. But some lawmakers questioned Vietnam's record on human rights and raised issues dating back to the Vietnam War.
 Representative Nathan Deal, Republican of Georgia, said the trade recognition would reward the communist government of Vietnam, which he said continued to resist efforts by Americans to seek the remains of family members lost in the conflict. But Representative Rob Simmons, a Connecticut Republican and Vietnam veteran, said the trade pact could help improve relations.
 Democrats and some Republicans said the stop-gap spending bill could potentially reduce government services by holding spending in many agencies at or below current levels. In response to criticism that veterans might have to wait for care, the legislation allows the Department of Veterans Affairs to shift up to $684 million within its budget to cover health care. 
 As the House moved toward adjournment, Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, the Illinois Republican who will lose his post when the Democrats take over, gave his farewell speech.
 ''On January 4, I will be privileged to rejoin you on these benches where my heart is, here on the floor of the House,'' Mr. Hastert said.

HEADLINE: Bangladeshi Peace Prize Winner Will Urge Banks to Lend to the Poor

BYLINE: By WALTER GIBBS

DATELINE: OSLO, Dec. 9 

 BODY:
Bangladesh's ''banker to the poor,'' Muhammad Yunus, said he would use his newfound celebrity as this year's Nobel Peace Prize laureate to urge banking and investment institutions everywhere to make small business loans to the poorest people they can find. 
 ''This is a movement that is going around the world,'' he said at a press conference. At a ceremony here Sunday, he and the bank he founded, Grameen Bank, are to be awarded the prize. 
 Dr. Yunus, 66, is credited with inventing microfinance, or the practice of lending small amounts of money to destitute people, 30 years ago. The idea is for borrowers -- almost all of them women -- to start or expand money-making enterprises like weaving, rope-making, vegetable farming and holding livestock.
 He said Bangladesh, with its population of 145 million, was en route to halving the number of people classified as extremely poor by 2015, thanks in part to the availability of microloans as small as $12 and averaging $200. ''If Bangladesh can do it, anyone can do it,'' he said. 
 The prize is to be awarded in equal parts to Dr. Yunus and the Dhaka-based bank, 90 percent of which is owned cooperatively by the 6.7 million people who currently owe it money. The bank's half of the peace prize will be given to board member Mosammat Taslima Begum, who said today that she first borrowed money from Grameen to buy a goat, then borrowed more to buy three goats. Now she owns a plot of land with an income-producing mango patch.
 Dr. Yunus urged the United States to recalibrate its strategy for fighting terrorism and to address what he said were its ''root causes'': poverty and injustice. He said microfinance was a tool for peace as well as prosperity, and lauded the Norwegian Nobel Committee for making the connection. 
 ''Poverty is a threat to peace,'' said Dr. Yunus, a native Bangladeshi with a Ph.D. in economics from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. ''This has been talked about before but never in such a resounding manner.''
 In the 30 years since he started lending money to the poor more than 3,000 other institutions have emerged to provide loans of a similar nature. Grameen Bank requires no collateral of its borrowers but charges most of them interest of about 30 percent per year. Currently there are 85,000 beggars in the portfolio who are exempt from interest charges, Dr. Yunus said. The high payback rate -- estimated at 99 percent -- has drawn banks like Citigroup, ABN Ambro and Deutsche Bank into the microcredit market, though Dr. Yunus has criticized them for largely ignoring the poorest of the poor, whose goal may be no more than a tin roof.
 ''Nobody should be left out of the financial system,'' he said today, adding than two-thirds of the global population has no access to banking.
 Resistance by conservative Muslims who originally opposed Grameen Bank's business dealings with women and its reliance on interest charges has largely evaporated, Dr. Yunus said. He characterized the remaining opponents as a ''fringe.''
 He said female loan recipients were far better than men at saving and using proceeds to benefit all family members. And without the ability to charge interest, he said, there would be no bank.
 ''This is a self-sustaining system,'' he said. ''If we didn't take interest, the whole system would become dependent on somebody's charity. To reach billions of people, this has to be a business.''

HEADLINE: Complaining Correctly Can Pay Off 

BYLINE: By DAMON DARLIN. 
E-mail: yourmoney@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I WANT to speak to a supervisor.''
 To many a frustrated customer contacting a call center for help, those seemed to be the magic words.
The other magic words that customers may have spewed, thinking they would bring a quicker response to a problem, are unprintable in this newspaper. There was a time when anger and escalation might have been effective as strategies to remove a charge on a bill or obtain a discount on a new product or a refund. But that was back when call center representatives were judged on how fast they got a person off the phone. 
 There is a new philosophy taking hold. The focus is on leaving customers satisfied because happy customers tend to buy more products or recommend a company's product or service to others. That may seem rather obvious -- indeed, you might have explained that with some exasperation to a call center employee -- but companies are now embracing it.
 ''I wouldn't say it is a full-scale swing,'' said Linda G. Shea, a senior vice president in the customer loyalty practice of the Opinion Research Corporation, a market research firm, ''but there is a swing.'' 
 The timing couldn't have been better during a year full of battery recalls, malfunctioning digital cameras, credit card interest rate increases and cellphone plan changes. Holiday gift-giving will set off a wave of calls for technical support and billing inquiries. New attitudes in call centers call for new strategies from consumers. 
 So we spoke to a supervisor. And we spoke to other call center managers to get some advice on the best methods for getting what you want.
 ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS -- The first thing most consumers encounter when contacting a call center is a voice recognition system. The disembodied voice asks a series of questions. The first impulse is to get out of the system because experience has taught us that it is a waste of time. We were not wrong. ''A lot of companies made it impossible to get to a representative,'' Ms. Shea said. 
 The questions asked by a properly designed system are supposed to lead the customer to the representative who specializes in the customer's particular product, service or problem. The more sophisticated systems can even identify to the representative how valuable a customer that caller is to the company.
 Trying to get out of the automated system by punching zero or another series of telephone buttons can result in being switched to a generalist who will only take more time to diagnose and solve a problem.
 The best advice is stick with it and have any necessary information at your fingertips, like account number or product model number and serial number. (Be prepared to repeat that information.)
 Count on spending some time upfront. ''People have to be ready to troubleshoot,'' said Michael Garrison, who runs Dell's call center in the Philippines. ''It will take some time to work through those issues and people have to be in that frame of mind.'' 
 STAY ON THE LINE -- In old-fashioned call centers, the representatives were judged on how many calls they answered and the average speed of the answers. It often didn't matter to the representative whether the problem was solved. The best strategy for the employee was to get rid of you. Because enlightened call center managers have discarded that time metric, they are measuring the employee on whether the problem was solved on the first call. 
 The pressure is on the representative to find a way to make you happy in a single call with no transfers. Suddenly, you have a little leverage.
 LET THEM, NOT YOU, ESCALATE -- It has made sense to try to reach a supervisor because those in authority have more power to grant concessions. But John Birrer, vice president for customer service operations at T-Mobile, the cellphone company, disagrees. ''It's a misconception that if you escalate to a higher level you get better resolution,'' he said. In the new call centers, representatives are given more latitude -- they call it empowerment -- to rectify a problem.
 ''They are empowered to do things that make business sense,'' he said. The T-Mobile representatives usually do not need to go to a supervisor to get permission to replace a phone or offer a discount on a calling plan. 
 DON'T THREATEN TO BOLT -- ''What we've created is a culture of switching where there is no loyalty anymore,'' Ms. Shea of Opinion Research said.
 In the last few years, more companies are linking that behavior to their call centers, she said. ''There has been an awful lot of change in the customer contact environment,'' she said.
 So don't ruin it by saying you plan to leave. Call center managers say they drum the idea that customers have a choice into their employees. ''We know they have that option whether they say it or not,'' Mr. Birrer said. ''We know the threat is there.''
 They are also aware of how a call gone wrong has a way of finding its way to the Internet to do further damage. Consumerist.com for example, posted a recording of an AOL customer given a rough time for trying to cancel dial-up service. The incident got coverage on television news programs and in newspapers.
 Telling the representatives you are ready to jump ship makes them less likely to make an effort to keep you because you may get classified as a lost cause. ''Why should I give them credit if they aren't going to stay with us?'' he said. 
 A better approach is to embrace the touchy-feely conflict-resolution language they use: ''Can you help me with this? I'd really like this to work.'' 
 DON'T GET MAD; BE PERSISTENT -- No one likes to be screamed at. Many of the call center people say that yelling is not an effective method for getting what you want. But they never say it is an ineffective method either. 
 They admit they have to deal with you when you think you catch more flies with vinegar than honey. ''Honestly, we embrace it,'' said Ofelia Penney, an associate director who supervisors 130 representatives at the Verizon call center in Rancho Cordova, Calif. ''We will do whatever is possible to turn that customer around.'' 
 USE THE NEW TECHNOLOGY -- Sometimes talking to a human is not the best thing. Often, the company's Web site has the information you need. Web chat, in which you have a live written dialogue with a company employee about a problem, is best for people with some technical expertise.
 At the Lands' End site, for instance, a small window pops up in your browser and queries are typed, like instant messaging. Each response lags at least 15 to 20 seconds so the process seems interminable as the representative asks a series of questions.
 Some companies prefer that you try the online remedies first, because it is less costly to operate. But some of them also realize that Web chat or e-mail message exchanges are time-consuming and irritating so they let consumers choose their method.
 Of course, sometimes old-fashioned face-to-face contact works best. Apple Computer has engendered considerable good feeling from customers with its ''genius bar'' inside its 160 Apple stores. Brandyn Bowden, sitting in the San Francisco store with a newly purchased video iPod that did not show videos, was willing to wait in a line 10 people long, rather than place a phone call for help. 
 ''It never even crossed my mind,'' he said. ''If I could have brought my Dell laptop into a place like this, it would have been a lot better.''

HEADLINE: Northwest Air to Hire Adviser, and Talk of a Merger Starts

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED; Jeff Bailey contributed reporting from Chicago.

 BODY:
Northwest Airlines plans to hire Evercore Partners as a financial adviser, signaling that Northwest, the nation's fifth-largest airline, may be considering a merger.
 According to a hiring agreement that Northwest filed yesterday in federal bankruptcy court in Manhattan, Evercore would collect a $2 million fee if Northwest closed a deal. The investment bank will also collect a $3 million fee upon the carrier's emergence from bankruptcy. 
Northwest's 7.6 percent notes maturing in 2023 rose to $88.25 in trading yesterday, up from $85 before the filing. Its shares jumped 48 percent, to $4.90.
 ''It's probably in Northwest's interest to evaluate various M.& A. outcomes and really maximize value for its creditors,'' said William T. Warlick of Fitch Ratings.
 The most likely suitors for Northwest, analysts said, are American Airlines, a unit of AMR; Continental Airlines; and Delta Air Lines. All have strong Southern routes that would complement Northwest's network with its northern Midwest hubs. Northwest and Continental already have a code-sharing agreement for their flights, noted Bill Harrell of Harrell Associates, an airline industry consultant.
 A Northwest spokesman said the airline declined to comment beyond the filing. A spokesman for Evercore declined to comment.
 Because Northwest is in bankruptcy protection, any plan to emerge from bankruptcy must be approved by its creditors. Scott L. Hazan, a lawyer representing the official unsecured creditors committee, declined to comment. 
 Analysts have seen Northwest as a potential takeover target since it entered bankruptcy protection in September 2005. And many investors and analysts have argued that the airline industry needs to consolidate to survive. Last month, US Airways announced an $8 billion hostile offer for Delta, a bid that was quickly rebuffed by Delta, also in bankruptcy protection. US Airways itself emerged from bankruptcy this year after merging with America West Airlines.
 Northwest, which has hubs in Detroit and Minneapolis-St. Paul, also draws significant revenue from its trans-Pacific routes. The airline has also been a partner with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines on several European routes.
 ''A lot of people would be willing to give their eyeteeth to get their hands on the Pacific international routes,'' Mr. Harrell said.
 Yet potential problems would await a Northwest sale. As an airline using both Airbus and Boeing planes, Northwest would need to integrate with a partner's own fleet. Moreover, as with any airline merger, there are antitrust issues for regulators to weigh.
 Perhaps the biggest potential problem for a Northwest buyer is the airline's clashes with its labor unions. In October, the airline reached a contract agreement with its mechanics' union, which had maintained a yearlong strike to protest wage cuts. It has also struggled in negotiations with the unions of its pilots and flight attendants.
 Still, should Northwest end up in merger talks with another airline, that could weaken Delta's defense against the takeover proposal from US Airways. Delta has yet to file its plan for exiting bankruptcy, but a large part of its argument for remaining independent is that a merger with US Airways entails too many risks -- presumably the same risks that Northwest faces.
 Evercore's team will be led by its chairman, Roger C. Altman.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 20, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 9 about Northwest Airlines' hiring of a financial adviser misstated the given name of an airline consultant, from Harrell Associates. He is Bob Harrell, not Bill.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Gets Gifts From Deal Makers and Court 

BYLINE: By MARK A. STEIN

 BODY:
SEVERAL large gifts arrived for investors and for Wall Street. Merger fever and cooling concern about inflation lifted stocks, while a federal appeals court appeared to save big investment firms from having to defend against a huge class-action lawsuit.
 There were disappointments, too, notably for the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, which lost its most promising new drug.

BIG NICHE PLAYER -- Bank of New York agreed to buy Mellon Financial of Pittsburgh for $16.5 billion in stock, a deal that would cement the bank's role as the world's largest securities servicing firm. 
Such firms provide behind-the-scenes services like administering hedge funds directed by others and keeping records on who owns corporate bonds. The combined company will have $16.6 trillion in assets under custody and act as corporate trustee for an additional $8 trillion in assets.
 Bank of New York, which was founded by Alexander Hamilton in 1784, and Mellon, founded more than a century ago by Judge Thomas Mellon, said the merger would let them cut costs by $700 million a year, in part by shedding about one-tenth of their 40,000 employees over three years.
 While the combined company, to be called Bank of New York Mellon, would be based in New York, Mellon's chairman and chief executive, Robert Kelly, said the cash management and stock transfer operations would stay in Pittsburgh.

A DRUG'S SUDDEN DEMISE -- Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceutical company, pulled the plug on its most important experimental drug, a treatment for heart disease, just two days after its chief executive predicted it would be one of the most important drugs in a generation.
 The decision, which came after clinical tests showed the drug was associated with increased risk of heart attack, was a stunning development that will probably seriously damage the company's prospects through the next decades. Pfizer had $51 billion in sales last year.
 Cardiologists had raised concerns about the drug, called torcetrapib, noting that it raised blood pressure in many patients, a serious side effect for a heart medicine. It is unclear whether torcetrapib's failure suggests that other drugs aimed at raising the so-called good cholesterol will also face unexpected problems in trials.
 Pfizer, which recently said it would cut 2,200 jobs in the United States, may lay off as many 10,000 more people in the near future, analysts said.

DODGING A BULLET -- Wall Street banks will not have to face a huge securities class-action lawsuit accusing them of cheating small investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars by manipulating the prices of initial public offerings of technology companies during the market boom of the 1990s, a federal appeals court ruled.
 A three-judge panel of the Federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, said a federal judge overseeing the lawsuit had erred in granting class-action status to 310 investors who had separately contended the banks had awarded shares of hot initial offerings to favored clients to attract investment banking business, conspired with clients to inflate prices by bidding up shares in the market, and created misleading research to lure investors into buying.
 Investors will probably have to pursue their claims individually, in some cases perhaps through arbitration, lawyers involved in the case said. Earlier settlements in the case, in particular a $425 million agreement with J. P. Morgan Chase, could be nullified by this decision. 
 The Supreme Court will hear a related case, in which investment banks seek to insulate themselves from antitrust lawsuits filed by investors because, the banks contend, they are so heavily regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

FRONT-RUNNER STUMBLES -- Acknowledging it has become too bureaucratic to compete effectively against nimbler rivals, Yahoo, the leading Internet destination, said it was restructuring its operations and shuffling its management ranks.
 Daniel L. Rosensweig, the chief operating officer since April 2002, and Lloyd Braun, the former ABC executive who has run Yahoo's media group, will leave, and the chief financial officer, Susan L. Decker, will take on additional responsibilities.
 At the same time, Yahoo is reorganizing itself into three operating units: one focused on its audience, one on its advertisers and publishers, and a third focused on developing technology for the rest of the company.
 The goal is to regain momentum against rivals like Google, which is extending its lead as the top search engine, and MySpace, the social networking site that threatens to take over Yahoo in total audience.
 Farzad Nazem, Yahoo's chief technical officer, will run the technology group, and the company said it would seek outside executives to lead its audience group and to serve as finance chief.

LESS IS MORE BETTER -- The Labor Department said that unit labor costs, a measure of what workers earn that takes into account their productivity, rose more slowly than expected in the third quarter, easing pressure on the Federal Reserve to resume raising interest rates and risk derailing the economy.
 Labor costs rose 2.3 percent in the third quarter, less than a preliminary estimate of 3.8 percent issued last month.
 The government also said that labor costs actually fell in the second quarter by 2.4 percent, reversing an earlier estimate suggesting they had risen 5.4 percent.
 The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet on Tuesday to decide whether to raise short-term interest rates, cut them or leave them steady.

HONOR SYSTEM -- In a scathing report to Congress, the Interior Department's inspector general's office says it found pervasive problems in a program intended to make sure companies pay the royalties they owe on billions of dollars of oil and gas extracted from federal lands.
 While investigators did not estimate the amount of money that the government might be losing, they did say the government was vulnerable to being short-changed because the agency's data were often inaccurate, its officials relied on oil company promises rather than actual records and it reviewed only about 9 percent of all oil and gas leases.
 The report undermines claims by top Interior officials that the department is aggressively pursuing underpayments and outright cheating by companies that drill on property owned by the American public.
 The department's Minerals Management Service, which collects royalties, said it would deliver the plan to act on many of the recommendations within 30 days.

HEADLINE: China, Shy Giant, Shows Signs Of Shedding Its False Modesty 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Dec. 8 

 BODY:
China's Communist Party has a new agenda: it is encouraging people to discuss what it means to be a major world power and has largely stopped denying that China intends to become one soon.
 In the past several weeks China Central Television has broadcast a 12-part series describing the reasons nine nations rose to become great powers. The series was based on research by a team of elite Chinese historians, who also briefed the ruling Politburo about their findings.
 Until recently China's rising power remained a delicate topic, and largely unspoken, inside China. Beijing has long followed a dictum laid down by Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader who died in 1997: ''tao guang yang hui,'' literally to hide its ambitions and disguise its claws. 
 The prescription was generally taken to mean that China needed to devote its energy to developing economically and should not seek to play a leadership role abroad. 
 President Hu Jintao set off an internal squabble two years ago when he began using the term ''peaceful rise'' to describe his foreign policy goals. He dropped the term in favor of the tamer-sounding ''peaceful development.''
 His use of ''rise'' risked stoking fears of a ''China threat,'' especially in Japan and the United States, people told about the high-level debate said. Rise implies that others must decline, at least in a relative sense, while development suggests that China's advance can bring others along.
 Yet this tradition of modesty has begun to fade, replaced by a growing confidence that China's rise is not fleeting and that the country needs to do more to define its objectives.
 With its $1 trillion in foreign exchange reserves, surging military spending and diplomatic initiatives in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Beijing has begun asserting its interests far beyond its borders. Chinese party leaders are acting as if they intend to start exercising more power abroad rather than just protecting their political power at home.
 ''Like it or not, China's rise is becoming a reality,'' says Jia Qingguo, associate dean of the Beijing University School of International Studies. ''Wherever Chinese leaders go these days, people pay attention. And they can't just say, 'I don't want to get involved.' ''
 Itself a major recipient of foreign aid until recently, China this year promised to provide well over $10 billion in low-interest loans and debt relief to Asian, African and Latin American countries over the next two years. It invited 48 African countries to Beijing last month to a conference aimed at promoting closer cooperation and trade.
 Beijing agreed to send 1,000 peacekeepers to Lebanon, its first such action in the Middle East. It has sought to become a more substantial player in a region where the United States traditionally holds far more sway.
 At the United Nations Security Council, China cast aside its longstanding policy of opposing sanctions against other nations. It voted to impose penalties on North Korea, its neighbor and onetime ally, for testing nuclear weapons.
 Officials and leading scholars are becoming a bit less hesitant to discuss what this all might mean. The documentary, on China's main national network, uses the word rise constantly, including its title, ''Rise of the Great Powers.'' It endorses the idea that China should study the experiences of nations and empires it once condemned as aggressors bent on exploitation. 
 ''Our China, the Chinese people, the Chinese race has become revitalized and is again stepping onto the world stage,'' Qian Chengdan, a professor at Beijing University and the intellectual father of the television series, said in an online dialogue about the documentary on Sina.com, a leading Web site.
 ''It is extremely important for today's China to be able to draw some lessons from the experiences of others,'' he said.
 The series, which took three years to make, emanated from a Politburo study session in 2003. It is not a jingoistic call to arms. It mentions China only in passing, and it never explicitly addresses the reality that China has already become a big power.
 Yet its version of history, which partly tracks the work done by Paul Kennedy in his 1980s bestseller, ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' differs markedly from that of the textbooks still in use in many schools.
 Its stentorian narrator and epic soundtrack present the emergence of the nine countries, from Portugal in the 15th century to the United States in the 20th, and cites numerous achievements worthy of emulation: Spain had a risk-taking queen; Britain's nimble navy secured vital commodities overseas; the United States regulated markets and fought for national unity.
 The documentary also emphasizes historical themes that coincide with policies Chinese leaders promote at home. Social stability, industrial investment, peaceful foreign relations and national unity are presented as more vital than, say, military strength, political liberalization or the rule of law.
 In the 90 minutes devoted to examining the rise of the United States, Lincoln is accorded a prominent part for his efforts to ''preserve national unity'' during the Civil War. China has made reunification with Taiwan a top national priority. Franklin D. Roosevelt wins praise for creating a bigger role for the government in managing the market economy but gets less attention for his wartime leadership.
 Government officials minimize the importance of the series. He Yafei, an assistant foreign minister, said in an interview that he had watched only ''one or two episodes.'' He said the documentary should not signal changes in China's thinking about projecting power, saying that colonialism and exploitation ''would go nowhere in today's world.''
 But Mr. He also hinted at a shifting official line. He emphasized China's status as a developing country. But he allowed that others may see things differently.
 ''Whether a country is a regional or a world power, it is not for that country to decide alone,'' he said. ''If you say we are a big power, then we are. But we are a responsible big country. We are a maintainer and builder of the international system.''
 China has in fact emerged as a major power without disrupting the international order, at least so far. It has accepted an invitation by the Bush administration to discuss becoming a ''responsible stakeholder'' in the American-dominated international system.
 Beijing places importance on many world institutions, especially the United Nations, where it holds a veto in the Security Council. It professes a strong commitment to enforcing the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
 Last month Margaret Chan of Hong Kong became the first Chinese to head a major United Nations agency, the World Health Organization. She vowed to build a ''harmonious health world,'' echoing the slogan of harmony promoted by President Hu.
 Yet critics say China is prepared to emerge in a less amicable fashion, if necessary. The Central Intelligence Agency says that China's military spending may be two or three times higher than it acknowledges and that it allocates more to its military than any other country except the United States.
 Beijing has cultivated close ties to countries that provide it with commodities and raw materials, regardless of their human rights records. Sudan, Myanmar and Zimbabwe have all escaped international sanctions in large part because of Chinese protection.
 China's increasing international engagement has also stimulated a more robust academic discussion about its global role and the potential for tensions withthe United States.
 Yan Xuetong, a foreign affairs specialist at Qinghua University in Beijing, argued in a scholarly journal this summer that China had already surpassed Japan, Russia, Britain, France, Germany and India in measures of its economic, military and political power. That leaves it second only to the United States, he said. 
 While the military gap between China and the United States may remain for some time, he argued, China's faster economic growth and increasing political strength may whittle down America's overall advantage.
 ''China will enjoy the status of a semi-superpower between the United States and the other major powers,'' Mr. Yan predicted in the article, which appeared in the China Journal of International Politics.
 He added, ''China's fast growth in political and economic power will dramatically narrow its power gap with the United States.''

HEADLINE: Back to the Moon, Permanently

 BODY:
Three years after President Bush announced an ambitious long-term goal to return astronauts to the Moon and then send them on to Mars, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has finally put some flesh on his nebulous aspirations. This week, the agency announced plans to establish a permanent base on the Moon by 2024, explained why we should want to send astronauts back to a world they visited repeatedly more than three decades ago, and described what they might do when they get there. It was belated justification for a decision that the Bush administration and Congress have already made. But the payoff is distant and the likely future costs very high, leaving it unclear how realistic these aspirations will prove to be. 
 The agency has done a commendably thorough job by consulting some 1,000 experts and 13 other space agencies in fashioning its plans. Such a costly and difficult venture should ideally be pursued cooperatively with other nations, to share the costs and the risks. It would be especially desirable to have multiple ways of reaching the Moon in case the American program runs into problems like those that grounded the shuttles.
What's worrisome about the new plans is their lack of focus. The agency cites six major reasons for returning to the Moon. The most persuasive is to use the Moon as a base to test technologies and operating techniques to be used on future missions to Mars, a more compelling target. It makes sense to first try ''living off the land'' on the Moon, where astronauts are only days away from home should something go wrong, before taking the long leap to Mars. The venture is also justified on scientific, economic, educational and global partnership grounds, and as a step toward eventual settlements on the Moon. 
 The wide sweep of these rationales is reminiscent of the extravagant promises for the space station, which was sold to Congress as a steppingstone to the planets, a scientific and economic bonanza, and a stimulus for students but is still limping along, half finished and far over budget, with greatly diminished expectations for what it can accomplish.
 An even more expansive document -- listing some 180 objectives that the astronauts might pursue on the Moon -- is essentially a wish list compiled after consulting virtually every expert in the world who might have an opinion. The list puts the lie to criticisms that there is almost nothing useful to do on the Moon. But some of the objectives have a pie-in-the-sky quality, like exporting power from the Moon for use on Earth, while others, like observatories on the Moon, might not prove feasible or affordable for decades. The objectives will need to be winnowed and focused if they are to serve as useful guides in pursuing the program.
 If this nation is to continue a human space flight program it makes sense to pick a more exciting destination than a space station circling endlessly in low Earth orbit. Our main concern is that the political proponents of the Moon-Mars adventure will not provide money commensurate with the task. NASA's crowning scientific achievements have come from its unmanned probes to distant worlds and its orbiting observatories. It would be a shame if an underfinanced program to return to the Moon on a permanent basis and then venture on to Mars forced reductions in research programs of higher scientific value.

Law on Distribution of OilIs Set to Pass in Baghdad
Iraqi officials are near agreement on a law that would give the central government the power to distribute current and future oil revenues to provinces or regions based on population, Iraqi and American officials say. A1

One of the most coveted jobs in Iraq does not yet exist: the executioner for Saddam Hussein. 
The death sentence against Mr. Hussein is still under review by an appeals court, but hundreds of people have already started lobbying the prime minister's office for the position. A1

An airstrike by American forces north of Baghdad sparked confusion, with different accounts from American and Iraqi sources. The only thing clear was that at least 20 Iraqis had been killed. A8

Lawyers See Rumsfeld Liability
Lawyers for former detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan argued in federal court that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was personally responsible, and thus legally liable, for acts of torture inflicted on their clients by American military interrogators. A9

Bush Sets Iraq Meetings
President Bush will take part in high-visibility deliberations on Iraq, making visits to the Pentagon and State Department as they participate in an effort to chart a new course in the war. Mr. Bush will also meet with a group of academic and policy experts about Iraq, officials said, and will hold a video teleconference with senior military commanders. A9

Hezbollah Leader Criticized
Lebanon's prime minister, Fouad Siniora, lashed out at Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, in a deeply personal attack during a televised address in which he dismissed the sheik's political ultimatums for more power, saying, ''You are not our Lord and your party is not our Lord.'' A10

New Draft of Iran Sanctions
Europeans produced a revised draft of a Security Council resolution on Iran and said they would introduce it in the hope of a speedy vote on action to curb its nuclear program. The new version narrows the scope of prohibition and punishment to activities that are clearly associated with making a nuclear weapon. A10

Four years after the Coast Guard began an effort to replace nearly its entire fleet of ships, planes and helicopters, the venture has been canceled after hull cracks and engine failures made the first eight boats unseaworthy. A1

Concern Over Rise in Poaching
Elk, deer, antelope, bighorn sheep and other big-game animals are being killed in a wave of poaching that has alarmed state and federal wildlife officials in Nevada and several other Western states. A1

Conservatives Fault Romney
Gov. Mitt Romney, the Massachusetts Republican who has built a presidential campaign on a broad appeal for conservative support, is drawing increased criticism from conservative activists for his advocacy of gay rights in the 1990s. A11

Tense Close for Congress
The 109th Congress stumbled toward an angry close as the Republican majority used its last hours of power to try to enact broad tax and trade legislation while Democrats accused Republicans of saddling them with a fiscal mess to clean up when they take control next month. A14

Panel Reports on Page Scandal
The House ethics committee said that a nine-week investigation into former Representative Mark Foley's conduct had found that Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and other Republican leaders were negligent in not shielding teenagers from inappropriate advances by Mr. Foley. A14

New Warning on Stent Use
Experts recommended that doctors and patients be given stronger warnings about the dangers associated with the use of drug-coated stents in some high-risk patients. A11

Space Priorities Questioned
NASA's administrator, Michael D. Griffin, said that the current period of space exploration will come to be seen as a mistake. ''Viewed from the point of history several decades out,'' he said, ''the period where the United States retreated from the Moon and quite deliberately focused only on low Earth orbit will be seen, to me, a mistake.''

HEADLINE: The Rascals On The Right

BYLINE: By THOMAS B. EDSALL. 
Thomas B. Edsall, who holds the Pulitzer-Moore Chair at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism, is a guest columnist.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
The early jockeying for the Republican presidential nomination reveals a split in the G.O.P. between sociocultural conservatives and the economy/national defense wing, a split likely either to expand Democratic opportunities in 2008 or to produce an exceptionally viable Republican nominee. 
 The most significant development at this stage of the race is the failure of any G.O.P. candidate to emerge as the consensus conservative, uniting white evangelicals, family-values traditionalists, defense hawks, and opponents of the tax and regulatory state. ''There is a vacuum in the field,'' says the Republican pollster Tony Fabrizio, ''a big, gaping hole.'' 
The two Republican candidates leading in polls, John McCain and Rudy Giuliani, both fail the consensus test. Each stands to the left of the party -- well to the left in Giuliani's case -- on the ''traditional values'' issues: sexual mores, family structure, reproductive choice, gay rights, embryonic stem cell research, and so forth. 
 While religious leaders and social conservatives have claimed veto power over Republican presidential candidates, there are at least three reasons to doubt this will take place:
 First, the G.O.P. has a long history of sticking with front-runners. Second, socially conservative political activists in key primary and caucus states are under intense pressure to choose now, accepting the field as it is. McCain has picked up the support of one of Iowa's top Christian power brokers, Marlys Popma, despite his denunciation six years ago of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell as ''agents of intolerance'' who ''shame our faith, our party and our country.'' Third, states such as Michigan, Florida, New Jersey and California are considering advancing their primaries to an early date, Feb. 5. This would weaken the leverage of religious and cultural conservatives who are strongest in the South, and would strengthen the hand of Republicans who are enthusiastic about right-libertarians like McCain and Giuliani.
 Where once party leaders and institutional forces screened candidates for moral rectitude -- or the semblance of it -- the top four candidates in this Republican crop head into the race with nine marriages, five divorces and unknown numbers of extramarital affairs. Among them, only Mitt Romney is viewed as squeaky clean.
 Public Opinion Strategies, a highly respected Republican polling firm, noted in an election post-mortem that the impact of personal scandal ''on the Republican Party has been understated.'' Bill McInturff, a senior partner in the firm, presented data showing that in the closing weeks of the last election, Mark Foley, the Florida Republican who resigned after disclosures that he sent sexually suggestive messages to teenage House pages, had become a better-recognized figure than either Dennis Hastert, the former House speaker, or Nancy Pelosi, his Democratic successor. In October 2006, Foley achieved the dubious distinction of a 69 percent negative rating among respondents, seven points higher than O. J. Simpson and nearly as high as Yasir Arafat. 
 Although Romney has evidently led an uneventful private life, he is trying to forcibly reinvent himself from his incarnation as a Massachusetts governor who favored abortion rights and gay rights -- almost as hard a history to surmount in the G.O.P. as the multiple marriages and divorces of McCain, Giuliani, and Newt Gingrich. (Gingrich set a new standard in nerviness by conducting an affair with a House staffer while leading the drive to impeach President Bill Clinton.) 
 Social-moral conflicts of the sort surfacing in the Republican Party should help the Democrats, if they choose a candidate who can capitalize on Republican disarray. Sexual mores aside, Democrats have been hampered by a long line of candidates who, no matter how virtuous (or not), have been perceived by swing voters as moralizing, elitist, egg-headed, puritanical, do-good scolds -- from Adlai Stevenson to Walter Mondale to Michael Dukakis to Al Gore. 
 Unless the Democratic Party can suppress its inclination to pick such nominees, or can find a way to focus public attention on the opportunistic and grandstanding nature of its opponents, the weakness of social conservatives could turn out to be a Republican strength. The nomination of a McCain, or a Giuliani, could result in the selection of a candidate whose macho posture and rascal charm make for a viable general election nominee.

HEADLINE: How Do You Spend $1.93 Billion?

BYLINE: By Harold O. Levy. 
Harold O. Levy was the New York City schools chancellor from 2000 until 2002.

 BODY:
THE real importance of the recent Court of Appeals decision in the Campaign for Fiscal Equity case -- in which the court found $1.93 billion ''reasonable'' as the additional amount that New York State needs to allocate to provide a ''sound basic education'' for the city's schoolchildren -- is less about how much the state should increase its contribution to the city school system than it is about giving our leaders the chance to solve the problems with public education statewide. Having been a witness for the plaintiffs in the case, I can now say that however much money we ultimately get, the critical question is how we spend it.
 It's a rare opportunity. In many respects, it echoes that moment in 1981 when Richard Ravitch, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, was unexpectedly given the resources to rid the subways of graffiti, modernize the fleet and significantly reduce subway crime. 
Our elected officials should seize this moment to install a new architecture for public education in the 21st century. Here are seven ideas intended to spur their creative juices:
 1. Education should not be the exclusive province of schools. Conscript all of our cultural institutions. Branch libraries should have longer hours, married to the vibrant school library system and converted into ''community learning centers'' -- with trained tutors, individually tailored remedial applications and Web-based coordination of homework assignments between librarians and teachers. 
 2. The youngest learners should have the tiniest classes. Even the notorious ''race gap'' between black and white student performance declines when there are fewer than 18 students in a class. Reduce class size first in the lowest performing schools. Accommodate additional preschool classes in park houses, churches, community rooms, museums, branch libraries and in the many public hospitals the health care facilities commission has just recommended closing. 
 3. Scrap the division between college and high school: education should be seamless from kindergarten through senior year of college. Create more schools like the Bard High School Early College, where every graduate is awarded both a high school diploma and an associate's degree. Introduce college courses and preparatory programs as early as middle school. I firmly believe many more children are capable of high-level work, given half a chance. 
 4. Try pay-for-success strategies. Where students fail to attend school or get passing grades, parents should be paid a modest sum if they can change their children's ways. Some people find such ideas offensive. But an incentive -- if it works -- is invariably less expensive than the cost to society of poorly educated citizens. And studies seem to confirm that both ''bribes'' and penalties do work. In New York City, where 30 percent of public school students are absent one month each year, we need radical measures.
 5. Lengthen the day, shorten the vacation. Start the school day earlier, end it later, reduce free periods and offer both remedial and enrichment classes on weekends. The 2 1/2-month summer vacation, a quaint holdover from an era when children were needed to harvest crops, needs to be more than halved. The reason the American worker is more productive than his European counterpart is that he works longer hours, not that he is more efficient. Extended school time is inevitable, if only so we can keep up with the academic achievements of students in Singapore, India and China.
 6. Resuscitate vocational education. In New York roughly half of our children drop out of high school, and just over half of those who graduate go on to post-secondary education. For the ones who graduate but are not going on to college, we should offer a taste of vocational education, though late in high school to avoid tracking. Community colleges need to do a better job in career education and job placement, rather than only preparing students for entry into four-year institutions, which few pursue.
 7. Use collective bargaining to foster educational innovation. Studies show that teachers reach their full professional capacity by their third year, yet by their fifth year roughly 50 percent have left the profession. Give good teachers the incentives to keep teaching: offer bonuses, limited transfer rights and meaningful professional development for the ones just reaching their prime -- those in the fifth, sixth and seventh years of teaching -- to induce them to stay another year or two. The teachers union can be a partner in making these kinds of constructive contract changes. 
 The increase in financing that the governor-elect, Eliot Spitzer, and the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, had bandied about was nearly $5 billion -- considerably more than what the court has ordered. There is no small irony in the fact that the court majority, which many commentators believe was carefully picked by Governor George Pataki largely to avoid any increases in education financing arising out of this case, has delivered to Mr. Spitzer the freedom to consider how he would like to spend more on education. 
 In the 1970s, Ireland went through such a moment and reinvented its educational system. The result has been one of the most vibrant economies in Europe with the most improved living standard. 
 The Court of Appeals decision and the election of a new governor have created a similar opportunity here where we can take a long view of how public education should be advanced over the next 30 years. If our leaders embrace the moment, they have an opportunity to create a model that could fundamentally change both the educational and economic future of the nation.

HEADLINE: At Holiday Parties, St. Nick Starts to Morph Into Bacchus 

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
THERE were 500 votive candles, a half-dozen Christmas trees, four scantily-clad elves, two caricature artists, one giant inflatable basketball game and a killer skyline view. But what really impressed guests at the party that Fox Interactive Media, an online group, gave on Wednesday was the vintage arcade-style Ms. Pac-Man machine.
 ''That,'' said Adam Sumner, a 23-year-old media planner, ''was awesome.''
The Scotch tasting didn't hurt, either. ''Pairing it with chocolate was really nice,'' said Rohanie Singh, 29, who works in advertising. 
 ''I give this party an 8.5,'' said her friend Michael Jacobson, 29, an Internet consultant. ''It reminds me of the dot-com era. What would make it better is if they had a Santa dancing in a thong on the bar. That would be like a 9.5.''
 The holiday party season is in full swing, and even without a naked Santa, there is a lot going on. Business has been booming at new steakhouses like STK in the meatpacking district and Porter House New York in the Time Warner Center, at the resurrected palaces of excess Le Cirque and the Russian Tea Room, and at the Nokia Theater in Times Square, a newer addition to the music and event circuit. All are fully booked this month -- and into the next -- with events for financial companies, law firms, media conglomerates and tech businesses. 
 Driven by higher salaries in the financial and technology industries and bigger Wall Street bonuses, corporate events are larger, more creative and often costlier than in the recent past, party planners, restaurant owners and banquet managers say. 
 ''We're having a really ridiculous fabulous season,'' said Serena Bass, the Manhattan caterer who has spent more than two decades in the corporate party business. ''Two-thousand four was not so great. Last year was better, and this year is really, really great. The numbers are bigger. Last year we were getting a lot of 150. Now were getting 250, 350, 450.'' 
 Ninety percent of the parties at the Russian Tea Room, which reopened last month, will have caviar and vodka service, at a cost of as much as $500 a person, said Ken Biberaj, a spokesman for the restaurant. Even ice sculptures are back: behind the glowing white bar at the Fox party, held at Studio 450, a loft in Chelsea, there was one in the shape of a giant letter I (for ''Interactive'').
 As lavish as the parties are, they are still not quite up to dot-com era excess. But at a time when the Dow has reached new highs and the haves are evolving into the have mores, these celebrations are more in line with the buoyant economic mood than with the discouraging situation in Iraq. This season, there is a greater willingness to throw more-elaborate parties, complete with themes, video displays and specialty cocktails. 
 ''In the past, we had the idea, 'We're in a war,' '' said Danielle Venokur, the general manager of L'Olivier, a florist and event production company with offices in Chelsea and on the Upper East Side. ''But for some reason, that's not in the forefront of everyone's mind right now.'' She paused before adding: ''That's a little scary.''
 Nonetheless, she said, people are definitely spending more this year, and are not shy about letting it show. ''We're doing a lot more sparkle, a lot more shimmer,'' Ms. Venokur said. ''They're not so scared to be showy.'' 
 To liven up their events even further, many planners are borrowing ideas from clubland and Hollywood, creating plush lounges and adding $5,000 lighting set-ups and video effects. Some are even offering bottle service and V.I.P. seating, where chief executives and other high-ranking officials either occupy a separate area of the party, or have a more private event with, as Ms. Bass put it, ''less loud music, slightly brighter lights and better wine'' before their employees are admitted.
 ''We've gotten several requests for club-style additions to the party,'' said Joseph Cozza, the vice president of sales for banquet spaces at Cipriani. ''Different environments are very popular, either a small lounge area or deluxe bars.''
 One financial group is doing a lavish Art Deco gala, with a red, white and black theme, and a club-style entrance with a red carpet. Another, a real estate firm, had a Studio 54 theme party, complete with custom disco lighting, said Clifton Cloud, the production designer for Cipriani. Video displays are more common, too -- a fifth of this year's parties have them, he said, compared with a tenth last year. 
 And ''everybody wants a specialty cocktail,'' said Marcey Brownstein, the caterer for the Fox party, which featured pomegranate martinis. The night life influence is so pronounced, she said, that it is even affecting the furniture: sofas for lounging are a necessity, and tables and chairs have grown to bar height. 
 Having bottle service or waitresses assigned to couch clusters, Ms. Venokur said, feels ''like you're in a club that's totally new,'' which is especially important for companies with young employees. ''The people running those companies are like in their 40s, and they were just doing the club thing,'' she said. ''They want their party to be cool.''
 Though the V.I.P. seating, especially, does not necessarily engender workplace bonhomie (''It's touchy,'' Ms. Venokur said), the rest of the splurges are appreciated.
 At the Fox party, Ms. Singh was impressed with the choice of wines. ''They went with a Montepulciano instead of the average merlot,'' she said. And Mr. Sumner loved the Scotch. ''You're not going to get that when you're out on a Saturday night with your friends,'' he said.
 Nor will you get hand-rolled cigars and custom ornaments (at a party on Monday for the Web site Thrillist.com), green-screen photos (at the Fox party, guests were made to look like they were on the ''American Idol'' set), and even a fireplace simulated on a giant video screen, complete with crackling sound effects, at Cipriani. (Take that, Channel 11 Christmas log!) 
 For a hedge fund firm, L'Olivier is creating an Aspen chalet-themed gala at the Morgan Library, with Ralph Lauren-style decor and fake animal heads for mounting on the wall, at a cost of about $100,000 (and that's before the food and drinks). 
 And at a luncheon for 80 ladies who do, Donna Soloway, the wife of Richard L. Soloway, the security expert, transformed the second floor of Le Cirque into a winter wonderland on Monday, with silvered pine cones resting on tufts of fake snow, crisp white linens, and tall vases of lilies. Guests like Denise Rich dressed the part, in pearly skirts and suits and fur chapeaux. One woman even donned a Santa hat. (Ivana Trump was an exception; she wore a gray pantsuit.)
 Perhaps because of all the extra attention to detail, the holiday party season, which typically runs for the first few weeks of December, seems too brief to contain this year's extravagances.
 ''Our holiday parties started at the end of November,'' said Jim Brady, the owner of Loft 11, a set of rental spaces on the West Side. ''They're starting earlier and they're going later. It's going right into the Christmas week, which it never used to do.''
 January, once considered a dead month when only restaurants and other service industry businesses had parties, is now an established option for companies that want their event to stand out (and their guests to recover from the holiday hustle), Ms. Bass said.
 Of course, not everyone is experiencing a holiday surge. ''We're having exactly the same number of events that we've had in the past,'' said Julian Niccolini, an owner of the Four Seasons. Still, even he admitted that the season for them had stretched out. ''It's very good for business, but I don't know if it's very good for the individuals,'' he said. ''People get party burnout.''
 Perhaps some do. But others are just as eager to keep the holiday spirit going. ''For the first time, we're taking a lot of orders for a year's time,'' Ms. Bass said. ''We're talking about next year's Christmas party in January.''

HEADLINE: Diplomat-Parking-Violation Corruption Index, The 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER SHEA

 BODY:
Social scientists who study corruption have long debated the relative importance of legal incentives and cultural norms (''people like us don't do that'') in the decision to act for or against the public good. Many economists lean toward the view that most people will act similarly, given similar incentives, and that cultural norms are less important. 
In an ingenious study published in June, however, the Columbia University economist Raymond Fisman and Edward Miguel of the University of California at Berkeley argued that culture plays a powerful role. The two scholars studied parking tickets that were racked up in Manhattan by diplomats from 146 countries who were posted to the United Nations. In a situation in which every diplomat essentially received an invitation to be corrupt, diplomats from nations with ''clean'' governments said, ''No, thanks.''
 The study began with the observation that, until late 2002, there was essentially zero enforcement of parking rules where diplomats were concerned. Diplomats were ticketed, but few if any cars were towed, and no one demanded payment. Using public records stretching back to 1997, Fisman and Miguel identified which diplomats had delinquent tickets, and how many -- 150,000 in all, representing more than $18 million in fines.
 If incentives trumped culture, you would suppose that diplomats from every nation would cheat. But in fact, attaches from Canada, Ireland, Scandinavian nations and Japan evidently drove around the block till they found a spot. (Diplomats with few or no unpaid tickets also tended to get few tickets, period.) The worst offenders, meanwhile, came from Kuwait (246 unpaid tickets per diplomat), Egypt, Chad, Sudan, Bulgaria, Mozambique, Albania, Angola and Senegal. This behavior correlated strongly with the scores of diplomats' home countries on a measure of public corruption compiled by World Bank researchers. 
 Of course, legal incentives were hardly irrelevant: over time, individual diplomats from ''clean'' countries did cheat more, as they learned how the system worked. But the initial scofflaws' cheating grew even faster. (An interesting side note: the more anti-American the population of a diplomat's home country, the more likely he or she got tickets.) Diplomats, Fisman and Miguel concluded, ''bring the social norms or corruption culture of their home countries with them.'' CHRISTOPHER SHEA
