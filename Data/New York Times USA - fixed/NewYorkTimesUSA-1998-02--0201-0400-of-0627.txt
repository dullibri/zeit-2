HEADLINE: Break a (Bendable) Leg, Barbie!;
It's Show Time for a Cast of Thousands at the Toy Fair

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS 

 BODY:
Barbie was rehearsing her lines yet again, gesturing and smiling in a glittering fantasy showroom inhabited by workmen who were too desperately busy to listen. "This year," she was saying, "we have Barbie and Ken featured as Dana Scully and Fox Mulder of 'The X-Files.' It's the first time Barbie and Ken have been featured as F.B.I. agents!"
A designer, pushing a paint roller to touch up a wall in Barbie white, never looked up. An electrician took no notice. Barbie surveyed the room after completing her spiel and shook her head. "Got to get this on the tip of my tongue before show time," said Barbie, a New York actress whose real name is Jeanne Jones. 
 It is showtime with a vengeance at the American International Toy Fair, the most prestigious trade show of the $20 billion toy industry, which opens tomorrow.
For weeks, throughout the six-block toy district in Manhattan, an area bounded by 21st and 27th Streets, Madison Avenue and the Avenue of the Americas, workers have been toiling to prepare the industry's annual carnival, stage set and high-stakes crap shoot, in which companies gamble millions on attracting buyers, retailers and securities analysts.
"It's not just like opening a Broadway show -- it's like opening all of them at once," said Thomas S. Arbuckle, director of the Toy Center at Fifth Avenue and 23d Street.
This year 20,000 buyers from 50 countries will check out the wares of 1,695 exhibitors from 23 countries. For five days, the fairgoers will jostle one another in the city's 430 toy showrooms, and jam the famously overcrowded elevators in the Toy Center. Then the fair, which is not open to the public, will continue at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for four more days.
The trade show is a Brigadoon of extravaganzas, summoning up an elaborate multimedia universe for a week or so, then fading into the mist. And though toy companies pay from $20,000 to $100,000 in annual rent and maintenance, the majority of the showrooms rented by out-of-town toy makers are unused for the rest of the year.
With only 320 shopping days before Christmas, the toy companies are spending $28 million to prepare the showrooms for the fair this year, according to the Toy Manufacturers of America, the industry's trade group, which sponsors the show.
Beneath its sparkling, fun-loving surface, the Toy Fair is an engine of employment for thousands of display builders, designers and construction workers, as well as about 800 actors and actresses who are hired as toy demonstrators. New York City derives more than $200 million in economic benefit from the trade show, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau.
Mattel and Hasbro, the two largest toy makers, will not discuss their spending, but David A. Miller, president of the toy manufacturers' group, estimated that their Toy Fair presentations and showrooms cost $5 million apiece, including cafeteria operations to feed thousands of buyers.
Backstage last week was a bedlam of whirring drills and thwocking hammers, a ballet of unloading and lugging. Corridors were jammed with porters wheeling in displays, trying not to run over workers scurrying to fix everything that was broken.
"Yesterday we put in 16 hours; that's about average," said Oscar Gruchalski, an electrician working in the Toy Center.
On the streets outside the Toy Center, there has been Ryder-truck lock. Drivers have arrived as early as 3 A.M., lining up to deliver showroom stage sets and merchandise. "The line of trucks backs up from the Toy Center all the way to Seventh Avenue," Mr. Arbuckle said.
The fair has been an annual event in the Toy Center since 1934. "The current emphasis on lavish showrooms began in the 1950's, when the manufacturers began to use television to market toys," Mr. Miller said.
"We feel competition with the other showrooms," said Gene Morra, the marketing vice president at Bandai America Inc., who conducted three dress rehearsals during the week. "The pressure is tremendous. Last year, there were 65 action-figure lines here, but 10 did all the sales. The other 55 gambled everything and lost."
Bandai, which sells the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and the Tamagotchi electronic pets, has five galleries in its showroom, and its construction crew of six has worked 18 hours a day, 7 days a week since the beginning of December. Bandai employs 13 actors and actresses as demonstrators.
All week in the showrooms, knots of actors have been running their lines, monitoring audition calls and asking each other questions like, "Are you going to yoga tonight?" In the toy corridors, the joke has it, the show-business good-luck greeting is not "break a leg" but, rather, "break a poseable limb."
The toy demonstrator jobs are much sought after, bringing actors $200 to $400 a day. "Thousands of actors are struggling for jobs while I get to play with these cool toys," said Christopher Wilkes, who wields a light saber as Luke Skywalker in the Hasbro showroom.
"I love it, this is the fast food of acting," said Kent Heacock, a New York actor who plays the Red Power Ranger in the Bandai showroom. "And it's a nice cash infusion," he said, adding that this will be his sixth Toy Fair appearance.
The pre-fair frenzy is a festival of incongruity. One afternoon Mark Smith, an art director, was encountered on West 23d Street in the company of Reptar, a five-foot-high green dinosaur with angry orange eyes. The problem? The three-foot-wide dinosaur, a character in the Nickelodeon series "Rugrats," would not fit through the Toy Center door, which is two and a half feet wide.
"At Toy Fair, everything that can go wrong will go wrong," Mr. Smith said. Soon, he solved the problem: he directed his crew to take the door off its hinges.
Behind the scenes, in the Hasbro showroom, there are eight "toy doctors" on call to fix broken demonstration toys and prototypes. In the Bandai showroom, Mikako Kawai walks about the hallways carrying a key chain holding 10 electronic Tamagotchi virtual-reality pets used in showroom demonstrations, making sure they don't expire.
Then there is Jennifer Simon, a "floater" in the showroom of Oddzon, a Hasbro subsidiary that makes Koosh toys, which resemble furry rubber balls. Ms. Simon has mastered the acting parts of six other demonstrators, and stands in so they can take breaks.
Invariably, a Toy Fair opening is a last-minute operation. "I remember one year at 7 A.M., while the buyers were coming through the front door, the carpet was still being swept at the back door," said Jean McKenzie, who heads the $1.9 billion Barbie business for Mattel.
In past years there have been disasters, ranging from snowstorms to elevator failures and wildcat strikes. Toys have broken in mid-demonstration before key buyers.
Last year at Hasbro, days before the show, a malfunctioning sprinkler system dumped 300,000 gallons into the showroom, flooding it with a foot of water and drenching exhibits.
"The show must go on, so we turned it around in 24 hours," said Gene Barbieri, the construction superviser. Hasbro celebrated by handing out "I Survived the Flood" T-shirts.
And Mr. Morra of Bandai recalled the year that the chief executive of another toy company that he once worked for "surveyed the showroom at midnight before the opening," he said, "and told us that he wanted the first room of the show to be the last, and the last to be the first." The exhausted crew worked all night to reposition the exhibits, facing them in the opposite direction.
Toy giants devote tremendous resources to the fair. Hasbro, the second-largest toy maker, offers 50 galleries full of toys and games in the three floors of its building on West 23d Street. The company hired 56 toy demonstrators this year and employed 214 full-time workers to prepare the showroom.
Hasbro's showroom statistics might impress Ripley: this year the company revved up 70 tractor-trailers to deliver sets and merchandise. The displays required 60,000 nails and screws, and enough paint to cover 1,333 houses. During the Toy Fair, Hasbro will use up 700,000 watts of electricity (enough to light 70 houses) and will generate enough refuse to fill a football field three feet deep with trash.
Mattel, the world's largest toy company, has 200 rooms on four floors of its building at Sixth Avenue and 22d Street, 20 of the rooms devoted solely to Barbie. Mattel hired 180 actresses and actors to demonstrate its toy lines this year, and employed 300 people on site to assemble its showrooms.
This year Mattel will introduce its "Teen Scene" Barbie, the first of the new dolls offering a Barbie with less makeup, softer features, a wider waist and smaller bust.
"I feel I have the range to play both Barbies," Ms. Jones said with a laugh.
Ms. Jones had paused to visit the Mattel cafeteria in the company of Flip 'N Dive Barbie (actually, Jennifer Clippinger) and International Barbie (Sharon Polo, by name). "You feel some pressure, representing the hottest-selling toy in the market," said Ms. Clippinger, a New York actress -- who, when not flipping and diving, is a Rockette.
And what of the after-show letdown? "It's like the carnival in winter," Mr. Miller, the toy manufacturer's president, said.
But for now, Ms. Jones was heading back to the showroom again, to perfect her "X-Files" presentation. "As you can see," she intoned to a room that seemed without ears, "Barbie and Ken are carrying their authentic F.B.I. badges and credentials, on their continuing search for the truth."

HEADLINE: At Bellevue, Luring Back New Mothers With Luxury

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN 

 BODY:
Kevin Masaquiza was born last Wednesday in a big double bed, in a room with glorious views of the East River. Flower-flecked paper covered the walls, which were decorated with bright framed pictures. In the corner of the room was a glass-enclosed Jacuzzi, where his mother could have relaxed while she was in labor.
By the looks of it, Ines Masaquiza could have been delivering her second son in a luxury Manhattan hotel. In fact, Kevin's mother, a sewing-machine operator, was the first woman to give birth in Bellevue Hospital Center's new birthing center, which opens officially tomorrow. 
 The lavish birthing room hardly squares with the image of Bellevue, the oldest public hospital in the country; Bellevue is better known for providing care to prisoners chained to their beds, police officers injured in the line of duty and all manner of trauma victims.
Luxury and Bellevue might never have appeared in the same sentence, but the new birthing center is gleaming, beautiful and luxurious, and it is part of a multimillion-dollar attempt to reverse a trend that is troubling to public hospitals in the city: the defection of low-income, Medicaid-insured pregnant women to private hospitals that once shunned them.
"There was a time when public hospitals could depend on their Medicaid deliveries because nobody else wanted those patients, but that time has passed," said Larry Gage, president of the National Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, a trade group in Washington. "Investing in holding on to those maternity patients is essential because it affects the overall economic well-being of public hospitals and their mission of caring for the poor."
Struggling to generate revenue when managed care companies have slashed reimbursement rates and shortened patients' hospital stays, private hospitals in the city and around the country have turned their marketing efforts to pregnant women with Medicaid coverage.
Medicaid rates once seemed low and undesirable, but managed care companies have whittled the fees they pay so much that Medicaid rates are suddenly attractive to all providers. In 1996, the average Medicaid fee for a normal delivery was about $3,000 -- competitive with many managed care payments.
Dangling free infant car seats, baby formula and fancy night-of-birth dinners as lures, private hospitals in New York and around the nation have persuaded expectant mothers on public assistance to give birth in their maternity wards.
Left in the lurch, however, have been the public hospitals, which cared for these low-income women when private hospitals had no desire for them or for the comparatively meager childbirth fees that Medicaid was willing to pay.
Although private hospitals have embraced Medicaid patients for other medical treatments, health experts say that the courtship of pregnant women has been especially fierce because births are considered lucrative for several reasons:
*Deliveries are generally considered low cost and low risk.
*Women tend to make the medical decisions for their families, and if they are pleased with the maternity care, they are likely to return to a hospital for all their family needs.
*Word-of-mouth is strong among expectant mothers, so a woman who has a good experience is likely to recommend a hospital to her pregnant friends.
The Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the 11 public hospitals in New York City, has been stunned by the shift of Medicaid deliveries to private competitors. From July to December 1997, about 80 women gave birth each day at all of the corporation's hospitals -- 10 fewer than in the same period of 1996. That drop cost the system at least $11 million last year.
"We saw that trend, and we knew we had to reverse it," said Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the hospitals corporation. In many cases, he noted, women who went to public clinics for their prenatal care, for which there is a fairly low fee, jumped to private hospitals for the births, which involve larger payments.
In response, Dr. Marcos said, the public hospitals corporation began a major effort to dress up its maternity wards, beginning with Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan, Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, Kings County Hospital Center in Brooklyn and Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens.
The corporation has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to hang prettier curtains and soft-colored wallpaper, put framed prints on the walls and add comfortable easy chairs, making the rooms feel more like bedrooms than like hospital rooms. Some have private showers and bathrooms, a previously unheard-of comfort in public hospitals.
The centerpiece of the strategy is the $3.5 million renovation at Bellevue, beginning with the $720,000 construction of the natural childbirth center.
Midwives assist at the births, which involve months of prenatal classes to prepare the women for drugless labor. The women are free to move around and even to eat during labor, and to have as many people with them as they wish.
Bellevue's plans for the next 18 months include redoing the rest of the maternity ward and adding homey decorating touches and better amenities to rooms where women will stay from labor through delivery, even when they are not using the natural childbirth model of the birthing center.
Officials at the hospitals corporation say that their immediate goal is to stop the exodus of their traditional patient base. On Bellevue's maternity ward, for example, about 70 percent of the patients have Medicaid, 10 percent have private insurance and about 20 percent are called self-paying, which generally means no payment: namely, the uninsured.
Officials of the public hospitals hope that the comfortable accommodations will eventually attract more women with private insurance.
Bellevue officials said they hoped that the new birthing center and the remodeled maternity ward would help improve the hospital's image.
"We've got to dispel that 'Midnight Cowboy' image of Bellevue," said Dr. Charles Lockwood, director of obstetrics and gynecology at Bellevue. "People are going to see this center, they're going to stop and say, 'This is Bellevue?' And they're going to look at the whole hospital in a new way."
Nursing her baby in the late morning light, an hour after she had given birth, Mrs. Masaquiza said that she would have been as thrilled with her son no matter where he was born. But she said she would not have been nearly as comfortable, emotionally or physically.
Though she chose not to indulge in the Jacuzzi, she said she had the greatest luxury of all in the beautiful room: having her husband and the midwives there -- sometimes actually on the bed with her -- helping to bring Kevin into the world.
"I will tell everyone, all my friends, it was so wonderful," said Mrs. Masaquiza, embracing in turn all the nurses and the midwives who had been by her side, and putting a glint in the eyes of Pam McDonnell, the hospital's head of publicity.
"Can we put that in an ad?" she asked.

HEADLINE: Economic Troubles Back Home Squeeze Asian Students in U.S.

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

 BODY:
The surprise economics lesson came straight from home in the form of panicked telephone calls and televised images of the sagging, dispirited faces of the rich and powerful.
As the won, ringgit, rupiah and baht -- the currencies of South Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand -- fell hard over several months, students from those countries studying in the United States suddenly saw the value of bank accounts halved, parents thrown out of work, family businesses dissolved. 
 A number of students have merely toned down spending habits that had been fed by boom times back home. But others are struggling to stay in the United States, where they have found a broader range of programs in technology, business, science and the arts in a less stringent teaching atmosphere than back home.
They are taking on two or three roommates to help pay the rent. Some have illegally taken jobs in restaurants and stores -- foreign undergraduates on student visas are not permitted to work -- to help pay tuition and other expenses. A few never returned to class after winter break because families summoned them home, while many of those who stay fear the same fate.
Yusung Hwang, an architecture student from South Korea, learned in December that his father's construction company had gone bankrupt at the height of the financial crisis.
Mr. Hwang, 22, owes the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn $6,000, he said. Even though Pratt is allowing students to stretch out tuition payments, Mr. Hwang said he cannot count on money from home and will leave for South Korea next month unless he finds a way to pay off his debt.
"The situation is terrible now," he said. "I don't want to stop my education."
In less dire straits but almost as anxious, Yoon Nam, 22, a communications major at New York University, has stopped buying new clothes, rarely goes to the movies and cooks her meals at home now: sacrifices she says have muted the New York experience she craved.
"My mom told me maybe I should marry somebody with a green card so I could stay here and work here," said Ms. Nam, of South Korea, unaware that the wait for a legal residency card can take several years. "I want to help my family back home, but I don't want to end my dream of studying here."
To prevent an exodus to Asia, college administrators across the country have responded with special aid and breaks on tuition payment schedules.
In many cases, students have until the end of the semester to pay, with no late fees.
"It's been extraordinary, the response from local campuses," said Peggy Blumenthal, vice president of education services at the Institute for International Education, a private nonprofit group based in New York.
Leonard Pramudinatha, a 22-year-old graduate business student from Indonesia, got a break when the University of Denver deferred indefinitely the $6,000 quarterly tuition payments for students from the affected countries.
Mr. Pramudinatha said he had never worried about money before, but now he plans to seek money for groceries from a $20,000 fund that business school patrons set up to help Asian students with rent and food costs.
"God knows when this whole thing is going to get better," he said. "It's so scary."
Jimmie White, a lawyer for the Office of International Students and Scholars at the University of California in Los Angeles, said his office had given loans of up to $4,000 to about two dozen students from the affected countries.
He said that two graduate students -- one from South Korea and one from Japan -- had had to drop out of school because of money problems tied to the faltering stock and bond markets in those countries.
"They were sad about leaving," Mr. White said. "This was a major disruption of their studies, and they had a fear that they would not be able to come back."
Most institutions will not know the full effect of the crisis until final spring enrollment counts come in over the next few weeks. Most students arrived last fall with enough cash to pay their way through the spring semester, officials said.
But some officials worry about the fall semester, if students don't return from summer break and new recruits can't find the money for study in the United States.
"Colleges are feeling the impact both in students not returning and not in the pipeline," said Linda Heaney, president of Linden Educational Services, which organizes recruitment trips overseas. She estimated that 200 to 250 colleges and universities actively recruit in Asia, up from a handful 15 years ago.
"We're going to see enrollment from Asia ratchet down a bit," Ms. Heaney predicted.
Aside from diversifying a college's student populations, foreign students also provide revenue for campuses and the cities where they are situated, contributing $7 billion to the national economy, according to the institute. Two-thirds of the students pay their own way entirely, with the rest on scholarships provided by their governments or by corporations in their homelands, the institute said. Fewer than one percent receive financial aid under United States Government-sponsored plans.
At least two foreign governments are rolling back the number of students they sponsor in this country.
The Thai Government had sent 200 to 300 students a semester, mainly to study engineering, computer science and medicine. But for the spring semester this year only 40 will be sponsored, and it is uncertain if the program will continue beyond that, said Chamnong Sangmahachai, the minister counselor of education affairs at the Thai Embassy in Washington.
Malaysia last year sent almost 500 students for a range of study, but this year that number will go down to about 140, mainly for business training, said an education official at the Malaysian Embassy.
Officials at the South Korean and Indonesian Embassies said that no decision had been made on cutting back the number of government-sponsored students.
South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia account for almost a third of the 457,984 foreign students studying in the United States, according to the Institute for International Education. South Korea, with 37,130 students, sends the third-highest number of students, behind Japan and China. Malaysia (14,527 students) is seventh, Thailand (13,481) eighth and Indonesia (12,461) ninth.
International students account for a significant portion of the student population at many schools. Boston University has the most foreign students (4,657, or 15.7 percent of its total enrollment), followed by New York University (4,491, or 12.5 percent) and the University of Southern California (4,183, or 15.2 percent), according to the Institute for International Education. Columbia University ranked fifth, with 3,807 students (18.8 percent.)
At New York University, which has 660 students from South Korea, 35 from Indonesia, 25 from Thailand and 24 from Malaysia, officials have seen some students "for whom there is an immediate crisis," said Gail Szenes, director of international students. A few have taken a leave of absence, she said, while others are arranging delayed tuition payments with the university on a case-by-case basis.
Likewise, Columbia University has offered small loans to tide students over, said Richard B. Tudisco, associate provost and director of the international students and scholars office.
Nevertheless, schools generally are not dependent on one group of students. Although officials said they regretted the students' hardship, the institutions are "not going to be decimated if one sending country drops off for a while," one administrator said.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International Center at Stanford University, said the Asian students' predicament recalled the wave of students who rode in on OPEC's wealth and rode out when economic and political tides shifted.
Not so many years ago, there were 45,000 students from Iran in the United States and virtually none from China; now those figures have nearly reversed.
And some colleges and universities said they were unprepared to dole out much aid.
Jerry Wilcox, director of international students at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., where annual tuition and living expenses can reach $30,000, said: "Cornell does not have the wherewithal to go in and rescue a lot of people. The students really have to ask their parents what's up."
Some students, mainly at the graduate level, are managing well. Graduate students on a student visa are allowed to hold academic-related jobs, like teaching or serving as research assistants.
"You have to realize that the good graduate students are like blue-chip football linemen," said Jerry McTier, director of student financial aid programs at Georgia Tech. "They're sought after by many colleges and they're offered very attractive financial packages. So they're not financially dependent on money from home."
Indeed, Paulus Kristanto, a doctorate candidate in industrial engineering at Georgia Tech, said the financial crisis at home in Indonesia had not caused him much grief.
"I have a job as a research assistant here, so I'm not affected at the moment," Mr. Kristanto said. "Of course we are always concerned about the situation down there."
Other students, who thought they were financially secure on corporate sponsorships, learned otherwise.
Three of four South Korean students in the graduate program at Emory University's Goizueta Business School in Atlanta have been forced by their sponsor, the South Korean-based electronics giant Samsung, to return home.
"We had four students in the program," said Julie Barefoot, admissions director for the business school. "One of them was very close to finishing his degree and he was allowed to stay. The other three were just starting and they were told to come home. It's really a shame because they were wonderful students and a real asset to the school."
And those trying to make it only on family money see a more austere future.
Eun Min, 23, a New York University senior from South Korea, gave up her student meal plan, which was costing $4,000 a semester, canceled a Rome vacation, and buys only used or bargain books, she said. Formerly a regular diner at Greenwich Village restaurants, she now eats at home.
"I cook egg salad sandwiches and noodles," she said.

Live . . . From 125th Street

BYLINE: By DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN 

 BODY:
125th Street is not what it used to be and many people would agree that is good news.
 While the eastern end of 125th near the Triboro Bridge is still quite rundown, and the western end, past Morningside Avenue, by the Grant housing projects is largely ignored, the street that is the commercial artery of Harlem has experienced a kind of a renaissance. 
 Within the last five years, many new businesses have moved in and the area has been cleaned up. Large retail chains, like Duane Reade, Blockbuster, the Body Shop and Portabella, now dot the landscape.
 The street is also part of an Empowerment Zone created by Congress in 1993. Loans and grants totaling $300 million, as well as $250 million in tax credits, have become available to stimulate the economy.
 The sidewalks themselves, while crowded, are less congested than a couple of years ago because many of the street vendors that were a ubiquitous presence have been pushed out. New construction, particularly east of Fifth Avenue, signals that development and rehabilitation are continuing.
 Despite these changes, the street has not been completely transformed. It retains a great deal of its history and distinctiveness, from the names on the streets it intersects to the aromas of the sweet potato pies eminating from its bakeries.
 It also retains some of the marks of its recent problems. Many old and architecturally beautiful buildings are boarded up and damaged, a sign there is still much to do. In addition, some major projects, like the International Trade Center, have fallen through, while others, like the huge Harlem USA development, have often been postponed.
 But many are buoyed by the general direction things are going in.
 Barbara Askins, executive director of the 125th Street Business Improvement District which was founded in 1994, said: "Everyone is saying that the renaissance is coming. I think that's going to take some time. But is it happening? I say yes."
 Here is a guide to some of the places on 125th Street. DYLAN LOEB McCLAIN

HEADLINE: Remedial Students Play An Integral Part at CUNY

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
In his budget address last month, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani portrayed the community colleges of the City University of New York as squandering their resources on teaching basic skills to students who are not ready for college and urged that those students be sent to privately run remedial programs so that CUNY could concentrate on delivering better college educations.
But even though CUNY officials promised this week to try to address the Mayor's concerns, they said that getting rid of students in remedial classes would be so costly and would so deplete the university that its ability to educate the students who remain would be hampered. 
 Not only do remedial students make up a significant portion of CUNY's enrollment, but remedial classes are a vital source of revenue for the university, the officials said.
"A precipitous reduction in the number of students could have a really devastating effect on the whole university," said Christoph M. Kimmich, CUNY's interim Chancellor. "If we are to be serious about addressing the issues the Mayor wants us to address, the city and state would have to help us deal with them.
"If we could separate the budgetary support from the remedial questions, we could have a better idea of what our role should be and what should be done," he added.
The Mayor's office said it did not have an immediate solution, but seemed to leave open the possibility of some help. "This is a plan in its formative stages," said Colleen Roche, the Mayor's press secretary. "All that is to be worked out."
There is a lot to work out. To remove all remedial students would leave a gaping hole, because 14 percent of the classes at CUNY's six community colleges are remedial and about 33 percent of the approximately 65,000 students take at least one remedial class. Even removing the weakest remedial students -- for instance, the ones who fail all three of CUNY's placement examinations, in reading, writing and mathematics -- would leave a large gap. In 1996, for example, about 37 percent of the community college freshmen -- more than 5,500 students -- failed all three of the exams.
What is more, the remedial programs that the Mayor wants to privatize are not an economic drain but actually subsidize more costly programs. Excluding remedial students would not only reduce the colleges' total budgets, but it would cut the money available for more expensive courses like nursing and science.
"The remedial courses help offset our higher-cost programs," Kurt R. Schmeller, president of Queensborough Community College, told a CUNY trustee committee on remediation Wednesday. "This is a very big issue."
Nor is Queensborough unusual. Although the exact figures are hard to pin down, the pattern appears to be the same at CUNY's other community colleges as well as nationally.
"There is no question that remediation costs less everywhere," said Henry M. Levin, a professor of economics and education at Stanford University and a visiting professor at Columbia Teachers College.
The reasons are not mysterious. Dr. Levin and others point out that remedial courses in reading, writing and mathematics are usually taught by adjunct professors or graduate students with low pay. Fancy equipment is rarely used and class sizes are usually large.
Remedial classes cost less, but just as important, students who take them pay the same tuition as other students, and the colleges receive the same government aid for these students as for others.
Tuition for local students is $2,500 a year, and the colleges get $1,900 a year in state aid for each student. (Ironically, under state law, that aid would be cut by $400 per student if the colleges no longer offered open admission.) City aid, which is not tied as directly to enrollment, amounts to about $1,200 a student, bringing the average revenue per student to about $5,600.
It is money the colleges count on.
"Our solvency depends on having some lower-cost programs," Dr. Schmeller said.
Remedial education is not the only low-cost program at colleges. Liberal arts courses like English and history cost less than science and engineering classes that require special equipment, or professional training programs like nursing or teaching that require close supervision of students.
Even though the remedial students pay their own way, the colleges have long struggled to balance their needs and those of other students. As an urban university, CUNY receives many poorly educated high school graduates and many immigrants who speak little or no English, and remedial programs play a significant role on most of its campuses.
At the community colleges, which offer admission to anyone with a high school diploma or the equivalent, 86 percent of last fall's entering students failed at least one placement test, and 63 percent failed all three. Some students need a little brushing up to be ready for college-level work. Others need extensive tutoring in basic skills.
Despite his reservations about the financial implications of the Mayor's proposals, Dr. Kimmich said the university is looking more carefully at the students who do not succeed, and should see whether there are better alternatives to offer them.
Even though the money is there to support them, he said, "what troubles me is that it is a demoralizing experience for them, for their instructors, and for the institution at large."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 10, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about remedial students at the City University of New York misstated the percentage of incoming students at the community colleges who fail all three of the system's placement examinations. It is 33 percent, not 67.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Laid Off? Dismissed? To Sue or Not to Sue

BYLINE: By DEBORAH L. JACOBS 

 BODY:
AS if getting laid off wasn't bad enough, a growing number of workers have an extra-tough decision to make on their way out the door: whether to forever give up their right to sue the boss. Those who do can walk away with a sweet deal. Those who don't gamble that they'll be better off in the long run.
Consider the case of Paul C. Bevan, a former marketing director for Honeywell Inc. in Minneapolis, who was replaced by a younger man and laid off in 1992. At the time, Honeywell offered Mr. Bevan $273,000 if he would release the company from any legal claims. Mr. Bevan, who was 52 and had been with the company for 24 years, refused to sign the release. Honeywell then reduced the severance package to about $60,000, he said. 
 Soon after the layoff, Mr. Bevan sued Honeywell, contending age discrimination. His five-year battle ended last summer when the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a jury verdict in his favor. The award, including interest and legal fees, was more than $900,000, he said. Honeywell declined to comment beyond a statement saying it had a "corporate-wide policy" against discrimination.
In asking for a release, or waiver, companies want to rule out trouble down the line -- discrimination cases based on race, sex or age. A waiver is "almost standard operating procedure whenever severance is given out," said Janice Goodman, an employment lawyer in Manhattan.
Courts have said these waivers are legal as long as they are given voluntarily for "adequate" consideration. That usually means anything more than an employee would otherwise be entitled to, Ms. Goodman said. If the company does not normally give severance pay, which is not required by law, a worker may need to sign the release to get anything at all.
In deciding whether a waiver is valid, the issue is not how much the company will pay but "the circumstances under which the waiver was obtained," Ms. Goodman said. Economic coercion -- withholding severance unless the waiver is signed -- is not illegal, she said, though how far a company can go has yet to be tested.
The key Federal law on waivers is the 1990 Older Workers Benefit Protection Act, which covers people older than 40. It says companies must give workers at least 21 days to decide whether to sign waivers and 45 days if a group of people is being terminated at one time. The waiver must let workers know that they are giving up the right to sue for age discrimination and must say that they have at least seven days after signing to change their minds.
When a release is part of a voluntary buyout or a program offered to a group of employees, the company must give more information, including selection criteria for the program and the "class, unit, or group of individuals covered"; the job titles and ages of the people selected, and the ages of people "in the same job classification or organizational unit" who are not eligible.
Until recently, it was not clear whether workers who sign invalid waivers must return the severance money if they sue. Last month, the Supreme Court said they did not.
That case involved Dolores Oubre, a former scheduler at a nuclear power plant in Killona, La., run by a unit of the Entergy Corporation. After she received a poor performance review, Entergy offered her a choice in early 1995 of trying to improve or resigning and receiving $6,258 in severance pay. Entergy gave her 14 days to make the decision -- a week less than the law requires. Ms. Oubre, then 41, signed the waiver.
When she sued later, contending age discrimination, the company tried to get the case thrown out. Even if the waiver was invalid, it argued, the contract was binding because Ms. Oubre kept the money.
Two lower courts ruled in Entergy's favor, but the Supreme Court reversed the decision on Jan. 26. Ms. Oubre must still prove that she was dismissed because of her age.
While employment lawyers hailed the case as a victory for workers, they called the circumstances unusual. "Don't sign a release with the idea that you're going to be able to disavow it later," advised Wayne N. Outten, a New York lawyer who has helped negotiate thousands of severance agreements. A better course, he said, is to ask for as much time as you need to decide and to talk to a lawyer before giving up any rights.
Before pursuing legal action, of course, a key question is whether you have a good case. No matter how badly employees feel they have been treated, they do not have a claim unless it fits into some legal framework like discrimination, wrongful termination or violation of a law protecting whistle-blowers, said Gary Laturno, a San Diego employment lawyer. Even then, they should not count on hitting the jackpot.
Typically, workers just get back pay -- the salary and benefits they would have earned from the time of dismissal until a court decides the case. If an employee finds another job while pursuing the case, the award is cut by whatever the person has earned at the new job.
HARDER to predict is the effect on an employee's psyche, finances and career should the worker turn down the waiver and proceed with a lawsuit.
Six years after he was dismissed, Mr. Bevan is negotiating an agreement to license his own invention -- a device to create an undulating practice-putting surface for golfers. But he had a tough time finding new employment while his case against Honeywell was pending.
Ultimately, a former colleague helped him land a position in Boston as a branch manager for a company that makes fire alarm and building security systems. He resigned in January to spend more time marketing his invention.
Mr. Bevan said he did not regret suing, but "there's no calculation you could run that would show the return on investment was worthwhile."
Lawyers typically advise clients to try negotiating a better severance package before contemplating legal action. Those with the most bargaining power are high-level, long-term employees with a good case, said Nancy Erika Smith, an employment lawyer in West Orange, N.J. Often the company is willing to improve on its initial offer, she said.
One former vice president at a Midwestern advertising agency negotiated six months' salary and health benefits, instead of the three months of pay that was first offered. Other items that can ease a transition cost a company little, such as outplacement help, favorable references and the right to keep the company car or personal computer or to buy them for a nominal sum.
A lawyer need not handle the negotiations. One marketing executive laid off from a large consumer products company never let on that she had a lawyer coaching her behind the scenes. As the lawyer counseled, she met with a personnel representative, rather than accepting a telephone brush-off. Though she had been with the company less than a year, she persuaded it to pay three-and-a-half months' severance -- a month more than the company had offered.
Even after paying the lawyer, she figured she was $4,000 ahead. And, she said, she learned an important lesson. "Always attempt to negotiate before you accept the first thing they hand you," she said. "You have nothing to lose."

BYLINE: By Alan Ryan; Alan Ryan is the author of "John Dewey and the High Tide of American Liberalism."

DATELINE: OXFORD, England

 BODY:
As Prime Minister Tony Blair flew off to Washington to confer with President Clinton, English commentators fussed about the trip. Some worried that Britain would be dragged into an ill-advised war with Iraq. Many more feared that Mr. Blair would be made to look ridiculous by being forced to answer questions about the President and Monica Lewinsky.
After all, Yasir Arafat had recently sat through a news conference in which life and death on the West Bank had taken second place to sex in the Oval Office. Nobody wanted the British Prime Minister to suffer the same fate. 
 But the British need not have worried. Facing a question about the private lives of public figures, Mr. Blair was cool and poised, saying that he had been elected to think about "schools, hospitals, crime, living standards, jobs."
"What is essential is that we focus on the issues we were elected to focus upon," he said, while Mr. Clinton listened appreciatively.
All the same, Americans who feel embarrassed by the obsession with their President's private life might be reassured to know that here in Britain, the personal lives of public officials are still very much on view, even with the Tories out of power.
This week has seen a parliamentary row over Mr. Blair's Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, who fired his secretary last year and admitted that he had planned to replace her with his mistress.
Lord Irvine, the Lord Chancellor and a close friend of the Prime Minister's, has suggested that newspapers be prevented from discussing the extramarital activities of Government ministers.
While legally minded people fretted about "prior restraint," unkind observers noted that Lord Irvine's second wife had formerly been Mrs. Donald Dewar, the wife of a Cabinet colleague.
Whenever a politician's approval ratings lurch up and down and up again, when journalists first puff out their chests and announce in solemn tones that he has finally shown himself unfit to govern and then discover the public is unimpressed -- this is not as peculiarly American as the foreign press pretends.
It was five years ago that the unfortunate David Mellor, the National Heritage Minister in John Major's Conservative Government, lost his post because he had an affair with a young woman who sold her story to the tabloids. She revealed, among other things, that he was particularly attracted to her feet, a detail that particularly delighted the headline writers at the tabloids.
Mr. Mellor was sacked because John Major had nailed his Government's credibility to the defense of family values, and every journalist with blood in his veins took that as an invitation to catch the Tories in flagrante.
Did the public want David Mellor to go? Not in the least; he was and is very likable. But he had become too ridiculous to remain in office. If all we think about when we see a politician is what he does in bed, he is ruined.
This might seem to strike a frivolous note. Shouldn't we take a sterner view of politicians than that? When politicians make mistakes, they can seriously damage our health. It is not clear, however, that we should take so stern a view of their private sins. No one cares whether the chief executive of an automobile company commits adultery or not. So why should we care if the President of the United States does or not?
One answer is that all we want from the auto company is efficient cars at a reasonable price. Its employees may -- within the limits of the law -- do whatever they like on their own time. We might take the same view of our leaders. We want them to give us full employment, low taxes and low inflation. What they do in their spare time is their business.
Yes, that rings hollow. For there is another thing Americans want from the President: a public affirmation of the values by which the United States intends to live.
President Clinton gave precisely such an affirmation three years ago, with his eloquent and powerful response to the Oklahoma City bombing. After the Republican Congressional victories in 1994, he had seemed stricken with doubt and indecision. But his performance in Oklahoma City sharpened his focus and resolve, and his reputation rose rapidly and steadily.
The point is we can't be certain just what parts of a leader's private life hold the key to how he will behave in a political crisis, let alone how he will manage the country from day to day.
Tony Blair, who admires President Clinton so much that he has turned the Labor Party into a slightly less left-wing version of the Democrats, is forever saying to the British people, "Trust me." They do -- but they do it selectively. They trust him not to raise taxes, but they do not trust him to be kind to single mothers and the disabled. They would trust him no more and no less if they discovered he was having problems of the magnitude of President Clinton's.
 The marital problems of Foreign Secretary Robin Cook produced no popular demands for Mr. Cook's resignation. There is, however, near unanimity that it was tacky to tell his wife of 28 years that he was leaving her in the V.I.P. lounge at London's Heathrow Airport. Can the British bear to be represented by somebody tacky? If he doesn't become an international joke, and otherwise does his job properly, the answer is yes.
To some this will suggest that we have lost our moral bearings. If we cannot demand that our leaders be honest, chaste, brave and unselfish, what hope is there for democracy? To others, it will suggest only that we have begun to grow up and come to terms with the fact that politicians are -- at best -- flawed instruments of the public good.
Five hundred years ago, Machiavelli observed that the proper place for saints was in the convent, not the councils of state. The same is true today. We should be ruthless with leaders who weaken national defenses, steal from the public purse or subvert constitutions.
But we should not expect to like what we see when we peer into our rulers' souls.

HEADLINE: European Commission May Revoke Exemption for U.S. Movie Studios

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Europe's love-hate relationship with Hollywood veered back toward hostility last week, when a European Commission antitrust official moved to break up a joint distribution company here owned by three big American movie studios.
The attack infuriated the three studios -- Paramount, owned by Viacom Inc.; MCA, owned by the Seagram Company, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-United Artists -- which together account for as much as 20 percent of the box-office sales in Europe. 
 But the move also highlighted an important long-term change that has complicated the long-running European angst about the dominance of American entertainment.
Despite continued resentment in many quarters about the invasion of movies like Disney's "Hunchback of Notre Dame," European demand for Hollywood's output is soaring. Multiscreen suburban movie complexes have become a hit in many countries, and American releases account for as much of three-quarters of their revenues. American books, in translation, dominate the best-seller lists in most countries.
And the expansion of digital television has led to fierce bidding wars for pay-per-view broadcasting rights from American studios.
The trend is not accidental. The underlying direction of policy at the European Commission has moved toward forcing more open competition on every part of the economy -- media included. Torn between promoting national cultures and open markets, the much-maligned "Eurocrats" generally push for the latter. More often than not, American suppliers of entertainment have been big beneficiaries.
But the tensions are real. On Thursday, Europe's Minister of Competition, Karel van Miert, announced that he wanted to revoke an exemption that had been issued to United International Pictures, a European distribution company owned by Paramount, MCA and MGM.
UIP has been operating in Europe since 1989 under an exemption to a European law that prohibits any agreements that "potentially restrict competition."
UIP sells movies from the three studios to theaters around Europe, allowing the studios to save money by sharing the costs of a joint distribution organization. Hollywood's other big studios -- Disney, Warner Brothers and Twentieth Century Fox -- distribute their movies in Europe independently.
Mr. van Miert remained vague about his objections to UIP, but neither he nor other officials in Brussels have argued that the company did anything wrong. Rather, they say that Europe has simply not received much benefit.
A key issue, according to both industry and commission officials, is that UIP is not doing as much to promote European movie producers as they had hoped.
In winning its legal exemption in 1989, UIP agreed to distribute at least some movies from European studios. But officials close to Mr. van Miert said that nonstudio European movies accounted for only 1 percent of all the movies that UIP distributed. By contrast, they said, locally made movies in European countries accounted for 14 percent to 24 percent of box-office sales.
"Recently, we have come to the conclusion that we don't have to tolerate it," Mr. van Miert said on Thursday.
Commission officials quietly rebutted press reports on Friday that UIP was suspected of an anti-competitive practice known as block- booking. The term refers to a practice of forcing theaters to accept unpopular movies as a condition for getting the big hits.
On Friday, however, officials told reporters in Brussels that they had no evidence of block-booking. Rather, they emphasized the fact that UIP had done very little to distribute European movies that did not come from the three studios.
They also argue that the movie-theater industry has become more vibrant in the last several years, as entrepreneurs have built appealing complexes that offer moviegoers a big choice, big screens and big sound. Therefore, they said, the need to give UIP an exemption had diminished.
Brian Reilly, executive vice president of UIP, said his company would fight the decision on the grounds that the company had lived up to its end of the deal. Mr. Reilly said that European inspectors had raided several UIP offices in 1996, looking for evidence of anti-competitive behavior, but had made no accusations. He also said UIP had distributed 227 European movies since 1989, although he did not rebut European complaints that these movies accounted for only a minuscule share of its total box-office revenue.
"We agreed that we would make our distribution organization available for European products, contingent on our commercial judgment," he said. "We feel we have fully met our commitment."
If Mr. van Miert gets his way, the three Hollywood studios will have to set up separate distribution organizations. Mr. Reilly warned that this would greatly increase their costs, ultimately leading to higher ticket prices. UIP will have a chance to rebut Mr. van Miert's objections, but it will have a difficult time prevailing.
Over the longer term, Mr. van Miert's policies have clearly benefited American suppliers of entertainment. A tough-minded and powerful crusader against trade barriers within Europe, he has pushed relentlessly for competition in the growing field of digital television.
In Germany, he has raised objections to a potentially monopolistic alliance between Deutsche Telekom, the telephone and cable company, and the two most powerful media conglomerates, Kirch Group and Bertelsmann A.G.
In Spain, he has forced the Government to retreat from measures aimed at shoring up the power of a Government-backed media consortium at the expense of a competitor controlled by Grupo Prisa and Canal Plus S.A. of France. Those policies kicked off a brutal bidding war for rights from American studios last year that were ultimately sold for hundreds of millions of dollars.
The Brussels-based competition authorities are also carving new inroads in publishing. Several weeks ago, Mr. van Miert formally announced plans to challenge price-fixing practices among German and Austrian book sellers.
The practices have been defended as a protection for small publishers and local culture, because the higher prices theoretically allow bookstores to keep slow-moving titles on their shelves.
But Mr. van Miert is having none of it. If he prevails, and the local publishers are correct about the implications, publishers of John Grisham and Tom Clancy are likely to be among the winners.

HEADLINE: Plea Heeded For Meeting On Black Theater

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW 

 BODY:
In a provocative speech at a Theater Communications Group's conference at Princeton University in June 1996, August Wilson said that among the 66 regional theaters in the United States only one "can be considered black." He made an impassioned plea for the need to encourage black theater as a separate movement. "It is vibrant," Mr. Wilson, the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, said about black theater. "It is vital."
"It just isn't funded," he said.
Mr. Wilson said it was time for black theater artists to come together "to address questions of esthetics and to defend ourselves from the naysayers." He assailed the critic Robert Brustein for his "presumption of inferiority of the work of minority artists." 
 Looking ahead, Mr. Wilson asked for a conference to be held in 1998 to deal with these and related issues and suggested that it take place in the South, which he referred to "as our ancestral homeland." The speech received a standing ovation. On the subject of a conference on black theater, however, there was silence, and when the response came to Mr. Wilson's call, it was not from a Southerner. It was from Dartmouth College.
At the instigation of two Dartmouth professors, Victor Leo Walker 2d and William W. Cook, the college decided to sponsor such a colloquium. After a year of preparation, a weeklong conference on issues confronting black theater in the United States is be held there next month, bringing together many of the most important playwrights, directors and producers in black theater as well as scholars, business executives, lawyers and representatives of foundations. Mr. Wilson is to deliver the keynote address.
In anticipation of the event, Mr. Wilson said, "as black Americans, we want to take an assessment of the state of black theater and lay the foundation for future progress and prosperity." For one thing, he said, "we need to go into communities and strengthen support groups."
After hearing Mr. Wilson's speech in 1996, Mr. Walker, an assistant professor of drama and film studies at Dartmouth, spoke to Mr. Wilson about the possibility of a follow-up meeting. None was immediately forthcoming, although that speech eventually led to a highly publicized debate between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Brustein at Town Hall in Manhattan in January 1997.
Mr. Walker said he felt even more strongly about initiating a conference after the Wilson-Brustein debate. In that encounter, moderated by Anna Deavere Smith, each man in effect accused the other of being elitist. The battle, Mr. Walker said, took the "shotgun approach," throwing many issues into the air, hoping that some would be hit. At Dartmouth, he indicated, the approach would be more specific and structured.
Ntozake Shange, Ed Bullins, Thulani Davis, Woodie King Jr., Ricardo Khan, Robbie McCauley, Clinton Turner Davis and Paul Carter Harrison are among the several dozen artists scheduled to participate. Sessions, closed to the public, will be held from March 2 to 6, to be followed by a one-day public meeting, "African American Theater: The Next Stage."
Panels will discuss economic as well as esthetic issues: audience and community development, fund-raising, marketing, legal and social initiatives and capital campaigns and also the nurturing of playwrights and multicultural aspects of black theater. After the meeting, the organizers plan to publish a book, arrange for future conferences and create an institute in collaboration with the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Darmouth. The conference is supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, Dartmouth and other organizations.
It was also at Mr. Walker's invitation that Mr. Wilson went to Dartmouth to teach playwriting this semester. In addition to his residency, the college offers undergraduates a course in Mr. Wilson's plays ("Ma Rainey's Black Bottom," "Fences" and "The Piano Lesson," among others).
The conference will be at the Dartmouth-run Minary Conference Center in Ashland, N.H. The public session, on March 7, will be held on the Dartmouth campus in Hanover, N.H. Mr. Walker said the Minary Center was in an area that "was a respite for runaway slaves on their way to Canada." He said that "symbolically this really works as a place for our meeting."

HEADLINE: Microsoft Case May Be Prelude to a Wider Antitrust Battle

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
The first round of the Microsoft Corporation's antitrust confrontation with the Government still has months to run, awaiting Federal court decisions. But a second round has already begun -- the discussion, debate and negotiations about whether the Justice Department should file a broader Sherman Act case against Microsoft.
A sweeping case against Microsoft would be a landmark test of how the smokestack-era doctrine of antitrust applies to a high-technology industry. It would also likely be a lengthy, bitter courtroom battle and a step-by-step dissection of the business practices of the software powerhouse that dominates the personal computer industry. 
 Yet comments last week by a senior Justice Department official and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee suggest that Washington would prefer to avoid a long-running, high-profile Sherman Act case, if possible. Specifically, they talked of agreeing on some ground rules of competition as computing migrates beyond the PC desktop, which Microsoft firmly controls, to the era of the Internet.
The issue, according to policy makers and economists, is to try to insure that Microsoft's near-monopoly of PC operating- system software is not used to exercise what antitrust experts call "chokehold control" over the new markets of Internet software and Internet commerce.
The company's current size, wealth and market share, they emphasize, are not concerns. But the goal of antitrust policy, they add, should be to make sure that the door is open in the Internet markets for the "next Microsoft," a newcomer rising to unseat the industry leaders by dint of business skill, innovation and luck.
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee, warned on Thursday that antitrust scrutiny of Microsoft was preferable to more heavy-handed Government intervention along the lines of an "Internet Commerce Commission."
After his speech before a seminar on antitrust and Microsoft, sponsored by the conservative Progress and Freedom Foundation, Senator Hatch said, "I would suggest to Microsoft and all its competitors that we should be working together to develop a set of antitrust principles for this digital age."
Within the Justice Department, there is a similar sentiment. If Microsoft were willing to agree to "certain principles of openness" a senior Justice Department official said, the accommodation would "go a long way toward getting us off the company's back."
The official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, emphasized that he was not suggesting that Microsoft -- no matter what it did -- could expect to be exempt from continuous antitrust scrutiny. And he said the Justice Department was continuing to assemble evidence that could lead it to file a case under Section 2 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits anticompetitive practices that maintain and extend a monopolist's reach.
Yet the Justice Department official observed that most antitrust investigations tend to combine adversarial relations between the Government and a company along with a "continuing dialogue" between the two sides.
An agreement by Microsoft to discuss ground rules of competition, he said, could be a step toward reopening the "dialogue" element of the Government's dealings with Microsoft. He declined to discuss in detail what areas the Government would want to cover in such principles.
But one area of antitrust concern, he said, would be licensing arrangements and the pricing of deals that Microsoft strikes both with computer companies and with banking, travel and media companies for placement on the front screen of its Windows operating system or its Internet Explorer browser.
The greatest benefits in terms of fostering innovation and competition, he said, would come from light-handed antitrust guidance early on, as Internet commerce is beginning to take off, rather than more Draconian enforcement later.
There are already ways for Government and companies to devise competitive ground rules jointly. The two Federal antitrust agencies, the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, have issued guidelines in industries, like the health care business, and in fields of activity, like intellectual property.
Yet establishing these guidelines normally requires a lengthy process of public hearings and comment. A quicker way to deal with Microsoft, a senior Justice Department official said, might be to place in a "business review letter" those principles on which the Government and the company have reached agreement. These letters are typically written by the company under investigation in consultation with the Justice Department.
An industry trade group, the Software Publishers Association, weighed in last week with its own set of "competition principles." The trade group published its eight principles of competition after polling its membership and meeting with Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division.
Several of the principles are calls for nondiscriminatory licensing practices by an unnamed "owner of a dominant operating system" -- Microsoft, obviously.
A Microsoft spokesman, Greg Shaw, said the Software Publishers Association's principles were "a public relations stunt." The principles, he said, seemed to be mainly the work of some Microsoft rivals who are on the association's board.
But the association is the software industry's largest and oldest trade group, and Microsoft is its biggest single member, paying annual dues of $100,000. "We had no interest in excluding Microsoft and we didn't," said Ken Wasch, president of the association. "Our members think these are important issues."
Microsoft's senior management seems to be open to the notion of renewed talks with the Justice Department, but is wary. "We'd be willing to talk," Nathan Myhrvold, the chief technology officer and a member of the company's executive committee, said on Friday. "But there's a cynical view of the process of dealing with the Government that says throw them a bone and they'll go away. Our concern is that by doing that we would be taking one step down a road which could lead to all kinds of restrictions on our business."
Microsoft now finds itself in court because it chose to fight a seemingly modest curb on its business practices. Last October, the Justice Department sued Microsoft to stop the company from requiring PC makers to install its Internet Explorer browser as a condition of licensing its Windows operating system. The Justice Department contends that practice is a violation of Microsoft's 1995 consent decree, which prohibits tying one product's sale to another's.
Microsoft refused and went to court instead. The company points out that the consent decree allowed it to develop "integrated products." It insists that its Explorer browser is not a separate product but an integrated feature of its Windows operating system.
On Dec. 11, a Federal judge issued a preliminary injunction, ordering Microsoft to offer PC makers the choice of taking Windows without Explorer. Microsoft is appealing the ruling.

HEADLINE: Allan Grant, Farmers' Advocate, 91

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Allan Grant, a California rancher who started as a sharecropper and came to speak for millions of farm families as president of the American Farm Bureau Federation in the 1970's, died on Jan. 27 at Kaweah Delta Hospital in Visalia, Calif., where he made his home. He was 91.
Mr. Grant was president of the federation from 1976 to 1980 after 12 years as head of the California Farm Bureau. The federation has four million members among its 50 state affiliates and one affiliate in Puerto Rico. 
 Founded in 1919, the federation assesses farmers' problems and interests and lobbies for their causes. As president, Mr. Grant often voiced the group's generally conservative views on economic and political matters and gave national news briefings on the outlook for crops and prices.
Mr. Grant was born in Perry, Calif., and studied agricultural economics at Montana State College and the University of California at Los Angeles. He was working in the oil fields around San Diego to earn money for his college tuition when his father died in 1928. He dropped out of college to support his mother and younger siblings.
At age 22, Mr. Grant moved the family from Los Angeles to a farm in Visalia, in the lower San Joaquin Valley, where he leased land and milked cows as a sharecropper. He survived the Depression and a partner who absconded with the proceeds of their first crop.
Mr. Grant acquired about 2,000 acres of irrigated farmland and a herd of 600 dairy cows. He worked on a cattle ranch in Coarsegold, Calif., until he retired in 1985.
Mr. Grant was a vice president of the national farm federation for five years before he was elected president in 1976. He traveled widely to open overseas markets to American farm products and to speak on issues dealing with trade and international relations.
He was a leader of the Future Farmers of America and, in 1980, began raising Belgian draft horses as a hobby.
Mr. Grant's survivors include his wife of 65 years, Irene Chinowith Grant, two daughters, Joyce Greene of Coarsegold, and Margaret Petersen of Visalia; three sons, Murray, Edward and Robert, all of Visalia; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: A Look at Religion in China by 3 U.S. Clerics

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A high-profile delegation of American religious figures began arriving in Beijing today for a three-week tour of China to examine the state of religious freedom here, one of the most volatile human rights issues in American diplomacy.
While it is being described as private, President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of China agreed to the mission during their summit meeting in October, and the White House picked the three-man delegation: a prominent rabbi, an evangelical Protestant minister and a Roman Catholic archbishop. 
 The group will meet with officials and religious leaders in Beijing, Shanghai, Nanjing, Chengdu and Hong Kong. It has also been granted rare approval for a visit to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, the remote mountain region where the Chinese are accused of repressing Buddhist religion and culture.
The Chinese and American Governments say they hope that the unusual dialogue will help defuse what has rapidly emerged as a popular human rights crusade, threatening their efforts to build friendlier political and economic ties.
In the United States, a vocal coalition drawing together evangelical Christians and other religious groups, human rights advocates and supporters of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, wants stronger measures to combat what it describes as widespread persecution of Christians and Tibetan Buddhists in China.
It charges that China is engaged in a campaign of arrests and harassment intended to stamp out unapproved religious activity by millions of people including Catholics who give allegiance to the Vatican, certain Protestant groups and Buddhists who follow the Dalai Lama.
Legislation pending in Congress that would apply sanctions against countries deemed to engage in religious persecution has received the support of the Republican leadership but is opposed by the Clinton Administration.
The Chinese Government angrily rejects the charges of persecution. It says that some 14 million Protestants and Catholics worship in the state-approved churches and describes leaders of the so-called underground churches as criminal elements out to disrupt the social order.
In Tibet, China says, it acts against those trying to split apart the country.
The first American delegation member to arrive in Beijing today sought to hold down expectations, but he sees the trip as a vital chance to start a dialogue.
"This will be a very modest step, but it's a beginning," said Rabbi Arthur Schneier of Park East Synagogue in Manhattan, president of the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, a New York-based group that promotes religious tolerance around the world. The two other members are Archbishop Theodore E. McCarrick of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark, and the Rev. Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals.
"The fact that we are here shows a certain recognition on the part of the Chinese that this is an issue they have to face," Rabbi Schneier said.
Human rights campaigners generally welcomed the mission as a rare chance to engage the Chinese leadership, but some privately expressed concern that it could be used by China as a propaganda tool and urged the delegation to insist on private meetings with underground church leaders and to press for the release of jailed Christians and Tibetans. Rabbi Schneier said it would be imprudent to divulge the team's plans in advance, but he was confident that it would gain access to a wide range of views from China's Christian, Buddhist, Muslim and Taoist communities.
He said the group planned to issue a preliminary report on its findings in New York on March 5, when it will provide more information about its procedures and meetings.
The final itinerary and formal list of meetings are to be worked out with Chinese officials on Tuesday. Most of the officially scheduled meetings are likely to be with officials of Government-approved "patriotic" churches. The delegation's host is a Government group that will accompany it around the country, and all of its activities are certain to be intensely monitored by security agencies.
In its quest for dialogue, the group will confront a sharp difference in perspectives about the meaning of religious freedom. In a statement issued in October, China boasted of the country's diversity of religions and noted the recent surge in the number of Protestants and Catholics inside the official churches. It acknowledged that religion had been violently suppressed during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76 but said the Government had restored religious freedom, which is guaranteed in the Constitution.
But the statement also said that "religion should be adapted to the society in which it is prevalent."
In China, still firmly governed by the Communist Party, the Government does not tolerate any organizations that give allegiance to outside authorities. So its official Catholic church, for example, explicitly rejects the idea -- central to Catholic teaching elsewhere -- that the Pope is the supreme leader of the church and has sole right, for example, to appoint bishops and cardinals.
In Tibet, too, China is combating the notion of a non-state allegiance. It has belatedly begun to support aspects of Tibetan culture but aims to wrench Buddhists away from their traditional leader, the Dalai Lama, who is described as an enemy of the country. The Government's October statement said that "no one in China is punished because of his or her religious belief." Human rights advocates paint a different picture, of repression that if anything may be rising.
In late 1993, Chinese officials stated that no "underground" Catholic priests or bishops were in so-called re-education camps or prison, said John Kamm, an American businessman and human rights campaigner. Currently, he said, several dozen Catholic leaders are incarcerated and efforts to stamp out church activities are constant.
"The situation for Catholics is as serious as it's been since the late 1970's," when the new era of economic reforms began in China, Mr. Kamm said.
The delegation members have said they will not conduct news conferences during their tour. China, which restricts travel by foreign reporters, has said it will not allow any to accompany the group to Tibet.

Winter Shuffle: Who Went Where?

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
The hot topic of conversation heading into spring training a year ago was the economic binge of the Florida Marlins, who committed $89 million to six free agents in an effort to become a contender and lure fans back to their ball park. As the beginning of spring training loomed this past weekend, the Marlins were again a hot topic of conversation.
Baseball people, in fact, have not stopped talking about the Marlins, who last October won the World Series, then four days later began playing another sport -- demolition derby. 
 The Montreal Expos won no championships last season, but they were the Marlins' fiercest competition this winter in the race to see which team could downsize itself fastest and most severely.
Now comes the time for the Marlins and the Expos to see what they have left. It is also time for the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays to see what they have wrought. Baseball's 29th and 30th teams, the Diamondbacks and the Devil Rays have spent the way the Marlins did last winter, but neither expects to contend for a spot in the World Series this year. They just hope to be competitive.
"We're in a division with some pretty high payrolls; that's not going to make it easy," Larry Rothschild, manager of the American League East Devil Rays, said yesterday. Rothschild, who will send his pitchers and catchers onto the field for their first workout next Sunday, is one of two new managers who, as Jim Leyland's coaches, were part of the Marlins' wild experience last year. He was their pitching coach, and Jerry Manuel, the new manager of the Chicago White Sox, was their bench coach.
"It's still a pretty good team," Rothschild said of the Marlins' skeleton. "The pitching obviously will be the question mark. They still have a pretty good team on the field. They still have a pretty good lineup and they have one of the top managers in the game. I can't count them short."
Twelve members of the championship team have departed. Kevin Brown, the Marlins' No. 1 starting pitcher, will have his spring training this year with San Diego, beginning Saturday. Al Leiter, another of their starters, will be with the Mets, and Robb Nen, their closer, with San Francisco. Moises Alou, the Marlins' erstwhile left fielder, will be with Houston, and center fielder Devon White with Arizona.
The Marlins aren't finished. Sometime during spring training they could complete the transformation of their outfield by trading right fielder Gary Sheffield, maybe to the Mets.
The Expos shed four position players and one pitcher. The pitcher, Pedro Martinez, just happened to be the best in the National League last season and will start this year in Boston as the highest-paid player in baseball history. First baseman David Segui is with Seattle, second baseman Mike Lansing with Colorado, left fielder Henry Rodriguez with the Chicago Cubs and catcher Darrin Fletcher with Toronto.
The San Francisco Giants are another team that has lost some name players, all as free agents. Wilson Alvarez and Roberto Hernandez, two pitchers the Giants rented from the White Sox for two months, are with Rothschild in Tampa Bay; Rod Beck, their closer, moved to the Cubs after the Giants obtained Nen from the Marlins, and Jose Vizcaino is now the Los Angeles shortstop.
The Cleveland Indians weren't looking to downsize, but they nevertheless engineered their second major shuffle in two off seasons. Before last season, the Indians acquired third baseman Matt Williams and traded Kenny Lofton for Marquis Grissom and David Justice. Now they have shipped Williams to Arizona for another third baseman, Travis Fryman; sent Grissom to the National League Milwaukee Brewers for pitching help and brought back Lofton to play center field. They also, in effect, swapped starting pitchers, Orel Hershiser (now with the Giants) for Dwight Gooden (now not with the Yankees).
Williams represents a major part of the expenditure the Diamondbacks have made, committing $113 million to him, shortstop Jay Bell and pitchers Andy Benes and Willie Blair.
The Devil Rays have committed $78 million to six players, including Alvarez, Hernandez, Fred McGriff and Paul Sorrento.
The Braves traded McGriff, then snatched first baseman Andres Galarraga from the Rockies, from whom they also grabbed shortstop Walt Weiss, whose signing prompted Jeff Blauser to go to the Cubs.
Closers were on the move, too. Besides Beck, Nen and Hernandez, Randy Myers moved from Baltimore to Toronto, Dennis Eckersley from St. Louis to Boston and Jeff Brantley from Cincinnati to St. Louis.
For roster shuffles, though, the Yankees have probably come closest to the Marlins in numbers. The Yankees didn't downsize; they trimmed some decaying wood. Gooden has moved to Cleveland, Kenny Rogers to Oakland, Wade Boggs to Tampa Bay, Cecil Fielder to Anaheim, Charlie Hayes and Rey Sanchez to San Francisco, Mike Stanley and Pat Kelly to Toronto.
The Yankees have added two strong hitters, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch and designated hitter Chili Davis, and a light-hitting third baseman, Scott Brosius.
Their chief division rivals, the Orioles, have added a veteran hitter, Joe Carter, and a veteran pitcher, Doug Drabek.

Schools Face Tough Choice About Repairs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
LATELY, it seems, hardly a day goes by -- O.K., maybe a week -- without some fresh disaster befalling a city school.
The brick facade of a Brooklyn high school collapses, crashing through a protective shed. Carbon monoxide seeps from the furnace of an elementary school in Queens, sickening dozens of students. A cinder block topples off a Brooklyn elementary school, killing a teen-age girl. 
 In one sense, the incidents are unrelated -- a set of freak accidents bunched together in time. But in another sense, they are very much connected. The city schools not only appear to be, but are collapsing.
Three years ago, a commission created by the Schools Chancellor issued a report on the physical condition of the city schools and predicted just the sort of calamities that have become almost commonplace in the last few weeks.
In a letter accompanying the report, the commission's chairman, Harold O. Levy, warned that the schools were "on the verge of a serious calamity" and credited "simple dumb luck" for the fact that there hadn't been more fatalities.
The commission's central finding was that while serious management problems persisted at the Board of Education, they were not the main cause of the schools' wretched condition. Rather, the falling roofs and crumbling masonry were the direct result of years and years of insufficient spending on routine repairs.
The funds devoted to maintaining the city's schools, the commission stated, were "grossly and devastatingly inadequate."
When the commission issued its report, almost no one questioned its findings. In fact, officials at the Board of Education praised the report for the clarity of its message.
Yet in the three years since, there has been almost no change in policy. Indeed, by some measures, the school system has reduced its spending on maintenance, adding more buildings without increasing its repair budget commensurately.
According to figures from the Mayor's Management Report, school maintenance spending per square foot over the last three years is, when adjusted for inflation, exactly equal to the average of the previous five.
And according to the calculations of the Independent Budget Office, the figure has actually been falling in recent years, to $3.34 per square foot last year from $3.64 in 1995.
Because of the complex way city schools are financed, the decision to spend -- or not to spend -- on maintenance is divided a half-dozen ways. Not only is the Board of Education responsible, but also the Mayor, the City Council, the Governor and both houses of the State Legislature.
 ASKED about maintenance spending for city schools, the chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, Steven Sanders, conceded that the recommendations of the Levy Commission had been largely ignored. He added, however, that the Assembly's top goal for the current session was to direct more money to school repairs, and he blamed Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for not making the issue a priority for the city.
"When the Mayor wants to make his point known, he's extremely effective," Mr. Sanders said. "I defy people to find three quotes from the Mayor that talk about the desperate needs of the infrastructure."
For its part, the Giuliani administration pronounced itself blameless. The Mayor, according to his press secretary, Colleen Roche, does not have any control over how the Board of Education allocates its resources. Furthermore, Ms. Roche went on to note, "city tax-level spending on the schools is higher now than five years ago."
Finally, officials at the Board of Education said they simply had not had enough money to do any better, even though the board had asked for additional funds from both the city and state.
"Asking isn't necessarily getting," said the board's chief financial officer, Beverly Donohue.
Ms. Donohue went on to say that when money is "that tight," the Board puts a priority on instruction rather than upkeep for buildings. Which is, of course, precisely the sort of calculation, repeated over the decades, that explains the dangerous condition of the city's schools.

HEADLINE: Canadian Indians Win a Ruling Vindicating Their Oral History

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA 

DATELINE: KISPIOX, British Columbia, Feb. 3

 BODY:
In the early time, long ago, an Indian maiden was taken into the sky. When she came back to the land, the man who took her turned into a grizzly bear. Her three brothers searched for her but found the bear first and killed it without realizing that it was their sister's husband. They brought the skin to where the river calls back the salmon every year. The Gitxsan people have been in Kispiox ever since.
That, says a Gitxsan elder, Alvin Weget, is the history of his people and their relationship to this breathtaking land of sky-high mountains. It is preserved on a towering cedar totem pole and in stories that Gitxsan elders first told hundreds of years ago. 
 And according to a recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada, that story is now legally binding evidence that can be used, along with other histories, to support Gitxsan claims to as much as 22,000 square miles of British Columbia's remote interior. Claims by other Indian groups cover all of the province's nearly 600,000 square miles.
By essentially validating Indian claims to land even where no treaties or titles exist, the ruling -- in a case started by the Gitxsan (pronounced GIT-san) and their neighbors, the Wetsuweten (pronounced WET-soo-wet-en) -- may redefine how government deals with Indians across Canada.
With other recent actions, including the Canadian Government's historic apology to native peoples for 150 years of paternalistic and sometimes racist treatment, the court's ruling seems to reflect a sharp shift in attitudes. It is driven as much by politics and a muscle-flexing court as by statistics indicating that Canada could be sitting on a demographic time bomb.
By any measure, the country's 1.3 million indigenous people -- about 5 percent of the population -- are much poorer, sicker and socially troubled than non-natives. They are also, on the whole, much younger, and their population is growing twice as fast.
"Nobody can look at the reality facing aboriginal people in Canada and not feel that something has to be done to put things back in balance," said Indian Affairs Minister Jane Stewart. "The status quo is not acceptable."
Ms. Stewart said she had a much better relationship than her predecessors with Indian leaders, making compromise possible. She also cited public opinion polls indicating that Canadians think Indians have gotten a raw deal and want something done quickly to help them.
But while such attitudes dominate in eastern cities, here in the west, where there are more indigenous people and the impact of land claims and self-government initiatives have immediate impact, things look different.
"Supreme Surrender" is the title of a recent article that sums up western attitudes about the Supreme Court ruling, handed down on Dec. 11, in the magazine The Western Report.
Mike Scott, an opposition Member of Parliament with the conservative Reform Party from British Columbia, said, "This whole thing is foolish, ill advised and downright irresponsible." He accused the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien of taking politically correct positions "without the foggiest notion of what this entails."
Like many others here, Mr. Scott is worried that the court's decision undermines British Columbia's control over the 95 percent of the province that is publicly owned. The justices basically rejected the province's long-held position that Indian claims to the land were extinguished when British Columbia became a province in 1871.
They also fear that uncertainty over who legally controls the land will undermine land-use decisions and threaten British Columbia's timber and mining industries.
In the six weeks since the ruling, industry leaders say, no logging contracts have been revoked, but there is a ground swell of uncertainty and fear about the impact of the ruling.
"What was uncertain before," Mr. Scott said, "becomes disastrous now."
Already, other native groups across Canada have interrupted treaty negotiations to consider how the ruling affects them. Last weekend, Indian leaders from British Columbia met with federal and provincial leaders and demanded a 60-day moratorium on all timber cutting and mining permits to give them time to apply the court ruling.
The Gitsxan here argued that as protectors of the large territory over which they have historically ranged, they should have the right not only to use the land in traditional ways like hunting and fishing, but also to take part in decisions on granting timber licenses and mining concessions and any other way the land is used.
Some 5,000 Gitxsan now live on scattered reserve land that totals less than 40 square miles. With unemployment among them approaching 90 percent, they also want to use the territory as a resource base.
They expect to receive royalties or compensation on timber, mineral and other resources they allow to be taken from here. They say they are willing to share those resources with the 20,000 non-natives who live in the territory.
The 3,500 Wetsuweten live just south of the Gitxsan on reserve land that is even smaller and more spread out.
Treaty negotiations have been going on throughout Canada for much of the last 30 years, but the Gitsxan case was an important exception to most treaty negotiations. While 46 other Indian groups in British Columbia focused on the provincial government's treaty process, Gitxsan and Wetsuweten leaders refused to accept ownership of a part of traditional lands and monetary compensation for an agreement to surrender claim to the rest.
"We were not interested in that," said Don Ryan, chief negotiator of the Gitxsan. Along with the Wetsuweten, the Gitsxan claimed what amounts to co-ownership with the province of a vast area of mountain range, salmon streams and timberland.
The case began in the early 1980's, and the provincial courts ruled against the Indians. The provincial Chief Justice, Allen McEachern, infuriated them by concluding that the oral histories presented in court by the elders were too contradictory to stand as evidence.
When the case was appealed to the Supreme Court, the Gitxsan and Wetsuweten separated their claims. The province was confident that it would win. In hearing the case last June, the Supreme Court did not allow the elders to recite their songs and histories in the courtroom. But after reviewing the testimony of the earlier trial, the justices brushed aside longstanding rules of evidence, deciding that uncorroborated oral histories have the same weight as documentary evidence.
"The law of evidence must be adapted in order that this type of evidence can be accommodated and placed on an equal footing with the types of historical evidence the courts are familiar with," the justices ruled.
Herb George, who headed the legal team for the Wetsuweten, said Indian strategy had fundamentally changed when the case went before the high court. Instead of claiming ownership in the traditional fee-simple way that most Canadians own their homes, native claim was defined as a kind of overlay on Government sovereignty.
"If you put one hand out and that represents the underlying title of the crown, and then put your other hand on top of it, that is the aborignal claim," Mr. George explained. "In order for crown to express itself, it will have to go through us."
The top court overruled the lower court but stopped short of granting absolute title and self-government to the Indians. Either a new trial or a new round of negotiations is needed to resolve the issue.
On Jan. 31 the Gitxsan people gathered here in Kispiox to celebrate the ruling with dance, song and a feast of a type that had been outlawed until 1951. They gathered in the community center here and listened once again to the elders retelling how their leaders got the white people to recognize their laws.
"What evidence did we have to show them this land was ours?" asked Neil Sterritt Sr., addressing the group in what may someday be another oral history. "There are the names of the territory, the names of the streams, the names of the mountain peaks. This took thousands and thousands of years. These are our boundaries. You could not fake them."
Led by Mr. Sterritt's son, Neil Jr., the Gitxsan have meticulously recorded the ancient tales that told of great birds leading the people to new settlement as the big ice of the glaciers receded. They wrote out the history of how the enraged giant grizzly destroyed the founding village of Temlaham by thrashing in the river and sending up a huge foaming wave that swept everything away.
In that instance, they even brought in geologists and botanists to search for historic concurrence. They drilled deep core samples and found evidence that a monumental mud slide leveled the area about 3,500 years ago, placing the event within the time frame of Gitsxan habitation.
The Supreme Court's acceptance of the oral histories was a bold act of judicial activism in a country accustomed to seeing its Parliament, not its top court, effect such legal changes. The justices encouraged the provincial government and the Gitxsan to settle the issue through negotiation, but Mr. Ryan, the Gitxsan negotiatior, said he doubted that the province would act unless the courts forced it to do so.
Whether they return to court or not, the Gitxsan see the ruling as recognition of their history, validation of their laws and acknowledgement of their ancient way of life.
This is not the first time two so very different cultures with foreign concepts of time and history have met in this place. After deciphering the totem pole that relates the story of Kispiox, Mr. Weget, the tribal elder, accompanied visitors to the village cemetery. There he pointed out a marble headstone he discovered years ago, almost completely buried in dirt and debris.
It is for a Chief Alexander Kit-Lu-Dalthque. The stone and its base bear no dates. But they were clearly carved by non-native craftsmen. And the eulogy, too, has unmistakably come from a non-Gitxsan source, lost in early time: "His end was peace," read the words carved in stone.
"His ancestors were the discoverers of Kispiox," says the stone, which then embraces an imprecise view of history more suited to a totem pole by adding, "hundreds of years ago."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE OVERVIEW;
U.S. WILL NOT ASK TO USE SAUDI BASES FOR A RAID ON IRAQ

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: JIDDA, Saudi Arabia, Feb. 8

 BODY:
With Saudi Arabia showing deep reluctance to support a military strike on Iraq, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said today that he would not seek permission to launch American fighters and bombers from Saudi territory.
Mr. Cohen's decision not to ask for the use of more than 100 American aircraft now based in Saudi Arabia -- half of them combat jets -- allows the United States to avoid the political embarrassment of having a request turned down by a key ally. 
 The Saudis' stance, though, undercuts the Clinton Administration's efforts to build political support for a punitive attack in the confrontation over United Nations inspections of Iraq's chemical and biological weapons programs.
Mr. Cohen said just last week that he expected "full cooperation" from allies in the Persian Gulf. Of America's European allies, only Britain has so far pledged to join an attack.
As he arrived here tonight to begin a tour of Persian Gulf states, Mr. Cohen said the commander of American forces in the region, Gen. Anthony C. Zinni of the Marines, had concluded that a "very substantial" attack could still be carried out even without receiving approval to use the aircraft based in Saudi Arabia.
"It's not my intent to make such a request," Mr. Cohen said in an interview with reporters en route to Jidda, "because we don't think it's necessary."
Whatever the necessity, however, a senior aide traveling with Mr. Cohen said the United States had concluded that Saudi Arabia would say no to any request to launch combat jets from its territory.
Saudi Arabia is one of the United States' closest Arab allies and a major regional power. During the Persian Gulf war, Saudi Arabia provided a crucial base for the 500,000 American and allied troops that ultimately routed Iraqi forces occupying Kuwait in 1991.
But without the violent occupation of another Arab state as justification for an attack, and with many Arabs sympathetic to the plight of Iraqis after seven years of economic sanctions, Saudi Arabia has found the idea of another round of strikes on Iraq unacceptable.
The developments added significance to Mr. Cohen's order, signed on Saturday, sending 42 more aircraft to the Persian Gulf. That brings the total in the region to well above 300. Most of the new aircraft are going to Kuwait and Bahrain, two gulf countries that have signaled a willingness to allow an attack from their territory.
The United States will send six more F-117 "stealth" fighters to the region, doubling the number based there since the crisis with Iraq flared again last fall. Another B-1 will join a pair of the heavy bombers in Bahrain. Mr. Cohen also sent six more B-52's to Diego Garcia, a British island in the Indian Ocean that has a major American base, raising to 14 the total number of B-52's there.
All of those -- along with cruise missiles and fighters already in Kuwait and Bahrain, as well as those aboard American aircraft carriers now plying the Persian Gulf -- would be even more essential to any attack.
Mr. Cohen also left open the possibility that some American aircraft based at Prince Sultan Air Base southeast of the Saudi capital, Riyadh, could provide support for fighters launched from Kuwait, Bahrain and the carriers. Those aircraft could include Awacs surveillance and communication jets and tankers for mid-air refueling.
Another official traveling in Mr. Cohen's party said those requests remained under discussion. The senior defense official said it was likely that Saudi Arabia would allow American bombers based elsewhere to fly over Saudi airspace, though that was not yet settled.
Mr. Cohen also noted that Saudi Arabia would continue to allow American and a few British and French jets to patrol the "no flight" zone over southern Iraq. "We do expect support in the region itself, and we would hope the Saudis would continue to be as helpful as they have been," he said.
But even as Mr. Cohen arrived here for talks with King Fahd and other leaders, the Defense Minister, Prince Sultan, declared the kingdom's strong opposition to an attack by the United States and Britain.
"We do not favor striking Iraq as a people and as a nation," the Prince was widely quoted as saying in Saudi news reports today.
Mr. Cohen said the remarks did not signal a widening split between the United States and Saudi Arabia. He noted that Prince Sultan also called on Iraq to comply with United Nations resolutions providing for weapons inspections and expressed support for a diplomatic resolution.
"I think most people think a military option is not the preferable option," he said. "We have said that ourselves."
Administration officials said today that President Clinton called King Fahd on Saturday, and that the two leaders spoke for seven minutes. In that conversation, officials said, the President did not ask for the use of Saudi bases to launch attacks against Iraq, but Mr. Clinton did stress the "urgency of the situation."
Mr. Cohen arrived in Saudi Arabia after spending the weekend in Munich, Germany, attending an annual conference on European security matters. The conference was overshadowed by the looming conflict with Iraq. Earlier today, Mr. Cohen largely departed from a prepared speech on the future of NATO to make an impassioned case against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
"Let me say to all of our friends who are here, especially our Russian friends," Mr. Cohen said, alluding to Russia's efforts to forge a diplomatic solution to the confrontation with Iraq, "If Saddam Hussein has nothing to hide, he has nothing to fear."
Mr. Cohen also held talks with Israel's Minister of Defense, Yitzhak Mordechai, who flew to Munich specifically for the meeting, which was not previously publicized. The two men met for more than an hour aboard Mr. Cohen's plane, an E-4B command aircraft, as it sat on the runway at Munich's airport.
Mr. Cohen expressed strong support for Israel and pledged to review its requests for additional materiel to defend itself from a chemical or biological attack by Iraq.
In an interview last week, Mr. Cohen urged Israel to refrain from retaliating in the event of an attack, including one like Iraq's missile strikes during the Gulf war. Today, his tone shifted significantly.
"Israel obviously has the right of self-defense and will exercise that right of self-defense as they see fit," he said.
The Pentagon's military strategists have drafted a series of plans for bombing campaigns against Iraq, including some that assumed that Saudi Arabia would not give permission to use its territory, officials have said. The targets evidently include bases belonging to Iraq's powerful Republican Guard, military command centers and suspected weapons factories or stockpiles.
Even without the use of the Saudi bases, according to officials at the Pentagon, the United States, with Britain, can still launch a substantial strike from the other bases in the region, as well as the aircraft carriers plying the Persian Gulf.
"The loss of those resources would be felt," a senior defense official said last week, "but that does not in any way mean the objective could not be met."
There are 50 United States combat aircraft at bases in Saudi Arabia enforcing the "no flight" zone in Iraq. Those planes are flown by pilots who have great familiarity with the terrain and possible targets in Iraq. But Pentagon planners could still call on 250 other American combat aircraft in the region.
The United States also has two aircraft carriers in the Gulf, the George Washington and the Independence. A third carrier, the Nimitz, left the gulf today. Mr. Cohen announced on Saturday that he would order the Nimitz, which arrived in the gulf last October, to return to the United States before March 1, as scheduled.

HEADLINE: Indians' New Money Buys Lobbying Power

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 6

 BODY:
Five short years ago, a lobbying excursion to Congress for the Oneida Indians of central New York went something like this: Tribal officials would pile into an old car, endure the eight-hour drive to Washington, sleep on a friend's floor and dine on peanut butter sandwiches, all for the chance to catch some Congressional aide on the fly.
How quaintly remote all that now seems to the Oneidas who flew into Washington last week, stayed four nights in a first-class hotel, co-sponsored a splashy reception for two dozen members of Congress and brought along two lobbyists, a tax lawyer and a publicist to their meetings on the Hill. 
 "We're a bit more sophisticated these days," said Keller George, a member of the Oneidas' ruling council.
A bit more wealthy, too.
Flush with huge gambling profits, tribes like the Oneidas have undergone political makeovers in Washington, where they are using high-priced lobbyists, savvy public relations firms and big campaign contributions to win influence, make friends and crush opponents.
Last week, the Oneidas were one of nearly two dozen tribes from along the Eastern Seaboard and as far west as Texas who flew to Washington for a week of lobbying and political power building. As a sign of their influence, their advocacy association, the United South and Eastern Tribes, drew not only members of Congress to their events, but also the Interior Secretary, Bruce Babbitt, and Attorney General Janet Reno, who electrified the crowd by saying she opposed taxing Indian casinos.
Indians, of course, have been coming to Washington for as long as it has existed, to talk over treaty rights and other issues. And since the early 1990's at least, tribes have been using newfound gambling wealth to expand their political muscle.
But, concerned that momentum is building behind a wide range of Republican bills they consider anti-Indian, tribal leaders have been stoking up their lobbying operations earlier and more forcefully this year than in the past, Congressional officials and tribal leaders say.
"There are more harmful bills out there," said Charles Hobbs, a partner in the lobbying firm of Hobbs, Straus, Dean & Walker, which represents several Eastern tribes.
Chief among their concerns are bills that would authorize the Federal Government to tax profits from casinos, enable states to block new Indian casinos, allow citizens to sue Indian tribes and make it easier for local governments to collect sales taxes from Indian businesses that sell to non-Indians.
In a sign of their growing sophistication, Indians are also weighing in on issues that seem, on the surface, unrelated to tribal affairs. For instance, many tribes are opposing portions of a proposed national tobacco litigation settlement because it might authorize government agencies to regulate Indian tobacco shops -- a violation of their sovereignty, tribes say.
A look inside the United South and Eastern Tribes, whose members include the Mashantucket Pequots and Mohegan Indians of Connecticut and the Seneca Indians and St. Regis Mohawks of New York, shows the changing face of Indian lobbying in Washington.
Ten years ago, only 5 of the group's 23 tribes had Washington lobbyists, but by last year 14 did, from the Seminoles in Florida to the Wampanoags in Massachusetts. And while few tribes could afford major campaign contributions a few years ago, the Pequots, Mohegans and Oneidas -- who all run casinos -- have contributed a total of more than $800,000 to state and Federal candidates since 1994, according to public records.
"The sad fact of life throughout the United States is that having money, or being perceived as having money, does seem to give people more of a voice," said Jayne Fawcett, vice chairwoman of the Mohegan Tribe in Uncasville, Conn.
The Pequots, who run the largest casino in the nation, have also opened a Washington office with full-time staff. And the Oneidas have not only retained law, lobbying and public relations firms in Washington, but also hired a former top Commerce Department official to run their communications operation in New York.
Some Congressional officials contend that the slickness of Indian lobbying is creating a political backlash. And a Justice Department inquiry into whether Mr. Babbitt denied a gambling permit to one Wisconsin tribe because of contributions from a rival tribe has cast shadows over Indian political activity here.
"A lot of their political capital stems from being poor tribes that have been disenfranchised and beat up for 300 years," said John Albaugh, an aide to Representative Ernest J. Istook, Republican of Oklahoma. "Then they hire the biggest firms in town and hold fancy events, and that cuts against their message."
Mr. Hobbs agreed, saying, "Indians have always gotten an extra measure of sympathy from people in Congress." But that factor often disappears, he said, "when a Robert Strauss or someone like that shows up."
For that reason, lobbyists urge their clients to plead their cases face to face with Congressmen. So Mr. George, dressed in a blue jean shirt and alligator boots, his hair pulled taut into a ponytail, did almost all the talking when he led a delegation of Oneida leaders into meetings on Capitol Hill last Thursday.
In session after session, Mr. George told of the dire economic consequences Indians would face if the tax bills were enacted. He offered gifts of fragrant sweetgrass. And he urged an aide to Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, to persuade Gov. George E. Pataki to settle an Oneida land dispute.
Throughout the meetings, the Oneidas' battery of lawyers and publicists remained silent. Their responsibility will be to block the secret deals and catch the bad amendments after the Oneidas have left town.
"I don't fault our opponents for strong lobbying -- it's in their business interests," said Ray Halbritter, the Oneida Nation representative, an elected official. "But we have to look out for ours, too."

Arab Nations Send Cautious Message to U.S.
With Saudi Arabia showing deep reluctance to support a military strike against Iraq, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said that he would not seek permission to launch American fighters and bombers from Saudi territory. A1
 
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright portrayed her recent visit to the Middle East as a success, but messages from top Arab officials are heavy with suggestions that the renewed use of force against Iraq could set off more turmoil in a volatile region. A6 

Native Canadians Win Ruling
A recent ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada declared that the legends of the Gitxsan people in Kispiox, British Columbia, are legally binding evidence that can be used to support Gitxsan claims to as much as 22,000 square miles of British Columbia's remote interior. By essentially validating Indian claims to land even where treaties or titles do not exist, the ruling may redefine how the Government deals with the 1.3 million indigenous people in Canada. A1
 
Leaders Start China Tour
A high-profile delegation of American religious leaders began arriving in Beijing for a three-week tour of China to examine the state of religious freedom, one of the most volatile human rights issues in American diplomacy. A3
 
New Political Plan for Ireland
For the first time since the current peace effort began, a new political structure for Northern Ireland has begun to emerge in talks between leaders of the Protestant majority and the Roman Catholic minority. The plan under discussion would give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more influence on the British province, but would allow no changes to be made without the approval of the province's Protestant majority. A4
 
Cover-Up Denied in Italy Crash
The crew of the American jet that sheared ski-lift cables in northern Italy last week issued a message of sympathy to the families of the victims, and United States military officials denied Italian charges that a delay in handing over the jet's mission recorder was part of an attempted cover-up. The accident killed 20 cable car passengers. Questions about the whereabouts of the plane's mission recorder led to accusations by Italian officials of possible tampering with evidence. A5
 
Backing Away From the Dollar
Southeast Asian leaders, hoping to reduce their reliance on the American dollar and shore up their economies, are rallying behind a proposal to trade goods in local currencies instead of dollars. The dollar, used for most regional trade, has become costly for Southeast Asian countries that have seen their currencies plunge. But experts dismissed the proposal as quixotic, and how such a system would function is unclear. A9

White House Steps Up Campaign Against Starr
The White House broadened its attack on Kenneth W. Starr, calling him "corrupt" and demanding an independent investigation of alleged leaks from his office. Officials in Mr. Starr's office said he had begun his own inquiry into whether his office was leaking to the press. Meantime, a new witness emerged who, lawyers said, told investigators that Monica S. Lewinsky confided in her that she had had an extended affair with President Clinton. A1
 
Springing from unnamed sources, leaks of information about President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky have started a very public brawl among not only hotheaded partisans, but also normally tight-lipped, mild-mannered lawyers. The leaks -- and subsequent fingerpointing and name-calling -- are being picked apart on talk shows and around dinner tables, with ever more fevered theories of Machiavellian strategy being spun to explain who is spreading the information, and why. A15
 
If there is one constant to the difficulties that have rattled through President Clinton's White House these past six years, it is Bruce R. Lindsey, perhaps the closest of Mr. Clinton advisers. He is once again in the middle of a storm -- subpoenaed to testify in the Lewinsky case and helping to direct the White House's daily political and legal response to the investigation. Mr. Lindsey talks often about escaping his existence. But he keeps plodding loyally along to help his friend of 30 years. A15
 
Battle Over Lawyers' Fees
Calling the proposed fees for lawyers in Texas' settlement with the tobacco industry "outrageous," Gov. George W. Bush has gone to Federal court to block the $2.3 billion payment to the roughly 150 lawyers who assisted the state in the tobacco lawsuit. The fight in Texas, and a similar one in Florida, could be dwarfed by the battle that would occur if Congress approved the proposed $368.5 billion national settlement with the tobacco industry. A1
 
G.O.P. Fights Harder on Census
House Republicans, once content with threats to withhold money from the Census Bureau or to challenge the constitutionality of the new methods, are drawing up plans to oversee the census more tightly than any Congress in memory. The Republican moves are part of a continuing fight over the proposed statistical sampling methodology for the 2000 census. House Republican leaders say it is unconstitutional and subject to political manipulation by the Clinton Administration. A11
 
H.I.V. Disclosure Low
Four of every 10 people infected with H.I.V. failed to inform their sex partners about their condition, and nearly two-thirds of those did not always use a condom, according to a survey to be released today. Most of the people surveyed had low incomes and were high school dropouts; many were also drug users. But researchers believe that the withholding of information about H.I.V. infection is widespread.

Prosecutors are investigating 7 of 56 locals of District Council 37, a coalition representing 120,000 New York City workers, and a well-known president of one of the locals has been suspended, plunging the coalition into what some labor leaders are calling its worst crisis ever. The problems are an embarrassing blow to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. A1
 
Partnership to Open Clinics
Montefiore Medical Center has teamed up with a for-profit company, Bentley Health Care of Beverly Hills, in a $100 million deal to open a string of 24-hour-a-day clinics devoted to cancer care and treatment of H.I.V. and AIDS in the New York metropolitan region. B1
 
Reclaiming Penn Station
For six years, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has championed the notion of reclaiming Pennsylvania Station's lost grandeur by a spacious new passenger concourse and ticketing hall in the General Post Office across the street, over the Amtrak platforms. Now, thanks to help from the Clinton Administration, he sees the goal within reach. B1

HEADLINE: Man Attacks One Officer and Shoots Another, Police Say

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A 23-year-old man who was apparently angry because the Newark police had confiscated his car for having stolen license plates walked calmly into a Jersey City police station early today, attacked a desk officer, grabbed the desk lieutenant's gun and shot him twice, seriously wounding him, the police said.
The suspect, William Marable, was arrested after being shot in the ribs, but not badly hurt, by a third officer who ran into the station when he heard gunfire. 
 The wounded lieutenant, Patrick Robinson, was listed in guarded condition at Jersey City Medical Center after surgery to remove about half a foot of his small intestine. Mr. Marable, who was in stable condition at the same hospital, is being charged with attempted murder.
The attack prompted an outcry from Lieutenant Robinson's union because, unlike many modern police headquarters that wall the police off from civilians with buzzer-operated security doors and bulletproof partitions, Jersey City's prewar police stations are wide open to the public.
Mr. Marable, the police said, simply walked in the front door of the West District station, walked around the four-foot-high police desk, which is not protected by a gate, and assaulted Officer Joseph Kelly, the desk assistant.
There was also a 1997 warrant out for Mr. Marable's arrest for failure to pay child support, leading the Jersey City authorities to wonder why the Newark police had released him after arresting him on the license plate charge on Thursday.
Mr. Marable, whose police record includes convictions for drug charges and for falsely incriminating another, lives five blocks from the West District station in the city's depressed Bergen-Lafayette section. Sometime after midnight today, his father said, Mr. Marable left the house, after complaining to a friend about how the Newark police had taken his car.
At 2:04 A.M., according to police reports, he walked into the police station and, apparently ignoring a coffee-stained sign that says "No One Permitted Behind Desk Without Permission of Desk Supervisor," knocked down Officer Kelly.
When Lieutenant Robinson, a 20-year veteran of the force, came to his colleague's aid, Mr. Marable knocked him down, too, and took his service weapon, a 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson, said the Police Director, Michael F. Moriarty. He said both officers are nearly six feet tall. The warrant for Mr. Marable lists him as 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighing 150 pounds, but his father, William Cook, described him as closer to six feet tall and powerfully built.
Mr. Moriarty said that there were 14 bullets in Lieutenant Robinson's gun, and that Mr. Marable fired 12 of them, striking the lieutenant in the thigh and stomach. The noise drew Sgt. Ed Carrittini, who from his car had watched Mr. Marable enter the building. Sergeant Carrittini fired twice at Mr. Marable, hitting him in the chest, the police said.
Lieut. Ron Buonocore, the president of the Jersey City Police Superior Officers Association, said that doctors and nurses at the hospital heard Mr. Marable bragging that he had got even with the police. His father, Mr. Cook, did not rule out the possibility.
"I know he was angry," Mr. Cook said. "Maybe he got revenge."
Mr. Cook, standing at the windowless front door of the faded white row house on Summit Avenue where he and his son live, said that Mr. Marable was "a good kid" but that he had been in and out of jail and was usually unemployed.
When told that Lieutenant Robinson was expected to recover, Mr. Cook said, "That's good. At least they ain't got death on him yet. At least he ain't killed anyone yet."
Last night the police in Newark and Jersey City were trying to figure out why Mr. Marable was not held in Newark on the child support warrant, which was issued in Jersey City. The police are supposed to run a warrant check on anyone they arrest, but Robert Martin the Deputy Police Chief in Jersey City, said it was conceivable that the warrant had not been entered into the state database, or that officers in Newark were not able to confirm that the warrant was still active when they arrested Mr. Marable.
Today's attack marked the first time in memory that a Jersey City officer had been shot inside a precinct house, but Mr. Buonocore said that given the design of the station it was only a matter of time before something like that happened.
"Members have been complaining for years that there's no security," he said.
Mr. Moriarty said that four months ago, the department began planning to buy and install surveillance cameras and intercom buzzers at all four stations, at a cost of about $40,000. He said the shooting would probably speed up the procurement process.
Mr. Moriarty said that while the officers' safety was a priority, it had to be balanced with community relations.
"There's a tradition in Jersey City that people have access to the Police Department," he said. "We don't want to give the impression that we're trying to keep people away. If nobody can come into the precinct, or if people say they got turned away because the guy didn't like the way they looked or the way they sounded, people are going to complain."
But while the police, unlike many store owners, are armed and carry the authority of law enforcement, a veteran tour commander at the West District, Lieut. Charles Winterhalter, said he sometimes felt vulnerable. He stood behind the desk at the busiest police station in the city, one of the busiest in the state, 10 feet from a double door, the panes of which have been replaced by aluminum panels painted black.
"At least when you get dispatched to a shooting or a homicide you know what you're getting into," he said. "Here they walk in and they're on top of you, and you have no idea what they're going to do."

HEADLINE: Reclaiming 'Day' and 'Night,' Memories in Marble

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
In 1968, Robert A. Roe saved the "Day."
And the "Night."
These two graceful allegorical statues, wrested from the facade of Pennsylvania Station, had been carted out of Manhattan and dumped into a trackside landfill in Secaucus, N.J. 
 There, "Day" was photographed by Eddie Hausner of The New York Times. He depicted a large fragment of the marble maiden -- with her gentle face and silken robes, sunflower garland and bayberry wreath -- upside down in a jumbled wasteland as a lone train crossed the bleak horizon.
"I knew I made a nice picture but that was about the extent of it," Mr. Hausner said.
Actually, what he made was probably the most evocative single image of the demolition of Pennsylvania Station.
"It grabbed you," recalled Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York. "You thought: 'What have we done? Has the city been sacked?' "
The picture in The Times grabbed Mr. Roe, who was then the New Jersey Commissioner of Conservation and Economic Development. (He later served in the United States House of Representatives.) Mr. Roe dispatched a rescue crew. "We decided to salvage them because they were of great historical interest and value," he said.
The remnants of the statues were taken to Ringwood State Park in northern Passaic County, where they have been stored ever since. Now -- shades of Ellis Island! -- New York would like one of them back.
But it will have to persuade New Jersey Transit, which has acquired the statues with a view to installing them at the Broad Street station in Newark.
The Pennsylvania Station Redevelopment Corporation, a New York agency, proposes sharing the costs of shipping, restoring and duplicating the statues, so that each state would wind up having an original of one statue, and a replica of the other.
New York's pair would be part of the new Pennsylvania Station that the corporation is planning within the General Post Office on Eighth Avenue. "These statues are an irreplaceable physical tie to the late, great Pennsylvania Station," said Alexandros E. Washburn, the president of the corporation, in a letter to New Jersey Transit. "Finally, the mute stones speak."
A spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit said on Tuesday that the railroad was "trying to work out something" with New York officials.
The figures were the work of Adolph A. Weinman, who may be best known for the gilded "Civic Fame" atop the Municipal Building in lower Manhattan.
Pennsylvania Station had four pairs of the "Day" and "Night" figures flanking large clocks on each facade. One "Night" is now at the Brooklyn Museum. A "Day" and a "Night" are in Kansas City, Mo. David D. Morrison, a railroad historian, does not believe that the Ringwood "Day" is the one pictured in The Times, based on its condition, although he said it may have been salvaged from the same field of debris.
The impending move was greeted ambivalently by Elbertus Prol, the curator of Ringwood Manor in the state park for 31 years.
"I'm going to miss them, yes," he said. "But they're going to be preserved in a better setting."

HEADLINE: Fat Fees in Tobacco Deals Signal New Foe for States: The Lawyers

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
At first blush, it sounds like a standard contingency-fee agreement -- even generous to the client, by trial lawyers' standards. The lawyers who took the case fronted the initial costs, agreed not to take a penny if the client did not collect, and asked for only 15 percent if there was a settlement.
But when the client is the state of Texas, and the state's settlement with the tobacco industry is $15.3 billion, the result is not cheerful payment of the lawyers' bill, which comes to $2.3 billion (plus expenses, some lawyers argue). It is a Texas-sized war. 
 Calling the proposed fees "outrageous," Gov. George W. Bush has gone to Federal court to block the payment to the roughly 150 lawyers who assisted Texas in the tobacco lawsuit, which was settled last month. In return, the state's Attorney General, Dan Morales, the chief architect of the settlement, who believes that Governor Bush's move could undermine the accord, accused him of having "chosen to wrap himself in a tobacco leaf" and said the Governor was pandering for campaign contributions from big tobacco in a future run for the White House.
The fight here mirrors one in Florida, where some lawyers are trying to collect up to 25 percent of that state's $11.3 billion settlement with the tobacco industry for health-related damages caused by smoking. That battle has the added twist of lawyers fighting among themselves over the share of any proceeds, but for now, a state judge has blocked some lawyers' attempts to collect fees by filing liens on the tobacco companies' payments to the state.
The Florida judge, Harold J. Cohen, of the Circuit Court in West Palm Beach, ruled late last year that the lawyers may well be entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars for their work. But in a ruling that basically tore up the stipulated 25 percent, he wrote: "2.87 billion dollars simply shocks the conscience of the court. It is per se unreasonable."
The proposed fees in Texas and Florida appear to be the two largest payments to lawyers in the history of American litigation. But as gargantuan as the fight over them may seem now, it may well be dwarfed by the one that would occur if Congress approves a $368.5 billion national settlement with the tobacco industry, which in most respects would supersede the agreements here and those expected in three dozen other states that have pending legal action against the tobacco companies.
Even without such a national deal in hand, several members of Congress have offered legislation that would cap the amounts that would be paid to the hundreds of private lawyers who assisted on that agreement, which was announced last spring but has yet to be acted on. A bill in the House would set the fees at no more than $150 an hour, plus expenses, while one in the Senate would put the amount at $250 an hour.
Here in the second-largest state, there are enough subtexts in the fee battle to occupy an entire semester's study of Texas Politics 101.
Trial lawyers here have long been major contributors to the Democratic Party and have fought Mr. Bush, a Republican, over tort-reform legislation that would cap award payments in civil trials and limit what Mr. Bush calls "frivolous lawsuits."
The Governor is running for re-election, and it seems hard to believe that he has chosen the wrong side of a major political issue by arguing to Texans that a bunch of trial lawyers do not deserve $2.3 billion in fees. In his filing to Judge David Folsom of Federal District Court in Texarkana, Mr. Bush said he did not want to do anything to reduce the overall size of the settlement: he wanted more of the money to go to health-care programs and less to lawyers.
Nor is he alone among Texas politicians. A bipartisan group of seven lawmakers filed a similar petition to the judge, arguing that the fees are "excessive and unconscionable."
Nonetheless, Mr. Bush's strategy is not without risk. Mr. Morales says the action directly threatens to undermine the settlement, which contains a provision that it can be terminated if the courts or lawmakers change it in any major "material respect." The Attorney General said Mr. Bush was doing the bidding of the tobacco companies by filing the equivalent of a legal bombshell that could destroy the agreement.
"Today's filing is about one thing and one thing only," Mr. Morales said at a news conference in Austin just after the Governor acted: "A Republican Presidential campaign and political contributions from big tobacco. Our state's historic victory over big tobacco is placed in serious jeopardy. Governor Bush, shame on you. The children of Texas will never forgive you for this."
Mr. Bush's spokeswoman, Karen Hughes, said the Attorney General was engaging in "scurrilous personal attacks" and that he was "trying to defend the indefensible." She said that the Governor was only seeking to sever the issue of fees from all other aspects of the settlement.
Mr. Morales, a popular Democrat who has declined to run for re-election this year but is still seen as a possible future candidate for higher statewide office, has clearly chosen to align himself with the lawyers. As the Democrats, who once dominated Texas politically, struggle to fight back the Republican surge of recent years, the lawyers' industry is expected to continue to be a major financial backer of the party.
The Attorney General said his office had made an up-front agreement on fees with the private lawyers two years ago and should honor the pact.
Clearly raising the image of an Old West duel, Mr. Morales said he wanted to meet with the Governor "any place, any time" to settle their differences -- with a public debate, not a shootout, he added -- over the fee issue. Mr. Bush declined, saying the matter should be resolved in court.
For its part, the tobacco industry stoutly denies that it carries any secret agenda of trying to scuttle the Texas agreement, under which the state is to get $1.2 billion for health programs this year and a series of other payments stretched out over at least the next 15 years.
"We are not looking to blow up the deal and consider the case done," Dan Webb, a lawyer who represents Philip Morris, said last week.
"If the state of Texas wants to give all their money to lawyers or all the money to sick smokers, they can do it," Mr. Webb told The Dallas Morning News. "The tobacco companies don't have a dog in this fight."
Last month, Mr. Bush speculated aloud that the fees the lawyers were demanding here could average roughly $450,000 an hour, though Mr. Morales called that a "patently silly estimate." The 150 or so lawyers involved in a major way in the case have not provided a precise estimate yet of exactly how much time they put into the case, but many have pointed out that they also owe a small fortune in payments to doctors, other health experts, economists, professors and other consultants they had hired in preparation for the case. (Some of the lawyers say those are expenses that are separate from the legal fees.)
Some lawyers have made it clear that they would be willing to negotiate much-reduced fees: a spokesman for the lawyers in Texas said they would be willing to donate more than $400 million to a private foundation for health care. But others insist that the arrangement is defensible, and point out that other states have initiated fee agreements of 25 percent or even 33 1/3 percent for tobacco litigation.
First, they say, $2.3 billion sounds like more than it really is, since that is an amount to be paid out over several years, not in present-day dollars. Second, they argue, as in all contingency arrangements, the lawyers took an enormous risk in taking on a case that was by no means certain to be settled. And third, they say, Mr. Morales made what should be considered a binding agreement.
The fight over the fees is not the only litigation likely to be spawned by the $15.3 billion agreement. While the money has already been earmarked for health programs and hospitals, many public officials have demanded more say in precisely how the money is spent.
"It is ironic," said Judge Lee Jackson of Dallas County, who joined in a motion to change some of the spending provisions in the deal, "that a tobacco settlement would contain a secret budget deal that is reminiscent of agreements made in the days of smoke-filled rooms."

HEADLINE: Pessimism Retains Grip on Appalachian Poor

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: BOONEVILLE, Ky.

 BODY:
There is an area of Booneville that some residents call Ho Chi Minh City for its third world appearance. It is not large, just a few winding gravel roads. But many of the houses look like shanties, heated with wood or coal. Children walk around with dirty bare feet. Many people lack telephones and cars.
In many respects, this little corner of Appalachia looks much as it did 30 years ago, when President Lyndon B. Johnson declared a war on poverty, taking special aim at the rural decay in places like Owsley County, here in eastern Kentucky, and other distressed areas in the 399 counties of 13 states that make up Appalachia. 
 Federal and state agencies have plowed billions of dollars into Appalachia through economic development programs, highway construction and job-creation initiatives to help residents overcome the economic and psychological isolation caused by poverty and the rugged terrain.
But a tour of Booneville offers ample evidence that money and countless programs have had only marginal effects on breaking a cycle of poverty and despair that continues throughout many parts of Appalachia. And conditions could grow worse before they improve.
With state welfare regulations forcing recipients to find work and with the Federal Government reviewing the eligibility of children who receive disability benefits, many Owsley County residents could lose vital monthly checks that they have relied on for years. More than half of the people in the county who receive those benefits are children.
Viewing those prospects, some residents sound much like people who have criticized entitlement programs for stagnating inner cities.
"The war on poverty was the worst thing that ever happened to Appalachia," said Denise Hoffman, 46, who runs a small farm here with her husband, Neil. "It gave people a way to get by without having to do any work."
By many measures, Appalachia remains mired in poverty. In about one-quarter of the highland region's counties, according to data from the 1990 census, 25 percent or more of residents live below the poverty level as defined by the Federal Government. That rate is nearly double the national average.
Owsley County, with a population of 5,400, is one of the most distressed areas. To many residents, the booming national economy is something they hear about only on television.
More than 46 percent live in poverty, as defined by the Government. The median household income of $8,595 is one of the lowest in Appalachia. Almost half the adults are unemployed. About two-thirds of the people in the county receive Federal assistance, 30 percent of county families do not have telephones, and 20 percent do not have cars.
More than half the adult population is illiterate.
But perhaps most critical of all, with the coal industry long gone as a major employer and job creation minimal and sporadic, feelings of hopelessness have become so deeply entrenched that many residents have long forsaken any expectation of bettering themselves.
Even a generous new program to encourage savings is struggling to win participants. Through a foundation grant to finance a $6-to-$1 match, residents can deposit up to $15 a month for two years, a total of $360, and receive back $2,520. The program began in May to encourage low-income people to set aside money for home improvements, a new business or school.
Eight people are participating.
"The overriding theory of the program works against the mentality that is deeply set within people who live in poverty," said the program administrator, Jennifer Hart. "They don't think they have a future. If they did, they would think about it and delay instant gratification. But they have no reason to. And they can't. They can only think about how they are going to feed the children this week and pay the rent this month."
Even many of the 70 seniors at Owsley County High School this year sense the inevitability of spending their lives in poverty, unchanged from their parents' situations.
The Hoffmans' 17-year-old daughter, Megan, a top student and an athlete who has been accepted to four state colleges, thinks of her classmates with chagrin.
"Many of them think things are never going to get any better," she said. "It's pretty sad. Kids feel, 'I don't think I can make a difference.' They don't seem to want to change or care."
When the senior class voted on the message to print on their T-shirts this year, an annual custom, they chose: "I came. I slept. I graduated." Megan said fewer than 25 percent plan to attend college.
As elsewhere in Appalachia, the feelings of hopelessness prevail despite energetic efforts by Government and private groups like the Mountain Association for Community Economic Development, a 21-year-old organization in Berea that helps community groups in 49 counties around the state.
In Owsley it provides a ray of hope through self-help programs like job-training classes, courses on starting a business and agencies that make low-interest loans. It also aids in recruiting companies into the area, a mighty challenge in Booneville, with its remote location and lack of services. The town has two restaurants, three groceries and one dentist. And while it has three doctors the nearest hospital is an hour away.
To attack the worst of rural poverty, the association created "action teams" six years ago for the most distressed counties, Owsley and Letcher. In each, officials work closely with local leaders to convince residents that they can lead more productive lives.
The efforts take many forms. In Booneville, the team helped bring Image Entry, a data-entry company that created 58 jobs, onto a site that local leaders hope will become an industrial park. Team members helped start associations for goat breeders and vegetable growers, to increase their profits. The team also helped set up a secondhand shop that employs welfare recipients so that they can fulfill new state regulations that require them to find a job in two years or lose benefits. Next to the shop is a credit union that offers low-interest loans and a generous matched-saving program.
The state welfare agency has set up a pilot program for recipients that teaches "job readiness skills," including how to write a resume and how to fill out a job application.
Yet every initiative pits the action team and Government agencies against an intractable pessimism built on decades of depressed conditions that are visible everywhere: piles of garbage heaped into creeks and ravines because people cannot afford the $12 monthly fee for trash removal; landscapes of rusting cars, some from the 1950's, and the crumbling shell of the Seale theater, which last showed a movie, "Silver Bullet," in 1985.
But many residents say the prevailing attitude in the county, particularly among those receiving state and Federal entitlement benefits, is that no amount of help and instruction is going to make a difference. According to the most recent state statistics, 14.3 percent of Owsley residents receive welfare benefits, 20 percent receive benefits through the Federal assistance program for disabled people known as Supplemental Security Income and almost half receive food stamps.
Mr. Hoffman, 47, a member of the action team, grew almost angry, talking about the conditions in much of Appalachia. "Poverty is not about money," he said. "It's in the mind. It's a way of life. Once you're in that cycle you think you can't break out of it. I don't know why people think that way, but they become a prisoner of it. It took us three generations to get into this mess, and it's going to take us three generations to get out of it."
Members of the team say many parents urge their children to try to go to special education classes at school as a way to prove that they are eligible for disability benefits.
"That shows how creative people are when there are no jobs," said Jeanne Gage, the director of the sustainable communities initiative for the Mountain Association. "You learn how to work the system."
But as the system is changing, that could have a devastating effect on Owsley County without more jobs.
Pam Barrett, 32, a divorced mother of a 17-year-old daughter and two sons, 11 and 10, is beginning to feel the pinch. Living with her 38-year-old former husband, who receives $438 a month in disability benefits for bad nerves and a spine injury, she began working 20 hours a week at the secondhand shop two months ago. She plans to use some of the money for her daughter, Jennifer, who expects to receive an athletic scholarship and start college in the fall.
"She has the chance I passed up to have three young'uns," Ms. Barrett said. "I quit school in the eighth grade to get married. I was 15. He was 21. I've regretted it ever since. And young'uns having babies is going on right today. But I tell you what, you learn from your mistakes."
Farmers like the Hoffmans, who rely on tobacco as their leading cash crop, are enduring another anxiety, waiting to see how the litigation between cigarette companies and Federal and state governments might affect small growers.
Action team members and government officials working to turn around the fortunes of Owsley County all say their efforts are paying off, even against an enormous tide of negativism that now touches some of those who are succeeding.
Megan Hoffman said, "I have really enjoyed growing up here." But asked whether she planned to return after college, she said: "No. There is nothing here. There is nothing to come back to."
The president of the Mountain Association, Don Harker, said that attitude would be difficult to change any time soon.
"We have an immense amount of work to do to bring up the prosperity levels of Appalachia," Mr. Harker said. "To give people hope, we have to change the whole dynamic. To give people a reason to believe things can be different than they are, we have to change their expectations.
"I know we can do it," he said. "But I don't think it will be done in my lifetime."

HEADLINE: Armenia's Turmoil

 BODY:
The resignation of Armenia's president, Levon Ter-Petrossian, earlier this month was a disturbing development for peace and ethnic harmony in the Caucasus. Largely Christian Armenia is at war with its larger and richer Muslim neighbor, Azerbaijan, over Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave in Azerbaijan populated by Armenians, who are seeking independence. In September, Mr. Ter-Petrossian, under pressure from the United States, France and Russia, announced his support for a peace plan that contained necessary compromises. The compromises enraged hard-liners in his Government and parliamentary coalition, who forced him to resign.
Mr. Ter-Petrossian was already unpopular, largely due to suspicions that he won the 1996 election through fraud. But his peace plan, seen by many Armenians as a sellout, is the only realistic solution to the Nagorno-Karabakh war, which began in 1988 after the enclave demanded Armenian rule and has killed 25,000 people, mostly civilians. It has sabotaged Armenia's economy and threatens the stability of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea region. Mr. Ter-Petrossian's ouster increases chances that a cease-fire that has held since 1994 will be broken. 
 His resignation also formalizes the increasing grip on power of an unsavory band of military and security officials. Their troops beat demonstrators protesting election fraud, and some have ties to a group that has attacked religious minorities.
The sponsors of the negotiations, most importantly Moscow, must scramble to keep the peace effort from collapse. They must persuade Armenia's new leaders that the agreement, which would result in some form of autonomy but not independence for Nagorno-Karabakh, is the only chance to achieve the stability and peace their country needs.
International groups must mobilize now to supervise new elections scheduled for March 16, as another ballot clouded by fraud would harm Armenia's teetering democracy. But even a clean election is unlikely to choose a president willing to make the compromises necessary for peace.

HEADLINE: House Republicans Plan to Keep a Tight Rein on 2000 Census

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 8

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress are preparing to renew their fight to prevent the Census Bureau from using a new method to count the nation's population in 2000.
House Republicans, once content with threats to withhold money from the Census Bureau or to challenge the constitutionality of the new method, are now drawing up plans to oversee the census more tightly than any Congress in memory. 
 "We must have a huge say in the planning, preparation and implementation of the 2000 Census," said Representative Dan Miller, the Florida Republican who is heads a House subcommittee that oversees the Census Bureau.
Last week, House leaders granted Mr. Miller's subcommittee a $1.1 million budget to oversee preparations for the next census. The money, which comes from a special account established by House Republican leaders for investigations, is about 10 times more than what was allocated to the House subcommittee that oversaw preparations for the 1990 census. House leaders have yet to say precisely how they will supervise the census.
The Republican moves are part of an ongoing fight over the proposed statistical sampling methodology for the 2000 Census. The technique is already used to measure things like the nation's unemployment rate.
For the 2000 Census, the bureau plans to estimate the number of people living in a given census tract -- a neighborhood of about 1,700 households -- by visiting a sample of those homes in which residents do not return their mail-in census forms or do not answer the knock at the door when visited by census takers. In addition, after the census is completed, the bureau plans to have census takers visit 750,000 of the country's estimated 119 million addresses and use that sample to determine the accuracy of the overall count.
Census officials have said sampling is the only way to avoid the problems of the 1990 Census, which was the most expensive in history but missed more than 10 million people, many of them minority residents of inner-city neighborhoods.
Though the method has been sanctioned by scientific panels, Republican leaders in the House say it is unconstitutional and subject to manipulation by the Clinton Administration. Supporters of sampling say they suspect that Republican opposition stems from a fear that counting more minorities, who tend to vote Democratic, would result in a redrawing of Congressional district lines that would benefit Democrats.
To counter the charge that that the Administration could, through the use of sampling, manipulate the census, some members of Congress are pushing the Clinton Administration to appoint a Republican, Barbara Everitt Bryant, as the new director of the Census Bureau. The former bureau director, Martha Farnsworth Riche, resigned last month in the face of mounting Republican opposition to the use of sampling.
Ms. Bryant, a proponent of sampling, was the Census Bureau director during the Bush Administration.
The possibility of Ms. Bryant's appointment places Republican opponents of sampling in a political quandary. As a former census director, she has the professional credentials. And, as a Republican, she could conceivably be trusted to resist any attempts by the Clinton Administration to manipulate the census figures for partisan gain.
"She is a professional and not a politician," said Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican who has defied his party's leadership by supporting sampling.

Backer of U.S. Heliport Wins Vote in Japan

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Feb. 8

 BODY:
A backer of a proposed floating United States heliport off the coast of Okinawa narrowly won a mayoral election today, providing a boost to supporters of an American military presence on the southern Japanese island.
The winning candidate, Takeo Kishimoto, who was endorsed by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, told voters in the city of Nago that the heliport would help the depressed local economy. Mr. Kishimoto won 16,253 votes -- about 1,150 more than his main opponent, Yoshikazu Tamaki, who argued the base would increase noise and crime. 
 The election, with turnout at 82 percent, was held two days after the Governor of Okinawa, Masahide Ota, announced that he would not support the central Government's efforts to build the floating platform.
Governor Ota noted that in a non-binding referendum in December, 54 percent of Nago voters rejected the proposed heliport. Mr. Kishimoto's victory is expected to bolster the central Government's campaign to persuade the Governor to support the heliport. Mr. Ota's approval is required for the base.
The heliport project resulted from a 1996 United States-Japan agreement, under which Washington agreed to close the Futenma Air Station in five to seven years on condition that an alternative heliport be built somewhere in Okinawa prefecture. Two-thirds of the 47,000 American troops stationed in Japan are concentrated on Okinawa, about 1,000 miles southwest of Tokyo.
Longstanding grass-roots opposition to the military presence in Japan exploded in 1995 after three American servicemen raped a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa.

HEADLINE: Don't Let Russia Derail NATO Expansion

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Howard Baker Jr., Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye (Op-Ed, Feb. 4) take the issue of expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization too seriously. NATO expansion is not a threat to Western security. Only Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary are likely to be admitted in the next several years. The Russians have accepted, however reluctantly, this degree of enlargement. 
 Second, full Russian cooperation with the United States can no longer be achieved or even expected. Russia is seeking a larger role in international politics by pursuing its own national interests as its post-Communist elites see them. Part of this is convincing Americans that NATO expansion is a danger. The article also suggests permanent second-class -- and in effect non-European -- status for all the countries of East Central Europe (and Russia).
Do the writers have the right to say who is European and who is not? And who are they to tell the unemployment-ridden Western Europeans that they ought to admit more states now to the European Union?

HEADLINE: Don't Let Russia Derail NATO Expansion;
Marshall Plan Model

 BODY:

To the Editor:
"NATO: A Debate Recast" (Op-Ed, Feb. 4) raises serious reservations about the expansion of the alliance to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. Howard Baker Jr., Sam Nunn, Brent Scowcroft and Alton Frye conclude that European Union expansion should precede NATO expansion. 
 Their reservations are reinforced when you consider the costs of expansion: $35 billion over 10 years. Adding other Central and Eastern European countries would double the cost. Rearming the former Warsaw Pact countries would add little to their security or the security of NATO members. The last things these countries need are the advanced fighter jets and military infrastructure required by NATO membership.
This level of financing could be used to establish a new Marshall Plan that could help turn around their economies.

HEADLINE: N.B.A. ALL-STAR GAME: NOTEBOOK;
Jordan Is Still Firmly In His Coach's Corner

BYLINE: By STEVE POPPER 

 BODY:
Michael Jordan had arrived at Madison Square Garden yesterday, still sniffling, but he was seated comfortably in the Knicks' locker room. The National Basketball Association could breathe a sigh of relief that Jordan was suiting up for what could be his final All-Star Game appearance, but he did nothing to alleviate the Bulls' fears that their golden goose is leaving after this season.
Jordan has said that if Phil Jackson is not back as the coach, he will not be back as a player. And if Jackson does not return, Jordan will put the blame squarely on Jerry Reinsdorf, the team owner, and Jerry Krause, the general manager. 
 "I think it's more or less personalities," Jordan said.
"It certainly can't be because of his job and what he's done with his players and the respect that he has won with the players," Jordan said of Jackson. "His success as a coach is certainly impeccable."
Asked if he truly believed that this would be his last go-round, he said: "Yes, I do. I haven't seen any light on the other side of the tunnel at all."
While Jordan and the Bulls' success has turned the N.B.A. into a worldwide enterprise, he said that he believed that greed and control were at issue.
"It's more control than anything," Jordan said. "Maybe it's not the way they want it to be. From an economic standpoint, I don't think they're making as much as they used to."
But even subtracting Jordan's $31.8 million salary, as well as the contracts of Jackson and Scottie Pippen, the Bulls do not figure to have their logo confused with a dollar sign anymore.
"That's a gamble they're willing to take," Jordan said. "You and I understand that. I think it's more a personality issue. They're willing to take the risk."
Asked if he might have a role in the league after he retired, he replied: "I'm going to be a fan from afar, watching the game. I'm pretty sure I'll still have some contact because of my business with the shoe industry. I'll come down to the United Center and visit."
With his problems with Bulls management and the expected departure of those in the organization he holds dear, Jordan was not about to profess just whom he would be a fan of.
"I don't know yet," he said. "We'll have to see."
 
Multimillionaires' Locker
 Michael Jordan did not know that the locker he had taken at the Garden belonged to Patrick Ewing.
Told whose spot he was using, Jordan expressed a bit of empathy for the Knicks center who missed a chance to play in front of the hometown fans when he dislocated a bone and tore ligaments in his right wrist in December.
"He's here in spirit," Jordan said. "I respect Patrick so much. Fortunately, I got his locker. That's pretty neat. I always wanted to stand in his shoes. I've never been over here. I wondered what it looked like."
When someone joked that you have to earn at least $20 million to use that locker, Jordan deadpanned, "Yeah, that's why I'm here."
 
Williams, a Nonbeliever
 Despite Jordan's insistence that this was his final season, not everyone believed him.
"Michael will be here again next year and win the m.v.p. again," the Nets' Jayson Williams said. "I don't know why Mike needs so much drama in his life."
 
Passing the Torch
 While younger All-Stars have been inundated with questions about who is Jordan's heir apparent, he is not bothered by talk of his demise and the prospect of handing the torch to Kobe Bryant or Grant Hill.
"I think it's no different than when I came in the league," Jordan said. "It's just a standard of measurement in terms of competitors.
"They did it with me and Dr. J," he said, referring to Julius Erving. "It doesn't faze me. But it puts pressure on certain people to live up to it."

HEADLINE: Researchers Paint New Portrait of an Ancient People

BYLINE: By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
AS the last of the great civilizations of antiquity to be discovered, the Indus culture of the third millennium B.C. has long suffered in comparison with its more illustrious contemporaries to the west. Its baked-brick cities, without splendid palaces and unadorned by images of mighty rulers and triumphant battles, might evoke wonder but not the awe of archeologists whose eyes had gazed upon the pyramids and temples of Egypt or the royal cemeteries of Mesopotamia.
Even the timing of its discovery, in the early 1920's, militated against a proper appreciation of the Indus civilization on its own terms. At the same time, Howard Carter was opening the tomb of the young pharaoh Tutankhamen and seeing "everywhere the glint of gold." And Leonard Woolley was excavating graves at Ur, revealing the art, technology and wealth of the Sumerians on the plain of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers in what is now Iraq. 
 Nothing so dazzling greeted John Marshall, the British director general of the Archeological Survey of India, who brought to light the large cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro in the fertile Indus River valley. They were among the world's largest cities (rivaled only by Uruk in Mesopotamia), serving as centers of commerce for a civilization extending over the region of present-day Pakistan and western India. This was an area twice as large as that occupied by either the Egyptians or Sumerians.
Now, renewed excavations and a re-examination of artifacts have awakened scholarly interest in everything about the Indus civilization: the sources of its economic strength and cultural cohesion, the puzzle of its undeciphered writing, the reasons for its rise in 2600 B.C. and decline around 1900 B.C. Many early assumptions and theories have been abandoned or revised. More than 1,500 sites of Indus settlements have been identified. But mysteries persist.
The new research has inspired an exhibition of Indus pottery and figurines, bangles and beads, which opens tomorrow at the Asia Society in New York City. The curator, Dr. Jonathan Mark Kenoyer of the University of Wisconsin, has described current knowledge of the culture in the current issue of Archaeology magazine and in a new book, "Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization," published by Oxford University Press.
The Indus cities represented the beginning of urbanism in the Indian subcontinent. The people lived in large cities with thick brick walls and gateways to protect them and control trade. The cities were served by numerous water wells, bathing quarters and an extensive system of waste-water drains. The elites seemed to shun ostentation, apparently doing without elaborate palaces or temples. The view of this as a largely unmilitary culture is fostered by the absence of any iconography of battle or of spears and other obvious instruments of warfare.
The Indus culture, Dr. Kenoyer wrote, "was quite different from other early civilizations."
In an article in the current issue of The Journal of World Prehistory, another leading archeologist in the field, Dr. Gregory L. Possehl of the University of Pennsylvania, described how theories about the Indus culture by earlier scholars have been swept aside, but have yet to be replaced by a new consensus.
According to the original view, the Indus people were austere, peaceful, urban, merchant burghers, a kind of ancient version of the Hanseatic mercantile culture of northern Europe. When the British archeologist Mortimer Wheeler excavated more intensively in the valley after World War II, a new interpretation emerged: this was a state ruled by priest-kings, its wealth based on agriculture and trade, a dull and regimented society that bore a strong likeness with Mesopotamia. This view also has been largely rejected.
"You catch us at a moment of change and re-interpretation," Dr. Possehl said in an interview at the University Museum of Archeology and Anthropology in Philadelphia.
Before him was a table laid with Indus artifacts: assorted pottery with fish-scale designs, woodland scenes and peacocks; a seal bearing the impression of a unicorn; a clay rattle and a toy cart also made of clay, and several small figurines, including one of a potbellied man.
Dr. Possehl stood there pondering a question: Why is it taking so long to come up with new interpretations explaining the Indus success?
"We have a stubborn problem; call it a double-whammy problem," Dr. Possehl said, finally. "So much archeological reconstruction of a civilization depends on an interplay of physical remains and written records. Forget about Indus writing. We can't decipher it and, besides, we have found no inscriptions of more than 26 characters, so we are left with no long narratives. Also, the physical remains, the archeological expressions of the Indus people, don't look like anything we are familiar with -- no palaces or monuments or temples."
Dr. Possehl, who has excavated Indus cities since the 1960's and written several books on the culture, also lamented the apparently simple Indus burial practices, which deprive archeologists of what is usually a most revealing lode of cultural information.
Unlike the elites of Egypt and Mesopotamia, the Indus people sent their dead to the afterworld unaccompanied by jewels, furniture and weapons. "That's an attitude," he said. "Stuff is kept in circulation with living people."
Excavations at Harappa, Dr. Kenoyer said, indicated that some people were buried in wooden coffins with pottery vessels that may have been filled with food. But having found so few cemeteries, archeologists suspect that burial was not the rule; perhaps most bodies were cremated or thrown into rivers.
Simple burials seem to fit the one persistent image of Indus society, which is that of a practical people without centralized rulers or kings but with wide-ranging economic interests. Somehow they introduced millet cultivation from Africa. Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets record the presence of Indus merchants and ships there during the reign of Sargon the Great, founder of the Akkadian kingdom, around 2300 B.C. The texts mention such trade goods as hardwoods, tin or lead, copper, gold, silver shell, pearls and ivory.
In other excavations, archeologists have found distinctive Indus cubical weights, made of chert or agate and used for measuring goods before a transaction, at many sites of Arabian Sea ports. These weights have also turned up at all Indus settlements. However, the large number of them recovered, along with small copper scale pans, near Harappa's main gate has led Dr. Kenoyer to suspect that the weights were not used primarily for trading but for assessing taxes on goods being brought into or taken out of the cities.
Even if the cities reveal no monumental traces of strong rulers, all around is indirect evidence of some kind of organizing influence. Who oversaw foreign commerce by sea and regulated the system of weights? How to explain the apparently common religion, uniform pottery and coherent Indus style of artifacts over a period of 700 years, spanning nearly 30 generations?
"We have the peculiar expression of an ancient sociocultural complexity without the ostentations of ideology or evidence of a focused leadership, like a king or queen," Dr. Possehl said. "There's no real model in history or ethnography that suggests that somewhere else there was a civilization like this one."
The Indus cities themselves attest to the presence, if not the identity, of some powerful guiding hand in the culture.
Dr. Michael Jansen, an archeologist at the University of Aachen in Germany, calls Mohenjo-daro "a founder city." That is, like Alexandria, the Egyptian city ordered built by Alexander the Great, Mohenjo-daro bears all the signs of a city that was willed into existence by some powerful person or group of people. The streets were straight, laid out on a north-south and east-west grid. Houses of brick on top of stone foundations seem to have been built to standard designs. Nearly all of them were connected to a city-wide drainage system, and each block had one or more water wells.
The most imposing part of Mohenjo-daro was the Mound of the Great Bath, originally thought of as a citadel. Built on a high mound of dirt and brick rising from the flood plain, this upper city covered an area about 600 feet by 1,200 feet. Its largest building is sometimes described as a warehouse for grain and other agriculture products, though some archeologists think it was more likely a residence or meeting hall for powerful merchant families. The bathhouse itself included a sunken courtyard lined with closely fitted bricks for a watertight pool, which was surrounded by colonnaded halls.
"This is the only piece of architecture we have that is reasonably convincing as something to do with ritual," Dr. Possehl said. "It's not your Y.M.C.A., but a place where some select part of the population came to do their ritual ablutions."
Although the rise of Indus urbanism is usually dated at 2600 B.C., most archeologists characterize the transition as a gradual phenomenon. For several centuries, people throughout the region developed new technologies like wheel-thrown pottery and copper metallurgy.
They began carving seals on ivory and terra cotta and decorating pottery with graffiti, the beginning of the culture's writing. Perhaps of special importance was the expansion of long-distance trading networks.
All these are considered factors in what appears to have been a population explosion around 2600. Recent radiocarbon dating indicates that the number of settlements in the region more than doubled at the time, and the first large cities came into being.
The civilization, however it was tied together, began unraveling in the early second millennium B.C. The end is usually dated at 1900 B.C.
As for the causes, archeologists cite new research that rules out invasion by Indo-Aryan hordes from the north. That was the earliest hypothesis advanced by Mortimer Wheeler. But the Rig Veda, the liturgical writings of the nomadic Aryans, was not composed until about 1000 B.C., making it unlikely that these people were in the Indus region at the time of the collapse. Besides, the historical validity of the Rig Veda has not been established.
In his book, Dr. Kenoyer wrote: "We now believe that there was no outright invasion. The decline of the Indus cities was the result of complex factors. Overextended economic and political networks, the drying up of major rivers as well as the rise of new religious communities all contributed in some way to the creation of a new social order."
Calling what happened a collapse may be overstating the situation, archeologists said. True, Mohenjo-daro was suddenly abandoned, probably because the Indus River changed course, and when a parallel stream, the Saraswati or Ghaggar-Hakra river, dried up, the effect must have been devastating over a wide area. But Harappa continued to exist after 1900 B.C., though with a greatly diminished population. Other cities suffered sharp declines.
In the end, the civilization did not so much collapse as disintegrate or de-urbanize, for reasons that may not be fully known until the Indus script can be deciphered. Then the civilization faded into the background and became truly "lost" until the buried stones and bricks of it cities were uncovered.
It was one of the few "pure archeological discoveries," Dr. Possehl said. "Egypt, we knew from the Bible, and Ur, also. There was Chinese literature with references to ancestral cultures. But there had been no suggestion in any literature before of the Indus civilization."

Archeologist are taking a new look at the Indus civilization, which flourished on the Indian subcontinent 4,000 years ago. One city, Mohenjo-daro, probably looked like this. It had a brisk trade in cotton, shown in the cart, and other goods. The largest pots found are also depicted. A conduit, at right, was for damage. (Illustration by Michael Rothman)
 
A belt of carnelian stone that was found in Mohenjo-daro. It will be one of the artifacts in an exhibition at the Asia Society in New York City.
 
A necklace with greenstone, gold and agate stone. Carnelian and lapis were also popular, but terra cotta was used for less costly ornaments.
 
Potters stamped seals like this one, showing a bull motif, into unfired clay pots. The seals may have identified the potter.
 
While the Indus had elaborate jewelry, like this brooch of gold and steatite, or soapstone, they did not build palaces.

Remembering David Schramm, Gentle Giant of Cosmology

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
THE first thing you needed to know about David Schramm was that he wouldn't hurt you -- not unless you got in his way on a racquetball court or a wrestling mat or unless he had cajoled you onto some mountain with no way down. Not unless you took issue with his classic computations on how the elements were formed in the thermonuclear furnace of the Big Bang at the beginning of the universe, in which latter case he would form a posse from his mafia of astrophysical confederates and perform the intellectual equivalent of beating you to death with a baseball bat.
At 6 feet 4 inches and 230 pounds, his red-topped head cocked bemusedly in his soft chuckle, David Schramm, cosmologist, the Louis Block Distinguished Service Professor in the Physical Sciences and vice president for research of the University of Chicago, indefatigable champion of the Big Bang theory of the universe, one-time Olympic wrestling hopeful and sole proprietor of Big Bang Aviation, was impossible to ignore, especially when he indulged his characteristic habit of lifting his thick arms, as during the heat of argument, as if to squeeze your head. 
 Cosmologists certainly could not ignore him. "I always considered him to be the leader of our field, the one who organized the most conferences, chaired the most committees, acted as chief spokesperson to the world and kept us all in touch with one another," said the cosmologist Dr. Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
When Dr. Schramm, 52, plowed his twin-engine Cessna into a Colorado wheat field a week before Christmas and died, cosmologists and astronomers could not believe he was gone. It was as if a mountain had suddenly and inexplicably disappeared from the landscape.
Rock stars die in plane crashes. Astronomers are supposed to die in bed, sunken by the gravity of a lifetime of solemn thoughts and shy nighttime excursions into the depths of the cosmos, wreathed in a nebulosity of eminence. In the world of the universe, however, Dr. Schramm was a rock star, and at the end of January, his colleagues, students, friends, and old wrestling opponents gathered in Chicago to give him the academic equivalent of a star's send-off highlighted by a nonsectarian memorial service in the University of Chicago's Rockefeller Memorial Chapel.
"Death and tragedy strike those who lead passionate lives," Jeff Jewel, one of Dr. Schramm's graduate students, told a gathering of his students. Others described him as a gentle giant, a larger-than-life adventurer who played hard at both science and life, and whose energy and optimism inspired those around him to be better than they were.
Around Chicago they called him Schrambo for his physical audacity and feats, but his real daring had been mental, prodding his colleagues and the rest of the scientific world, especially particle physicists, to take seriously the implications of the Big Bang. His life, in fact, was a parable on the often underestimated and mistrusted role of personality and passion in science.
The history of astronomy and cosmology is littered with tales of great thinkers who lost their nerve when confronted with the wilder consequences of their abstract reasoning. Albert Einstein inserted an extra term, the so-called cosmological constant, into his solutions of general relativity in 1917 to make the universe stand still -- and thus missed the chance to predict that the universe was expanding.
George Gamow and his colleagues later envisioned the beginning of the universe as a thermonuclear fireball, but did not try to persuade radio astronomers to search for the leftover radiation; the famous cosmic background radiation was discovered by accident 20 years later.
Lack of nerve was never Dr. Schramm's problem.
"He went through life as if every door was open to him," said Dr. Gerald Wasserburg, who ran the Caltech "Lunatic Asylum," where the Moon rocks were analyzed and where as a graduate student Dr. Schramm began applying the lessons of a youth lived on the wrestling mat to science.
When Dr. Schramm picked a particularly risky and contentious topic for his doctoral thesis, Dr. Wasserburg tried to advise caution. Dr. Schramm responded with an explanation of "jugular science," Dr. Wasserburg recalled in Chicago.
Play to win, Dr. Schramm said, always play to win.
For Dr. Schramm, the Big Bang itself would be the ultimate wrestling mat. By the time he came of age, in the early 1970's, scientists were still having trouble taking the beginning of the universe seriously. Cosmologists haunted lonely dark telescope domes hoping to discern the fate of the universe in the flights of the galaxies. Particle physicists sought to discover the fundamental forces and constituents of nature by banging elementary particles together at greater and greater energies in bigger and bigger underground particle accelerators.
In the eyes of Dr. Schramm and a few other brave souls, the Big Bang was the natural meeting place for those disparate fields. "The Big Bang is the poor man's particle accelerator," Dr. Yakov Zeldovich, the Russian theorist, often said, and Dr. Schramm adopted the phrase as his mantra.
Dr. Schramm did not invent the calculations that married inner space and outer space, but he was willing to bet the fate of the universe on them. Combined with measurements of cosmic deuterium, a heavy form of hydrogen, they indicated that ordinary matter could supply the gravitational oomph to reverse the present universal expansion.
Those results were a cornerstone for a famous 1974 paper "An Unbound Universe?" Dr. Schramm and three other young astronomers, Dr. Beatrice Tinsley, Dr. James Gott and Dr. Jim Gunn, argued from a variety of lines of evidence that the universe would expand forever. That paper heralded a rude generational shift in cosmology. None of the authors were over 40.
They were relieved a year later when Dr. Allan Sandage of the Mount Wilson Observatory also concluded after 20 years of classical observations that the universe would expand forever.
In 1976 Dr. Schramm, Dr. Gunn and Dr. Gary Steigmans made the audacious suggestion that these calculations could be used to answer a fundamental question in particle physics: how many families of elementary particles are there? At the time, generations of elementary particles were proliferating seemingly without limit, as accelerators got bigger and bigger, but Dr. Schramm and his friends predicted that there could be no more than seven such generations in the end. At the time, the suggestion was viewed with skepticism by particle physicists.
"People still wanted to hear about it, but they thought it was amusing," he recalled. "Their tone was sort of 'Why don't you come and entertain us?' Heh, heh, heh."
Play to win. But observational techniques improved and by the late 1980's Dr. Schramm and his co-authors were beginning to look pretty good. Cosmological estimates of the number of particle families shrank toward four and and then three. Dr. Schramm began telling people that he and his two co-authors had been nominated for the Nobel Prize.
In the meantime, Dr. Schramm had built an empire on the Big Bang and the cosmology-particle physics connection at the University of Chicago. He and Dr. Leon Lederman convinced NASA to set up an astrophysics group at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, where it could act as a "border patrol" between inner and outer space. It was famously quick to strike back when the Big Bang calculations, which had emerged as one of the pillars of Big Bang cosmology, were attacked. "People are always trying to shoot us down," Dr. Schramm explained cheerily. "So far we're still afloat."
A skit last Christmas put on by the Chicago physics students showed how it worked. In a takeoff of the scene from "The Untouchables," in which Robert de Niro, playing Al Capone, fondles a baseball bat while giving a soliloquy on teamwork and then suddenly bashes in the head of a betrayer, a student playing Dr. Schramm took a foam bat and pretended to beat another astrophysicist who had challenged the Big Bang model. Play to win.
Under the umbrella of his gregarious personality, a new style of astrophysics grew in Chicago -- brash, irreverent and fun-loving. Food fights and ski trips were regular features of the scientific life. On a 1976 visit to the Aspen Center for Physics, a longtime summer outpost for Caltech physicists, Dr. Schramm saw the mountains for the first time and fell in love, bought a house and helped transform Aspen into the summer and winter camp of cosmologists.
Always on the lookout for new talent and ideas, Dr. Schramm expanded his influence far beyond Chicago. When Dr. Guth, a young particle physicist at M.I.T., came up with an elegant new theory called inflation, which resolved many longstanding paradoxes about the universe by presuming that it had undergone a kind of quantum burp very early in time, Dr. Schramm took him under his wing and promoted the theory -- and its maker -- as if it were his own. He became a statesman of science. He was appointed vice president for research of the University of Chicago and headed an important committee of the National Academy of Sciences on the future of physics. It was suddenly easy to imagine him as a future Presidential science adviser.
Dr. Schramm's life style, meanwhile, was becoming the stuff of legend. His apartment took up the entire wing on the 52d floor of a luxury lakeshore condominium and featured a flying-saucer-like view of the Second City. He drove around in a red Porsche with license plates that read "Big Bang," and worked out on the wrestling mat with members of the Chicago Bears football team until his knees would not take it anymore. Fulfilling an old dream of his father's, Dr. Schramm bought an airplane and incorporated it under the name of Big Bang Aviation. He often flew it to conferences.
He climbed mountains on every continent but Antarctica, including McKinley, where he sat through a whiteout for four days waiting to help lug a dead body from a crevasse, and tumbled down the steep headwall of Tuckerman's Ravine on Mount Washington. He turned down an invitation to join an Everest expedition, but liked to point out that the peak of Ecuador's Chimborazo, which he had attained, was farther from the center of the earth than the top of Everest, due to the earth's equatorial bulge. Coming down Switzerland's notorious Eiger, Dr. Schramm fell, almost dragging his partner and himself off a cliff. "You should have seen the look on your face when I came past," he said when they had stopped sliding.
Such exploits earned Dr. Schramm the nickname "Schrambo." Chicago writers fawned over his "cosmic giggle."
In 1989, physicists at the Stanford Linear Accelerator in California and the European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva held competing news conferences to announce that experiments had concluded that there were only three families of elementary particles. Dr. Schramm flew to the European center, known as CERN, for the announcement. But now there would be no Nobel, since it is not awarded posthumously.
On the evening of Dec. 19, Dr. Schramm was flying from Chicago to Aspen for the holidays and a series of annual winter physics conferences. He had climbed to 5,000 feet after a refueling stop in Denver when he radioed that his plane was stalling. Dr. Schramm turned around and headed for a field, no doubt expecting to walk away chuckling from yet another scrape. Play to win.
As word spread of the accident, many astronomers expressed disbelief that a man so often described as a force of nature could be gone.
"All I can say is that David was larger than life in many ways," said Dr. Stephen W. Hawking, the British physicist, who was a longtime friend.
At the official memorial in Chicago, Dr. Schramm's old crony, Dr. Lederman, imagined him in heaven in a "terrific argument with God about what happened before the Big Bang." God, he said, was wearing glasses for protection.
The day after the official memorial, a few dozen of Dr. Schramm's former and current students, gathered in a small seminar room for an informal remembrance of their own. Laughter broke out frequently.
"He had this ability to convince otherwise sane people to do these things," said Dr. Joshua Frieman, a former student who is now the leader of the Fermilab cosmology group. "He personified greatness, but it was not a selfish greatness. It radiated outward. In his presence you felt that could be better than you were."
If there was a sliver of light in the gloomy weeks that followed Dr. Schramm's death, it came during the American Astronomical Society meeting in January, where there was big news from God's particle accelerator about the fate of the universe, a favorite subject of Dr. Schramm. Two teams of astronomers using distant supernova explosions as beacons to chart the flow of the universe had concluded that the universal expansion had not slowed and never would; the universe would expand forever.
Moreover, their data suggested that the expansion of the universe was actually speeding up, apparently under the influence of some mysterious cosmic repulsion. Among themselves, astronomers were beginning to talk about having finally detected Einstein's old discredited cosmological constant.
On the last day of the meeting, Dr. Michael Turner, one of Dr. Schramm's oldest friends, flew in to arrange an impromptu memorial session for Dr. Schramm. Afterward, he stood in front of a chart that displayed the new data. "It would be a magical discovery," he said. "What it means is that there is some form of energy we don't understand. And the astronomers discovered it first."
He paused and nodded. "Dave would have liked that."
High on Mount Olympus, a smile broke through the clouds.

Black Success vs. Black Despair

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN 

 BODY:
As President Clinton's "national conversation" on race moves haltingly around the country, Henry Louis Gates Jr. comes forward with a call for a conversation about class.
In "The Two Nations of Black America," Mr. Gates, who is the DuBois Professor of the Humanities at Harvard University, draws a picture of growing black success along with deepening black despair. He argues in this thoughtful edition of "Frontline" that black professionals and entrepreneurs now have more in common with their white colleagues and peers than with the brothers and sisters they have left behind in the inner cities. 
 He begins a short but incisive history with his own upbringing in the working-class town of Piedmont, W.Va. An early beneficiary of affirmative action, Mr. Gates was admitted to Yale University in 1969 with 95 other selected men and women who amounted to an advance guard of America's black elite. There he found himself involved with the Black Panthers in shutting down the campus for a couple of weeks.
But he was put off by the Panthers' ideological mix of nationalism and Marxism and, perhaps more, by their tough style. As he says tonight: "The truth was, the Panthers scared us to death. They seemed like the thought police in blackface, as offensive as other bullies." He and most other students turned back to their studies. Instead of battling the school, they hit the books.
The legacy of those early achievers has been built on; there are many more black youths in America's best colleges, many more black men and women in prestigious positions and high-paid jobs. For them the promise of America has been real. But the gap within black America, Mr. Gates emphasizes, has widened, exemplified in Washington, with its black moneyed class on one side and poverty and crime on the other.
Older actors in the civil rights movement like Julian Bond, Angela Davis and Eldridge and Kathleen Cleaver give their historical perspectives, but the program's focus is on the current stark divide. Mr. Gates describes his feelings about ghetto gangs in language not often heard from black intellectuals: "I find it hard to concede that these young hoodlums are part of the same community I belong to." He says that "gangsta culture" makes him want to holler, "Since when does being black mean embracing the worst of what we can be?"
William Julius Wilson, the Harvard economist who heads the national conversation on race, sees little hope for change in what Mr. Gates calls dysfunctional behavior until opportunities open up to the underclass. The two agree with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the need for the kind of interracial coalition that inspired the March on Washington 30 years ago.
But Mr. Gates is not optimistic. "Today," he reports, "one-third of all black Americans working full time live beneath the poverty line. Hope for a future has practically disappeared from the inner city." And he concludes, "I'm worried that the two nations within the black community are permanent."

It's Good for You

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
It was interesting to be in Prague watching on CNN as the U.S. Congress gave President Clinton a standing ovation for his call to expand NATO to Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. It was interesting because Mr. Clinton couldn't get a similar standing ovation for that proposal from the Czech Parliament.
Yes, after months of the Czech Government bombarding the public here with propaganda about why they have to join NATO, polls still show that only 54 percent of Czechs favor the idea. So just remember this equation: two-thirds of the U.S. Senate is going to be asked to ratify a NATO expansion that will ultimately cost U.S. taxpayers billions of dollars, but only half the Czech people being expanded to support the idea. . . . Hello? 
 Czech advocates of NATO have had to resort to evoking the "Red scare." You can't find a picture of former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev anywhere in Russia today. But his face was recently plastered up in Prague, above the sarcastic words, "Thank you for freely deciding not to join NATO." The campaign was meant to shock Czechs into joining the alliance.
Indeed, to the extent that there is support here for NATO membership, it is for all the reasons the Clinton team says NATO expansion is not about. The Clintonites insist it is not an anti-Russian move, but Czechs say if it is not anti-Russian what use could NATO expansion be? "It is highly confusing to Czech people," said the Czech polling analyst Jan Hartl from the Stem agency. "They say, 'We want NATO against Russia, and if it's not against Russia, who needs it?' "
Those Czechs who remain indifferent to NATO membership fall into several camps. Many simply see no threat, so no reason. Some older Czechs are more afraid of Germany than Russia. Many younger people are deeply skeptical of spending money on the Czech military, which did not defend the country from the Nazis in 1938, from the Communists in 1948 or from the Soviets in 1968.
To break down this skepticism, Jiri Bis, head of the Impact ad agency in Prague, has been running a privately financed, pro-NATO campaign, often using sports heros and movie stars to sell NATO expansion as though it were deodorant. It's the Czech equivalent of "Hi, I'm Michael Jordan and I'm here to talk to you about NATO. . . . Hi, I'm Cindy Crawford and I'm here to talk to you about the Eastern Front." He's also tried to make NATO fun. On Christmas Eve they gave out 100 fresh carp to the first 100 people who showed up in Prague's main square wearing pro-NATO ribbons. They also gave away Polish dumplings, Hungarian goulash and Czech beer to honor the three would-be NATO members. There has also been an effort to underscore that joining NATO "is a way for Czechs to rejoin Europe, which we were separated from by the cold war," said Mr. Bis.
But even those Czechs who see NATO membership as a bridge to Western Europe would really prefer to join the European Union first, but the E.U. has been dragging its feet because it does not want Eastern European workers or farm products. When asked in a Stem poll what was more important, E.U. membership or NATO, 44 percent of Czechs said they preferred E.U. membership and 13 percent said NATO.
So far cost of membership has not been an issue, because no one really knows how much is involved. But it will be high. This is a country that traded its only advanced fighter jets, 10 MIG-29's, to Poland for helicopters because it could not afford to maintain the planes. Says Miroslav Vacek, a former Czech Defense Minister and leader of the Communist Party here, "For the NATO alliance the Czech Army cannot mean anything in its present condition, and I doubt we will have the economic growth in the coming years to pay for the upgrades."
And if NATO expansion has to be paid for with reduced health care, social care and education, he added, it is going to lose a lot of support. When the Czech Parliament's Foreign Relations Committee began debating ratification of NATO membership the other day, only 6 out of the 18 members of the committee showed up.
So get this: The Clinton team is begging Czechs to take something -- NATO expansion -- that is for their own protection, and yet barely half feel they want it, need it or are ready to pay much for it. But never mind, the Clintonites intend to plow ahead with expansion anyway. Who says American foreign policy can't be funny?

HEADLINE: Study Questions The Usual View Of Downsizing

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Month after month, the Labor Department reports the creation of hundreds of thousands of new jobs. The latest report showed that 358,000 were added in January, even as the economy showed signs of weakening.
Where are all these jobs? While low-wage work is one source, a new study finds that well-paid middle managers and other upper-level office workers are being hired in big numbers. 
 The study, to be made public today, challenges two widely held views about the work force. One is that corporate downsizing has decimated middle-level management. Downsizing has indeed been widespread, but hiring has outpaced the layoffs, the study found. The other challenge is to the concept that corporate America is starved for people highly skilled in technology. The real draw for the college graduate is an upper-level office job, not a job that requires education in science and technology. That specialty work does not pay as well.
Thirty-seven percent of all the jobs created since 1989 have been for "business professionals and managers," the study said. That was up from 20 percent of the new jobs in the 1970's. These are the middle-level executives, the bankers, accountants, brokers, sales account representatives, insurance agents, advertising and public relations specialists, financial officers, analysts, buyers, personnel managers and data processors who occupy America's ubiquitous office towers. Their annual pay averaged a healthy $46,000 in the mid-1990's.
"The decision structure in a global economy demands these people," said Steven Rose, senior economist at the Educational Testing Service, and a co-author of the study. "It takes less and less to produce a product or service, but more and more to promote it, manage the process, customize it, make it consumer friendly, deal with style and convenience. No firm feels it can cut back without losing market share."
The Educational Testing Service prepares and administers the SAT and other college entrance exams, and draws its revenue from the fees paid by students who take these tests. The new study's message, not surprisingly, is that college graduates populate the new professional and managerial class and, thus, get the highest-paying jobs, without high-technology knowledge. Indeed, these jobs place a premium on tasks that a generation ago often did not require a college education, Mr. Rose and his co-author acknowledge.
"Our study raises basic questions about what these people need to know to do their jobs," said Anthony P. Carnevale, the co-author and a vice president at Educational Testing Service. "A case can be made for a liberal arts education, with its emphasis on analysis and problem solving, although companies seem to prefer people who have taken business courses. The curriculum issue is naturally of great concern to us, and we don't have answers."
This study, as do most that try to explain labor force dynamics, relies on Labor Department data. What sets it apart is the decision to rearrange workers into the authors' own set of occupations and functions. The goal was to more accurately reflect reality, but some labor economists said the study's classifications were arbitrary and subjective.
"The tremendously positive spin on this office-economy stuff is unwarranted and inappropriate," said Lawrence Mishel, chief economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Front-office managers at a steel mill, or a computer manufacturer, or a restaurant chain, for example, are included in the new category of business professionals and managers. But supervisors on the factory floor -- probably earning less -- are excluded, as are managers of McDonald's restaurants. Such distinctions are not made by the Labor Department, although in Mr. Rose's view they reflect valid divisions.
Similarly, the study distinguishes between a sales representative who handles a corporate account and a sales clerk in a store. The former is in the manager category, while the latter is not. An executive secretary and an office administrator are also included, but not a file clerk or a mail room manager. Accountants, insurance agents and brokers qualify as office professionals, but not most engineers, scientists, architects, computer system analysts and technicians. Unless they have shifted to the office environment, they are classified as production people.
From all the tabulation, these findings emerge:
*Of the 69 million new jobs created from 1959 through 1995, the last year in the study, 34 million, or 49 percent, fell into the new business professional and manager class. The category reached a high for a single decade of 39 percent in the 1980's, as the global economy took shape, and edged down slightly, to 37 percent, in the 1990's.
*Average wages, which had risen through the 1980's for managers and professionals, fell slightly in the 1990's, Mr. Rose said. Wages were a casualty of the downsizing in management ranks. "Corporations tried to cut costs, but they also needed these people, and they ended up hiring more managers and professionals than they fired," he said.
*Among prime-age workers, 30 to 59 years old, the new office sector accounted for 41 percent of all employment, up from 30 percent in 1959. In addition, business professionals and managers pocketed half of the earnings of all workers, excluding those earning more than $200,000 a year. Their average pay in 1995 was "47 percent more than the average earnings of workers in all the other sectors," the study said.
For Mr. Rose, a prominent labor economist, the study is an important explanation of the sources of wage inequality. It challenges the view that workers can close the wage gap through training in technology, math and science.
But even before its formal release, the study drew criticism from labor economists familiar with its contents. Some, like Frank Levy of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, note that other studies have already spotted "the accelerated growth of managers, administrators and sales occupations." Census Bureau data do show that the ratio of managers to production workers has risen over the last three decades.
Alan Krueger of Princeton contends that the study fails to take into account the increasing level of skill needed to make efficient use of office computers. And Peter Gottschalk of Boston University said the classification procedure used by Mr. Rose and Mr. Carnevale was too arbitrary and subjective.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Most Gauges Fall on the 2d-Slowest Trading Day of 1998

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mostly lower yesterday in the second-slowest trading day so far this year, reflecting a dearth of economic data and corporate earnings reports that made investors reluctant to buy without a clearer sense of the market's next move.
Investors were also wary of driving stock prices much higher, analysts said, after the strong gains and heavy trading volume of the previous week, when the Standard & Poor's 500 index hit four new closing highs. 
 Last week's gains reflected a growing belief that corporate earnings would not be hurt much by the economic problems in Asia as well as expectations that the Federal Reserve would not raise short-term interest rates anytime soon.
"It was such a big week last week and people are trying to figure out which way this thing is going to go," said Alan Bond, chief investment officer of Bond Procope Capital Management in New York.
After gaining more than 282 points, or 3.6 percent last week, the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,180.52, down 8.97 points, coming back after an intraday decline of more than 47 points. American Express, Chevron and Hewlett-Packard led the blue-chip index lower.
Even with the slight loss yesterday, the Dow average is only 78.79 points below its all-time high of 8,259.31.
The S.& P. 500 index dipped 1.72 points, or less than two-tenths of a percent, to 1,010.74. The S.& P. rose 3.3 percent last week.
The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index fell 3.92 points, to 1,690.43, as well-known technology shares, including Intel, Cisco, Microsoft and Sun Microsystems, declined. Based on the strength of other technology companies like Oracle, the Nasdaq composite had climbed 4.6 percent last week.
Bucking the trend, the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks rose 1.78 points, to 447.28, after rising 3.6 percent last week.
As evidence of yesterday's limited trading activity, volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 542.5 million shares, falling off last week's pace, which was marked by four days in which more than 690 million shares changed hands. It was also the lowest daily trading volume since 367 million shares were traded on Jan. 2.
"This is part of the normal digestion when you have a big up week," said Andrew Brooks, vice president in charge of equity trading at T. Rowe Price Associates. "Last week caught a lot of people by surprise," Mr. Brooks said, pointing to the strong upward moves in the major market indexes.
And after last week's strong gains, investors were wary of quickly pushing the Dow to a new high, said Ken Ducey, director of trading at BT Brokerage in New York.
Without any major barometers to signal market direction, investors were left to ponder the uncertainties in the market, which include the outlook for corporate earnings in the first quarter, the implications of the reported White House scandal and the rising possibility of a military confrontation with Iraq.
"People are waiting for these things to fall into place," Mr. Ducey said, adding that "nobody's rushing in to buy stocks and nobody's rushing in to sell."
Skittish investors, who decided not to buy stocks earlier this year, have missed a strong move in the market, said Arthur Hogan, a senior trader at Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter.
As a result, they might decide to wait until the market sells off a bit, hoping to pick up stocks at lower prices. Or, if the market continues to move higher, investors might be pulled in by fear that they may continue to miss future gains, he said.
One sign of investor uncertainty about the stock market could be the record amount of cash that has been flowing into money market mutual funds, Mr. Hogan said. Approximately $11.4 billion flowed into money market funds during the week ended Feb. 4, said Robert Adler, president of AMG Data Services in Arcata, Calif.
Since the beginning of the year, money market funds' assets have increased by about 4 percent, to $1.99 trillion, the highest amount ever, Mr. Adler said.
"There are a lot of investors on the sidelines with a wait-and-see attitude," Mr. Hogan said of the cash buildup in money market funds.

HEADLINE: Newark Shows Increased Revenue

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Mayor Sharpe James said today that increased revenue from operations by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey here, as well as improved property tax collections, would net the city about $25 million more than expected this year and would allow the hiring of 300 police officers and a 5 percent cut in the local tax rate.
 The Mayor's election year announcement came today as he released his $517 million budget proposal, down from $546 million last year. Mr. James said the revenue windfall also allowed him to propose a cut in municipal water rates. 
 The bulk of the new revenue -- $18 million -- came from the Port Authority operations. With an improved national and state economy, there was growth at Newark International Airport that translated into more flights and more landing fees, increasing the agency's annual payment to the city under a net lease agreement.
The improved economy also increased property tax payments to 86 percent of the rolls, from 82 percent. All of these factors combined with what Mr. James termed the city's "fiscally conservative policies" to produce "one of the best budgets we have crafted in years."
The budget must now be debated and voted on by the nine-member City Council. which includes the Mayor's two opponents in this May's election.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Drop as Traders Await 3 Days of Auctions

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Bond prices ended lower yesterday, weakened by selling ahead of the Treasury's quarterly refunding auction of $35 billion in new debt this week.
The 30-year bond fell 12/32, to a price of 102 18/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.94 percent from 5.92 percent on Friday. 
 With no economic news to influence the market, traders focused on the impending auctions.
Prices often weaken around the time of an auction as securities firms seek to cause yields to rise by selling bonds in an effort to attract investor interest. That can help insure quick distribution of the new debt they buy from the Treasury and resell to investors. The firms try to avoid amassing big supplies of new Treasury debt, leaving them exposed to a potential decline in the market.
Some of the weakness in the market yesterday may have reflected fear that prices would decline after the refunding is completed. Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, said Treasury bonds had fallen after every February refunding auction this decade, except for 1993 and 1995.
The Treasury will auction $13 billion of new three-year notes today, followed by $12 billion of 10-year notes tomorrow and $10 billion of 30-year bonds on Thursday. In when-issued trading late in the day, the three-year note to be sold today was offered at a price to yield 5.43 percent, up 3 basis points from Friday, while the 10-year was offered at a price to yield 5.61 percent, up 4 basis points, and the 30-year bond at 5.95 percent, up 2 basis points. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Yesterday the Government held its regular weekly sale of three- and six-month bills and had good investor demand. Analysts said the number of bids compared with the total amount of the auction, known as the bid-to-cover ratio, improved over other recent sales, with the three-month issue getting a solid 5.96-to-1 ratio and the six-month maturity, 5.07 to 1.
Besides the auctions this week, market participants will be looking for further signs of an economic slowing when the Government releases its January retail sales report on Thursday. The last retail sales report showed a gain of seven-tenths of a percent over all and two-tenths of a percent without autos. For this report the consensus is for a gain of three-tenths of a percent over all and five-tenths, excluding autos.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-month and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.712	97.434	Discounted Rate	5.09%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.23%	5.28%	High Price	98.718	97.452	Discounted Rate	5.07%	5.04%	Coupon Yield	5.20%	5.24%	Low Price	98.711	97.434	Discounted Rate	5.10%	5.07%	Coupon Yield	5.23%	5.28%	Accepted at low price	32%	45%	Total applied for	$47,369,260	$40,387,216	Accepted	$11,115,106	$10,822,957	Noncompetitive	$1,377,695	$1,261,808	

Both issues are dated Feb. 12, 1998. The three-month bills mature on May 14, 1998, and the six-month bills mature on Aug. 13, 1998.

HEADLINE: U.S. Jewish Group Sets Up Office In Berlin as Sentinel Against Bias

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 9

 BODY:
Reflecting a gradual resurgence of Jewish life in Germany, the American Jewish Committee opened a permanent office in Berlin today at a site once owned by a Jewish family that fled the Nazis.
The inauguration drew high-level German officials together with United States and Israeli diplomats to ceremonies including the nailing of a mezuza to the door of offices in the building that stands in Berlin's Mitte District, close to both the ruined center of Hitler's Reich and the construction sites that have come to symbolize the emerging new capital of a reunified Germany. 
 The building is also close to the proposed site for a German national memorial to the Holocaust -- a project still surrounded by debate.
David A. Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, said, "We never expected the kind of fascination that has surrounded the opening of this office."
The remark, made in an interview, reflected the complex emotions felt by Germans seeking what Mr. Harris called Jewish "validation" of their efforts to come to terms with the Nazi past. But, he said, the point of the office was not -- as he put it -- to tell Germans that they had been "koshered" by the presence of an American Jewish organization. Rather, he said, the committee, which was founded in 1906 to fight anti-Semitism, saw itself as "another ally, supporter and watchdog" against any future "German fear that the demons will again come out of the closet, that with the fading of memory such a thing could occur."
Of particular concern to the organization is a surge of neo-Nazism in the economically depressed former East Germany, Mr. Harris said. Other officials of the group said a principal task was to promote a greater understanding of modern Germany among American Jews.
"American Jews' perceptions of Germany remain split and not very positive," Eugene DeBow, the director of the new office, said recently. The office, in the former East Berlin, is on a site once owned by the Mosse family, a prominent Jewish family in prewar Berlin. The family won back title to the land after reunification.
The site was sold to a German developer, and the architect who drew up the plans for a new building was Hans Strauch of Boston, Mass., the nephew of George Mosse, a historian who fled Berlin in 1939. The developer agreed to give the American Jewish Committee rent-free space for 10 years, Mr. Harris said.
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain in Europe, Germany's Jewish population has more than doubled, from 29,000 a decade ago to an estimated 70,000. The increase is ascribed to the arrival of tens of thousands of Jews from the former Soviet Union who, under German law, have automatic residence rights in Germany.
"There is a chance that this Jewish life can once again become an integral part of German culture and society," President Roman Herzog said at an official ceremony marking the inauguration.
The inauguration was accompanied by another undercurrent. The American Jewish Committee reportedly angered Chancellor Helmut Kohl last May by publicizing Bonn's refusal to pay compensation to Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe. The dispute was finally resolved last month when Germany agreed to set up a $110 million fund for some 18,000 Eastern European Jewish survivors.
Mr. Kohl was invited to the ceremonies but declined, citing scheduling problems, and did not send a representative, American Jewish officials said. The absence of a representative was initially seen as a slight, the officials said. But it emerged later that Mr. Kohl had sent a message to the committee president welcoming the group to Berlin, German officials said.

HEADLINE: Craze for Beanie Babies Helped Surge in '97 Toy Sales

BYLINE: By DANA CANEDY 

 BODY:
Those pint-sized bean bag characters, stuffed animals that gyrate and giggle and key chains that youngsters nurture like pets helped push toy sales up nearly 8 percent last year, double what the industry and analysts were expecting.
"We had a very good year in the toy industry with Sing and Snore Ernie, Star Wars, Barbie, Beanie Babies and Tamagotchis and other virtual pets driving market sales up to the double-digit numbers at various times throughout the year," Gary Baughman, chairman of the Toy Manufacturers of America, said yesterday during an industry address to open the 95th annual American International Toy Fair in New York. 
 Retail sales increased 7.8 percent last year, to $22.5 billion, while manufacturers' unit sales rose 5.6 percent. Including video games, total industry shipments grew 6.9 percent, in units, or 14.3 percent, in dollars. The healthy economy, licensing arrangements tied to hit movies like the re-release of the "Star Wars" trilogy and strong consumer confidence contributed to the growth.
As the Toy Fair was getting under way, Hasbro Inc., the industry giant, announced an acquisition that is intended to capitalize on the growth of electronic toys. Hasbro said it was acquiring Tiger Electronics Inc., the privately held maker of the popular virtual toys known as Giga Pets, for $335 million. Tiger said the sale would accelerate the international growth of its toys.
As for the overall toy business, "it was a surprisingly robust year," said Frank Reysen Jr., editor of Playthings, a trade publication. "I don't think anybody would have foreseen an 8 percent growth."
A number of factors contributed to the increase. For one, toy companies have been aggressively marketing products throughout the year to be less dependent on consumers' often finicky shopping moods during the all-important fourth quarter. While Christmas sales still account for half of the industry's annual revenues, that is a decrease from as much as 70 percent in previous years. Products based on popular summer movies have helped, as has the Beanie Baby craze, which had youngsters scrambling year round to collect the latest of the little stuffed characters as they hit the market.
A wider range of popular playthings last year than in previous years also helped the industry, making manufacturers and retailers less reliant on a few hot items that they could not keep in stock. And manufacturers are clearly looking to once again capitalize on the success of many of those items this year.
Visitors would be hard pressed to walk through a showroom at the fair this week and not find some doll or creature giggling or snoring. The hope, of course, is to come up with the next Tickle Me Elmo, as Mattel's Tyco Preschool division did when it duplicated that toy's success in 1996 with Sing & Snore Ernie last year.
Tyco Preschool is showing off several new Ernie pals this year, including the Sesame Street Walk & Talk Assortment. The $29.99 characters, including Elmo, Big Bird and Cookie Monster, walk and talk when their sneakers are pressed.
There are also plenty of new virtual pets this year, intended to relegate last year's models to the back of the toy chest. They include new ones from Tiger called Giga Pets Plus, which enable owners to take care of up to eight characters, and Giga Farm, which enables youngsters to raise an assortment of farm animals and also requires them to virtually raise crops for the animals to eat.
The popularity of virtual pets is responsible for one huge theme at this year's Toy Fair. Everyone, it seems, is making dolls that require the same nurturing that is necessary to care for the electronic pets. One is Takin Care of Baby, created by Toyriffic L.L.C., which may well be the next best thing to having a baby brother or sister.
Once its internal clock is set, the doll cries spontaneously up to 20 times a day. It also "wakes up" every morning at 7:30 demanding to be fed, played with or given medicine, and responds by saying "I love you, Mommy."
"I called my sister who has a 3-year-old and said, 'I don't know how you do it,' " said Neil C. Wasserman, who used $20,000 of his savings to create the doll. "I wanted to throw the thing out the window."
Computer-programmed playmates are a big trend this year, as well, playing off of a hit from last year, Actimates Barney from Microsoft. Mattel is coming out with My Interactive Pooh, a computerized stuffed bear. Using CD-ROM, parents can program the toy to repeat a child's name, hair color, age or birthday as well as to sing and tell stories. The bear can then be disconnected from the computer and will interact with the child for up to 20 minutes. Pooh's companionship will not come cheap, though. The bear sells at retail for $100.
Not surprisingly, most companies at the fair are offering beanie-something. Tyco has Sesame Street Beans and Hasbro has Star War Buddies bean bag toys. In all, Hasbro is introducing more than 100 new "Star Wars" toys, including collectible figurines and toy vehicles.
As usual, Barbie provided a few surprises, including a new career. She has joined the W.N.B.A. and now wears official league gear. W.N.B.A. Barbie, which sells for $20, comes with a basketball rim and net and a ball that magnetically attaches to her, enabling her to shoot.
With so many potential big sellers again this year, the toy manufacturers' association is cautiously optimistic about the prospects for another successful year. It conservatively forecast a 4 percent sales gain for this year but also acknowledged that toy companies still faced some challenges.
Fluctuations in the Asian economies could affect the industry, for instance. While weaknesses in the Asian currencies could push production costs lower this year, retail sales could suffer as well.
In the United States, meanwhile, toy makers are finding it more difficult to market effectively to children. The growth of cable television, -- with such networks as Nickelodeon, WB Network and UPN -- is making it harder to find mass audiences of youths to advertise to.
Over all, though, the industry should have another strong year, according to Mr. Baughman, the toy group chairman, who is also chief executive of Fisher-Price Inc. "We're coming off a healthy year in the toy industry that should create momentum for 1998," he said.

HEADLINE: Black-White Economic Gap Is Narrowing, White House Says

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
After two decades without progress in narrowing the economic gap between black and white Americans, the nation shows tentative signs that economic inequality between the races has been reduced in the last few years, the Clinton Administration said today.
Much of the improvement was linked by Administration economists to the economic expansion that began seven years ago and continues to rumble on. Unlike the boom of the mid-1980's, when much of the gain went to people at the top of the income scale, the current upturn has not added to overall economic inequality, they said. 
 Choosing selectively among a broad range of statistics, the Administration said the signs of renewed progress in narrowing the gap between the races included a rise in the median income of black families since 1993 that was larger than the increase for non-Hispanic white families, record high income for black families in 1996 and a drop in the poverty rate for black families to a record low.
"Such developments raise hope for renewed and sustained progress toward economic equality," said Janet L. Yellen, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers.
Administration officials said they did not want to overstate the progress or minimize the economic gulf that continues to divide the races. Their findings were contained in the annual Economic Report of the President, which the White House submitted to Congress today.
The report said that income gaps between black and white families remain as large as they were three decades ago and that the median wealth of white families may be as much as 10 times that of black and Hispanic families. And while there has been some narrowing of differences in educational attainment, which speaks for longer term gains, there were growing gaps in social indicators of economic success like the proportion of families headed by single women -- 14 percent among white families last year compared to 47 percent among black families.
"Substantial disparities in economic status across racial and ethnic groups persist," Ms. Yellen said.
Private economists said the Administration's conclusions were generally in line with their own. But they said it was important to distinguish between the benefits to non-white families from the current low unemployment rate and robust economic growth, which could prove transitory when the economy next turns down, and the much slower progress in addressing the underlying social and historical causes of inequality.
"If all we're seeing is labor market improvement, that could go away the next time the Midwest goes into recession and all the good jobs go away again," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, the research organization.
The Administration's report also said the nation has made some progress in reducing poverty among children in recent years. The combination of the strong economy and Government programs like the earned-income tax credit, the report said, helped push the poverty rate among children down to 20.5 percent in 1996 from 22.7 percent in 1993, following a relatively steady rise that started in 1969.
"Despite these improvements, far too many children remain economically vulnerable," Ms. Yellen said.
The report said the nation's overall economic condition was the best it had been in a generation, with few problems on the horizon and little risk that even the financial turmoil in Asia will derail the expansion.
In its discussion of racial inequality, the Administration said that income differences between white and non-white Americans narrowed substantially in the decade after the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but then expanded again or held steady for much of the next 20 years.
In the last few years, though, black families have closed some of the gap with their white counterparts in terms of inflation-adjusted income. Median family incomes for blacks increased 13.4 percent between 1993 and 1996, to $26,500, while median family income among non-Hispanic whites increased 5 percent, to $47,100, the report said. Median incomes for Hispanic families have been declining over the past several decades due to an influx of immigrants with little education, but have turned up slightly in the last few years and stood at $26,200 in 1996.
Family incomes tend to be driven in part by the strength of the economy. Administration officials said the narrowing of the income gap, and the general reduction in inequality during the current expansion, might also have been helped by an increase in the minimum wage and by the growing numbers of racial minorities who are completing high school. The gap between high-school completion rates for white students and black students, for example, has narrowed to seven percentage points in 1996 from 20 points in 1967.
Broader measures of economic well-being, like household wealth, represent longer-term trends. By one of two surveys used by the Government to measure household wealth, the median net worth of white households in 1993 was $47,740, more than 10 times greater than that of black or Hispanic households. A similar survey in 1995 found median net worth was $73,900 for non-Hispanic white households and $16,500 for all other households. As of the 1993 survey, 95 percent of black households reported owning no stocks, compared to 75 percent of white households.

America Online Shares Rise On Higher Internet Fees
America Online shares rose more than 12 percent to an all-time high after the company broke from its standard $19.95 price of unlimited Internet access, raising the fee to $21.95 for its 11 million members -- half of the home Internet market in the United States. The shares surged $11.9375, to $110.4375.
The on-line service provider also promoted to a new No. 2 position, Robert W. Pittman, the former MTV founder recruited to help the company last year. In a further move welcomed by investors, America Online cut half the jobs left at Compuserve, the rival it bought last week. D2. 

G.M. to Buy 10 Percent of Shares
General Motors announced an unexpectedly large buyback of its stock, extending efforts made by the company over the last year to raise the price. The $4 billion repurchase amounts to about 10 percent of G.M.'s outstanding shares. G.M. shares rose nearly 4 percent, to $62.9375. D2.
 
Dow Jones Posts Big Loss
Dow Jones, the publisher of The Wall Street Journal, reported a loss of $889.3 million, mostly because of a write-off connected to the reorganization of its financial data business, Dow Jones Markets. The company is also said to have received an offer of $500 million for Dow Jones Markets from Bridge News. Other offers are said to be lower. D6.
 
CVS to Buy Michigan Chain
CVS agreed to buy Arbor Drugs, a big Michigan drugstore chain, for $1.48 billion in stock. The acquisition would make CVS the biggest drugstore chain in the country. D2.
 
Time Warner Sells Six Flags
Premier Parks will buy the Six Flags theme-park chain from Time Warner and its partner, Boston Ventures, for $965 million. Premier will leapfrog from No. 5 to No. 2 in the theme-park business, behind Walt Disney. D6.
 
Stocks Finish Mostly Lower
Stocks ended mostly lower yesterday in the second-slowest trading day of the year. The Dow Jones industrial average, which gained 282 points last week, closed down 8.97 points, to 8,180.52. D8.
 
South Korea's Next Problem
While South Korean banks' renegotiation of short-term debts to foreign banks eased some concerns, a messier problem may be unpaid loans local companies owe Korean banks. Dozens of debtors are collapsing. A1.
 
Big Merger in Water Business
United States Filter will buy Culligan Water Technologies for $1.5 billion in stock, combining a leading industrial-water systems provider with one of the best known names in residential water. D2.
 
Insurers Seek Truck Changes
An insurers group urged auto makers to redesign sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks, after concluding the vehicles increased the risk of death for other drivers while providing little if any additional protection for their own occupants. A1.
 
Economists Seek Euro Delay
Criticizing what they called ill preparations for the euro, 155 prominent German economists pleaded for a delay in Europe's single currency, scheduled to make its debut in less than a year. It was the broadest and most credible objection yet to the monetary union plans, but is not expected to result in a postponement. D4.

Every Sled Dog Has Its Day

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON 

DATELINE: NAGANO, Japan

 BODY:
IF you can dream up something semi-athletically peculiar to do on ice, snow or on the side of a glacier, Juan Antonio Samaranch has an Olympic medal in his bag for you.
Like Bill Clinton with the economy, Samaranch, the president of the International Olympic Committee, says that one of his remaining missions before his term expires in 2001 is to continue to grow the Winter Games. More sports. More athletes. More sponsors. More mind-altering traffic jams on slippery mountain roads. 
 More women.
"The Olympic movement is determined to make its contribution so that the 21st century marks the beginning of a new era for women in world sport," Samaranch declared late last week. "Any new sport wishing to be included in the Olympic program must comprise the women's events."
There is no place, he insisted, for old-school sexism within the Olympic Movement. But if you can find a way to keep the layers of clothing and body fat off the little pixies, the figure skaters and gymnasts have demonstrated that their movement will be enhanced, as will the Movement's television ratings and its bloated revenue stream.
Bikini bobsled, guaranteed, would rate right up there with the Super Bowl. And as many journalists here have been complaining about the dearth of transcendent news at these Olympics compared with Lillehammer's four years ago, someone may want to introduce Tonya Harding to Latrell Sprewell before Salt Lake City in 2002.
What a pairs team for a sport whose every event goes to arbitration.
Curling and snowboarding are the newest medal sports at the Nagano Games. The inclusion of the former supports my point that no activity that defies comprehension is beyond consideration, while the latter emphasizes how the Olympics, the true global sports league, is determined to incorporate Generation X before ESPN and its Extreme (or X) Games becomes the unofficial Olympics R Us.
Look, then, for future Olympic takeouts from the following Winter X menu: ice climbing, snow mountain bike racing, skier X, snowmobile snocross and a yet-to-be titled competition in which young men and women with too much hair spray sit stiffly on a snowbank and make wisecracks while delivering the scores.
Just kidding on that last one, though it is interesting to note that Samaranch did not totally dismiss the question of dog sled races, which has everyone in Greenland pumped and Alaska talking secession from the United States. (Note to my wife: Call the trainer. I am reserving a space in the 2002 athletes' kennel for the puppy right away.)
"It's not easy to find new sports for the Winter Olympics, but we have room," Samaranch concluded in his news conference last week.
Dear Mr. Movement and Shaker: All it takes is a little imagination. You, for instance, summarily rejected an earnest Japanese reporter's suggestion that sumo wrestling be added to the hopelessly overcrowded Summer Games. "My answer is no," Samaranch said. "It is a sport practiced in very few countries."
Here, then, some thoughts on how to grow the Winter Games:
Sumo speed skating. Now that women are being treated as team-sports equals in hockey, basketball, soccer, etc., isn't it time for the Olympics to stop discriminating against the unhealthy? This competition would require gorging, not training, along with a small ponytail. The United States, homeland of junk food, could be an immediate medal power.
Monkey moguls. The obsession with those friendly little critters at the hot springs here has got me thinking. Put the monkeys on skis and let 'em rip. With the dogs, the monkeys, perhaps a wide selection of marine life captured in the popular and Olympic-deserving sport of ice fishing, I'm thinking about a family-friendly zoo and aquarium that would be built in host Olympic cities with precious tax dollars.
Cell phone cross-country. Forget the Olympic rings; the most prominent rings in Nagano are coming from the tiny telephones in everyone's pockets. Beepers are out of control. Everybody's E-mailing the world here at the On Line Olympics. Photographers with laptops are sending pictures from the tops of mountains. Meanwhile, those poor cross-country saps are out in the woods for hours with no one to talk to. Give them a cell phone and Geraldo's number.
American football: Paul Tagliabue, you owe me for this. But why not one more Dream Team? "The rule is that all winter sports must be on snow and ice," Samaranch argued. To which I say: has this man ever heard of the Ice Bowl?

HEADLINE: Film's Rising Star: New York;
Independent Movies Spur the City's Celluloid Success

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Larry Meistrich is not central casting's idea of a movie mogul. He wears torn jeans to the office. His two huge dogs -- both half chow-chow, half Samoyed, found abandoned on a film set -- wander around his lower Manhattan office, lapping water from a giant silver bowl and nuzzling up to visitors.
But Mr. Meistrich, who is all of 31, produced the 1996 hit film "Sling Blade," and that has given his independent film company, the Shooting Gallery, a name and a reputation, not to mention a fortune. Last month, Mr. Meistrich decided to flex some of that newfound muscle. With little fanfare, he announced that he would build the biggest movie sound stage in the world in an old industrial park in Harrison, N.J., just outside Newark. 
 "We want the same toys Los Angeles has," Mr. Meistrich said.
Being an independent filmmaker in New York, unless you were Woody Allen or Martin Scorsese or Spike Lee, used to mean three things: obscurity, poverty and an attitude that turned the first two traits into badges of artistic integrity. No more. An explosion of movies and television shows being filmed in the region in the last few years, and the heightened visibility of an edgy, urban movie-making style long associated with the New York film world, has changed the scene. New York is hot. New York filmmakers are hot.
"New York has become a nurturing, sexy, cutting-edge environment for independent filmmakers," said Terry Casaletta, the associate eastern executive director of the Director's Guild of America. "It's apparent by the level of increased production in New York that the rest of the film industry has come to the same conclusion."
The forces behind the city's rediscovery are intertwined, like subplots in a film noir. The number of locally produced films has grown, and Hollywood producers and directors have, at the same time, decided to make more movies here. But Hollywood has also embraced some of the ideas and rhythms that film scholars say have long characterized New York independent film, and that in turn has led to even greater expansion, as Hollywood tries to capture or tame whatever it is that New York has got.
The results are stark: New York City, New York State and New Jersey all set records in 1997 for the volume of productions and the amount of money the film industry spent locally. Spending on movie, television and other such productions rose to $2.37 billion in the city last year from $2.23 billion in 1996, according to figures released last week by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, making the film industry the fastest job growth sector in the city's economy.
And while not even Mr. Meistrich is predicting a return of New York as the industry's capital, as it was early in the century when Thomas A. Edison and his imitators were cranking out slice-of-life films like "Central Park" and "At the Foot of the Flatiron," the new growth is raising questions. Is New York doomed -- as it seems to be on days like today when all eyes are on Los Angeles and the Academy Award nominations -- to live at the whim of Hollywood's casting call? Is there a middle way between aloof independence and mainstream market success?
"The pioneers of the independent film business were working outside the Hollywood system," said Daniel Victor, the president of Boneyard Entertainment, a Manhattan company born two years ago to finance and produce independent movies. "The Shooting Gallery is a pioneer in terms of where they'd like to take the independent film business from here."
Mr. Victor, a former entertainment lawyer, made his first film investment in "Sling Blade" and got a return on his money of more than 300 percent. He is now preparing a $15 million fund to back films mostly costing $3 million or less.
What that kind of money creates, when added to the mix of bigger budget Hollywood films like "Meet Joe Black," "Ransom" and the new "Godzilla," which were all filmed at least partly in New York, is demand.
Throughout the region, film and television crews have swarmed into armories and warehouses, creating sound stages in places that were not built for the purpose. The Park Slope Armory in Brooklyn had three movies filmed in succession last year. Some places have taken on a air of semi-permanence, with one film crew in some cases passing on its equipment to the crew of the next film coming in.
Talk of expanded capacity is everywhere as well. Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, where the television show "Cosby" is filmed, is considering adding on. Sonalysts Studio in Waterford, Conn., where Steven Spielberg filmed many of the interior scenes for "Amistad," is also planning major growth. A company in New Jersey founded by a line producer from "Saturday Night Live" and a businesswoman from Franklin Lakes, N.J., said last week that they were entering the fray with plans to open a 30,000-square-foot sound stage complex in Paterson, N.J.
"There's no question that if we build them, they will be filled," said Patricia Reed Scott, the New York City's Commissioner of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. "We want to build on the extraordinary numbers we're doing so that the critical mass goes larger."
But there are also plenty of worriers. Independent filmmakers say that while all the new attention has made financing movies easier than ever, the unique flavor of New York filmmaking could easily get lost in all the new opportunities and pressures.
"Basically what's happening is that Hollywood is trying to co-opt the entire independent film world," said Ira Deutchman, a partner at Redeemable Features, a three-year-old independent production company in Manhattan that is probably best known for the film "Kiss Me Guido," released last year. "There was a time when a low-budget film could go in, and if it made a million in the box office, it was perceived of as a success. These days, a million is a failure -- they keep raising the bar."
Most film scholars trace the tradition of the New York independent film to people like John Cassavetes, the actor and director who honed his skills in New York in live television in the 1950's. His first feature film, "Shadows," in 1960, with its grainy texture and jumpy scene cuts, was embraced by a generation of New York filmmakers as a blueprint.
"There's a certain pace that was carried from the hectic quality of live TV into the rhythms of New York City movies," said Annette Insdorf, director of undergraduate film studies at Columbia University. "And there's a greater overlap between the concerns and style of European films and New York independent movies than between New York independent movies and Hollywood."
Recent New York films like "All Over Me," directed by a Columbia film school graduate, Alex Sichel; "The Daytrippers," directed by Greg Mottola, also from Columbia's film school, and "New Jersey Drive," directed by Nick Gomez, all include the city or the region as a prominent feature, almost a character. Other locally based filmmakers, like Joel and Ethan Coen, carry the banner of New York edginess, film experts say, whether they shoot in the city or in the snowy northern plains, as in the Coens' 1996 movie, "Fargo."
Some local industry executives say the greatest danger is that New York will start to believe its own mystique. "This is not 'Field of Dreams,' " said Hal Rosenbluth, the president of Kaufman Astoria Studios. "There is nothing that says, 'If you build it, they will come.' "
Mr. Rosenbluth said the central fact of the industry is that Los Angeles leads. New York has improved as a place to live and work, and the local film production unions have become more accommodating than they were a few years ago, Mr. Rosenbluth said. Those changes have given New York star appeal, he said, but not real power to influence its fate.
While there are more television series, like "Spin City," starring Michael J. Fox, "Oz," an HBO series, and "Law and Order," being produced in New York, there are even more, like "Seinfeld" and "Friends," that are set in a fictional New York, imagined from a sound stage in California. And the region's film facilities, Mr. Rosenbluth said, are like hotels -- if Hollywood does not check in, there is simply not enough local business to make for success.
"I'm dependent on Warner Brothers and Paramount and Sony and Fox, and I have to wait for them to say, 'Let's do a project and let's do it in New York,' " he said. "I can't influence that decision other than to say, 'I'm here.' "
Officials at the Shooting Gallery said that plans for the New Jersey project would proceed with the market's needs in mind. The overarching goal, said David C. Tuttle, the company's senior executive vice president for operations, is to allow for flexibility of uses -- smaller, intimate spaces for shooting commercials, or large stages for film and television, or some combination.
The capstone, a 106,000- to 110,000-square-foot sound stage that would edge out the 105,000-square-foot sound stage at England's Pinewood Studios as the world's largest, would require a separate building and would not come until the second phase of construction, Mr. Tuttle said. He said that $100 million in venture capital money had been committed, but that plans and estimates were still being drawn up to calculate how much each phase might cost.
Such ambition has been seen before. Under a headline that read, "Movies Come East from California," The Wall Street Journal noted an expansion of studio space and film industry investment and predicted that the tide of motion picture production heading west for California had turned.
"It is safe to say," The Journal article said, "that in the future the bulk of production will be done within easy reach of Manhattan."
That article was published in 1924.
 
Big City as Stage: Best Shooting Sites
 
For New York City location managers, whose job it is to find interesting places to film, the city has an endless variety of architecture and atmosphere, but also a collection of stupefying logistical problems. Following is a sampling of typical New York shots and where film crews go to get them.
 
WHAT THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR -- Grit, decay, the urban wasteland.
THE REALITY -- "It's not as easy as you'd think," said Tom Whalen, a location manager on several films, including "Kids." "There's not that much of it left."
THE LOCATIONS -- The Brooklyn waterfront, especially in Williamsburg and Greenpoint; under any East River bridge; parts of northern Long Island City and sections of the South Bronx and Staten Island.
THE SHOTS -- "Donnie Brasco," with Al Pacino and Johnny Depp, shot in Williamsburg and on the Staten Island waterfront; the coming "Frogs for Snakes," starring Barbara Hershey, recently shot along Elton and Westchester Avenues in the Bronx; "Cop Land," with scenes shot under the Queensboro Bridge.

WHAT THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR -- An alley (with rats if possible).
THE REALITY -- Location managers say this is also a surprisingly tough chore. "Many of these scripts are written in Los Angeles, where there are alleys everywhere," said Nathan Gendzier, a freelance location manager. "Manhattan has about seven good ones."
THE LOCATIONS -- Staple Street in TriBeCa; Minetta Street in Greenwich Village; Cortlandt Alley in Chinatown; Ryders Alley in the financial district; side streets in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.
THE SHOTS -- "Little Odessa," shot in Brighton Beach, with Tim Roth as an unhappy Russian; "State of Grace," starring Sean Penn, shot on Staple Street.
WHAT THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR -- Landmarks.
THE REALITY -- "Filmmakers from out of town like to have a skyscraper in the shot to convince people that they were actually there," said Joseph Zolfo, a location manager. "New York types actually try to avoid it."
THE LOCATIONS -- The Empire State Building, the World Trade Center, the Brooklyn Bridge.
THE SHOTS -- The 1976 remake of "King Kong," in which the big ape climbed the World Trade Center; "Godzilla," in which the Empire State Building is sliced in half by the big lizard's tail; the Guggenheim Museum, which is scaled by a fugitive alien in "Men in Black."

WHAT THE SCRIPT CALLS FOR -- Vintage New York.
THE REALITY -- Period pieces require some ingenuity. "If you point the camera up and avoid the street level, a lot of the city's buildings can look old," said Andy Clark, a location manager who worked on "I Shot Andy Warhol."
THE LOCATIONS -- The National Arts Club and the Players Club, both on Gramercy Park, for interiors. For exteriors, Sylvan Terrace, off Jumel Terrace in upper Manhattan; St. Luke's Place and other streets in Greenwich Village; parts of Park Slope, Brooklyn (minus the street signs).
THE SHOTS -- "The Age of Innocence," a drama set in the 1870's with scenes shot in the National Arts Club; "Ship of Fools," a 1930's comedy, starring Stanley Tucci and Isabella Rossellini, with shots in the theater district and on a Hudson River pier.

HEADLINE: Whitman Plans Her Biggest Spending Rise

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 9

 BODY:
With New Jersey's coffers overflowing with extra tax revenue from the economic boom, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman will recommend raising spending by about $1 billion in her new state budget, the largest increase since she took office four years ago, top aides to the Governor said today.
Mrs. Whitman is not expected to propose any major tax cuts when she outlines her spending plan to the State Legislature on Tuesday, the aides said. But they said that she would propose giving $75 million more to cities and towns to help them keep property taxes down. 
 She will also propose eliminating the sales tax on long-distance telephone calls made within the state, which would save taxpayers $24 million annually, and she will recommend putting $650 million aside in the state's rainy-day fund.
After cutting taxes and striving to hold down state spending, Mrs. Whitman will make a significant departure in the proposed $17.9 billion budget by increasing spending, primarily for public schools and state colleges and universities. Total spending in her new budget is about 5.4 percent more than in this year's budget.
Assemblyman Richard H. Bagger, chairman of the Assembly's Budget Committee, praised the Governor for proposing more spending for public schools and higher education, and for setting part of the surplus aside in the rainy-day fund. He said that he did not think that Mrs. Whitman should follow the lead of Republican governors in New York and Connecticut and give part of the budget surplus back to taxpayers.
"Been there, done that," said Mr. Bagger, a Republican from Westfield. "We've cut taxes 17 times." He added, "Perhaps the fact that we cut taxes early on has helped the economic recovery in New Jersey be so strong."
In her plan, Mrs. Whitman recommends a $540 million increase for public schools, including $50 million for school construction. State aid for state colleges and universities would rise by $61 million, but state officials said that future increases would depend on whether colleges and universities meet certain performance standards, like graduation rates.
Mrs. Whitman is also expected to propose spending $50 million for a new program to help preserve farmland and other open space. Other spending increases include $29 million for New Jersey Transit to avoid a commuter ticket price increase this year and $15 million to build bicycle paths throughout the state. The Governor is also expected to announce a $25 million spending increase for a program to help revive urban neighborhoods.
"It is a good-news budget," John Farmer, the Governor's chief counsel, said, "because it strikes the proper balance between spending on school programs, like school construction, and exercising the kind of fiscal restraint that has characterized this administration."
Senior administration officials announced on Friday that tax revenues would be $609 million higher than they had expected for the current fiscal year that ends on June 30. They estimated that tax revenue would be $710 million higher in the new fiscal year, presenting Mrs. Whitman with the difficult choice of spending more or giving some of the budget surplus back to taxpayers.
Today, administration officials said the higher tax revenues were offset by some unexpected expenses, such as overtime costs in the state prison system. The state is expecting a $1.021 billion surplus in this fiscal year.
State Treasurer James A. DiEleuterio Jr. said that the surplus, combined with the extra tax revenues in the new fiscal year, persuaded Mrs. Whitman to increase spending in some areas and set aside $650 million in the state's rainy-day fund. The state usually budgets about $550 million annually for the fund, he said.
Almost $6 billion, a third of the state budget, is intended for public schools. Urban school districts would receive almost half of all state aid for public schools.
Of the $540 million overall increase in state aid for public schools, about $343 million would cover local pension costs and Social Security payments for teachers. State spending would rise by $35 million for urban schools and $165 million for suburban districts.
The Governor's proposed budget does not include an extra $312 million for urban schools that a judge, appointed by the State Supreme Court, said last month was necessary to further correct inequities between the state's poorest and wealthiest school districts. The court must now decide whether to force the state to spend the money.
Mr. Farmer, the chief counsel, said the administration did not budget the extra money because officials did not think the court would require the state to spend $312 million on top of the money it is already spending this year in response to an order from the State Supreme Court. Last year, the court ordered the state to increase spending for urban schools by $246 million.
Democrats said the Governor's proposed budget did not include enough relief for property-tax payers. "If we've really heard the message of last November, we simply can't go to the people with this paltry amount of new property tax relief," said State Senator Bernard F. Kenny Jr., a Democrat from Hoboken who is the assistant minority leader.
Steven H. Hochman, senior vice president of state ratings at Moody's Investors Service, said the Governor's spending plan did not include risky budget maneuvers -- like relying too much on one-shot revenue sources -- that concerned bond rating analysts in the past.

HEADLINE: School-to-Work Programs Set Students Back;
Learning in Context

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Lynne Cheney (Op-Ed, Feb. 3) seems to be unaware of the increasing amount of national research on school-to-work programs, much of it financed by private foundations that see these efforts as promising ways to eradicate the "floundering" stage between school and work. 
 Moreover, connecting young people to the world of work is not the only goal: contrary to Ms. Cheney's assertion, there is research that suggests that learning in context can strengthen understanding and improve retention of academic subject matter.
School-to-work programs don't call for eighth graders to choose careers but career majors, which are broadly defined occupational areas. These programs don't direct job choices but instead provide information about job possibilities, give students exposure to different occupations and workplaces, and help them create ties with adults from whom they can learn about specific jobs and working in general.

HEADLINE: If NATO Doesn't Grow

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Contrary to the suggestion of some Feb. 9 letters, membership in the European Union should indeed precede any expansion of NATO. But that does not seem to be in the cards for three reasons. First, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are major agricultural producers. Their entry would complicate inter-E.U. agricultural controversies. 
 Second, the European Union is about to go to a single currency, which will require budgetary restrictions and austerity and the setting of exchange rates; the still frail economies of these countries would not be up to that.
Finally, cheap exports and expensive imports are already a barrier to the reforms and reconstruction of their industries and infrastructure that all three countries need badly. Forcing them to spend on weaponry would foreclose the prospect of a better life for their long-suffering peoples.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place -- The St. Louis Phoenix;
From Its Heartland Hub, T.W.A. Is Rising, but Wall St. Has Some Doubts

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Last summer, Wall Street feared Trans World Airlines was headed for yet another emergency landing in bankruptcy court -- its third since 1992.
Speculation about bankruptcy has evaporated, though, as T.W.A. scored impressive gains in efficiency and pulled off a string of refinancing deals that raised nearly $225 million. Memories of the still-unexplained explosion of Flight 800 off Long Island in 1996 have faded. And after T.W.A. reported third-quarter earnings that were the best since 1989, its stock soared more than 60 percent, and several analysts added it to their buy lists. On Monday, the shares were unchanged at $11.5625. 
 But don't mistake Wall Street's relief for long-term optimism. The company is expected to report a fourth-quarter loss this month. Moreover, it will end 1997 -- a year in which other airlines rode the strong economy and low fuel prices to record profits -- deeply in the red. T.W.A. can survive, but will it prosper?
"We still have to prove we can make money," acknowledged Gerald L. Gitner, the lanky, balding 52-year-old Texan who has led the recovery since being named chairman and chief executive late in 1996.
To gain financial altitude, T.W.A. will have to confound the industry experts. Once the nation's biggest airline, it is now No. 7, just ahead of Southwest. The common wisdom is that there is no such thing as a lucrative niche for a relatively small carrier like T.W.A. that is saddled with entrenched unions and the hub-and-spoke structure of the industry giants. And in an industry where there is constant talk of mergers and of deals like last month's alliance of Continental and Northwest, T.W.A.'s name is usually among the last mentioned.
Indeed, most analysts and airline industry insiders see T.W.A.'s recent rebound as little more than the latest evidence that it is almost impossible to kill an established airline when the economy is growing. One industry joke, both a comment on T.W.A.'s prospects and a backhanded compliment to its survival skills, has it that the airline business in the year 2025 will consist of three prospering giants created through mergers "and financially strapped T.W.A."
T.W.A., not surprisingly, has a rosier vision, based on two core assumptions about the nature of the airline business. The first is that the worst battles of the industry's civil war following its deregulation in 1978 are history, leaving T.W.A. and other established airlines organized around impregnable hubs. "There's not a whole lot anybody can do to compete but get a lot better where they are," said Michael Palumbo, T.W.A.'s chief financial officer.
The second assumption is that T.W.A. is strategically blessed with its major St. Louis hub here in the heart of the nation and a strong presence at New York's chief international gateway, Kennedy International Airport. Profits will roll in, T.W.A. believes, if T.W.A. can beat other airlines at the fundamentals such as on-time service, getting the right-size planes for each route and marketing plans that reward frequent, full-fare passengers.
Put it together, and you end up early in the next century with a flourishing airline, according to Mr. Palumbo. Revenues might be about $4 billion, not much larger than today and just a fourth the size of the giants like United Airlines. But if everything goes right, profit margins could top the industry, Mr. Palumbo said.
Even after T.W.A.'s impressive strides the last year, such a rewarding scenario seems far-fetched. But, a gradual return to solid profitability at least seems possible.
T.W.A.'s most startling gains have been in on-time service. After starting 1997 as the worst performer among the nation's 10 biggest airlines, it vaulted to first by summer. Though bad weather, wildcat strikes and a breakdown in the Federal air-traffic-control computer covering St.Louis knocked it back into the pack the final two months of the year, it continued to outshine its own recent past, completing every scheduled flight on six days of November, for example, compared with none for all of 1996.
"It's so basic," said William Compton, a longtime T.W.A. pilot whom Mr. Gitner put in charge of operations and recently promoted to president. "As soon as the on-time figures began shooting up last February, so did all our measures of customer satisfaction."
One key to both more timely service and cutting costs was replacing wide-body Boeing 747's and Lockheed L1011's with new 757's and a mixture of new and almost-new MD-80's, which have less than half the capacity. T.W.A. is also phasing out its aging 727's.
With fewer seats to sell, T.W.A. has experienced a 10 percent drop in operating revenue. But operating profit in the third quarter jumped to $63.8 million from $26 million a year earlier, and the company is projecting a sharp narrowing of its loss during this year's slow winter period to $50 million from $150 million last year. This is because the new planes are fuller and more efficient, requiring smaller crews and less fuel and maintenance.
The average age of T.W.A.'s fleet has dropped from over 19 years to just over 16. That is far from the best in an industry that averages 13 years -- but it is no longer the worst. Getting rid of the widebodies saves $20 million in annual training costs. It also cuts T.W.A.'s vulnerability to higher fuel prices: each 1-cent increase now adds $7.1 million to the airline's annual fuel bill, down from $8.4 million before.
T.W.A. is also rebounding on the marketing front. It recently became the first airline to deploy a computer program tracking how much customers spend with the company as well as how many miles they fly. That data have given it a tool to track -- and reward -- full-fare business customers who fly frequently but rarely on long hauls.
The carrier has also renovated lounges for its frequent and full-fare fliers here and in New York and recently expanded its first-class seating and upgrade programs as a further inducement.
Analysts give Mr. Gitner's team high marks for these and other improvements. So why is there so much skepticism that they can build on such successes to the point that T.W.A. can sail above the turbul when the next downturn hits? After all, Continental Airlines, which has also been through two bankruptcies since deregulation, now has a $1 billion cash hoard, and Northwest Airlines, which narrowly averted bankruptcy in 1994, is flying high.
One problem is that not many people outside the company buy T.W.A.'s assumption that there is a host of unexploited benefits from its particular route structure. T.W.A. already accounts for more than 60 percent of the traffic originating at St. Louis's Lambert Field. Southwest, which cannot be beat on budget prices, holds much of the rest.
St. Louis businesses are already pulling out all stops to support T.W.A. Each spring in recent years, Civic Progress, which brings together the local business community, has organized a drive in which companies like Monsanto and Anheuser-Busch buy tens of millions of dollars worth of tickets in advance to help the airline stay aloft until the summer season.
The leaves T.W.A. extremely dependent on getting more customers flying between other cities to come through St. Louis, especially those with no direct flight options. T.W.A. calls it the Portland, Ore., to Jacksonville, Fla., market. But such "transhub" customers already account for two-thirds of T.W.A.'s business at Lambert, more than any other airline has running through a major hub.
St. Louis's central location makes the potential transhub market worth tens of billions of dollars, but T.W.A. acknowledges that does not reflect Lambert's current physical limitations. It is already the fifth-busiest airport in the nation despite being reduced to one runway whenweather is bad. A planned additional runway will not be ready before 2003 at the earliest.
T.W.A.'s second hub, at Kennedy Airport, is no help. It is a reminder of the glory days when the T.W.A. of Charles Lindbergh and Howard Hughes was rivaled only by Pan Am as an internationally renown symbol of American aviation. But after Carl C. Icahn, the Wall Street financier who took control of the airline in 1985, sold the valuable London routes to American Airlines in 1991, Kennedy and the routes feeding international traffic into it became money losers.
Mr. Icahn was forced out after T.W.A. went bankrupt in 1992, but efforts to return T.W.A.'s Kennedy operations to profitability have not worked. T.W.A. can claim it flies to more American cities from Kennedy than any does other airline, but most business travelers heading to or from New York prefer La Guardia or Newark. That is why Continental's heavy investment in expanding its Newark hub has contributed so much to that airline's rebirth.
"T.W.A.'s board thinks their problem is that people avoid them, but I believe people don't even think about them," said Glenn D. Engel, an airline industry analyst for Goldman, Sachs. "Outside of St. Louis, they are a nonentity."
Beyond such fundamental strategic problems, T.W.A. also faces tough labor negotiations this year, and the continuing challenge of keeping up with wealthier rivals when it comes to investing in new technology and renewing its fleet.
Ultimately, analysts say, T.W.A.'s best hope is to attract bigger and healthier airlines as marketing partners so that it can link its routes, schedules, frequent-flier programs, clubs and other attractions to theirs. T.W.A., said Samuel Buttrick, who follows the industry for Paine Webber, "has to become part of a true network."

CORRECTION-DATE: February 12, 1998, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Tuesday comparing the operating results of Trans World Airlines with those of other airlines carried an erroneous label for 1997 results. They were for the 12 months ended in September, not for the first 9 months of the year. T.W.A., for example, had an operating loss of $30 million for the first 9 months, but a loss of $263 million for the year.

HEADLINE: Beyond Rancor, Brecht Remounts His Pedestal;
Playwright Is an Icon Again as Many Forgive His Marxist Politics

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BERLIN, Feb. 10

 BODY:
When Bertolt Brecht returned here in 1948 from wartime exile in the United States, the legendary German playwright and stage director chose to live and work in East Berlin. He was not, in fact, a card-carrying Communist, but he described himself as Marxist. And after his death in 1956 at the age of 58, his Berliner Ensemble theater company remained East Germany's principal cultural ambassador. With the unification of Germany in 1990, Brecht's name seemed irrevocably linked to a repressive regime and a failed ideology.
Yet today, the 100th anniversary of his birth on Feb. 10, 1898, Brecht is being celebrated throughout Germany on a scale suggesting that his politics have already been forgiven. In addition to a speech honoring him by President Roman Herzog of Germany today at the Berlin Academy of Arts, Brecht's birthplace in Augsburg has been turned into a museum, while his last residence in Berlin at Chausseestrasse 125 now contains his archives. Stamps have been issued, tours organized, a dozen new books on Brecht published and, across the country, his plays are being performed, accompanied by lectures, workshops and exhibitions. 
 At the ornate 19th-century Am Schiffbauerdamm Theater, home to the Berliner Ensemble since 1954, five Brecht plays are currently in repertory, including Robert Wilson's production of "Flight Over the Ocean," the American director's first venture into Brecht. On Monday night, the countdown to Brecht's birthday was accompanied by a lively concert of his songs, leading off with "The Ballad of Mack the Knife." Tonight, a performance of his 1930 play, "The Measures Taken," was followed by "Germany Nine-Zero," a film of Jean-Luc Godard, the most Brechtian of movie directors.
Outside Germany, the return of Brecht is occurring more slowly, with many theater directors still put off by both his politics and his often pessimistic plays. New productions are nonetheless being presented, not only of the best-known plays written after he fled Hitler's Germany in 1933, like "Mother Courage and Her Children," "The Life of Galileo," "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui" and "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," but also of earlier works, among them "The Threepenny Opera" and "The Rise and Fall of Mahagonny," both with music by Kurt Weill. If Brecht has not been forgotten, then, which Brecht is being remembered? At different times during -- and after -- his life, he was variously considered European theater's most important playwright, director and theorist. Yet in all three categories his views often changed, suggesting he was more empirical than dogmatic. Today, Germany has placed him alongside Schiller as an icon, but what is his relevance to theater?
Certainly his plays continue to be performed and studied, with his midlife works considered by some experts among the best epic plays written in Europe since the 17th century, although at least three of his mistresses probably deserved to share credit for them.
Brecht's stagecraft, which challenged Stanislavsky's realism by provoking what Brecht called an "alienation effect" to remind audiences they were in a theater watching a re-enactment, is also present in modern theater, opera, cinema and even advertising, albeit at times absorbed to the point that its provenance is not always apparent.
But what clearly fell out of fashion in the Reaganite and Thatcherite 1980's was Brecht's strong commitment to what he called "epic theater," to making audiences think before feeling, to the idea, in the words of the British playwright David Hare, "that plays have to be defined by people's social class and by power relationships and not simply by psychology." Or as Sir Richard Eyre, until recently artistic director of the Royal National Theater in London, put it: "He taught people that they could take the theater seriously and that theater was a medium to talk about serious things."
Brecht's influence on British theater from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's was enormous, first through the impact of the Berliner Ensemble's early visits to London on theater technique, then through the way British directors came to interpret Shakespeare and other classics as sociopolitical dramas.
"Brecht is the key figure of our time, and all theater work today at some point starts or returns to his statements and achievement," the British director Peter Brook wrote in 1969. Mr. Hare, who has translated and adapted both "Mother Courage" and "The Life of Galileo," said, "Only when his influence as a director began to wane did we begin to rediscover his plays."
 
Topical in France As Jobs Dry Up
While Brecht has now joined the classical repertory in Britain and elsewhere, rising unemployment and social disenchantment have made him more topical in France and Germany.
"In the 1960's, many French directors were politically engaged Brechtians, but they fell out of favor," said Stuart Seide, an American director who teaches at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Art in Paris. "But now the young are interested in a different Brecht, the early Brecht, the poetic Brecht, the Brecht before Marxism, the Brecht who had not found himself, who found the world to be a confusing place."
Stephane Braunschweig, a 33-year-old French director whose production of Brecht's "In the Jungle of the Cities" is drawing young audiences at the Theatre de la Colline in Paris, said he chose this early work because "it speaks more directly to my generation." And he added: "People have an image of Brecht as serious and didactic theater, but his early work was pulsating, nervous, irreflexive, dynamic, almost surreal at times. I too want audiences to take a position, to react, to fight, so in this sense Brecht is natural material."
Holge Teschke, 39, the resident dramaturge at the Berliner Ensemble, noted a similar phenomenon in Germany. "Young directors are doing early plays like 'St. Joan of the Stockyards,' which in the 1920's dealt with unemployment and the social crisis," he said. "These plays interest young directors more than the classics." Among these young directors is Brecht's own granddaughter, Johanna Schall.
Still, if Brecht wrote plays for all occasions, this also reflected the changing circumstances of his turbulent life. He came of age during World War I and wrote his first play, "Baal," in a Germany humbled by defeat and a Europe convulsed by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the rise of Soviet Communism. Brecht himself, as if reflecting this confusion, was a leftist anarchist: his early plays in Munich, with audiences encouraged to become involved, often set off near-riots.
In 1924, he moved to Berlin, and it was there in 1928 that he enjoyed his first triumph -- and financial success -- with "The Threepenny Opera," based on John Gay's 18th-century "The Beggar's Opera." It was also with this production that he first earned a reputation for sharing neither earnings nor credit with his collaborators. According to John Fuegi, a professor of comparative literature at the University of Maryland and author of "Brecht and Company: Sex, Politics and the Making of the Modern Drama" (Grove Press, 1994), Brecht's mistress and assistant, Elizabeth Hauptmann, translated and adapted most of "The Threepenny Opera."
In 1933, with Brecht long viewed as both Communist and "degenerate" by the Nazis, he fled to Denmark with his wife, the actress Helene Weigel, their two children, and Hauptmann. In 1939, as war approached, they moved hurriedly to Sweden and eventually to Finland. During these years he wrote his best-known works, the so-called chronicle plays, in these cases, Mr. Fuegi said, with considerable assistance from two other mistresses, Margarete Steffin and Ruth Berlau.
Finally, in June 1941, after crossing the Soviet Union (and choosing not to stay there), Brecht took his family by boat from Vladivostok to Los Angeles, where he lived until 1947. His time in the United States did not win him over to capitalism. His efforts to write for Hollywood and Broadway failed, and only in 1947 was he able to present "The Life of Galileo" onstage, with Charles Laughton in the lead role. Finally, under intense surveillance by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interrogation by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, he returned to Europe.
Before accepting an invitation to work in the Soviet-run section of Berlin, he tried unsuccessfully to find a permanent theater in Zurich and Vienna. But the offer of the Am Schiffbauerdam Theater, scene of his triumphant "Threepenny Opera" in 1928, was hard to resist. It would be used, he said, "for the scientific manufacture of scandal."
As it happens, the East German authorities never fully trusted him, and he was not assigned the theater until 1954. But by then he had created the Berliner Ensemble and had made his mark in postwar European theater with his stunning production of "Mother Courage," with Weigel in the main role.
After Brecht's death, the Berliner Ensemble continued to prosper under Weigel's direction until her death in 1971. But by the mid-1970's, the company was being suffocated by East Germany's cultural bureaucracy. And by the time the Berlin wall came down in 1989, it was a shadow of its former self.
Since then, it has been liberated from Government meddling, although not from politics, with a succession of directors fighting their personal and ideological battles onstage. Indeed, if the 32-member ensemble is working well this year, it may be because it has no permanent director. In the view of many European theater experts, the effort to make Brecht relevant today has been complicated by his heirs, notably his daughter, Barbara Brecht Schall, who insists on approving all translations of Brecht's plays and, in the case of the Berliner Ensemble, even on authorizing the director and principal cast members.
"It's easier to do something fresh with Brecht in Namibia than in Berlin or Paris," Mr. Teschke said.
 
'Absurd Policing Of Translations'
"One of the reasons Brecht is not performed more is this absurd policing of translations," argued Sir Richard Eyre, who nonetheless presented seven Brecht productions during his time at the National Theater. Mr. Hare, though, said he saw signs of flexibility. "There was a time of almost monarchical obeisance that one had to pay to the great man. But since the fall of the wall, there has been an easing up, a recognition that Brecht has to live."
In that sense, then, his place in 21st-century theater may be assured less by this month's homages than by the fact that young European directors are now choosing to present his early plays. "I think the later pieces are a bit intimidating because there is such tradition and orthodoxy," Mr. Braunschweig said. "Perhaps we have to pass through the early pieces to cast fresh light on the later pieces."

HEADLINE: 'Titanic' Leads the Oscar List With 'L.A.' and 'Good Will'

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Feb. 10

 BODY:
Gloria Stuart was asleep at her home in West Los Angeles when her visiting daughter and son-in-law woke her up and began jumping up and down to tell her she had just been nominated for an Academy Award for her supporting role in "Titanic." Ms. Stuart, 87, said later, "All these years -- I've been waiting for this a long, long time."
Gus Van Sant, who was nominated as best director for "Good Will Hunting," said his parents cried when he called them with the news. And Robert Forster, who has struggled for years as an actor, heard from some unlikely callers that he had been nominated for an Oscar for Quentin Tarantino's "Jackie Brown." 
 "In rapid order, Quentin called, my two ex-wives called, my daughter and son called, even my old agent called," said Mr. Forster.
It was that kind of morning in Hollywood.
As expected, "Titanic," the James Cameron romantic epic that seems destined to break box office records around the world, was nominated for 14 Academy Awards, including best picture, actress and director. The only other film to earn 14 nominations was "All About Eve," released in 1950.
Two other films, "L.A. Confidential" and "Good Will Hunting," received nine nominations each, including best picture. The other films nominated for best picture were "As Good as It Gets," and "The Full Monty."
Uberto Pasolini, the producer of "The Full Monty," the comedy-drama about a group of unemployed men in northern England, said he was "flabbergasted" at the best-film nomination, which was a relative surprise to the film industry. Mr. Pasolini said that the movie, which cost only $3 million and has grossed nearly $200 million around the world, resonated with filmgoers because it dealt with characters and issues that were instantly recognizable.
"I thought this was the year of the big film, like 'Titanic,' " said Mr. Pasolini. "They decided to squeeze a small Cinderella in there."
What was unexpected in the 70th annual Academy Award nominations, announced before dawn in Los Angeles, was the decision by the Director's Branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science to pass over Steven Spielberg, who did not receive a best director's nod for "Amistad." The film was also ignored in the best-picture category.
The well-reviewed "Ice Storm" did not receive any nominations.
At the same time, the directors ignored James L. Brooks, whose film "As Good as It Gets" received seven nominations, including best picture, best actor (Jack Nicholson), best actress (Helen Hunt) and best supporting actor (Greg Kinnear). Mr. Brooks was nominated, though, for best original screenplay for the film, which he wrote with Mark Andrus.
Also nominated for best original screenplay was Woody Allen for "Deconstructing Harry." It was Mr. Allen's 13th writing nomination, breaking Billy Wilder's record of 12.
Instead of Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Brooks were two surprise directorial choices: Atom Egoyan, for "The Sweet Hereafter," a critically acclaimed but not widely seen drama about sorrow and forgiveness, and Peter Cattaneo, for "The Full Monty." The other directors nominated were Mr. Cameron, Mr. Van Sant and Curtis Hanson for "L.A. Confidential."
Mr. Hanson was in a friend's apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan when he saw the news of his nomination on television. "I was on the 17th floor and could have stepped out the window and still been this high," said Ms. Hanson, whose film is being re-released by Warner Brothers after grossing only $41.6 million, which was not bad for a period drama about the Los Angeles police in the 1950's but a disappointment given its dazzling reviews.
A total of 5,371 academy members selected the candidates in 24 categories. The Oscars are to be presented on March 23.
While independent films were well represented in last year's Oscar nominations, this year's marked the return of major studios like Paramount, 20th Century Fox, Warner Brothers and Sony. The list included comebacks for several prominent performers of the 1960's and 70's. These included Julie Christie, 56, nominated for her role as a faded actress in a troubled marriage in "Afterglow." Ms. Christie, who won an Oscar for the 1965 film "Darling," is competing in the best-actress category with Kate Winslet in "Titanic," Helen Hunt in "As Good as It Gets," Helena Bonham Carter in "The Wings of the Dove" and Judi Dench in "Mrs. Brown."
Ms. Dench said in London that she was sitting in the cafeteria at the BBC, where she is rehearsing a television role, when the news of her nomination came by phone. "It was terribly glamorous," she said with a laugh. "It was a truly terrible lunch, and I celebrated by cracking open a bottle of water."
Ms. Hunt, speaking from her car phone in Los Angeles, said it was a "dizzying compliment" to be compared to an actress like Ms. Dench, one of Britain's most honored stars. "If I see 'Mrs. Brown' one more time, the tape will break down," said Ms. Hunt.
Another comeback was made by Peter Fonda, who rose to fame in 1969 with "Easy Rider" and was nominated for best actor for his role as a beekeeper in "Ulee's Gold." Mr. Fonda said from Toronto, where he is making a television film: "I'm just a lucky actor to be working. An actor takes so much rejection. Rejection after rejection. To have this moment of acceptance is wonderful."
Mr. Fonda has formidable competition, including Mr. Nicholson, whose 11th acting nomination sets a record. The other actors nominated are Dustin Hoffman in "Wag the Dog," Robert Duvall in "The Apostle" and Matt Damon in "Good Will Hunting."
Mr. Damon, who was also nominated with Ben Affleck for their screenplay "Good Will Hunting," said that his sudden stardom has left him overwhelmed. "It's been going by a little too fast," he said. "It's hard to take control over it. I've got to sit back and gauge where my life is. I feel like I'm missing an anchor."
Mr. Damon said he did not expect to win the acting award. "Did you see 'The Apostle'?" he asked. "All I want to do is six next to Robert Duvall."
Another comeback was that of Burt Reynolds, who turns 62 on Wednesday. He was nominated for best supporting actor for his role as a pornographic filmmaker in "Boogie Nights." The other supporting actors nominated are Mr. Forster, Anthony Hopkins in "Amistad," Greg Kinnear in "As Good as it Gets," and Robin Williams in "Good Will Hunting."'
As for the supporting-actress category, Ms. Stuart faces Joan Cusack in "In and Out," Kim Basinger in "L.A. Confidential," Minnie Driver in "Good Will Hunting" and Julianne Moore in "Boogie Nights."
Ms. Moore said she was nursing her 2-month-old son, Caleb, when the Oscar nominations were announced on television this morning in Los Angeles.
"I was pretending nothing was going on, with the lights off, when my boyfriend came into the bedroom and said, 'Congratulations,' " she said. "And then the phone rang, and it was my Dad in Maryland."
Ms. Moore said that the impact of the nomination had still not sunk in. "I'm still in my ratty running clothes and taking care of the baby," she said. "Nothing feels different. Yet."
Mr. Williams heard the news of his nomination on a film set in Asheville, N.C. "Someone shouted out, 'Mazel tov!' " he said. "These are not words you hear in North Carolina."

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Taking Pulse of the President's Pulse-Takers

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

 BODY:
FOR weeks, President Clinton has seemed like a stunt flier defying gravity. Why are his approval ratings soaring in the face of allegations that he had sex with a former White House intern? Could he still crash and burn? Public Lives put these questions to Mr. Clinton's very busy pollsters, Mark Penn and Doug Schoen, two New Yorkers who got their start in the early years of Mayor Edward I. Koch.
The pollsters responded, at first, with the not-astonishing view that the public is happy with the President because he made good on his promises to stoke the economy and bring down crime. 
 Here are some of their less predictable comments:
*Party lines are crucial. "There are three things going on," Mr. Penn said. "Democrats feel that their party is under assault by a partisan investigation, which is why fund-raising is going up. Conservative Republicans see this as a confirmation of their hatred for Clinton. And independents have reviewed his job performance, and see that he's kept his commitments. Their approval of him has gone up significantly."
*Even though polls show that a majority of Americans approve of the President's job performance, and a majority think the allegations are true, it does not automatically mean the country accepts the allegations of an affair. Mr. Penn agreed with his college friend E. J. Dionne of The Washington Post, who wrote recently that there are two distinct majorities -- those who approve of the President, and those who think he had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. The two majorities do not overlap that much. Polls show that most people who approve of the President do not think he had the affair, or do not know. Only 25 percent, Mr. Dionne said, think Mr. Clinton had the affair and still approve of his job performance. "That's an accurate point," Mr. Penn said.
Does that mean that Mr. Clinton might be in serious trouble if more damaging allegations come out?
"That's true of anybody, at any time," Mr. Penn said.
Mr. Penn and Mr. Schoen have been polling for the President since before the 1996 election, when the former White House consigliere, Dick Morris, brought in Mr. Schoen, his old friend from Upper West Side Democratic politics. A year later Mr. Schoen brought in his partner, Mr. Penn, to Mr. Morris's initial dismay. There were many fights (Mr. Morris threw a fit when Mr. Penn took over a White House closet as an office), but when the dust settled, Mr. Morris was out and Penn, Schoen & Berland Associates were in as the President's pollsters -- Mr. Schoen in New York to manage clients like AT&T that pay the bills, and Mr. Penn in Washington to take care of the President.
MR. PENN is now closer to Mr. Clinton than Mr. Schoen is, but Mr. Schoen contends there are no hard feelings.
"This is a long-term professional investment," he said. "It's not a short-term 'How close can we get to Bill Clinton, Al Gore, whoever?' "
Mr. Schoen, who talked in smooth paragraphs over lunch at the Lobster Club on the Upper East Side, said the 1996 Clinton campaign still owes the pollsters $1.6 million. Mr. Penn talked at Dock's Oyster Bar in midtown, in fitful starts and stops.
Mr. Schoen, 46, is the duo's lean and intense Mr. Outside, described by friends as a classic political operator with overlapping agendas who assumes that everyone else has them, too. He still insists that a question he was asked during an interview for a Rhodes Scholarship -- "Do you write poetry?" -- was a trick designed to make him hold forth on his other achievements. Mr. Schoen responded instead with an unembellished "no," and is convinced that it cost him the Rhodes.
"I couldn't spin the answer to that question in the way I've tried to instruct my clients to answer similarly difficult questions," he said.
Mr. Penn, 44, is in contrast the shy, sleepy bear who avoids the press, loses his cellular phone and wakes up when the talk turns to numbers. In the 1996 election, he pushed Mr. Clinton to take credit for the prospering economy. He polls for the President two to four times a month, but more often around big events. This year Mr. Penn threw some scandal-related questions into the polling he usually does at the time of the State of the Union address. Mr. Penn will not discuss his questions but did say, "There is nothing more deeply rooted in the American psyche than keeping the Government out of investigating these types of matters."
Mr. Penn, the son of a kosher poultry-plant owner, grew up in Riverdale in the Bronx. Mr. Schoen, the son of a corporate lawyer, grew up on the Upper East Side. Their partnership was born at the Horace Mann School, where the 5-foot 8-inch Mr. Schoen played football and the 6-foot 1-inch Mr. Penn was editor of the school paper, The Record. Mr. Penn conducted his first poll, about the liberal civil rights views of the Horace Mann faculty, when he was in ninth grade.
The two were at Harvard together, then polled for Mr. Koch, Gov. Hugh L. Carey and national elections in South American countries. They have, however, turned down dictatorships.
"If people feel that they're going to get shot based on how they express an opinion," Mr. Penn said, "you don't get a reliable poll."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
I.M.F. Concedes Its Conditions for Thailand Were Too Austere

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BANGKOK, Thailand, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund has conceded that conditions it imposed on Thailand as part of a multibillion-dollar bailout package have proved too austere, clearing a path for the Thai Government to increase spending substantially.
Acknowledging that economic growth and tax revenue have fallen far below levels predicted only several months ago, the I.M.F. has agreed to allow Thailand to run a budget deficit instead of posting a sizable surplus, said Hubert Neiss, director of the fund's Asia Pacific department. 
 "There is a need for flexibility on the spending target," Mr. Neiss said in an interview today. "Especially to the extent that there is a need for spending on social programs, this program is not hard and fast."
Mr. Neiss, who is visiting Bangkok this week for a formal assessment of the country's progress under I.M.F. care, said details of increased spending would await the completion of the Government budget, expected later this month.
The revised budget target, while not unexpected, would appear to vindicate some critics of I.M.F. bailout programs for troubled Asian countries. Several critics have argued that when the fund prescribed austerity for Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia last year, it tried to cure the wrong ill.
Those countries, the argument goes, do not have spendthrift governments, but rather huge private-sector debt problems. Sharp austerity adds to economic pain without solving the debt problem, the critics say.
Indeed, when the I.M.F. came to Thailand's rescue in August, the fund's experts predicted a relatively mild economic slowdown. They imposed belt-tightening measures to restrict Government spending and ordered that interest rates rise to high levels -- they are now close to 25 percent -- to help curtail excessive lending and force companies to clear their books of bad debt.
The forecast proved far too optimistic. The Thai baht lost half its value against the United States dollar. The country by most accounts has slipped into a recession, and some economists see the economy shrinking by 5 percent this year. One million people are expected to lose their jobs, doubling the unemployment rate.
Mr. Neiss acknowledged that the fund underestimated the ferocity of the Asian contagion and its impact on Thailand. But he says austerity was nonetheless needed, as Thailand showed classic symptoms of government mismanagement when it first applied for I.M.F. help last August.
Belt-tightening was necessary to curb excessive credit expansion, a gaping current account deficit and wasteful infrastructure spending, Mr. Neiss said. It is because of the sharper-than-expected recession and Thailand's success in meeting most early I.M.F. targets -- its balance of trade in particular has shown rapid improvement -- that the fund now advises looser restrictions on the budget, he said.
"Thailand is on the path to recovery, although not perhaps as fast as we had hoped," Mr. Neiss said. "This Government has given people confidence that it will stay the course."
Despite the mild criticism of the I.M.F. program here, Thai officials have taken pains to show their solidarity with the fund's program, fearing that they might otherwise jeopardize improving financial market sentiment.
Still, Pisit Leeahtam, the Deputy Finance Minister, said the Government felt strongly that it needed more spending power. It has cut its budget several times already to account for revenue shortfalls, and the new budget is already bare bones, he said. Most new spending would be used to help the jobless and support education, he added.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Up 115 As It Reaches Newest High

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
The stock market soared again yesterday, sending the Dow Jones industrial average to its first record high in six months.
The gains continued a rally that began earlier this month when stock markets around the world surged on optimism that the economic crisis in Asia was easing. Wall Street strategists are calling it a "sigh of relief" rally, a sense that the Asian crisis might not be as fierce a threat to American corporate profits as once was believed. 
 "There's a recognition that some of the earlier fears about Asia were unwarranted," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. "The fact is that U.S. companies in aggregate will not see a big negative impact."
Many other strategists, however, warn that the Asian turmoil has not really diminished -- it has only receded from the front pages -- and that it could reappear in the form of lower first-quarter profits. But in the meantime, investors around the world are celebrating the less visible threat by buying up shares of companies that had been beaten down in recent months.
Yesterday, strong earnings reports by Goodyear Tire and Time Warner rallied the market early. And the heavy buying sent the Dow up 115.09 points, or 1.41 percent, to 8,295.61. In the last two weeks, the Dow -- the most widely followed stock index -- has risen nearly 5 percent, managing to eclipse its old record of 8,259.31, set on Aug. 6.
More remarkable, though, is the gain since Oct. 27, when the Dow fell 554 points to slip as low as 7,161.15. While many investors panicked, those who bought stocks around that time, following a pattern seen throughout this bull market of buying on dips in prices, have pocketed big gains.
Indeed, many of nation's biggest and best-known companies -- even those with considerable interests in Asia -- have rallied sharply in recent months. The so-called Nifty Fifty, which includes companies like Coca-Cola, DuPont and Phillip Morris, is up 30 percent in the last 12 months.
Yesterday, investors were bidding fiercely for such blue-chip stocks, helping send the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- which reached the 1,000-point level for the first time last week -- up 8.27 points, to 1,019.01. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.61 points, or 1.1 percent, yesterday to 1,709.04, leaving the technology-heavy indicator just 2 percent from its all-time high.
Much of the buying interest is being focused on big-name stocks, but in recent days the bidding has broadened to smaller-company issues. And the pace of the activity picked up, too, yesterday. More than 647 million shares traded hands on the Big Board yesterday, about average for this year, but well above the pace of just a few months ago. In 1997, for instance, about 525 million shares traded each day on the Big Board.
Technology stocks are among the big winners this year. Shares of Intel and Microsoft, which trade on the Nasdaq stock market, continue to soar. Microsoft, now valued at more than $192 billion, reached an all-time high yesterday. Meanwhile, the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index is up 11.6 percent this year.
The bond market has held up well, too, in part because investors expect that the Asian crisis, even if it is easing, will help keep inflation in check despite an economy that continues to plow ahead.
In addition, a rise in worker productivity is helping hold costs down. Yesterday, bond prices rose, sending yields lower, after the Government reported that productivity increased much more than expected in the fourth quarter and rose by 1.7 percent for all of 1997. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.92 percent, from 5.94 percent on Monday.
The stock market rally in recent weeks has come despite what some see as a lackluster earnings season. With more than 80 percent of the companies in the S.& P. 500 reporting, earnings for the most recent quarter are up about 7.9 percent from a year earlier, a solid gain, but down significantly from the double-digit pace of earlier quarters, according to I.B.E.S. International, a firm that tracks corporate earnings.
"When we look back it's not a strong quarter at all," said Joseph Abbott, a research manager at I.B.E.S., noting that many analysts are cutting their projections for the first quarter of 1998. "They continue to come down, and the question is: Where does it stop?"
Mr. Abbott said that as recently as a month ago, Wall Street analysts had been projecting profit growth of about 9.4 percent for S.& P. 500 companies in the first quarter of 1998. That figure has dropped as low as 5.3 percent in recent days.
Elizabeth J. Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear, Stearns, says that not much has changed since October, and that the crisis in Asia still looms large. "I'm not sure Asia's over with," she said. "I'm not even sure the impact on earnings has begun."
Ms. Cohen at Goldman Sachs, however, says that many investors are simply coming to the conclusion that the American economy is "hot stuff." She likens the economy here to a "supertanker," slow and purposeful, and hard to knock off course.
That may be why about nine stocks rose for every five stocks that fell on the Big Board yesterday.
Joseph Yurman, a managing director at BancAmerica Robertson Stephens, was on the trading floor yesterday and he likened the frenzy to the investors' dream of owning a piece of corporate America and watching the price appreciate.
"Everyone's chasing the same rainbow," he said. "We're all trying to buy the big names."
The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three-year notes:

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
From Mutual Funds to Raising Funds

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
The bull market on Wall Street has produced a windfall for The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which received its first round of contributions this week from employees of Bear, Stearns & Company and Salomon Smith Barney, two of the nine investment banks and brokerage houses that participate in the fund's annual appeal.
As of Monday, $58,000 had been raised among 322 employees at the two firms, and much of that total will be matched by corporate grants. 
 Christian Hensley, 23, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney who helps coordinate the Wall Street campaign, said he expected this winter's yield to surpass that of previous drives, especially as donations from the seven other firms are gathered in the coming weeks.
"This is an extremely strong beginning to what we hope will be record-breaking numbers," Mr. Hensley said.
If so, they will be icing on the cake for the fund, which is enjoying its most successful campaign since it was established 86 years ago to help the city's poor, hungry and dispossessed. As of yesterday, $5,260,745 had been received from contributors, about $692,000 more than at this time last year. On Feb. 3, the tally of donations broke the record of $5,083,551 collected in the 1991-92 drive.
When this year's appeal ends, on Feb. 28, the money will be distributed among seven of the city's most prominent charities. And because The Times pays the fund's administrative costs, every dollar is spent on direct services, from feeding homeless children to keeping elderly renters in their homes.
Many contributors this year said they were moved by the realization that not everyone has benefited from New York City's healthy economy. Although the city's 8.7 percent unemployment rate is the lowest in years, it is still far higher than the national average of 4.7 percent. At least two million New Yorkers still live below the Federal poverty level, and their numbers are expected to grow as welfare benefits shrink over the next few years.
"The fact remains that if you're at the bottom of the barrel, not much prosperity is trickling down," said Herman Weingarten, 74, a retired teacher from the Upper West Side who sent the fund $25 for the seventh straight year. Mr. Weingarten said he was particularly worried about unskilled immigrants who arrive in New York without the ability to speak English.
"Like my own parents, who came to this country penniless," he said, "I know that many new arrivals need a little push before they can support themselves and their families."
Those who work with New York's most impoverished residents say that the need for assistance continues to outstrip available resources, especially after last year's welfare cuts, which removed thousands of legal immigrants from the food stamp program.
"For a city that is supposedly flush with prosperity, there is still too much deprivation and suffering out there," said Megan E. McLaughlin, executive director of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, one of the charities that benefit from the fund. "From where I sit, things look rather grim."
As in years past, the Wall Street campaign was led by a dozen young analysts who collected money for the fund in addition to working 80-hour weeks.
Sebastian Stubbe, 25, a third-year analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said that raising money for the fund was easier than he anticipated. "What I've learned is that people aren't stingy," he said. "They just don't have a conduit in which to be charitable. Present them the opportunity and they give."
This year the average donation from Wall Street has been $179. The largest came from James Valentine, 32, an equity researcher at Salomon who gave $10,000.
"The great thing about the fund is that we don't have to do any arm-twisting," said Aarti Chawla, 25, a second-year analyst at Salomon. "Everyone seems to know it's a good cause, so it's just about catching people who have very busy lives."

HEADLINE: Chrysler Is in the Market for Acquisitions

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, Robert J. Eaton, said this week that his company, the third-largest United States auto maker, was interested in buying all or part of another car company as it tries to increase international sales.
Talking to reporters before speaking at the Economic Club of Detroit, Mr. Eaton said: "Obviously, we're looking around. And if the right thing materializes, we'll be a player." 
 He told analysts last month that he expected some consolidation among auto makers in the first half of the year. Sales by the North American auto industry are expected to remain steady, prompting Chrysler to join its rivals General Motors and Ford in trying to improve sales abroad, analysts said.
Mr. Eaton said Chrysler might expand in Europe, where it has the smallest operations of Detroit's Big Three. While he would not say whether the company was in acquisition talks, he did mention Latin America as a region where Chrysler is putting emphasis.

HEADLINE: Productivity Jumps In 4th Quarter

 BODY:
Rapid economic growth at the end of 1997 was accompanied by sharp gains in worker productivity, the Labor Department reported yesterday. The index of nonfarm productivity rose at a 2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter, faster than analysts had expected, reflecting a surge in output of goods and services that far outpaced increases in wages and hours worked.

HEADLINE: Utility Agrees to Settlement in Bias Lawsuits

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Feb. 10

 BODY:
The Detroit Edison Company, the largest utility in Michigan, agreed today to pay as much as $65 million to settle accusations that it engaged in race, sex and age discrimination against 3,500 current and former employees.
Under the agreement, an arbitrator will decide on the overall amount that Detroit Edison must pay -- anywhere from $17.5 million to $65 million. Then, a committee made up of some of the plaintiffs, Detroit Edison executives and members of the Council of Baptist Pastors of Detroit will determine how much each employee will get. 
 The lawsuits were filed beginning in 1993, after Detroit Edison cut its work force of 11,000 to 8,400. Employees contended that the utility singled out women, members of minority groups and older workers. They enlisted the help of the Council of Baptist Pastors, which threatened economic sanctions.

HEADLINE: Whitman Shifts Course to Propose Hefty Increase for New Spending

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
After four years of cutting taxes and state spending, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reversed course today with a proposed $17.9 billion budget that recommends nearly $1 billion in new spending for public schools, state colleges, open space preservation and a handful of other programs.
Mrs. Whitman would pay for the largest budget increase since she took office with extra tax revenue flowing from the economic boom. State officials expect to end the current fiscal year, on June 30, with a $1 billion surplus and an additional $710 million in new revenue for the new fiscal year. 
 In a 34-minute budget address to the State Legislature, Governor Whitman said she wanted to put $650 million into a "rainy day" fund. She also proposed eliminating the sales tax on long-distance calls made within the state, saving consumers and businesses about $24 million a year.
Mrs. Whitman also called for a constitutional amendment to make it tougher for future lawmakers to raise taxes and said she wanted to allow motorists to renew their driver's licenses once a decade.
She also announced that she intended to revive the 1980's slogan "New Jersey and You: Perfect Together" to help promote tourism in the state, and she brought to the lectern the man whose distinctive Brahmin accent helped popularize the slogan, former Gov. Thomas H. Kean. He was greeted with a standing ovation.
Describing her spending plan, Mrs. Whitman said: "At $17.9 billion, this budget reflects the strength of our economy, the health of our finances and the priorities of our people. It includes investments, sensible savings and smart spending. And it honors our commitment to use taxpayer dollars wisely."
Some lawmakers and municipal officials said they had expected the Governor to offer more direct relief for property taxpayers. Voter anger over paying the highest property taxes and automobile insurance rates in the nation nearly cost Mrs. Whitman re-election to a second term last fall.
William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the League of Municipalities, said mayors would now bring their case for property tax relief to state lawmakers who can be counted on to make some changes to the Governor's proposed budget before it is adopted on June 30.
"Without having additional monies for direct property tax relief, taxes are going to rise and municipal officials are going to take the heat for that," Mr. Dressel said. "We need broad-based property tax relief. We've got to take a look at the budget and see where we can find money for that purpose."
Mrs. Whitman insisted that her new spending plan would help reduce the burden on homeowners because it provides more state aid for municipalities and school districts. She said it also included $90 million in savings for county governments as part of the continued effort by the state to take over the cost of running the county court system. And she noted that her budget includes $83 million more for the next phase of a two-year-old program that allows taxpayers to deduct part of their property tax bill from their state income taxes.
But state aid for municipalities would rise only slightly under her proposed budget, and most of the $540 million spending increase for public schools would cover teacher pension costs. That would leave about $200 million for other school expenses to be divided among the state's 594 school districts.
The State Senate minority leader, Richard J. Codey, a Democrat from Essex County, said, "Once again, Governor Whitman failed to connect with the people's major tax concern -- the highest property tax rates in the nation."
Mr. Codey dismissed Mrs. Whitman's attempt to count as "property tax relief" her recommendation to increase spending by $50 million to help local governments preserve farmland and other open space and $25 million to help cities reclaim vacant buildings. The Governor said last month in her inaugural address that she was committed to preserving 300,000 acres of open space during her second term and helping to revive urban neighborhoods by turning abandoned buildings into affordable housing.
Republican legislative leaders, who control both houses of the Legislature, praised the Governor's plan.
"It is a very good budget, one that will be strongly supported by the Legislature," said the Senate President, Donald T. DiFrancesco.
Mrs. Whitman proposed to increase spending by $61 million to the state's community colleges and state universities. Other spending increases include $29 million for New Jersey Transit to avoid bus and transit fare increases this year, and $15 million to build bicycle paths throughout the state. She proposed only modest budget cuts in various state agencies. About 610 jobs would be eliminated through attrition out of a state work force of 62,239.
Total spending under Mrs. Whitman's budget would rise about $1 billion, a 5.4 percent increase over this year's budget. The average annual increase of her last four budgets was about 1.8 percent.
Although Governor Whitman and the Legislature are better known for cutting taxes than raising them, she called upon legislators to support her new proposal that would make it more difficult for lawmakers to raise taxes in the future. The constitutional amendment that she proposed would require a two-thirds majority in each house of the Legislature for tax increases to be approved.
"Like you, I don't have much experience raising taxes," Mrs. Whitman said. "I like to cut them. But I do believe that it's too easy to increase taxes in New Jersey, and we should do something about it."
The Assembly Speaker, Jack Collins, a Republican from Salem County, did not embrace the Governor's proposal. "That is something that deserves a great deal of thought," he said. "I am pretty comfortable with the way government exists in the United States and in the state of New Jersey."
Thirteen other states require "super-majorities" to raise taxes. The Whitman plan would require an amendment to the New Jersey Constitution. Amendments to the Constitution require that three-fifths of the members of both houses approve the amendment in two consecutive years. Then, the proposal would be put to the public for a vote, and enacted if approved by a majority of voters.
The Governor did not include $312 million in her proposed spending plan that a judge recommended last month the state should spend in urban school districts for programs that ranged from preschool classes to psychological counseling for high school students. The New Jersey Supreme Court will decide whether to require the extra spending by the state.
Last year, the State Supreme Court ordered New Jersey to come up with $246 million more in extra aid for 28 urban school districts as part of the 28-year court battle over spending inequities between the state's financially needy and wealthy districts. The Whitman administration and the Legislature added that money in last year's state budget.
But Mrs. Whitman strongly argued in her budget address today against the judge's recommendation that the state spend an additional $312 million on urban schools. She said existing state programs were already meeting some of the needs outlined by the state judge.
"This Legislature and this Governor know what our jobs are and we know how to do them," she said. "Schools shouldn't have the primary responsibility for solving every social problem. They're not prepared to, and frankly, that's not their mission. But together, we can, and we are, making a difference. Let's give these programs time to work."
The Governor also announced today plans to turn the State Commerce Department into an independent commission, creating a new public-private partnership. The commission's board of directors would include members from the private sector whose perspective, Mrs. Whitman said, is critical for directing state economic development policy.

HEADLINE: SHARE OF WEALTH IN STOCK HOLDINGS HITS 50-YEAR HIGH

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
After three years of rapidly rising stock prices, American households have more of their assets invested in the stock market than at any time in the last 50 years -- and perhaps ever.
Even that most prized possession, the home, has fallen behind stocks for the first time in three decades. 
 An analysis by The New York Times of data compiled by the Federal Reserve shows that stock investments made up 28 percent of American household wealth -- a measure that includes houses, cars and other tangible assets as well as financial assets. The figures are for the end of September, the most recent period available. And stocks accounted for 43 percent of financial assets, which include bank accounts, mutual funds and securities.
Both those stock allocation numbers have more than doubled since 1990, when the latest run of the bull market began.
The implications of this profound growth in stock exposure are many. The size of their paychecks aside, many Americans are feeling richer as the value of their stock holdings rises. Stocks surged again yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rising to a record. Page D1.
But with so much in stocks, a sharp market decline could seriously erode the financial well-being of Americans, even if their money is largely tied up in long-term retirement plans. In years past, the biggest asset of most Americans was the home. Where skyrocketing real estate prices once provided reassurance to the middle class, soaring stock portfolios now do. And stock prices are subject to much wider short-term swings than home values.
The extra wealth from stock portfolios has also encouraged Americans to spend more and save less. The Commerce Department reported last week that the rate of saving fell last year to 3.8 percent of disposable income, the lowest level in 58 years and less than half its postwar peak of 9.5 percent, set in 1974.
What Americans do set aside for saving, they increasingly allocate to stocks, rather than to more conservative investments. That heightened allotment accounts for about a third of the increase in stocks' share of wealth, with the other two-thirds coming from the rise in share prices.
The increased shift into stocks comes as stocks have been gaining 30 percent annually the last three years. "It's been jammed down their throats that they have to put their money in equities if they want anything left for retirement," said Melissa R. Brown, a stock market analyst at Prudential Securities.
But if stocks fail to continue to provide such large returns, Americans might find their assumptions about saving for retirement or college expenses fundamentally altered. Historically, gains on stocks have averaged 8 percent a year.
Concerns about how investors with bulging equity portfolios will react to a steep or prolonged downturn in stock prices have plagued Wall Street for several years. To allay fears of a panic, Wall Street analysts have often said that the average American's exposure to stocks is no greater than it was 30 years ago. But that estimate does not take into account many investment products that are gaining in popularity.
The long bull market has given few clues about what individuals will do. Last October, a sharp decline in stock prices caused many individual investors to pour new money into stocks. In contrast, institutional investors were heavy sellers.
Still, the last time Americans had their faith in stocks truly tested was the stock market crash of 1987. Then, stocks accounted for only 13 percent of household assets -- half as much as today -- and Americans had more money in their savings and checking accounts than in stocks.
"Individuals certainly are taking more risk today than they were taking five years ago," said Scott L. Lummer, chief investment officer of 401(k) Forum Inc., which sells investment advice on line. "A lot of that is for good reasons.
"But there is a growing set of the populace that looks at the last three years of returns and says, 'The market goes up 30 percent a year.' I'm not sure those people really understand the risks involved in stocks. They may have a lot more money in equities than they should."
How much is enough depends on who is talking. Wall Street professionals usually put the ideal portion of stocks at about 60 percent of one's financial assets. Some individuals go much further.
Don Matsanoff, a 36-year-old commercial real estate agent in Columbus, Ohio, believes he did not have enough money invested in stocks at the beginning of the 1990's. Less than half of his financial assets were in equities. By the end of last year, Mr. Matsanoff had raised that portion to more than 80 percent. To him, that is still not enough.
"With the returns I've seen in the market over the past few years, I'm putting a considerable percentage of the income I'm making at work back into the market," he said. "I'm confident that it will continue to grow."
With mutual fund managers commanding sports-star salaries and investment shows on the airwaves, the man on the street may accept the news about rapid growth in stock ownership without flinching. But some of Wall Street's leading gurus have insisted that stock investments have not reached a new peak.
For example, Abby Joseph Cohen, the stock market strategist at Goldman, Sachs and one of the leading bulls on Wall Street, has noted that Americans have been increasing their stock investments in recent years as inflation has waned and as baby boomers save more for retirement. But, she says, the percentage of their financial assets in stocks "remains well below the levels of the late 1960's."
She and other Wall Street analysts have reached such conclusions by focusing only on holdings of individual stocks and stocks through mutual funds. Other categories of stock ownership, however, have grown steeply. At the end of 1996, employee-controlled plans accounted for half of the $3 trillion in corporate pension plans, according to the Federal Reserve, up from a quarter of the total when the 1980's began.
In those plans, the employee, rather than a professional pension fund manager, decides how to invest -- in stocks, bonds or other assets. The same is true for variable annuities, which essentially combine the tax deferral of an insurance policy with a mutual fund, and other types of variable life insurance products, with returns based on market performance. Sales of those products have skyrocketed in recent years.
Even the Fed's key person on the issue says that these investment products should be included in any study of household assets. "That's what we do when we look at the data," said Albert M. Teplin, chief of the Federal Reserve section that collects and publishes the numbers. "I'm not sure why Wall Street does not seem to do that."
Mr. Teplin concludes that the portion of total household assets in stocks is much bigger than it was in the 1960's.
The Wall Street analysts who monitor the Fed data say they have not tried to add up all the indirect and direct stock holdings of households because the data are notoriously soft. "Even if the data were clear," Ms. Cohen of Goldman, Sachs said, "I think that we still would come up with the same conclusion," that current stock holdings do not surpass those in the late 1960's.
The analysis by The Times shows that when all indirect stock holdings are included, stocks account for 43 percent of household financial assets, up from 39 percent in 1968, and 28 percent of total household assets, up from 26 percent in 1968.
 The numbers are higher than at any time since the end of World War II. But because the Fed data extend only to 1945, comparisons with earlier periods are difficult.
The shift has, nonetheless, been clear over the last 50 years. Americans emerged from World War II with only 27 percent of their assets in real estate, durable goods and other tangible assets. As they added homes, cars, refrigerators and other goods in the postwar boom, those assets soared to 37 percent of the total in 1955.
Tangible goods soared again in the 1970's, exceeding 45 percent of household assets by the end of the decade. Those increases came as the value of most financial assets fell victim to runaway inflation and rising interest rates. Because real estate investments are often made with borrowed money, their value can also swing widely when market conditions change. By last year, tangible assets had fallen back to 35 percent of total household assets.
Similarly, the portion invested in stocks rose from 15 percent at the end of World War II to nearly 26 percent in 1968.
The late 1960's "was a very similar environment to what we see today," said Ms. Brown, the Prudential analyst. "It was another period of very low inflation, stable-to-declining interest rates and decent corporate profits. We had a good market, the economy was in good shape and unemployment was low."
In short, there was no place other than stocks to put your money if you wanted to earn any return at all, said H. Bradlee Perry, former chairman of and now a consultant to David L. Babson & Company, the Cambridge, Mass., manager of the Babson mutual funds. "There were no bond mutual funds at the time, and the money market fund was just coming onto the scene," Mr. Perry said.
Few people who were around on Wall Street in 1968 need to be reminded what lay ahead. The market lost nearly one-third of its value over the next 18 months, and by the end of 1970, stocks had fallen to 20 percent of household assets from 26 percent two years earlier. As it turned out, stocks were just warming up for a lengthy bear market.

HEADLINE: MOTHER OF INTERN MAKES APPEARANCE BEFORE GRAND JURY

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 10

 BODY:
After hearing for months about her daughter's relationship with President Clinton, the mother of Monica S. Lewinsky, Marcia Lewis, was summoned today before a Federal grand jury.
While Ms. Lewis would not discuss her testimony when she left the jury room, the office of the Whitewater independent counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, has tape recordings in which Ms. Lewinsky tells a friend, Linda R. Tripp, that she consulted her mother about an affair she said she had with Mr. Clinton, said lawyers who have listened to the tapes. 
 The two-hour appearance of Ms. Lewis marked an important moment in her daughter's fast-moving story; the two are said to be so close that she could provide the first hint of what Ms. Lewinsky might say in her own testimony about her relationship with the President.
While Ms. Lewis is scheduled to return to the grand jury here to continue her testimony on Wednesday, her daughter's lawyer, William H. Ginsburg, suggested that Ms. Lewinsky would also testify -- and not invoke her Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination -- if prosecutors obtain a court order forcing her to do so.
"She will not defy either a Federal court order or a subpoena," Mr. Ginsburg told reporters in Los Angeles. "And she will do what she has to do, given the situation she finds herself in. She will not go to jail like Susan McDougal. She has no intention of falling on her sword."
Mrs. McDougal, a onetime business partner of Mr. Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, has been in jail since September 1996 for refusing to testify, despite a grant of immunity, in the Whitewater investigation.
Mr. Ginsburg also said that Ms. Lewinsky, who is expected to appear before the grand jury perhaps late this week, was "absolutely mortified" to have her family engulfed in the investigation.
By leaning on the 24-year-old former White House intern and her family, Mr. Starr could succeed in gaining evidence to build a case that the President had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it under oath.
But Mr. Starr's strategy may carry a political cost: It could play into the White House campaign to portray the independent counselor as excessively zealous. And it could draw public sympathy for Ms. Lewinsky, who has been depicted by some as a young woman of uncertain reliability, and by others as a victim.
Ms. Lewis, 49, who lives in Manhattan but shares an apartment in the Watergate complex here with her daughter, battled her own subpoena but was ordered to testify by Judge Norma H. Johnson of Federal District Court here. Ms. Lewis appeared eager to speak, but as they left the courthouse her lawyer, Billy Martin, interceded at every reporter's question.
"Part of what she's feeling is a lot of pain for what her daughter is going through in this ordeal," Mr. Martin said. "She'd like not to be here at all."
R. Peter Straus, an owner of newspapers and radio stations in New York who is engaged to Ms. Lewis, said she disliked drawing such attention. "This, clearly, is not her favorite sport, being in the public," he said in a telephone interview. "She is concerned about her daughter being under pressure. She's a very good mother and very close to her daughter. This is very tough on both of them."
Nancy V. Hernreich, Mr. Clinton's longtime personal assistant in Arkansas and Washington and supervisor of daily operations in the Oval Office, has also been subpoenaed to testify, said officials familiar with the investigation. She is the latest in a series of current or former White House staff members who have been subpoenaed.
But today, Ms. Lewis was in a position to offer a different -- and perhaps more complete -- perspective: through a connection, Ms. Lewis helped her daughter get a White House internship in the first place. And on that fateful day last month when Ms. Lewinsky was approached by Federal agents, the first person she asked for was her mother, who took a train from New York to Washington to be by her side.
Ms. Lewis's testimony may also be pivotal because people familiar with tapes that Ms. Tripp secretly made of conversations with Ms. Lewinsky said the tapes suggest that Ms. Lewis was behind efforts to prevent her daughter from giving testimony or from turning over to investigators gifts reportedly exchanged between Ms. Lewinsky and the President.
In another development, a Federal judge in Little Rock, Ark., today rejected a request by the President's lawyers to move up the date of Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit against Mr. Clinton. The President's lawyers had argued that the White House was being overwhelmed by inaccurate news reports that could prejudice a trial.
But the judge, Susan Webber Wright, said she would hold to the scheduled starting date of May 27. "The court, notwithstanding the President's admittedly valid concerns about the current state of journalism, determines that the previously set trial date should at this time remain in place," she said.
The date of the Jones trial has become less important since Judge Wright ruled that no evidence concerning Ms. Lewinsky could be introduced because it would interfere with Mr. Starr's investigation. Ms. Jones's lawyers have appealed that ruling.
Mr. Clinton's lawyers filed papers in Arkansas today, opposing a petition to unseal the President's deposition in the Jones case. The lawyers argued that its release would disrupt the Presidency and prevent a fair trial.
"The interest of having the President carry out his official duties without undue disruption also could be impeded," the papers said, "by requiring the Presidency to divert significant time and effort away from running the country in order to defend himself against unfounded accusations and gossip related only tangentially to this case."
In keeping with the effort to play down the scandal, Mr. Clinton ignored questions about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky when he appeared before reporters today to talk about the economy and Iraq. The President was concentrating on his job, "where he believes the American people want his focus to be," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House spokesman.
No ordinary mother, Ms. Lewis seemed drawn to a glitzy life style. In 1996 she published a book about the private lives of three opera stars. In a blurb that she wrote promoting the book, she described herself as "a glamorous Beverly Hills writer." Her name is actually Marcia K. Lewinsky; Lewis is a pen name.
"She did this book on the three tenors and the paperback came out fairly recently, and I've been pressing her for three months to have her picture taken for the back of the paperback," Mr. Straus said. "She is the least public person that I've ever known -- and unsuccessfully."
Again and again, Ms. Lewis's name pops up in important moments in the case. Mr. Straus recalled that at one point Ms. Lewis asked Evelyn Lieberman, the former White House deputy chief of staff, about her daughter's transfer from the White House to the Pentagon, a move that Ms. Lewinsky had objected to.
Mrs. Lewis approached Ms. Lieberman at a reception of the Voice of America three months before the scandal erupted. Mrs. Lieberman was then director of the Voice of America.
Mr. Straus said that because of the inquiry, he believes the telephone in his apartment overlooking Central Park has been tapped.
"I'm pretty sure it is," he said. "I've lived here for 15 years and the phone has worked gloriously, until a week ago -- and all of a sudden the phones went out completely. If they're going to tap, they probably should do it a little more discreetly."

Re "A Matter of American Leadership" (editorial, Feb. 5): The economic turmoil in Asia seems to me a great opportunity for the World Bank to try out its new dedication to ecologically as well as economically sound development principles. Southeast Asia has a horrendous record of deforestation and habitat destruction, and the profits resulting from those actions have not gone to local people but have lined the oligarchs' pockets. 
 Part of the condition of the bailout should be insistence on ecologically sustainable resource management. "Debt for nature" swaps could be incorporated into the aid package, and other ecologic incentives and requirements put into place. This would have the additional benefit of requiring American companies to comply with the same environmental safeguards they operate under in the United States.

HEADLINE: Should I.M.F. Get Still More of Our Money?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "A Matter of American Leadership" (editorial, Feb. 5): The International Monetary Fund has assisted Mexico several times since the 1980's. The fund has had difficulty securing Russia's adherence to previous promises, yet the I.M.F. is now reportedly preparing to sink another $700 million into that country. 
 The World Bank is spending $22.3 million to help a French company build a Hilton hotel in Sofia, Bulgaria, and $41 million to build a Hilton in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. It has recently agreed to send $17 million to the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia.
The International Monetary Fund already holds unpaid debts inherited from deadbeat dictatorships like Mobutu Sese Seko's Zaire, Slobodan Milosevic's Yugoslavia and Saddam Hussein's Iraq. Now the fund is planning to spend billions of dollars to bail out the Suharto regime in Indonesia.
Good loans will always be generated by the private sector. Bad loans require the high-level arm-twisting we are seeing in Washington today. For Congress to finance the monetary fund any further, as you suggest, would be throwing good money after bad.

Magic Johnson Eyes Site

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
After his plans for movie houses in Harlem and Queens fell through, Magic Johnson, the retired basketball star, has turned to a long-closed Brooklyn theater as the possible site for his first New York City cineplex.
Ken Lombard, president of Magic Johnson Enterprises of Los Angeles, said the company is hoping to develop the historic Loews Kings Theater on Flatbush Avenue, which was recently put up for bid by the city. 
 "That's the site that is currently under review," Mr. Lombard said. "We're still in the early stages on the Brooklyn thing."
Mr. Johnson's company, in partnership with Sony, has developed movie complexes in Los Angeles, Atlanta and Houston.
The company had earlier looked at locations on Harlem's 125th Street and in Jamaica, Queens.
Mr. Johnson's company is one of several that have expressed interest in the Brooklyn location. Charles Millard, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said a decision would be made within a few months.

HEADLINE: Ron Brown Scholarships Open Doors For Blacks

BYLINE: By IAN ZACK 

DATELINE: CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Feb. 10

 BODY:
Entering its second year, the Ron Brown Scholar Program has quickly emerged as the nation's most lucrative scholarship for black students -- and one of the most important.
The other day, the modest office here of the scholarship director, Michael Mallory, was inundated with envelopes. Big Manila ones and small white ones were stacked perilously on desks, piled on the carpeted floor and crammed into gray plastic postal crates. "This is incredible," Mr. Mallory gloated. "I am seeing the best black kids in the country." 
 The program was established in honor of Mr. Brown after he was killed in April 1996 in a plane crash in Croatia while he was Commerce Secretary. Recipients receive $40,000 toward an undergraduate degree.
Mr. Mallory, a 40-year-old former admissions officer for the University of Virginia, is working to select the next group, sorting through the records of more than 4,000 black high school seniors around the United States to whittle the contenders to about 500. A selection committee will narrow the list to 60 semifinalists and then 20 finalists, who will compete next month in a three-day series of interviews and seminars.
Last year, the finalists were so impressive that the selection committee, which conducted interviews at the Washington offices of the Patton & Boggs law firm, decided to award scholarships to all 20, instead of narrowing the field to 10 winners.
The scholarships are financed by the CAP Foundation, a philanthropic organization in Charlottesville that was started by the multimillionaire Anthony M. Pilaro, who earned part of his fortune in the duty-free goods industry.
Profiles of the first-year recipients reveal a great variety of circumstances: Family incomes range from a high of $101,000 to a low (in three cases) of zero. Six of the scholars come from single-parent families. One, whose father is an economist and whose mother is an intelligence officer, scored a perfect 1600 on her S.A.T.'s; another, whose mother died of drug-related health problems and whose father is in jail, finished third in her high school class with a 3.8 grade point average.
The students are finishing their freshman years at colleges that include Harvard, Princeton, Brown, Stanford, Virginia, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania.
"These groups of young people that we're talking about here can be considered a beacon," said Dennis Hightower, a member of the selection panel who is a former president of Disney's television and telecommunications division and now teaches at Harvard Business School. "Here is an example of unbridled ability. We have got to find more of our youngsters like this across all racial lines if we are going to be the world leader we expect ourselves to be."
The Ron Brown scholars are expected to serve the community during summer internships and after college, a task that Yolanda Covington, an 18-year-old freshman at Brown University, said she relishes.
"So many people, they make it, they make money and they keep on going," said Ms. Covington, who grew up one of five children of a single mother on welfare in the Morrisania housing projects in the Bronx. "They forget about everyone who helped them."
Ms. Covington, who went to Strath Haven High School in Swarthmore, Pa., at no cost to her family through a program called "A Better Chance," plans to become a doctor.
"I still want to become a doctor and a successful one at that, but I want to open up a practice, probably in an African-American community," said Ms. Covington, who noted: "There's still a lot of distrust in the African-American community of hospitals."
Michael Billings, a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, has come a long way since he ran away from his home in Salt Lake City at age 13. He left to escape his unemployed mother's drinking shortly after the man who lived with her died of drug-related causes in the family's sparsely furnished living room.
After living in a park for part of that summer, Mr. Billings was taken in by friends, whose families sent him to a private school, where he earned a 4.0 high school grade point average.
"Ever since I was in the sixth grade, I knew I was going to go to college and I knew the only way I was going to be able to afford to pay for college was to get a scholarship, so I had to do well," said Mr. Billings, 19. "I decided that I didn't want to live with my mom because I didn't think she was going to take care of her problems. I didn't care if I was on the street."
"Education really opens incredible doors for you," Mr. Billings added. "People have really been willing to help me."

On the Set at TV News, Don't Believe Your Eyes

BYLINE: By Andrea Codrington 

 BODY:
IT is Friday night, and Steve Aveson, an anchor on the Discovery Channel's "Discovery News," is seated at a wood-topped desk. Behind him is a familiar landscape: a cluster of monitors, a world map.
Variations on this standard broadcast news interior are beamed into American homes daily by national networks and local stations alike. But there's something different about this particular set: it doesn't exist in real life. Mr. Aveson is actually sitting in front of a blue grid. Every interior design element on Discovery News, except Mr. Aveson's desk, is virtual -- from the Art Deco-reminiscent columns to the mission control light overhead. 
 This is a revolution, and it will be televised. Discovery is not alone in its use of virtual-reality broadcast sets. ABC, which co-produces "Discovery News," ran its entire 1996 election broadcast from a virtual set. Barbara Walters recently hosted an "ABC News Saturday Night" program on Ronald Reagan against a wholly illusory backdrop. (Both "Discovery News" and "ABC News Saturday Night" sets were conceived in-house.) And WCBS-TV in New York has just generated a virtual set for its 11 P.M. newscasts.
"Discovery News" has disclosed its virtual status to viewers since the beginning. It's only fair, since Dan Devlin, the creative director of Devlin Design Group, a San Diego company that designs broadcast sets, says that virtual sets can pass for real. "The viewing audience at home should not be able to tell," he said. "That's the key to good design."
If you've ever noticed a news set that features decoratively painted walls in mottled colors, there's a good chance you've seen Mr. Devlin's work. Devlin Design Group has won Emmy Awards over the last nine years for real sets that bring visual excitement to news programming.
Rather than view virtual design as the demise of his industry, Mr. Devlin is one of the first well-known set specialists to expand his business to accommodate it. In partnership with Orad, an Israeli technology company that is a world leader in virtual reality, Devlin Design Group has announced a new service called Soft Set. "I can do a a Soft Set that looks three-stories tall in an actual room that is only 18-feet high," Mr. Devlin said. Stations interested in going virtual can pick from the Devlin library of more than 500 designs, which are then customized for news, sports, weather or interview settings.
"Now, a set can arrive via Federal Express on a CD-ROM," Mr. Devlin said. Soft Set clients include Florida's News Channel, a 24-hour news service that will begin all-virtual newscasts in July, and WVUE in New Orleans.
Because of the technology involved -- the entire system runs on high-powered Silicon Graphics computers -- a Soft Set is as expensive as a traditional set (a few hundred thousand dollars and up). But considering that it takes three to six months to design and install a real set, which remains fresh looking for two and a half years at most, the long-term economic advantages of virtual reality are considerable.
Successful virtual sets tend not to be surreal landscapes that distract the viewer's attention from the news, which itself can seem surreal. Globes spinning in space and anchors floating in midair are out; real-world architectural fittings and design details are in.
But with virtual reality, perceptual trickery is what is being sold, which may seem strange given that news sets are intended to evoke believability. Is there anything philosophically wrong with doing a news program about concrete reality from a set that does not exist?
Bob Reid, co-executive producer of Discovery News, thinks not -- "as long as you are not deceiving your audience in an unfair way."
"The set is not the program," he said. "It is designed to support the program."

HEADLINE: Julian Simon, 65, Optimistic Economist, Dies

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Julian L. Simon, an economist and professor who spent much of his professional life taking on scientists, demographers and other academics who argued that mankind was stretching the resources of the earth to the breaking point, died at his home in Chevy Chase, Md., on Sunday.
The cause of death was a heart attack, his son, David, said. Mr. Simon was 65. 
 At the time of his death, Mr. Simon was a professor of business administration at the University of Maryland and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington research organization. And his views, generally optimistic about the benefits humans bring to the planet and about man's prospects for the future, were widely debated.
The essence of Mr. Simon's view of man and the future is contained in two predictions for the next century and any century thereafter that are in "The State of Humanity," a book he edited for the Cato Institute.
"First," he wrote, "humanity's condition will improve in just about every material way. Second, humans will continue to sit around complaining about everything getting worse."
He argued that mankind would rise to any challenges and problems by devising new technologies to not only cope, but thrive. "Whatever the rate of population growth is, historically it has been that the food supply increases at least as fast, if not faster," he said in a profile published in Wired magazine last year.
Mr. Simon's views were widely contested by a large coterie of the academic and scientific community, many of whose members believe that more people create more problems, straining the earth and its resources in the process.
"Most biologists and ecologists look at population growth in terms of the carrying capacity of natural systems," said Lester R. Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute in Washington. "Julian was not handicapped by being either. As an economist, he could see population growth in a much more optimistic light."
In 1980, for example, Mr. Simon and Herman Kahn, the futurist, headed a panel organized by the conservative Heritage Foundation that took sharp issue with findings of the Global 2000 Report, a study issued by the Carter Administration.
Among other things, the report said that "if present trends continue, the world in 2000 will be more crowded, more polluted, less stable ecologically and more vulnerable to disruption than the world we live in now."
At the time Mr. Simon was an economics professor at the University of Illinois. But he had been researching and writing about the positive effects of population growth since 1965, when he saw a headline in The New York Times warning of a population doomsday.
"Fortunately for this planet," Mr. Simon said in response to the Global 2000 Report, "these gloomy assertions about resources and environment are baseless."
Mr. Simon's sunny view of the future became the basis for a highly publicized bet in 1980 with Paul R. Ehrlich, the Stanford University ecologist whose 1968 book, "The Population Bomb," predicted that one-fifth of humanity would starve to death by 1985.
Mr. Ehrlich and two colleagues from the University of California at Berkeley were piqued by an article Mr. Simon wrote for Science magazine titled "Resources, Population, Environment: An Oversupply of False Bad News." They responded to a challenge by Mr. Simon to Malthusians that the price of any natural resource would be lower by a mutually agreed-upon date, not higher.
Mr. Ehrlich and his colleagues took the bet on the belief that rising demand for raw materials by an exploding global populace would pare supplies of nonrenewable resources, driving up prices. Mr. Ehrlich said he had accepted Mr. Simon's "astonishing offer before other greedy people jump in."
The Ehrlich group bet $1,000 on five metals -- chrome, copper, nickel, tin and tungsten -- in quantities that each cost $200 in October 1980, when the bet was made. Mr. Simon agreed that he would sell the agreed-upon quantities of the metals to the Ehrlich group 10 years later at 1980 prices. If the combined prices of acquiring the metals in 1990 turned out to be higher than $1,000, Mr. Simon would pay the difference in cash. If prices fell, the Ehrlich group would pay him.
During the decade, the world's population grew by more than 800 million, the greatest increase in history, and the store of metals did not get any larger. Yet in the fall of 1990, with the prices of the metals down sharply, Mr. Ehrlich mailed Mr. Simon a check for $576.07.
Mr. Simon wrote back a thank you note, along with a challenge to raise the wager to as much as $20,000, tied to any other resources and to any other year in the future. Mr. Ehrlich declined to take him up on the new offer.
Born in Newark, Mr. Simon studied psychology as an undergraduate at Harvard University, then earned an M.B.A. and a doctorate in business economics at the University of Chicago. He joined the faculty at the University of Illinois in 1963.
Much of his early work was in mail order marketing -- his book on the topic, "How to Start and Operate a Mail Order Business," sold more books than any he wrote subsequently. But his attention turned to population questions after he heard the grim predictions about an overpopulated planet.
Despite his optimism about the future of mankind, Mr. Simon was given to personal bouts of depression. As a form of therapy he wrote a book on the subject, "Good Mood: The New Psychology for Overcoming Depression."
An active lecturer, Mr. Simon's view of the world and man's possibilities never wavered.
"He believed that the world needs problems because they make us better," said Robert L. Bradley Jr., president of the Institute for Energy Research in Houston. "Problems make us better off than if they had never occurred."
Mr. Simon is survived by his wife, Rita James Simon of Chevy Chase; three children, David M. Simon of Chicago, Judith Simon Garret of Vienna, Va., and Daniel H. Simon of Laurel, Md., and one grandchild.

Treasury Prices Rally on Inflation Outlook

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rallied sharply yesterday and pushed long-term yields to the lowest level this month on optimism about mild inflation and good demand for new Government securities at the quarterly refunding auction.
The healthy appetite for the $12 billion in 10-year notes sold yesterday by the Treasury, the second stage of the three-day refunding auction this week, forced traders who had bet on price declines and a weaker auction to buy bonds instead to minimize their losses, raising prices even further in what is known as a short-covering rally. 
 The 30-year bond surged 1 3/32, to a price of 103 30/32, while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.84 percent, from 5.92 percent on Tuesday. The average yield at the 10-year auction was 5.558 percent, better than expected. The number of bids compared with the total amount of debt sold, a measure of demand, was also stronger than the average in the last 12 auctions.
Demand also was healthy for the Government sale of $13 billion in three-year notes Tuesday, the first stage of the auction.
The quarterly sale of new Government debt is often viewed as a signpost for the direction of interest rates and investor sentiment about inflation, which erodes the value of investments that pay at a fixed rate of return.
Optimism that inflation will remain benign has grown in recent months, partly because Asia's economic crisis is expected to help restrain costs in this country. In addition, the prospect of Government budget surpluses and diminished Government borrowing in coming years has increased the attractiveness of existing bonds.
Traders said a more revealing test of investor sentiment about inflation will come today when the Government sells $10 billion in 30-year bonds, the last stage of the auction. It coincides with the Government's release of January retail sales data, which will be scrutinized for inflationary signs of increased consumer demand. Long-term maturities tend to react more sensitively to signs that inflation may accelerate.
"There is no question that the economy is in good shape, but a strong retail number on Thursday, one that is stronger than the Street is willing to tolerate, could impact the 30-year auction negatively," said Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed income for J. W. Charles Securities Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla. Analysts generally are expecting the Commerce Department to report a retail-sales gain of three-tenths of a percent for January, and five-tenths of a percent excluding automotive sales.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new 10-year notes:

HEADLINE: Gingrich Calls for Hearings on I.M.F.'s Role

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
Representative Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House, called today for a series of Congressional hearings into the International Monetary Fund to determine whether it is an institution that had "outlived its usefulness."
The Clinton Administration has been pressing Congress to approve $18 billion for the world body to bolster its reserves in the wake of the Asia financial crisis. But Mr. Gingrich said the request had to be "carefully looked at." 
 He cited recent criticisms from former government officials and economists, contending that the I.M.F. interferes with the workings of the free market. A raft of economists have also been highly critical of the fund's actions in Asia, arguing that it has bailed out the large lenders, mostly big banks, and imposed austerity rules that have placed the greatest burden on the working poor.
Mr. Gingrich called for "very significant hearings this spring" into the role of the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Dow Hits a High Again, but Not All Blue Chips Are Joining in the Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average is back, finally regaining all the ground lost since its August peak and the October market plunge. But the news is not good for all the big names in this marquee stock measure, even though it inched to a second consecutive record yesterday.
Among the Dow's 30 stocks, 17 are still below their Aug. 6 levels, led by Sears, Roebuck, down almost 19 percent. The other laggards include International Paper, the Boeing Company, Union Carbide, Aluminum Company of America and Caterpillar Inc. 
 This performance, excluding the separate problems with credit cards and sluggish sales at Sears, partly reflects the big hit that America's commodity, industrial and manufacturing companies have taken because of the concern about the earnings fallout from the economic turmoil in Asia. That is what set off the 554.26 point, or 7.2 percent, plunge in the Dow on Oct. 27.
On the other hand, the leaders are drug and consumer product companies, like Merck, Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson, the kinds of companies that are resilient because of steady consumer need for their products. Many investors saw them as defensive investments against the Asian fallout.
Walt Disney, the No. 2 performer since August, is riding strong results from its theme parks and ESPN and beat expectations for its earnings for the last three months of 1997. AT&T, the best performer, with a jump of almost 58 percent since August, is a longtime underperformer that has rebounded with the promise of extensive layoffs and cost-cutting by the new chairman, C. Michael Armstrong.
It is how some of these stocks have performed recently, however, that still makes it difficult to read what investors think about the impact from Asia. In trading yesterday, the Dow rose 18.94 points, to 8,314.55, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks inched a point higher, to 1,020.01.
This year's performance of some of the laggards seems to indicate that sentiment about Asia may be changing. And the distance some of these stocks still must travel to reclaim their August levels may make them attractive buys and help propel the Dow further this year.
One of the better recent performers is Caterpillar, the largest maker of construction equipment. Its stock is up 5.9 percent for the year and 13 percent since fourth-quarter earnings announcements eased some of the concern about Asia.
The company apparently allayed a lot of concern with the report of an 18 percent jump in earnings. While Caterpillar warned of problems in Asia, especially in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines, that business makes up just 5 percent of its sales. To some analysts, it appeared that sales elsewhere would help offset this decline.
Applied Materials, the largest manufacturer of the machines that make computer chips, is another example -- although it is not in the Dow -- of a company with major Asian exposure that has had a jump this year, with its stock up 19 percent. Part of this bounce may be from investors picking up a "cheap" stock because they are betting that Applied Materials will climb higher after the Asian flu passes.
It reported better-than-expected earnings for the fourth quarter on Tuesday. But it warned that orders from Asia are falling, adding that first-quarter equipment orders are off 6 percent. Yet its stock rose Tuesday before the warnings and fell only 6.25 cents, to $35.9375 yesterday.
Jeffrey M. Applegate, the chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers, argues that the market is looking beyond Asia already. Referring to the hard-hit stocks like Caterpillar, he said, "The selloff was way overdone and the market is now looking over the valley."
While the strategy to minimize the impact of Asia would be to buy stocks that depend less on foreign sales, Mr. Applegate noted that the smaller-company stock indexes, like the Russell 2000, comprising companies that in aggregate have only 10 percent of their sales abroad, have not regained their former highs.
"What the market is telling you is counter to the conventional wisdom of going defensive and getting domestic stocks," he said.
Thomas McManus, an independent investment strategist, argues that a lot of these large multinational companies have brand names that will garner sales abroad even with a slowdown, a fact that was ignored in the initial selloffs caused by Asian concerns. That fact has helped make Coca-Cola one of the Dow's best performers since the October plunge.
But Boeing's performance seems to say that some investor concern remains. The aircraft manufacturer, which announced its first annual loss in 50 years last month, has continued to slump, with its stock down 5 percent so far this year. The acquisition of McDonnell Douglas and assembly line problems are part of the reason. But some analysts are also worried that the company is too optimistic about the loss of business from Asia and that has contributed to the stock's fall. For these reasons, Byron K. Callan, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, has lowered his 1998 earnings estimate for Boeing by 16 percent.
Some stocks that performed a little better than the laggards in the Dow's rebound also signal that worries still abound. J. P. Morgan has set aside $587 million to protect itself from potential losses on currency swaps with companies in South Korea, Thailand and Indonesia. And a South Korean court yesterday blocked the payment of $189 million that J. P. Morgan is owed by a South Korean bank. The stock is off 1.3 percent this year.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Graph: "Some Bluer Than Others"
The Dow Jones industrials closed yesterday only a few points above its previous record high set on Aug. 6, 1997. But the index conceals within it widely varied performances by the 30 blue-chip stocks that compose it. Graph tracks percentage changes since Aug. 6 close, plotted daily, for the Dow industrials, AT&T, Sears, Roebuck, along with the percentage change range of the other 28.

HEADLINE: THE SKI REPORT;
South Africans Feel at Home at New England Lift

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD 

DATELINE: WATERVILLE VALLEY, N.H.

 BODY:
Why would 20 South Africans, most of them in the their mid-20's, want to leave a Southern Hemisphere summer to stand day after freezing day at the base of a New England ski lift?
Because they are lift operators possessed of wanderlust who just want to soak up the ambiance of a small American ski town and feel as if they belong. 
 There is no call of the wild here, only a free season ski pass and a pay check just above minimum wage.
"I'm going to be doing this job until I'm too old to walk," Paul Kingaby, a 28-year-old photolithographer from Johannesburg, said. "I could keep coming back forever."
Hired by Waterville Valley for the winter season, the South Africans are traveling on temporary work visas arranged by the resort administration. The South Africans pay their own air fare -- about $2,000 round trip -- and $75 a week for housing.
It is a strong commitment for a
20-something adult with seemingly better things to do. But at a time of low unemployment in the United States, ski operators are glad to have the international alternative.
"It's good because I get a lot of employees all at once," said Joe Clark, supervisor of lift operations at Waterville. "Getting full-time help is hard here. The South Africans are good, and put across a good image. But there are no guarantees, no preferential treatment. If we have problems, they get the boot."
Many of the nation's 500 ski areas employ overseas help. Youths bent on adventure tend to roam the world looking for work in glamorous places. Ski resorts such as Heavenly, Nev., and Kirkwood, Calif., regularly employ a number of New Zealanders and Australians to help man their lift operations. But the oddity could begin to disappear as local job markets tighten.
"A lot of ski areas have a smattering of people on a seasonal basis from around the world," Michael Berry, president of the National Ski Areas Association, said recently from Lakewood, Colo. "But we're at a time where unemployment is low, so sometimes it's easier to bring in people with visas for seasonal jobs, particularly in rural, mountain areas."
At Waterville, the ski area has rented local condominiums for its workers. The South Africans say their apartments are spacious and pleasant. But that doesn't mean the job is akin to lifeguard duty at the Ritz.
Take a look at Kingaby's left boot, for example. A ragged piece of duct tape holds the sole onto the fur-lined upper. That's because a ski tip jammed into his foot one day as he was trying to help a novice skier onto a chairlift for four people. It is a lift operator's nightmare to think about the new six-packs: chairlifts that load six people at a time.
The operators call themselves lift rats, or lifties. But chairlift operators, especially those loading skiers and snowboarders onto a four-seat lift during busy weekend hours, need to be as fit as athletes. The South Africans, and the other 40 full- and part-time lift operators who work with them at Waterville, need to work quickly and safely.
Small children often have trouble getting into a moving chair. But it is the lift operator's job to keep the chair moving. So the lifties tend to pick up tiny tots by the scruff of their ski jackets, and plop them into a lift like startled puppies.
Adults aren't so pliable.
"Spend one day at our lift and see a thousand things happen," said Alan Wade, a 26-year-old South African architect in his second season at Waterville.
Better yet, put yourself in his place:
*A ski pole drops out of the skier's hand; go grab it before the chair gets out of range. Whoops, there goes the other pole. Run, you can get it back to the customer before he is out of range up the hill.
*Better get to that woman next. She has her back to the hill, ready to dust snow off the chair as it moves toward her like an earth mover.
*Is that 6-year-old as far off the front of his chair as he looks? His mother has got him by the arm. Ride it, lift rat; jump on the back of the chair and pull the kid into his seat. What? You're 15 feet off the snow, and on your way up the mountain? Jump lifty, jump. Watch your head.
*Oops. A skier's jacket is caught in the chair. Yank it free. He's yelling that it's your fault. Tell him you're sorry, lifty. But wait, that woman said thanks. Love this job. Love this place.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The I.M.F. must go, critics say, but who will cope with crises?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

 BODY:
DOES anybody like the International Monetary Fund? The half-century-old super-governmental agency has long been out of favor with the political right, which sees it as a usurper of sovereignty and the enemy of free markets. The left is no friendlier, condemning it as a collection agency for international bankers.
Strikingly, in the wake of the fund's ineffective performance in stemming the Asian crisis, members of the establishment have joined the hostile chorus. Joseph E. Stiglitz, the World Bank's chief economist, has taken some undiplomatic gibes at the I.M.F.'s one-size-fits-all approach to financial distress. In a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed article George P. Shultz, the former Secretary of State; William E. Simon, the former Secretary of the Treasury, and Walter B. Wriston, the former chairman of Citicorp, called the I.M.F. "ineffective, unnecessary and obsolete." And the Congressional Republican leadership, sensing an opportunity to trap President Clinton on the wrong side of the opinion polls, is piling on. 
 Hence Congress is unlikely to approve $18 billion in financial commitments to the embattled lender unless internal reform is put at the top of the I.M.F.'s agenda. And some changes, it is widely agreed, are overdue. But the big question remains: What, if anything, can be done to prepare the organization to cope with crises that pop up as unexpectedly as monsters in a Nintendo game?
The I.M.F. was created in 1944 to stabilize the economies of what was then a cozy clique of advanced capitalist countries dependent on America. The fund provided loans to defend the fixed exchange value of national currencies, typically in return for promises to fight inflation at home.
But the club with a big stake in international trade and investment grew beyond the industrial democracies. Adding to the confusion, Europe, America and Japan abandoned the fixed exchange rates that the agency had been formed to defend. And the I.M.F. struggled to carve out a new mission. Since the debt crises of the early 1980's the fund has been using its leverage as a lender of last resort to become ever more intimately involved in the micromanagement of poorly run less-developed economies from Pakistan to Peru.
This suited the rich economies because it distanced them from the unpleasant task of imposing austerity on profligate economies in search of aid. And it often suited the leaders of borrowing countries, who could blame faceless I.M.F. bureaucrats for everything from unemployment to increases in the price of bread.
A few academics, notably Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard, complained bitterly about the agency's inflexibility in demanding debt repayments from Latin America and Eastern Europe. And the remnants of the voodoo-economics crowd, now led by Steve Forbes, recently asserted that the I.M.F.'s enthusiasm for fiscal austerity and tolerance for currency devaluation was a recipe for disaster. But no one with the power to force reforms has seriously challenged the substance of I.M.F. policy or the fund's secretive, authoritarian style in overseeing more than half the world's economies.
That is about to change. In the wake of the I.M.F.'s failure to predict the crisis in Asia or resolve it promptly, the movers and shakers of international finance have distanced themselves from the fund. For example, a former Under Secretary of State, Richard N. Cooper, a man inclined to diplomatic understatement, now notes that the I.M.F. "has the disadvantages of any large organization: inertia, preoccupation with precedent, and encrusted with dated rules of thumb and modes of operation."
First among the demands of the I.M.F.'s newly empowered critics is an end to the secrecy that shrouds everything from routine country status reviews to emergency bailout plans. "If the Federal Reserve can publish the minutes of its deliberations, so can the I.M.F.," argued Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University.
Not far behind is a push to streamline the fund's decision-making, allowing managers to short-circuit the elaborate consultative procedures now in place so they can react to financial panic in days rather than weeks. "The organization just has to be able to move faster," Mr. Cooper said.
Seemingly everybody, moreover, wants the I.M.F. to exact a pound of flesh from private bank lenders, who have generally gotten most of their money back after the I.M.F. intervenes. "The $57 billion committed in Korea didn't help anybody but the banks," Mr. Sachs groused.
But only the most dogmatic free market ideologues think the increasingly integrated global economy can get by without a super-national organization to serve as financial watchdog, scold, mediator and lender of last resort. And hardly anybody who has been second-guessing the I.M.F. in recent months argues that the mom-and-apple-pie virtues of flexibility and accountability will provide the insight to make the world safe for global capitalism.
In the end, Mr. Kenen suggests, institutional reform can go only so far. "Good judgment, transparency and substantial resources are necessary," he argues, but they may not be sufficient.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Stays His Ruling On Long-Distance Service

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
A Federal judge in Texas yesterday temporarily stayed his year-end decision that invalidated major portions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
Yesterday's action keeps the telecommunications industry in the regulatory status it had before Dec. 31, when Judge Joe Kendall of the Federal District Court in Wichita Falls, Tex., ruled that local Bell telephone companies should be allowed to sell long-distance service without passing a rigorous review by the Federal Communications Commission. 
 That process was the cornerstone of the act, and in ruling the portions forcing the review unconstitutional, the judge threw into question the entire structure of telecommunications regulation in the United States.
Now, the Bells, which had hoped to offer long distance early this year, must abide by the language of the act until the judge's original decision is considered by courts of appeal -- a process that could take months or years.
The act says that the Bells, because of their history as part of the AT&T Corporation, must win special approvals from the F.C.C. before they may sell long-distance service. No Bell has won such approval.
Other large local phone companies, however, like the GTE Corporation, are allowed to enter the $80 billion long-distance market without passing such a rigorous review.
In December, Judge Kendall ruled that the act violated the Constitution by essentially convicting the Bells -- Ameritech, Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, SBC Communications and U S West -- of antitrust violations without a trial.
But yesterday the judge stayed the decision, pending appeal. The F.C.C. along with AT&T and the MCI Communications Corporation have petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, to hear the case.
Lawyers involved in the case said yesterday that they did not expect the appeals court to hear arguments in the dispute for at least a few months.
The lawyers also said that it was unusual that Judge Kendall did not explain his reason for granting the stay. The big long-distance companies had argued that they would suffer irreparably were the decision allowed to go into effect.
"The Bell monopolies must still comply with the requirements of the telecom act before they can enter the highly competitive long-distance market," MCI said in a statement.
"Obviously we're pleased that he granted the stay," added Peter Lucht, an MCI spokesman.
SBC Communications, the Bell that originally filed the lawsuit, played down yesterday's action. "The order granting the stay is not unusual," the company said in a statement. 'The appeals process will be resolved quickly, and we are confident that the ruling will be upheld."
Judge Kendall declined to issue an injunction specifically barring the Bells from selling long-distance service. But the stay essentially keeps the Bells out of the long-distance market for the time being.
Even as he granted the stay Judge Kendall stood by his original decision, which he said was important to maintain the separation of powers among the branches of the Federal Government.
"Despite all the noise, spin and reams of papers, legally this case isn't so much about Milt Friedman vs. Kenneth Galbraith as it is about James Madison," he wrote.
Mr. Friedman is a free-market economist, while John Kenneth Galbraith is an economist who generally sees a more positive role for Government intervention in the economy.

HEADLINE: Even as Economy Booms, More People Are Going Without Insurance

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

 BODY:
The number of people without medical insurance is rising far faster in New York State than in the rest of the country, a jump that has left nearly one in five New Yorkers under age 65 uninsured, several new studies show.
The increase has come despite a robust economy that has created hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the region. In fact, the new data suggest a dark side to New York's economic resurgence: many of the new jobs are in small, low-wage service or retail businesses, which because of the high cost have become less and less likely to offer their workers health benefits. 
 Moreover, one-third of the uninsured in New York are legal or illegal immigrants, who are more likely to take those same low-paying jobs, experts say.
The data also reveal a problem for politicians eager to move people on welfare into work. Most of the people without insurance in New York actually have jobs. In fact, people in low-paying jobs are more likely to be uninsured than people without jobs, who generally can qualify for Medicaid.
"This is not a crowd that is living at the margins of society," said James R. Tallon Jr., president of the United Hospital Fund, a private philanthropic and policy group. "This is a crowd that is playing by the rules but is finding that there is a different set of rules than in previous generations."
Health experts say they are especially alarmed by how quickly the number of uninsured is rising, even as the economy thrives. In 1991, about 2.2 million New Yorkers under age 65, or 13.9 percent, were uninsured, below the national average of 15.9 percent, according the census data analyzed by Mr. Tallon's group.
In 1996, the last year for which data are available, the number of uninsured New Yorkers had risen to 3.1 million, or 19.1 percent, creeping above the national average of 17.6 percent. In the past, health experts say, New Yorkers were more likely to be insured than people in other states because of several forces now largely in decline: powerful unions, manufacturing jobs in big companies that offered insurance and a healthy market for individual policies.
The problems are far greater in New York City, where 28 percent of the population under 65 was uninsured. At the same time, health insurance offered by employers has declined dramatically in the city, from covering 58.2 percent of all people insured in 1991, to 49.1 percent in 1996. Nationally, private health coverage dropped much less, from 72.2 percent in 1991 to 69.1 in 1996, according to the Hospital Fund study done by Kenneth E. Thorpe, a Tulane University professor and a former health official in the Clinton Administration.
Concern about the problem of the uninsured has been growing in recent months among a wide range of groups, from public policy organizations to advocates for poor people to the hospitals that would be hardest hit financially.
The uninsured in New York City rely largely on the 11 public hospitals, which have seen a sharp rise in the number of patients without insurance, according to a study released yesterday by the Commonwealth Fund, a large private philanthropic organization in New York. The city reports that in 1997, 20,458 people were admitted to public hospitals without insurance, up from 15,855 people two years before.
"We worry about this trend," said Dr. Luis R. Marcos, president of the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation. "For public hospitals to survive, we cannot simply treat patients who cannot pay. In the end, it will be more inefficient and costly to the taxpayer. We cannot go back to the days of the almshouse."
Private hospitals say they, too, are worried because they already pay the bulk of the cost of treating uninsured people, and are reimbursed by the state about 38 cents for every $1 of care they provide.
"You are talking about people who are edging up into the middle class but can't afford to buy insurance themselves," said Rima J. Cohen, a vice president at the Greater New York Hospital Association, the trade group for the region's hospitals. "This really is an issue that is dynamite waiting to be ignited."
On Tuesday, Gov. George E. Pataki underscored the worry among the state's politicians by proposing a broad expansion of a health plan that would cover some 420,000 uninsured children.
But many health experts say that although providing for children is important -- and a much easier task politically than covering the masses of the working poor, who are largely immigrants and minorities -- they are only part of the problem.
"These kids have parents, and the parents are struggling to get the health care they need," said Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund. In a survey of 4,013 adults in New York City conducted by Louis Harris & Associates, the Commonwealth Fund found that the uninsured had a much harder time getting medical care, were much less likely to have a regular doctor and found it harder to pay their medical bills.
At a forum in Manhattan yesterday attended by the leaders in public health policy, Ms. Davis noted that insurance for a family of four costs an average of $6,000 in New York -- or about 20 percent of the salary of someone making $30,000 a year.
"In many ways, health care is a bit of a luxury," she said.
The largest drops in private insurance came in small companies with fewer than 25 employees, according the Hospital Fund study, and many of the new jobs created in New York have been in low-wage jobs in small companies, like restaurant workers, shop clerks or workers in small manufacturing plants.
Mr. Tallon said he thought there were several reasons fewer employees were insured through their work: the costs and and the paperwork associated with health insurance are rising; more young people may be going without insurance because of the higher costs, and many of the uninsured are immigrants who may be more likely to take jobs that do not include insurance.
David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York, said he worried that the problem would only get worse.
"If it's even a little blip, these kinds of problems are going to explode on us," he said.

HEADLINE: A Growing Optimism on Ending Graft in Mexico

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 11

 BODY:
One year ago, as Washington was preparing to certify whether Mexico was a reliable partner in the narcotics war, came stunning charges by the Mexican Government that the general serving as anti-drug czar had sold out and was deploying his troops on behalf of a billionaire trafficker.
Today in an interview, President Ernesto Zedillo called that "one of the most difficult moments I have had as President." 
 But since that searing crisis, he said, his Government has turned a corner in confronting narcotics corruption, putting the general and several other senior officers on trial in an unprecedented campaign against graft.
"What is new, indeed totally new, is that whenever we have caught a member of the army committing a crime, he is prosecuted," Mr. Zedillo said. "That is new. The accountability is what is new."
Later this month, the Clinton Administration must decide whether to certify Mexico's anti-drug cooperation for another year, and Mr. Zedillo's remarks made clear that he hopes Washington will note his efforts to fight drugs' corrosion.
But instead of pleading for certification, Mr. Zedillo bluntly criticized the annual process by which Washington passes judgment on the anti-drug programs of scores of nations.
"The balance of this process in terms of its contribution to the fight against drug trafficking, after so many years, is not only negligible but probably negative," Mr. Zedillo said. "It's a lose-lose situation for everyone involved."
In the interview, conducted in English in his office overlooking rambling pine-shaded gardens, Mr. Zedillo spoke not only about the narcotics war, but also deepening distrust of the guerrillas in Chiapas state, mounting criminality that has panicked residents and foreign investors, the economy he has shepherded back from a catastrophic crisis and his own role in Mexico's political reforms, which he described in modest terms.
"I hate pretentious people, and I would be pretentious if I said I am leading the democratic transition," he said.
Nonetheless, starting the second half of his six-year term, Mr. Zedillo enjoys robust approval ratings, and he exudes a sense of command that eluded him when he became President, virtually by accident, after the assassination of the original candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, in 1994.
He said he had already achieved one political goal he set for himself when he took office in December 1994: "establishment of a true democratic system to elect public officials."
Reforms he negotiated with the opposition in 1995 and 1996 led the way to nationwide elections last July in which the PRI's opponents wrested control of the lower house of Congress for the first time in seven decades.
"Now all the parties are in the same ship," he said.
As for what comes next in political reform, Mr. Zedillo said: "Everyone has his own political agenda. For some people, the political agenda should be to defeat the PRI, to erase the PRI, and they say the President should lead that process.
"That's stupid!"
Instead, he said, he intends to help the PRI compete under new conditions.
Despite the deep changes, many Mexicans continue to say that a president's powers remain overwhelming and that Mr. Zedillo, if he wished, could engineer the election of a successor. So his remarks did not resolve one of the largest questions in Mexican politics: how powerful a role he will play in selecting the PRI's candidate next year in preparation for elections in 2000.
In an unbroken tradition dating to the 1930's, 11 PRI presidents have all chosen their successors in a system that has been likened to a constitutional monarchy. Mexicans have nicknamed this prerogative to handpick successors Dedazo, or Big Finger.
Asked today which was his Big Finger, Mr. Zedillo burst into hearty laughter, extending his hands in front of him. "All 10!" he answered.
But he immediately added: "That's a caricature."
"I think I will not play the same very strong role other presidents have played," he said.
At a convention this year, the party's rank and file will decide how the PRI will pick its candidate, he said.
Mr. Zedillo's willingness to allow opposition parties to seize large chunks of Mexico's political terrain has raised his approval ratings, which peaked above 70 percent in August after the midterm elections according to some polls. In January, however, his approval fell by eight points, his aides said, both because of public anger over higher prices for basic goods and in reaction to a gruesome massacre, apparently by members of the PRI, of 45 Indian peasants in Chiapas.
Mr. Zedillo outlined what appeared to be a hardening approach to the Zapatista guerrillas there, whose sympathizers were victims in the December massacre. He blamed the rebels for a breakdown in negotiations, and voiced deep distrust of their sincerity in seeking peace.
"I'm not convinced they really want to fix this problem," the President said. "I just hope they get tired."
He said the rebels had adopted a strategy of harassing troops in order to provoke a violent response that could further radicalize Indian peasants.
"All along they have tried to provoke the federal Government, sometimes through violence," Mr. Zedillo said. "You should see my army there. They are exemplary. They are insulted, hit, they send little children and women to hit the soldiers -- and they withstand all that situation."
Mr. Zedillo said he regretted a decision early in his Government to withdraw troops and civilian officials from Zapatista strongholds, and signaled his intention to send them back now to re-establish a more forceful federal presence. That tactic, opposition politicians say, is likely to provoke further confrontation.
Mr. Zedillo spoke in equally somber terms about the mounting depredations of criminal gangs, which have sent rates of kidnapping, murder and bank robberies soaring in many Mexican states.
"We're going through a very critical situation," he said. "Our laws, our institutions and our people are clearly short in their capacity to face the criminal justice problems in a country as large and complex as Mexico today. We have to completely overhaul our institutions, and that cannot be done overnight."
He suggested that he has begun to view the crisis of criminality as a major focus for the second half of his presidency, and that he had taken heart from recent gains against crime in the United States.
"A few years ago you had a tremendous crime crisis in large urban areas, and people were very pessimistic that that could not be reversed," he said. "Fortunately, the pessimistic ones were wrong. I think you have done a terrific job. This can be reversed, and we are going to reverse it. It can be done.
"I'm not just concerned; I'm very busy working on this. Before I leave office, I will have definitely reversed this trend."
 On the economy, he said he had been apprehensive late last year that Mexico's recovery was being threatened by the Asian financial crisis. "I was afraid we were approaching a dramatic crash." he said.
But he expressed growing confidence that the crisis has passed.

HEADLINE: Clinton Is Reported Set to Propose Rise in the Minimum Wage

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 11

 BODY:
President Clinton plans to propose increasing the minimum wage by $1 an hour over the next two years, Democrats say, an initiative that sets up the possibility of an election-year battle with Republicans.
After several weeks of negotiations, White House officials and Democratic leaders in Congress agreed today to work together to pass legislation raising the minimum wage in two 50-cent steps, to $6.15 an hour, people involved in the talks said. 
 A number of Democrats in Congress, including Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, had been pressing for an increase of $1.50 an hour over three years and a provision for further increases, indexed to inflation, after that. Administration officials, who supported a much smaller increase, ultimately agreed to $1 an hour over two years as a compromise, negotiators said.
Mr. Clinton could announce the plan as early as Thursday, when he goes to Capitol Hill to meet with Congressional Democrats about their agenda for the year, Democratic officials said. But these officials also said that the Administration was still consulting tonight with members of Congress over some details, including the precise timing of the increases, and that it was possible the formal announcement would be delayed.
Congress last passed an increase in the minimum wage in mid-1996, raising it 90 cents in two steps, to $5.15 an hour. The second step took effect last Sept. 1, when the minimum wage went up 40 cents an hour.
A new increase would affect about 12 million workers. For someone being paid the minimum for a 40-hour workweek, 52 weeks a year, the proposed increase would mean a raise before taxes of $2,080, to $12,792.
Influential Republican constituencies, especially small-business owners, have long opposed minimum-wage increases, saying the added costs force them to lay off workers, postpone hiring or even go out of business.
The Republican leadership in Congress was initially opposed to the minimum-wage increase in 1996, but reversed course in the face of strong public support for it.
Republicans have not taken a formal position on the issue this year. And although there is strong opposition among many conservatives to any increase, it is unclear how the party will respond to the Democratic initiative with the midterm Congressional elections looming and the economy booming.
Democrats said they would be happy to make their initiative an issue in the elections if the Republicans opposed it.
Congressional Democrats and White House officials said they were confident that the initiative would win considerable bipartisan support, in part because the job losses direly predicted by opponents of the last increase had failed to materialize. The Democrats said there was a very good case for raising the minimum wage at a time of strong business profits and low inflation.
"This is an effort to insure that as the recovery goes forward, people at the low end of the income scale will share in the benefits," a senior Administration official said tonight.
Unemployment currently stands at 4.7 percent, near a quarter-century low, and the strong economy is forcing many employers to offer higher starting pay to attract the workers they need. As a result, employers in a number of industries that have traditionally paid minimum wage, like fast-food restaurants, are already raising wages above the minimum.
The White House initially considered proposing a minimum-wage rise as an element of Mr. Clinton's State of the Union Message last month, but held off after a number of Congressional Democrats had asked the Administration to consider a larger increase.
Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bonior and other Democrats had initially asked for an increase of $2.10 an hour over five years, to $7.25 an hour, and then an annual adjustment for inflation. They later scaled their proposal back to 50 cents an hour in each of the next three years, followed by an annual inflation adjustment.
Mr. Kennedy has argued that for the minimum wage to have the purchasing power it had in 1968, it would have to rise to $7.33 an hour. In the last 30 years, "the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down by 30 percent," he said in a speech in December, adding that the current annual pay of a full-time worker earning the minimum would leave a family of three $2,600 below the poverty level. "No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty," he said.
Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Bonior met earlier this month with their party's leaders in Congress, Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, and a delegation from the White House, including Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff; John D. Podesta, deputy chief of staff, and Gene Sperling, the economic policy adviser.
They tentatively agreed to drop the proposal to index the minimum wage to inflation, and agreed as well to scale back the increase to $1 over two years, participants said.
Administration officials said that because the $1-an-hour increase over two years was roughly in line with the increase enacted in 1996, it would be harder for opponents to argue that it would kill jobs or damage the economy.

HEADLINE: Time for a Fuel Tax;
New Urban Coalition

 BODY:

To the Editor:
We agree that President Clinton must focus on transportation aid programs if the United States is to have a full urban agenda (editorial, Feb. 5). But transportation programs are not enough. There are other Federal (and state) policies that benefit new suburban developments at the expense of hard-pressed inner cities and older suburbs. Tax policies subsidize the development of housing subdivisions at the exurban fringe, and Federal regulations make reusing urban land prohibitively expensive. 
 These discriminatory policies, along with the fact that many older suburbs face inner-city problems (concentrated poverty, high unemployment, failing schools) but lack the tax revenue to combat them, are a powerful impetus for new metropolitan political coalitions. The coalitions would include the constituencies of central cities and older suburbs as well as others that lose from suburban sprawl, like environmentalists and rural advocates. We cannot save the cities without looking beyond their borders.

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

 BODY:
Japan's current account surplus surged 59.8 percent in 1997, the first time in four years that it has grown, the Finance Ministry said yesterday. The surplus, measuring the flow of goods and services as well as monetary transfers, hit $92.6 billion in 1997. The surplus in trade alone expanded 35.5 percent, with exports growing 13.7 percent and imports rising 7.9 percent. 
 In December, the current account surplus jumped 57.4 percent from a year earlier, to $10.5 billion, rising for a ninth straight month. The trade surplus alone rose 35.7 percent, with exports up 12.2 percent and imports up 4.1 percent. The ministry said strong demand for Japanese goods in Europe and the United States offset sluggishness in Asia.

Opponent Challenges Newark Mayor's Report

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
In a speech rebutting Mayor Sharpe James's glowing State of the City address, a political opponent on the City Council yesterday attacked the Mayor's claim to have created 25,000 jobs in the past year and the rosy picture he painted of the city's future even as unemployment continues to soar.
Councilwoman Mildred Crump, who is running against Mr. James in the May nonpartisan election, said that the city's unemployment rate stood at 14 percent. She challenged the Mayor to explain what kind of jobs were created and who got them. She said his 25-page address, delivered two weeks ago, devoted just one paragraph to education, and she criticized him for failing to cooperate with officials of Newark's state-run school district. 
 Pamela Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mr. James, listed Continental Airlines and Prudential Insurance among several local employers that had recently increased hiring. She also said that Mayor James worked frequently with the Newark Board of Education, including running an after-school recreation program.

HEADLINE: Argentina's Values

 BODY:

To the Editor:
As an Argentine living in the United States, I was somewhat disappointed by your article "Argentine Economy Reborn but Still Ailing" (front page, Feb. 6). What Argentines fear is not globalization itself, but the Americanization of our culture. We have strong ties with Europe, as our social structure indicates. Universal health care provided by the state, free public universities, legal protection from layoffs, and six-month maternity leaves are just some of the social rights that have protected us from becoming a selfish society. 
 Unlike Americans, we strongly value solidarity and do not praise success as our utmost goal. Efficiency belongs to inanimate objects. Free time is still highly cherished, and being busy is something that people are not proud of. Unfortunately, these are the values that we are losing.

Investors Step Up Purchases Of Stock and Bond Funds

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Investors stepped up their purchases of shares of stock and bond mutual funds in January, compared with December. But while bond funds took in more money than in any month for more than four years, cash flows to stock funds failed to measure up to the levels reached in January of the previous two years.
According to estimates released yesterday by the Investment Company Institute, a fund trade group, stock funds continued to receive a majority of the new cash that went into long-term mutual funds, garnering an estimated $18.5 billion in net investments last month. 
 That topped December's cash flow of $16.8 billion but fell below the extraordinary flows of January 1997, when stock funds added a record $29 billion, and January 1996, when they added $28 billion.
Prior to 1996, however, stock funds had never taken in as much as $18.5 billion in a single month. Therefore, last month's take can be measured as slow only in relation to the very strong totals of the previous two years.
Bond funds, meanwhile, took in an estimated $11.5 billion in January, up from $5.6 billion in December and $3.6 billion in January 1997. Last month was the strongest month for bond funds since August 1993, when they added $12.7 billion.
The January bond fund purchases came close to the $12.6 billion that the funds added for all of 1996. That year followed two years in which more money flowed out of the funds than came in.
The cash flow figures released yesterday represent estimates of new investments minus the amounts that are pulled out of funds; final figures will be released near the end of the month.
The rapid purchases of bond funds follow three years of extraordinary stock-fund gains; those gains attracted more than half a trillion dollars in new stock-fund investments.
Now, analysts say, investors are seeking to buy a bit more safety, perhaps in the expectation that such strong gains in stocks cannot continue. Evidence that investors are simply reallocating their mutual fund investments can be found in the fact that the $30 billion that flowed into long-term mutual funds in January -- that is, into stock and bond funds combined -- is only about 10 percent below the totals in January of each of the last two years.
Also spurring cash flows to bond funds in recent months has been talk of the possibility of deflation, brought on by the economic problems in Asia, said James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Norwest Investment Management in Minneapolis.
"Government bonds are absolutely the best thing to own in a deflationary environment," Mr. Paulsen said. "And we're already seeing deflation in several areas, like unit labor costs, new auto prices and the cost of alcoholic beverages."
In addition, over the last three months, the average corporate and government bond fund gained about as much as the average stock fund, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
The yield on 30-year Treasuries, which declines as the price of the bonds rise, has been falling for nearly a year. In August 1993, the last time sales of bond mutual funds were as high as they were last month, interest rates had been declining for about three years. Within six months, long-term rates headed sharply higher after the Federal Reserve began to raise short-term rates.

HEADLINE: A Place for Part-Time Students

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's attack on the City University of New York has prompted debate about the system's mission and how best to deliver remedial courses that more than 8 in 10 students require. The debate is timely and important. But so far it has overlooked the merits of revising the state student-aid formula, which has failed to keep up with changes in student demographics.
Over the last 20 years, colleges all over the country have seen a large rise in part-time and non-traditional enrollment, as younger students work to meet soaring tuition costs and older workers return to college to retool for the changing labor market. The trend is especially pronounced at CUNY, where 70 percent of students attend school part time at some point. These students, mostly poor and many of them single women with children, must work to support their families and to earn money for tuition. 
 Full-time students can take advantage of the state Tuition Assistance Program, which provides $615 million a year statewide and covers more than 80 percent of tuition for the poorest students. But part-timers are covered by a less generous program that furnishes only up to a third of tuition costs and has only $15 million to spend. That is unfortunate, given that a third of the state's 770,000 students attend part time. With education so important to the state's economy, it is time for an aid formula that encourages part-timers to complete their degrees instead of punishing them for trying.

HEADLINE: Brazil Congress Votes to Scale Down Social Security Benefits

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO 

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Winding down a special session of Congress marked by political horse-trading inside and labor protests outside, lawmakers have approved bills to strip down social security benefits and job protections.
The measures are the cornerstone of the Government's four-year plan to stabilize the economy. 
 The social security changes, sought by President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, passed Congress late Wednesday, by 346 votes to 151, with the winning margin 38 votes more than necessary for a constitutional amendment. And on Tuesday the Senate approved civil service changes that loosen job protections that public workers have long had.
Congress also approved a bill against money-laundering, and at noon today, once the social security vote was in his pocket, the President signed an environmental crimes law, vetoing some of its toughest provisions. The provisions were opposed by members of Congress close to industrial and rural interests.
Riordan Roett, a specialist on Latin America at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, said the votes would lift the confidence of international investors. The Government has been pushing through the structural changes to distance itself from the tumult in Asian markets. But he noted that further votes lie ahead before the bills take effect.
In the social security system, the minimum age for retirement is being raised to 60 years from 50 for men who have contributed to the system for 35 years, and to 55 for women who have contributed for 30 years.
The maximum pension for private sector employees is $1,080 a month, but for public workers the maximum jumps to $11,256 a month, corresponding to the top salary of a Supreme Court minister.
Divisive parts of the social security bill were put off for a vote early in March, after which the entire bill will return to the lower house for a second approval.
Under the civil service amendment, public employees for the first time could be dismissed for incompetence or because spending on salaries exceeds 60 percent of a state's total budget. The change is subject to enabling legislation outlining the criteria for dismissing employees.
The Government estimates that the reforms will save Brazil $10 billion a year and, more important, lessen future strains on the social security system.
But the changes set off bitter protests among workers. Scattered work stoppages were reported, and protesting workers and pensioners threw counterfeit bills at lawmakers disembarking at the Brasilia airport for the vote.
Vicente Paulo da Silva, president of the country's most powerful labor union, the 19-million-members Central Labor Union, said the reforms would penalize the most vulnerable, least-educated workers. "The rich man's son will retire with fewer years of work," Mr. da Silva said.
In signing the environmental protection law, the President vetoed seven key articles. One banned setting fires without taking precautions to keep them from burning out of control, while another removed the automatic liability of companies to clean up their environmental damage and compensate victims. Companies will be held responsible only if the Government can prove the damage was intentional.
Mr. Roett of Johns Hopkins said the financial reforms were important "for the long-term health of the Brazilian economy, but they don't address the outstanding issue of inequality, especially in income."

HEADLINE: U S West Media Reduces Loss

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ENGLEWOOD, Colo., Feb. 12

 BODY:
U S West Media Group said today that it had pared its fourth-quarter loss on higher revenue from its United States cable-television, high-speed data and cellular phone businesses.
The company, the media unit of U S West Inc., said its loss narrowed to $133 million, or 24 cents a diluted share, from $174 million, or 30 cents, a year earlier. Per-share results matched the average estimate of nine analysts polled by I.B.E.S. International Inc. 
 The loss included a pretax noncash charge of $200 million that has been set aside to cover costs arising from Asian economic problems and a pretax gain of $313 million on the sale of assets.
Revenue rose 5.3 percent, to $1.29 billion from $1.22 billion, helped by the growth of its high-speed data services. The company almost doubled its number of data customers to 23,000, from 13,000 at the end of the third quarter, while the number of United States cable subscribers was unchanged in the same period.
Shares of U S West Media Group were up 56.25 cents, to $30.50.
Cash flow, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, rose 16 percent, to $453 million.

HEADLINE: Greenspan Sees Asian Crisis Moving World to Western Capitalism

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told a Senate panel today that one of the most fundamental effects of the Asian crisis was a worldwide move toward "the Western form of free market capitalism," instead of the competing Asian approach that only a few years ago looked like an attractive model for nations around the world.
"What has happened here is a very dramatic event towards a consensus of the type of market system which we have in this country," Mr. Greenspan said before the Senate Foreign Relations committee. 
 In the last year there have been a number of triumphal declarations of America's economic success from members of the Clinton Administration. But rarely have they come from the cautious chairman of the Fed. Today the argument fit neatly with Mr. Greenspan's agenda: to overcome broad resistance in Congress to $18 billion in new support for the International Monetary Fund as it attempts to stabilize Asia's markets and others around the world.
Mr. Greenspan's appearance, alongside Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, was part of an intense effort by the Administration to get the I.M.F. financing pushed through quickly, with few strings attached. During the hearing, Mr. Rubin pledged to "sit down with the I.M.F." and press for broad reforms in the institution -- something a growing chorus of lawmakers is insisting upon -- though he stopped well short of promising actual changes. The United States is the largest contributor to the fund, but it only provides 18 percent of its financing and has a commensurate vote in its operations.
A few days ago, Administration officials believed they would win a relatively quick approval for additional funds for the I.M.F., despite a struggle in the House. Now they are not so optimistic. Republican leaders have once again suggested the funds could be tied to an amendment that denies funds to any organization abroad that provides or counsels on abortions. That amendment killed a $3.5 billion contribution to the I.M.F. at the end of last year's Congressional session. This year the Administration is seeking those funds and an additional $14.5 billion increase in the American contribution to the I.M.F. -- though the money is lent to the fund rather than actually spent.
Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Rubin are pressing for quick action because the Administration fears the closer it gets to Congressional elections the more difficult it will be to get House members to vote for what is clearly an unpopular cause in many parts of the country. They are also fearful that continued social unrest in Indonesia, where the I.M.F. is currently involved in its most difficult economic rescue effort, could kill the entire American contribution.
"A few pictures of troops putting down riots, and opponents of this will say the I.M.F. is helping along the cause of authoritarianism," one Administration official said recently.
The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, hinted at that argument today as he jousted with Mr. Rubin.
"There is no getting around the fact that I.M.F. intervention has so often meant the bailing out of negligent bankers and corrupt or incompetent governments," Mr. Helms said.
Mr. Rubin, Mr. Greenspan and Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary, argued today that the I.M.F. had succeeded in using its bailouts to force nations to open their markets and transform their economies -- a step, they suggested, toward more democratic government.
In the last decade or so, Mr. Greenspan said, the nation has observed "a consensus towards the, for want of a better term, the Western form of free-market capitalism as the model which should govern how each individual country should run its economy."
"We saw the breakdown of the Berlin wall in 1989, he added, "and the massive shift away from central planning towards free market capitalist types of structures. Concurrent to that was the really quite dramatic, very strong growth in what appeared to be a competing capitalist-type system in Asia. And as a consequence of that, you had developments of types of structures which I believe at the end of the day were faulty, but you could not demonstrate that so long as growth was going at 10 percent a year."

HEADLINE: U.S. and I.B.M. Join Forces to Develop Fastest Computer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF 

 BODY:
The Department of Energy yesterday raised the stakes in the international race to build the world's fastest supercomputer when it announced that it had signed an $85 million contract with the International Business Machines Corporation to build a machine capable of 10 trillion calculations a second.
I.B.M. said that its machine, designed on the technology that enabled the Deep Blue supercomputer to beat the chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov last year, would be ready by 2000. 
 If it meets its goal of 10 "teraflops," or 10 trillion mathematical operations a second, it will be the world's fastest computer, combining the processing power of 8,000 of I.B.M.'s most powerful microprocessor chips.
"To put this into context," Secretary of Energy Federico F. Pena said, "we will be able to do in less than a day all of the calculations that were performed at the weapons laboratories in the first 50 years of the nuclear weapons program."
But for all that, I.B.M.'s speed record could be fleeting.
The Japanese Government has also embarked on an aggressive supercomputer development program whose goal is a 32-teraflop machine to be constructed by the NEC Corporation and installed by 2002.
The United States Government program, financed by the Energy Department, is known as the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative. Computer scientists said it had had a striking impact in the international computing world, touching off a new race for global supercomputing supremacy.
"Our program has inspired other organizations and other governments to look hard in this area," said Randy Christensen, deputy program manager for the Advanced Strategic Computing Initiative at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories. "We're pushing the envelope."
Computer scientists said there were crucial differences in the goals of the American and Japanese programs.
The United States program, begun in 1996, is aimed at designing a new class of computers capable of simulating nuclear weapon explosions. They are a fundamental component of the Energy Department's Scientific Stockpile Stewardship Program, which is intended to maintain the nuclear weapons arsenal without physical testing of the bombs.
The Japanese are embarking on an Earth Simulator Program to help scientists model global climate conditions, earthquakes and other natural phenomena.
The Energy Department's program is planning five generations of supercomputers intended to scale up from 1 to 100 teraflops by 2005. In addition to Lawrence Livermore, both Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratories have received awards from the agency to have purchase supercomputers from Silicon Graphics Inc., the Intel Corporation and the Sun Microsystems Corporation.
The two competing national programs will also match two fundamentally different computer architectures against each other, and scientists said that the competing designs were both still unproved at multi-teraflop speeds.
"The drama here is that the two programs pit I.B.M. against NEC, said Larry Smarr, director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications, in Champaign-Urbana, Ill. "In a sense this is untried territory."
The Department of Energy is betting that I.B.M., Silicon Graphics and Intel will be able to solve thorny problems in scaling machines from hundreds to thousands of microprocessors. As scientific challenges like modeling storms are broken up into parts to be solved simultaneously on thousands of microprocessors, bottlenecks emerge based on huge amounts of data that need to be shuttled back and forth at great speed inside the computers.
Livermore researchers said they had not yet proved that the systems would accurately model weapons explosions, but they said they were confident that they could refine their software codes to run on the new superfast machines.
Even so, Mr. Christensen, a veteran physicist who has long been involved in the weapons simulation program, acknowledged: "This is hard, and it's not a lock. We don't have a 100 percent guarantee."
The risk that the United States runs is that the more traditional computers favored by the Japanese may be easier to program and may come closer to reaching peak speeds on real problems.
But United States industry analysts said that massively parallel processing, or M.P.P., computers have been making large strides in recent years. In 1997, commercial M.P.P. machines for the first time surpassed the sales of the traditional high-performance computers based on what is known as vector architecture for the way they arrange problems, said Chris Willard, research director at the International Data Corporation in Mountain View, Calif.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Up Just 0.1% As Cars Slump

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
A slump in auto sales offset a surge at department stores last month, holding retail spending over all to a tepid increase of one-tenth of a percent, a report by the Commerce Department showed today.
The rise in retail spending, to a seasonally adjusted $214.8 billion, followed a three-tenths of a percent gain in December and an advance of one-tenth of a percent in November, the department said. Both earlier months had previously been reported as stronger. 
 The report suggested that consumers began pulling back a bit late in 1997 after spending strongly through much of the year.
"We are talking about a consumer who has not been a pacesetter these last several months," said Robert Dederick, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "The consumer hasn't been on a tear since the third quarter."
Still, there is little evidence the retreat is anything more than a natural slowdown, he said. Asia's widely reported financial problems may have unsettled the American stock market for a time, but they have not discouraged consumers, who are enjoying solid income growth and a plentiful supply of jobs.
In another indication of the strong demand for workers, the Labor Department said today that new claims for unemployment benefits edged down to 303,000 last week from 305,000 the week before. A four-week moving average of claims dipped to a three-and-a-half-month low.
The retail sales mix in January largely reversed the December pattern, when sales at many stores were weaker than expected but auto makers enjoyed a big gain.
In January, discounts drew shoppers back to department stores, where sales rose 1.6 percent, the biggest gain in 13 months. Clothing shops posted an increase of seven-tenths of a percent, the best in five months. But auto sales fell 1.1 percent.
"When consumers buy cars, they tend to throttle back on other purchases," said Paul Boltz, an economist at T. Rowe Price Associates in Baltimore. "They don't buy a car and a new stereo and two new suits. It's too much."
Excluding the volatile auto category, sales rose five-tenths of a percent in January after declining one-tenth of a percent in both December and November. It was the best showing since July.
Also contributing to the January advance were sales at building supply and hardware stores, up 1 percent, and furniture stores, up three-tenths of a percent. Both were helped by robust home sales.

HEADLINE: Low Rates Spur Surge in Home Buying and Refinancing

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO 

 BODY:
Interest rates have fallen to a four-year low in recent weeks, causing a surge of home buying and mortgage refinancings that has created a windfall for consumers, lenders and real estate agents in the New York metro politan region.
"I am probably getting 50 percent more phone calls than a year ago," said Ellen Bitton, president of the Park Avenue Mortgage Group in Manhattan. 
 As of Wednesday, the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.1 percent, with 1.31 points, according to HSH Associates, a mortgage analyst in Butler, N.J. -- slightly above the 6.83 percent of Oct. 15, 1993. A point is a fee paid at closing that is equal to 1 percent of the loan. The average adjustable rate was 5.59 percent, with 1.35 points, up from a low of 4.15 percent on Oct. 29, 1993.
"Our phone volume has increased by 500 to 600 percent, and this is the third time something like this has happened in the 90's," said Bruce R. Lublin, president of the Homerica Mortgage Corporation in Harrison, N.Y.
The lower interest rates have made buying a home more attractive and fueled business at real estate brokerages.
"It has led more people to put their homes on the market and make the move to a more desirable neighborhood," said John Dibs, the owner of RE/MAX Liberty, a real estate broker in Ozone Park, Queens. "At the same time, more purchasers have entered the home buying market to take advantage of the low interest rates. Over all, I'm currently experiencing an increase in purchasing activity and inventory."
In 1992 and 1993, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages dipped below 7 percent for the first time in more than a quarter-century and some adjustable-rate mortgages had initial rates as low as 3 percent. Then, like now, more than 70 percent of all new mortgages were refinancings.
Christopher Ryan, a Danbury, Conn., firefighter, and his wife, Donna, who operates a day-care center at their home in nearby Sherman, Conn., recently refinanced their mortgage after watching their one-year adjustable-rate mortgage jump to 8.5 percent, swelling their monthly payment by $400 above what it was in 1995. So in January, they refinanced to a mortgage that is fixed for seven years and adjusts annually after that; it has a lower rate, 7 percent, than their old loan and saves them $125 a month.
"We could have gotten down to 6.5 percent," Mr. Ryan said. "But I jumped the gun and locked in about two days before the big rate drop."
On Wednesday, People's Bank in Bridgeport, Conn., received 75 refinancing applications; the norm is 30.
"Volume has risen dramatically during the first six weeks of 1998 compared to the first six weeks of 1997, more than tripled, and the weather has been about the same, so the increase is not weather-driven," said Dorothea Brennan, a bank spokeswoman.
Mortgage brokers' business has jumped so much that they are writing about as many loans as are banks. It has not always been that way. Before the early 90's, few people used mortgage brokers, intermediaries who find loans for borrowers and help them with the applications but do not make loans themselves. The industry was small and, to some degree, had a slightly shady reputation. Instead, borrowers usually, almost reflexively, shopped for rates at local lenders.
The National Association of Mortgage Brokers, a trade organization, said that the percentage of home mortgage applications written by brokers increased to 52 percent last year, from 20 percent in 1987. Most of them are refinancing loans.
"Seventy-five percent of my business is currently devoted to mortgage refinancing," said Neil Bader, chief executive of the Skyscraper Mortgage Company in Manhattan. "It is double what it was at this time last year."
Most of the recent refinancing activity has been into 30-year fixed-rate loans. Rates on one-year adjustable mortgages have not fallen so sharply. Indeed, many homeowners who took them out in recent years have found that they are paying higher rates than they would for a 30-year fixed-rate loan.
The savings on mortgages can be substantial when rates decline. Circumstances have outdated the old formula for practical refinancing of "2-2-2," meaning borrowers had been in a home at least two years, intended to stay at least two more years and refinanced at a rate at least two percentage points lower than their current mortgage rate.
When is the rate difference wide enough? Many mortgage brokers believe that a drop in rates of even half a percentage point can justify refinancing, if the fees of the loan are wrapped into the loan or are paid by the broker. Such loans are sometimes called "zero-cost" refinancings; in exchange for about three-eighths of a percentage point in the rate, all other fees are paid.
The savings can be substantial, however, even when rates drop just a little. Consider a homeowner with an existing mortgage of $200,000, and a mortgage rate of 7.25 percent. The monthly payment is $1,364. At a refinanced rate of 7 percent, just a quarter-percent lower, the monthly payment would be $1,330, a savings of $34 per month.
Robert Gold, a lawyer and real estate developer who lives in Greenwich Village in Manhattan, recently refinanced the mortgage on his one-bedroom co-op apartment using a mortgage broker.
By refinancing from a 7.25 percent one-year adjustable-rate mortgage into a 7.125 percent mortgage that has a fixed rate for 10 years, Mr. Gold could take out $35,000 in equity from his home and only bump up his payments by about $100 a month.
"It's wonderful to be able to get the appreciation out of an apartment after eight years," he said, "and be able to lock in a very comfortable rate for a 10-year period."

HEADLINE: Hispanic Births in U.S. Reach Record High

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
The number of babies being born to Hispanic women in the United States has reached a record high, increasing to 18 percent of the total number of births, according to a new Federal report released today.
The study by the National Center for Health Statistics indicated that 679,768 babies were born to Hispanic women in 1995, the latest year for which complete data are available. That figure is up from 532,249 Hispanic-origin births in 1989, when 14 percent of all babies born in the United States had Hispanic mothers. 
 Hispanic residents make up 10.3 percent of the nation's population.
The fertility rate among Hispanic women varies greatly among nationalities, according to the study, which is the Government's most comprehensive look at Hispanic births to date.
The report also indicates that much of the increase in Hispanic-origin births is the result of high fertility rates among Mexican-Americans, particularly recent immigrants. About 70 percent of the babies born to Hispanic women in 1995 -- up from 61 percent in 1989 -- were born to women of Mexican heritage, the report said.
The study also estimated that Mexican-American women would average 3.32 births over their lifetimes, compared, for example, with 1.7 births for Cuban-American women and 2.2 births for Puerto Rican women, birth rates that are comparable to those of black and non-Hispanic white women.
The study provides further evidence that people of Mexican heritage have an increasing demographic significance in American society. The study's findings strongly imply that, as a result of high levels of immigration and a high birth rate, people of Mexican heritage are poised to become a major economic, political and cultural force in the coming decades.
"Their birth rates have been increasing while other groups have been stable or have declined," said Stephanie J. Ventura, a demographer in the National Center for Health Statistics. "It's not like the Cubans, who have low fertility and no growth from the outside."
The report also notes that as the Hispanic birth rate continues to rise, the birth rates of whites and blacks have declined. As a result, even if immigration is curbed, the Hispanic proportion of the American population will continue to grow.
The report, entitled "Births of Hispanic Origin, 1989-95," is compiled from birth records supplied by each state. The National Center for Health Statistics publishes a final report about 18 months after the close of a particular calendar year.
The reason for the delay is that hospitals and other birthing centers must first transmit their records to state health departments, and those departments must then send the records on to the health statistics center.
The report also noted a sharp increase in births among Hispanic teen-age girls from 1989 to 1995. Indeed, the study determined that in recent years, the birth rate for Hispanic teen-agers has exceeded that of black teen-agers.
The study said there were 106.7 births per 1,000 Hispanic teen-age girls in 1995, compared with 100.8 in 1989. In the same period, the birth rate among black teen-age girls dropped to 74.5 births per 1,000 teen-age girls, from 84.8.
But the study noted that Hispanic teen-age girls who give birth were more likely than the black teen-age girls to be married.
The study also highlighted some positive trends in Hispanic fertility. It noted, for example, that the number of Hispanic women who began prenatal care in the first trimester of their pregnancies rose by 19 percent from 1989 to 1995.

HEADLINE: Indonesian Rupiah Again Falls Sharply

BYLINE: Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Friday, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The Indonesian rupiah dropped sharply today for the first time this week, hurt by worries over possible changes in Indonesia's banking system and growing political tension in the country.
The currency fell more than 15 percent in Asian dealings to a rate of 9,100 to the dollar. 
 Traders said the decline reflected opposition by the International Monetary Fund and the United States to President Suharto's proposal to tie the rupiah's value to the dollar. Such a change would require Indonesia's central bank to hold enough dollars to repurchase rupiah to keep the exchange rate stable, which I.M.F. officials have said is unrealistic for the economically distressed country.
Fear of civil unrest in Indonesia also hurt the rupiah. Food riots have broken out in Jakarta, the capital, and other areas, in recent weeks.

HEADLINE: California Governor's Race: A New Height in Spending

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Politics has never been a cheap sport in California, home to a dozen media markets stretching over a span equal to the distance from New Jersey to Georgia and to a diffuse and desultory political culture where paid television commercials are king.
But as the 1998 gubernatorial race begins here in earnest this month, the state of so many firsts seems poised to set yet another record, for the most expensive state election campaign in American history. And in no small measure that is the work of one man, a demibillionaire Democratic businessman named Al Checchi (pronounced CHECK-ee), who is running for office for the first time. 
 Mr. Checchi, a 49-year-old investor who has been involved with companies from Marriott to Walt Disney and was until last year the co-chairman of Northwest Airlines, has come from nowhere to virtually dominate the Democratic field at the moment. Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, whose husband is a onetime partner of Mr. Checchi and himself a multimillionaire, chose not to run for governor last month -- though she led in all the polls -- because she confessed dreading the prospect that Mr. Checchi would spend millions of dollars attacking her in a primary.
Leon E. Panetta, a member of Congress from Monterey for eight terms who went on to serve as President Clinton's budget director and White House chief of staff, concluded last week that he could not possibly raise enough money to compete. Lieut. Gov. Gray Davis, who has spent years planning a gubernatorial bid and amassing a war chest of more than $4 million, now finds Mr. Checchi nipping at his heels in public opinion polls.
The only other Democrat who decided she could afford to join the fray by the filing deadline last week was Representative Jane Harman, who represents a coastal district on the south edges of Los Angeles and whose husband has a fortune akin to Mr. Checchi's.
On the Republican side, the conservative State Attorney General, Dan Lungren, faces only token opposition for his party's nomination to succeed Gov. Pete Wilson, who must leave after two terms. But a combination of concerns among moderate Republicans that Mr. Lungren's strong anti-abortion stance and Mr. Checchi's deep pockets might hurt Mr. Lungren's chances led the popular Republican mayor of Los Angeles, Richard J. Riordan, himself worth well over $100 million, to flirt briefly but intensely last week with the notion of running for governor.
"What can I say?" said Herbert E. Alexander, a professor of political science at the University of Southern California and a longtime expert on campaign finance. "Money is an important element in politics, and it certainly gives an advantage to a person such as Checchi. There's a lot of money going in this race."
Wealthy candidates who finance part or all of their own campaigns are nothing new in American politics, from the Kennedys to Ross Perot and former Representative Michael Huffington of California, who spent close to $30 million of his family's fortune in an almost successful effort to unseat Senator Feinstein in 1994. That was the all-time record for spending for an individual in a Senate race and together with the $13 million Ms. Feinstein spent, the all-time record for collective spending in a Senate race.
Mr. Wilson and his 1994 Democratic gubernatorial opponent, Kathleen Brown, together spent even more than that, an all-time record of nearly $50 million.
But Mr. Checchi, who is worth more than $500 million, has the capacity to cause both those records to be broken. To boost his name recognition among voters, Mr. Checchi began advertising on television last November for the June primary, the earliest of any candidate in California history. By Dec. 31, he had spent $7.25 million on the race, and he acknowledged today that he had probably already broken the record state primary spending level of $9 million set by Ms. Brown in her campaign for governor.
Mr. Chechhi, whose adversaries refer to him with a mixture of scorn and envy as "Al Checkbook," makes no apologies for his wealth, or his decision to spend it on a campaign. He dismisses as "nonsense" any suggestion that his entry into the race deterred other candidates, or limited voters' choices.
"What my spending has done is allow the public to have another choice," Mr. Checchi told a group of reporters over breakfast this morning. "No amount of money is going to get people who want to do something to do something they don't want to do. You can't buy votes, you can only disseminate information."
In fact, in politics, getting out the message is often the biggest battle, and Mr. Checchi's wealth has already given him a major leg up. He has hired experienced campaign consultants and run advertisements that portray him as the self-made grandson of immigrant grocers and that show him walking the beach with his attractive family, advocating tougher educational standards and the imposition of the death penalty for serial rapists and repeat child molesters. His wife, Kathy, who speaks fluent Spanish, has appeared in Spanish-language advertisements aimed at the growing Hispanic electorate.
Acknowledging his electoral inexperience, Mr. Checchi spent months last year crisscrossing the state and listening to the concerns of various groups before speaking out on the issues. He showed up at the State Democratic Convention in Sacramento last spring to make the rounds, but declined an invitation to address the delegates, insisting he was not yet qualified.
He is considerably more confident now, jousting aggressively this morning with veteran political reporters over everything from his wealth to his failure to vote in four elections since 1993, including the 1994 governor's race.
This morning, Mr. Checchi also tossed out two new popular proposals in this state where automobiles are ubiquitous and managed health care plans are widespread: He called for a 10 percent cut in auto insurance premiums and a "Patients' Bill of Rights," for members of health maintenance organizations and other managed care plans.
Paradoxically, some political experts say, it was a recent state effort to sharply limit campaign contributions and spending that contributed to Mr. Checchi's current dominance. Proposition 208, passed by voters in 1996, limited contributions to candidates for statewide office to $500 per donor, or $1,000 if candidates agreed to spending caps, and under the law, candidates for office this year could not even begin raising new money until last summer, though they could use money raised before the new law took effect.
That left Mr. Panetta, who was waiting to see what Ms. Feinstein did in any case, unable to start raising money to catch up with Mr. Davis's war chest, let alone Mr. Checchi's potential. A Federal judge last month struck down the contribution limits as unconstitutionally harsh, but by then it was too late. "Proposition 208 was a drastic measure that has been knocked down," Professor Alexander said. "Now the floodgates are open and it'll probably be an arms race."
Steve Merksamer, a Sacramento lawyer and Republican who was chief of staff to former Gov. George Deukmejian, said that most wealthy aspiring politicians in the past, from John F. Kennedy to Ms. Harman, started out running for lower offices like Congress before presuming to take on leadership of the nation's most populous state and the world's seventh-largest economy.
"As a general proposition, I think it perverts the Democratic process," Mr. Merksamer said. "There's nothing wrong with people of all walks of life, including wealthy people, entering the political fray.
"What's changed," he added, "is that you have candidates that have never been involved in appointed or elected office, who haven't participated in the difficult tasks and give and take of making public policy, and think that by virtue of the fact that they have either inherited or made a lot of money that they are instantaneously qualified for holding high political office."

HEADLINE: Democrats Rally as President Unveils Agenda for Campaign

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
They stepped up, woman after woman, to praise the President. A black business executive. A white woman looking toward retirement. A 21-year-old college student, not much younger than Monica S. Lewinsky.
"Six years ago, I was filled with apprehension and fear about my economic well-being and my retirement security," one of them, Judy Lee, said today at a Democratic rally in a Senate auditorium. But she prospered under the Clinton economy. "I'm back," she said. "I'm hopeful again. And I now plan to retire when and if I want to." 
 Then Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri lauded his rival Vice President Al Gore for working "so hard and so effectively." Mr. Gore called Mr. Gephardt, his expected Democratic challenger in 2000, a "a great leader."
Basking in Democratic unity that has so often eluded him in better times, President Clinton rolled out a campaign agenda today for the November mid-term elections built on the traditional Democratic touchstones of strengthening Social Security, improving health care, expanding Medicare, hiring teachers and increasing the minimum wage by $1 over two years.
"If it doesn't happen this year, we owe it to the American people to make sure it was not our fault," Mr. Clinton said, urging Democrats to work with Republicans to pass as many of the agenda items into law as possible.
It was Mr. Clinton's first appearance on Capitol Hill since the night of the State of the Union Message. And Democrats put aside their feuds, ignored the White House crisis over the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and gamely stood by Mr. Clinton's side, aware that their fate in the mid-term election may be inextricably linked to his.
Mr. Gore contrasted the Democratic unity with Republican squabbling over tax cuts, health care and the propose tobacco settlement.
"The Republican Party is in so much disarray today," the Vice President said, "that the right hand doesn't know what the far right hand is doing."
Though Congressional Democrats have assembled similar campaign platforms in the past, this was the first time that Mr. Clinton, too, had embraced the identical agenda.
The Democrats have built this platform on their traditional areas of strength, putting Social Security front and center as an issue that can draw the elderly and the baby boom generation. Mr. Clinton staked out the issue in his State of the Union Message when he called for any government surpluses to be saved for Social Security.
For the first time, too, Mr. Clinton endorsed a specific proposal to raise the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage.
The other cornerstones of the Democratic program are health care issues, the regulation of health maintenance organization managed care and the expansion of Medicare so uninsured people nearing retirement age can buy into the program.
It was significant that the Democrats featured three women to talk about these issues. Women are now some of the most faithful Democratic voters and many of the agenda items are designed to have a particular appeal to them.
Mr. Clinton thanked the three for "reminding us why we're here."
In his only oblique reference to the scandals consuming his White House, he said: "I'm not exactly a Washington person, you know. I just sort of showed up here a few years ago for work. And sometime I really get lonesome for why I came here."

HEADLINE: Amsterdam News' New Generation;
Owner's Daughter Tries to Rebuild Famous Paper for Blacks

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Leonard Davis sells papers in Harlem, but his opinions are free. Ask him what he thinks of The New York Amsterdam News, one of a half dozen black newspapers neatly displayed on his newsstand, and he will offer several earfuls. The paper, he said, has become "bourgeois" -- too much news about social goings-on, too little about issues -- over the last half-decade.
"You get off the first two or three pages, and there's really nothing there," he said, as a customer nodded vigorously in agreement. 
 This does not mean Mr. Davis has no interest in news on black life, from a black perspective: he is an avid reader of several other black papers, and thinks general market papers like The New York Times, The Daily News and The New York Post "slant" their coverage of black issues unfavorably. Whether the issue is the allegations of a police attack on Abner Louima or even a black view on Bill Clinton's troubles, Mr. Davis says black newspapers are almost as necessary today as when the first one was founded 170 years ago.
Finding the magic formula that will bring Mr. Davis back to The Amsterdam News, and take new readers with him, is Elinor R. Tatum's challenge. In December, she became editor in chief and publisher of The Amsterdam News, the city's oldest, best-known black paper, replacing in name, if not yet entirely in fact, her father, Wilbert A. Tatum, who owns the paper. Mr. Tatum, 65, has had health problems, from heart bypass surgery and prostate cancer to neurological damage from injuries in a fall.
"It's time," he said about his daughter's anointment.
Ms. Tatum, who is 27, has her work cut out for her. The 89-year-old Amsterdam News is profitable, and it remains a Harlem institution, its imprimatur still coveted by many politicians. But the city's media market is more competitive than ever, and its black population larger and more diverse than ever. No single paper may be capable of serving that population, but some critics, including several journalists, say The Amsterdam News has not done enough to reflect the changing face of the New York region.
There is no question that its readership is withering. The New York metropolitan region has a black population of more than 2 million, but the paper's circulation has dropped to 25,962, according to the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, down from 36,242 in 1987 and 58,905 in 1977. (Other black weeklies, like The New New York Beacon and The New York Voice, claim larger circulations, but they are not audited by the bureau, which is considered the industry standard.)
The paper's reputation, once illustrious, has fallen as well. E. R. Shipp, the Daily News columnist, recently included The Amsterdam News in a description of the country's black papers as "ghost shadows," offering "embarrassingly inept and irrelevant journalism."
Under Ms. Tatum's leadership, there has so far been no perceptible change in the paper's tone or content. As a defamation suit against Tawana Brawley's advisers proceeds in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., for instance, the paper is trying again to prove -- as it did a decade ago -- that Ms. Brawley was raped, despite a grand jury finding to the contrary. The paper has also devoted front-page space to articles from The Tribune-Review, an extremely conservative paper in the Pittsburgh area owned by Richard Mellon Scaife, alleging that the Government has covered up evidence that the death of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown was a homicide, not an accident.
"I don't want to make any bold changes," Ms. Tatum said in the paper's time-worn offices on Frederick Douglass Boulevard. "I want to do it slowly, correctly. I have to defer to him because he has the experience," she said of her father, who will, for now, continue to write editorials and have a say in the paper's content.
How The Amsterdam News fares under a new generation of leadership may be a bellwether for the nation's several hundred black papers. Dorothy R. Leavell, the president of the National Newspaper Publishers' Association, an organization of black newspaper publishers, said at least 12 of the association's 215 publishers had died last year. At those papers and others with aging leadership, succession is a pressing question. So is keeping readers and, especially, generating advertising. "We are at a crossroads," Ms. Leavell said.
All the black papers face fierce competition these days from everything from television to black-oriented Web sites.
The competition is especially thick in New York, but The Amsterdam News seems ill equipped for combat. It has only one staff reporter. It culls the rest of its content from freelancers, reprints from other papers and press releases. The office has only one computer and, unlike The New York Beacon, The Daily Challenge and other black papers, no Web site.
Nor does the paper have a Brooklyn office, although the borough now rivals Harlem as a center for the city's black population. While the paper reprints some stories and press releases about Africa and the Caribbean, it gives minimal coverage to immigrants from those areas living in the city.
Wilbert Tatum responded to criticisms of his paper by pointing to the growth in competition, as well as his paper's unionized status, alone among New York's black papers. "People say, 'What have you done?' " he said. "We're alive -- that's what the hell we've done."
Control of the paper has been firmly in Mr. Tatum's grasp since he became editor and took majority control in 1983.
"To a large extent, The Amsterdam News has become Bill Tatum," said Ken Smikle, who worked at the paper in the 1970's and is now president of Target Market News, a publication based in Chicago that covers the black media and consumer market. "The paper's personality has sort of merged with his own, for good or for bad."
That personality combines expressions of Southern sweetness, moral outrage and fiery melodrama. The paper is much the same. It features "small town in a metropolis" coverage of Harlem's galas and the region's black residents' achievements, coupled with an abundance of stories about police brutality, redlining and other manifestations of racism and discrimination.
There is also breathless, opinionated and sometimes outrageous coverage of racially polarized stories like the Brawley case -- a "certain amount of conspiracy thinking," said Dr. Roscoe Brown Jr., a professor at the City University Graduate Center.
Among those who work at or watch black newspapers, there is heated debate over whether they should be painting a more nuanced picture of black life and leadership. The Tatums -- and their counterparts at The New York Beacon and The New York Voice -- say that while mainstream papers show the negative, they exist to show the good.
To show black life, period, was the central reason black papers were founded. Segregation gave the papers a captive audience, as black readers turned to their own publications to find a favorable chronicle of their existence and follow the progress of their quest for civil rights.
But starting in the 1950's, integration and the civil rights movement sapped much of the black papers' vigor as they lost readers, journalists and advertisers to general-market papers and later to black-oriented magazines and radio stations.
Elinor Tatum also attributed her paper's drop in circulation to a more recent decision to cut back the print run in light of rising costs and distribution problems.
Joel Dreyfuss, a senior editor at Fortune magazine, said he sympathized with the difficulty of obtaining financial resources for a black publication: he recently spent over a year unsuccessfully trying to raise $8 million to start a new national black weekly. "The perception that blacks want first-class, high-quality news is still lagging," he said, adding that some black publishers seemed to share that perception -- including Mr. Tatum.
"It's an issue of quality," Mr. Dreyfuss said of The Amsterdam News. "They haven't put in the resources to demand better journalism." By focusing too narrowly on racial grievances, he said, the paper failed to capture the complexity of black life and politics in the 1990's.
The paper makes money, though, according to the Tatums, and Mr. Smikle argued that Mr. Tatum's "fiery, aggressive, outspoken political focus" was one reason why. "Shy of that," he said, "The Amsterdam News could just be swallowed up by all the other media outlets in the city."
As an editor, Mr. Tatum was never accused of being a shrinking violet. He won renown and rebuke over the years for running 104 consecutive front-page editorials calling for Edward I. Koch's resignation -- the culmination of a long-running feud between the two men -- and for printing the name of the jogger who was gang-raped in Central Park in 1989. After the Crown Heights riots, Mr. Tatum ran a headline, "Many Blacks, No Jews Arrested." That and some pieces in the paper drew accusations of anti-Semitism, which Mr. Tatum angrily denied.
He speaks with pride of his own integrated private life; he regularly mixes with whites and is married to a Jewish woman, the former Susan Kohn, who fled Czechoslovakia at the beginning of the Holocaust.
Elinor Tatum is a practicing Jew as well. "My identity is both black and Jewish, and very proud of both," Ms. Tatum said, adding that she thought it would not affect what she did at the paper.
Over time, she said, she will upgrade the paper technologically and recruit young reporters. She also hopes to beef up the arts coverage to lure young readers, she said, noting that the paper's Arts and Entertainment editor has been there for 52 years. The paper has already hired a new assistant to the publisher, Robert E. Seixas, who is 25 and, like Ms. Tatum, attended New York University's journalism program.
Ms. Tatum, who was raised on the Lower East Side, lives there in a building owned by her father and around the corner from her parents' home. An only child, Ms. Tatum said she had a "privileged upbringing, but not sheltered," noting that she grew up on a block with a homeless men's shelter. She attended the private Dwight School, then on the East Side, where her passion was theater, not journalism.
She graduated from St. Lawrence University in upstate New York, working her way up to editor at large of the campus paper. She started work at The Amsterdam News in 1994.
She appears poised and at ease with political notables like David N. Dinkins or the Rev. Al Sharpton. But in her comments about the paper, she seemed to feel the weight of history and high expectations on her shoulders.
"The paper is basically being handed to me by my father," she said. "I've got to keep it going for the next generation."

Chart: "New Voices"
Over the last five years or so, a host of new small publications, often put out by just a few people using increasingly affordable technology, have joined the mix of black newspapers in New York City. Below is a sampling:
 
The Black Star News Founded 1997
Publisher: Milton G. Allimadi
Circulation: Monthly. Last issue sold out a 20,000 print run.
The scoop: The Ugandan-born Mr. Allimadi, a graduate of Columbia University School of Journalism and a former deputy editor at The City Sun, got the money to start his paper from Bill and Camille Cosby.
His monthly covers everything from the African continent to health care to the history of black hair and has a literary feel. Eventually, he would like to make the paper a weekly.
 
The KIP Business Report Founded 1997
Publisher: Lloyd C. Grant
Circulation: Aimed at 25,000 black business owners and professionals in New York and New Jersey, as well as policy makers.
The scoop: Middle income blacks, Mr. Grant observed, tend to fly beneath the radar of the major media and above that of the local black press. Co-founded by Cynthia Y. Franklin, its editor, The Report tries to provide an extended business grapevine and monitor the economy from a black perspective.
 
The New York World Founded 1993
Publisher: Franklin Solis
Circulation: Monthly; 35,000 copies distributed free in Brooklyn and downtown Manhattan.
The scoop: Mr. Solis, a former advertising salesman, started this paper, initially called The Brooklyn Advocate, because there was no free black or Latino publication in Brooklyn at the time. To keep his paper true to the grass roots, he said, he accepts advertising only from local businesses. He covers local people and events.
 
Our Time Press Founded 1995
Publisher: David Mark Greaves and Bernice Elizabeth Green
Circulation: Monthly; 25,000 distributed free in Brooklyn, Harlem and lower Manhattan.
The scoop: He left his job as a project manager for a moving company; she left hers in media relations at CBS. We felt there was a lot of information the African-American community wasn't getting, Mr. Greaves said. The couple operates off a computer and out of a Clinton Hill storefront, covering issues from multilateral trade agreements to local black history.

CITING ASIAN CRISIS, LAM RESEARCH ANNOUNCES JOB CUTS

BYLINE: Dow Jones 

 BODY:
The Lam Research Corporation said yesterday that it would cut 700 jobs, or 14 percent of its work force, in a reorganization the company attributed to Asia's financial crisis. Lam, a maker of equipment for manufacturing computer chips, said it expected lower prospects for orders and revenue from its Asian customers. Lam Research said it would take a third-quarter pretax charge of $80 million to $85 million because of the reorganization, which also includes closing plants and writing down the value of certain assets. Lam Research, based in Fremont, Calif., had revenues of $582 million in the six months ended Dec. 31. Lam announced the cuts after its stock gained $2.125, to $28.4375.

I.B.M. Sells Another Site

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The International Business Machines Corporation is nearing the end of a major sale of its real estate holdings that it began four years ago.
In recent years, I.B.M. has disposed of more than 14 million square feet of office, warehouse and industrial space across the country, according to real estate executives. The latest sale came earlier this week in Endicott, N.Y., the town where I.B.M. got its start about 80 years ago. 
 The company sold its 127-acre Glendale Technology Park to the Glencott Realty Corporation, a Manhattan investment company, for $6.5 million. The one-million-square-foot site, which once housed I.B.M.'s software development laboratory, had been on the market for three years in an area that is only beginning to recover from the recession. About 40 percent of the 17 buildings in the $100 million complex are occupied by several state agencies, and the companies Telespectrum and Nationwide Credit. I.B.M., however, still has a major presence in the area.
"Glendale Technology Park is truly a diamond in the rough," said Lawrence J. Bijou, a director at Cushman & Wakefield, who represented the buyer. "This is a Class A facility in a tertiary market that is rebounding nicely."
Robert A. Mead, a real estate consultant, represented I.B.M. in the sale.
James Ruderman, a spokesman for I.B.M., said that the Glendale campus was the last major parcel in the country that it had put up for sale. The remaining sites are small and scattered across the country.
Also this week, I.B.M. sold its 257-acre Ulster Business Complex to the investor Alan Ginsberg for more than $20 million. It has also sold a 3 million square foot complex in Boca Raton, Fla., and a 200-acre complex in Franklin Lakes, N.J., that had been closed in 1993. CHARLES V. BAGLI

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Another Day, Another High; Dow and S.&P. Climb Again

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from an early drop to reach its third consecutive new high yesterday as investors discounted unsettling news from Asia.
Mirroring the trend of weaker equity markets in Asia and Europe, stocks opened lower on Wall Street, with the Dow falling as much as 76.23 points before climbing in late afternoon trading. 
 Casting a pall on this week's rally were fears of growing political protests in Indonesia over its economic crisis and fears that the United States might not support the Indonesian Government's plan to impose monetary controls.
Those concerns pushed Indonesia's benchmark equity index down 9.3 percent yesterday, and stock markets in Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Malaysia, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines each lost more than 1 percent.
While American stocks have been gaining in recent days -- with both the Dow average and the Standard & Poor's 500 index posting new highs on the belief that Asia's impact on corporate earnings has been limited, -- the early selloff "tells you the focus is still on Asia," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at the First Albany Corporation.
"From time to time, it starts to look like all the pieces in Asia are going to come apart," Mr. Johnson said. "If you ask me what the stock market is going to do tomorrow, I'd ask you how many people are going to be marching in the streets of Indonesia or in the streets of Malaysia."
As evidence of investor concerns, stocks of multinational corporations like AT&T, Walt Disney, Merck, General Electric and Coca-Cola, which have also been some of the Dow's better performers this year, were lower in early trading.
However, comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin yesterday seemed to allay some investor concerns, analysts said. In comments to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, both called on Congress to support the United States commitment to contribute to the International Monetary Fund's bailouts of the faltering Asian economies.
Traders and analysts said those remarks as well as the economic fundamentals of this country, including low inflation, low unemployment and moderate economic growth, pulled investors back into the market.
"Once it stabilized, after the first people stuck their foot in the water, it was just everybody in the pool," said Michael W. Clark, a managing director and head of United States equity trading at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
In pushing the Dow to another record close, investors ignored reports that President Clinton plans to call for a $1 increase over two years in the minimum wage, bringing it to $6.15 by 1999, said Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen & Company. In previous remarks, Mr. Greenspan had warned that rising wage pressures could aggravate inflation and hurt the economy.
The Dow finished at 8,369.60, up 55.05 points. Over the last 14 trading days, the Dow average has risen 668.86 points, or 8.7 percent.
The S.& P. 500 also reached its seventh new high in the last nine trading days, closing at 1,024.14, up 4.13 points. The Nasdaq composite index, heavily weighted with technology shares that had fallen early in the day, finished up 5.79 points, to 1,714,34. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled more than 611 million shares.
Some investors were perplexed by the market's turnaround.
"I was surprised at the strength of the market," said Michelle Clayman, chief investment officer and chief executive of New Amsterdam Partners, a New York-based investment management firm. Since she is only forecasting that the stock market will increase about 10 percent this year, Ms. Clayman said that since the Dow has already risen more than 5 percent in 1998, she anticipates a modest retreat.
However, New Amsterdam, which has become more domestically focused since late last summer, was employing a well-tested investor strategy of buying on the dips yesterday, Ms. Clayman said.

HEADLINE: December Business Inventories Grew 0.4%

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Stockpiles of unsold goods accumulated steadily on store shelves in December, the Commerce Department said today in a report that may foreshadow slower economic growth in 1998.
 Total business inventories increased four-tenths of a percent in December to a seasonally adjusted $1.048 trillion -- the 18th consecutive month without a decline -- after gaining a revised three-tenths of a percent in November. 
 Analysts said much of the inventory buildup had been in response to brisk demand so the December report was not worrisome. But there have been signs that consumers may be curbing their spending pace.
 Lynn Reaser, an economist at Nationsbank in Jacksonville, Fla., said the relatively weak retail sales of the last three months, as reported by the Government on Thursday, may lead to an adjustment as companies restrain production to avoid an excessive buildup of unsold goods.
It remains unclear whether consumer spending, which accounts for the bulk of economic activity, is about to slow significantly. But a new consumer confidence survey distributed today showed growing optimism about the economy's future. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index, based on survey results, rose to a record 110.1 in February from 106.6 in January.
 A Labor Department report today showed a 1.3 percent drop in import prices in January, more than twice the six-tenths of a percent fall in export prices. Imported oil fell 9.9 percent -- the biggest price drop since December 1993 -- a restraint on consumer prices since industry is highly dependent upon foreign oil.

Prices End Higher in a Shortened Session

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended higher in a shortened session yesterday, drawing foreign investors after stock prices slumped in Asia.
Gains in bonds were limited, however, by a survey showing that consumers were more upbeat and likely to spend more, reviving concerns about a pickup in inflation. 
 The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to a record 110.1 in February, from 106.6 in January, traders said. (The survey is released only to subscribers.)
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose a quarter-point, to 103 30/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.84 percent, from 5.86 percent on Thursday. The Treasury market closed early yesterday, at 2 P.M., and will be closed on Monday in observance of Presidents' Day.
While some investors were buying yesterday because of the weakness in Asian markets, others were booking profits on the upticks in price.
A report on business inventories in December gave the market some comfort since it suggested that growth the next quarter might be reduced as companies cut back production to get rid of some of their inventory accumulation of goods, said Anthony Chan, chief economist for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
Next week, the market will focus on producer prices and housing starts on Wednesday and December trade data on Thursday.

HEADLINE: I.M.F. Opposing Indonesia's Plan For Currency

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund tried today to veto Indonesia's plan for changing how it values its beleaguered currency, setting up a showdown with President Suharto that could have profound implications for the world's fourth-most-populous nation.
The fund, which has promised $43 billion in assistance to help the country recover from the financial instability that has swept Asia, said Indonesia was not ready to adopt the high-risk, high-reward recovery strategy for its currency that Mr. Suharto had settled upon in recent weeks. 
 "We are of the strong view that this moment has not yet come in Indonesia," Michel Camdessus, the fund's managing director, said in response to a question from the audience after a speech here.
Mr. Camdessus did not say how the fund would respond if Mr. Suharto went ahead with his plan, which would lock the Indonesian currency's value to that of the dollar under a mechanism known as a currency board.
If successful, the move would greatly strengthen the currency and help Indonesian industrialists, not least among them members of Mr. Suharto's family, who have long used their connections to amass great wealth and who have been influential proponents of the strategy. If it failed, it could leave Indonesia's foreign currency reserves depleted and its economy in an even steeper downward spiral.
The I.M.F. is scheduled to disburse another $3 billion to Indonesia next month, but must review Mr. Suharto's economic management and give it a passing grade before doing so. While the fund has temporarily cut off aid to other nations that have failed to live up to bailout agreements, including Russia, Mr. Camdessus would have to consider the risks to financial markets throughout Asia and around the world if he were to move against Indonesia.
Mr. Suharto met in Jakarta today with Steven Hanke, an economist from Johns Hopkins University who has been a leading advocate of adopting a currency board. Mr. Hanke said after the meeting that the Indonesian leader was committed to going ahead with the plan and would continue to discuss it with the fund.
One day after Mr. Suharto ordered the military to take "stern action" to deal with his opponents, there were reports today of rioting in at least eight towns by residents angry about rapidly rising prices for many basic goods. Although there has been sporadic unrest for a month because of the economic crisis, there are few signs that the 76-year-old Mr. Suharto is losing his grip on power after 32 years in office.
Officials from the I.M.F. and their counterparts at the World Bank and in the Clinton Administration have been raising doubts about Mr. Suharto's emerging strategy in recent days, and the fund dispatched an envoy from Washington this week to tell the Indonesian leader of its concerns.
Today, Mr. Camdessus turned up the pressure, leaving no question that the fund was strongly opposed to Mr. Suharto's plan and would work to stop it.
Mr. Camdessus said adoption of a currency board, which has proved successful in Hong Kong, Argentina and other economies, might one day be appropriate in Indonesia. But he said that if Indonesia adopted a currency board now, it might well fail, risking deeper economic and political turmoil.
Mr. Suharto's Government, Mr. Camdessus said, has not yet done enough to strengthen the banking system, deal with foreign debts and bolster the nation's foreign currency reserves -- all steps that economists say are necessary before Indonesia can cope with the short-term economic strains that Mr. Suharto's approach would entail.
Mr. Camdessus emphasized twice that his statement represented the unanimous view of the I.M.F. executive board, which is dominated by the United States and the other big industrial democracies.
Mr. Camdessus, however, did not address what American and international officials have acknowledged to be another of their primary concerns: that Mr. Suharto's backing of the plan may be driven in part by his family's desire to minimize its financial losses from the instability sweeping the country.
Two of Mr. Suharto's children reportedly helped Mr. Hanke win access to the Indonesian leader to convince him of the merits of the currency board. Like other business owners who have debts in dollars and large holdings of the Indonesian currency, the rupiah, they would benefit greatly from the plan.
Under the plan, the rupiah's value would be pegged at around 5,500 to the dollar, significantly stronger than its recent rate. Today, the rupiah settled at 8,200 to the dollar, down 11 percent from where it traded on Thursday.
Under a currency board, the Government would effectively give up control of monetary policy. The Government would pledge to do whatever was necessary to maintain the exchange rate at its fixed level, primarily by using its foreign currency reserves to purchase rupiah and by allowing interest rates to rise.

HEADLINE: Havana Journal;
Remember the Maine? Cubans See an American Plot Continuing to This Day

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
The old monument still towers over the Malecon, Havana's tattered seafront promenade, but it has been stripped of most of its original busts and plaques, including the eagle that once crowned it. Clearly, even after 100 years, remembering the Maine has a different meaning in Cuba than in the United States.
"To the victims of the Maine, who were sacrificed to imperialist greed in its fervor to seize control of the island of Cuba," reads an inscription at the base of the memorial. 
 Only two rusted cannon and a weathered tablet listing the 267 American sailors who died in the still-unexplained sinking of the battleship remain intact at the site.
As generations of schoolchildren in the United States, Cuba and Spain have been taught, the Maine blew up in Havana on Feb. 15, 1898, leading to a four-month war that freed Cuba from Spanish rule and made Puerto Rico an American possession.
Now, with the centennial of that war looming, Cuba has embarked on a campaign to selectively revive memories of the conflict as a tool to be used, scholars and diplomats say, in disputes with the United States and Spain.
The Cuban Government's position is perhaps most succinctly conveyed in the title of a new book, written by a prominent Cuban historian, about to be published here: " '98 -- The War That Does Not Cease."
From President Fidel Castro on down, officials are seizing every opportunity to portray the conflict as the beginning of a century of American hostility and avarice toward Cuba and to minimize the United States role in what is known here as the Spanish-Cuban War or the Second War of Independence.
Mr. Castro set the tone in welcoming remarks to Pope John Paul II on Jan. 21 that attacked the United States as well as Spain. Cuba, he maintained, "had to fight alone for its independence," and in doing so fell victim to "a veritable holocaust" at the hands of Spanish colonial oppressors.
"Today," Mr. Castro continued, "genocide is again being attempted when some try to subdue this people, which refuses to accept the dictates and rule of the mightiest economic, political and military power in history, by means of hunger, illness and total suffocation."
Subsequent comments made clear that he was referring to the 37-year American economic embargo of Cuba, especially the 1996 Helms-Burton Act tightening such sanctions.
A week later, on the 145th anniversary of the birth of Jose Marti, Cuba's national hero, Mr. Castro's brother Raul, the country's Defense Minister, lashed out even more strongly. In a speech in Santiago, where much of the war was fought, he announced plans to put up new monuments to the rebel Mambi army "that the Yankees refused to let enter" Santiago and to the victims of the Spanish, whose toll he put at 300,000.
In an interview at Jose Marti National Library here, Eliades Acosta Matos, who is director of the institution and author of the forthcoming book on the war, offered the standard Cuban interpretation of the sinking of the Maine: that the United States itself probably did it. The same "powerful economic interests" that had an interest in doing so, he argued, may also have been involved in a conspiracy that may have been responsible for the assassinations of Presidents Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley.
Dr. Acosta said a series of conferences and discussions of the war would be held here throughout 1998, along with expositions of documents and photographs from the period. Such commemorations, he said, are a matter of "historical justice" and of reminding Cubans how their national identity was forged.
"Everyone wants to forget, but 1898 is still alive and relevant, and we ought to be able to bury it," he said. "A century later, the main actors in the war still have important differences. Relations with the United States and Spain are not normal, and Cuba is still defending itself from nearly 100 years of blockade and disrespect for its liberty and right to self-determination."
But Jaime Suchlicki, author of "Cuba: From Columbus to Castro and Beyond," an English-language history widely used in the United States, takes another view. He notes that before Mr. Castro seized power in 1959, most Cubans were taught that "Cuba became independent as a result of U.S. help" and that there was no knowing "how long it would have taken Cubans to defeat the Spaniards had the Americans not come in."
As for the sinking of the Maine, "conventional historiography taught that either the explosion was an accident or that Cubans did it themselves to provoke American intervention," added Dr. Suchlicki, who is a professor of history at the University of Miami. "Accusing the U.S. of blowing up the Maine is just a way of linking the war to all of the propaganda that blames the U.S. for Cuba's current problems."
It was gratitude for the United States role in the struggle for independence that led Cubans to build the monument to the Maine, which was dedicated in 1925, damaged by a hurricane a year later and subsequently restored. But in May 1961, just days after the Bay of Pigs invasion, a crowd assembled at the site to hold an anti-American rally and to watch as a crane toppled "the eagle of imperialism" from its pedestal atop a pair of 40-foot columns.
Today, the shattered remains of the eagle's wings and body lie in a heap at a downtown museum. There, groups of visiting schoolchildren are taught that the American intervention "sought to invalidate 30 years of immense pain and glorious battles," according to the museum display that the sinking of the Maine was merely "a pretext for the U.S. to participate in the Spanish-Cuban War."
The head of the eagle was rescued by Cubans sympathetic to the United States and turned over to the Swiss Embassy, which handled American interests in Cuba after diplomatic relations were broken in 1960. It is now mounted on a wall in a snack bar at the American Interests Section, Washington's quasi-embassy here, awaiting better relations between the countries.
"A lot of Cubans say they look forward to the day that the head and the body of the eagle will be reunited," said Michael Kozak, the senior American diplomat here, who has a copy of the intact eagle on display in the garden of his official residence.
At San Juan Hill in Santiago, where Theodore Roosevelt led the famous charge against Spanish troops that eventually propelled him into the White House, the authorities have taken a different approach.
At the top, there are monuments to Cuban combatants and even one honoring "the Spanish soldier, who knew how to die heroically in the performance of his duty," but nothing commemorating what Roosevelt called "the great day of my life."
"This park has been all but forgotten," said its unofficial caretaker, Eliezer Jorge Montelier, 21. Anything that once acknowledged Roosevelt's feat "has been removed," he added, though a pit for Cuban soldiers has been dug at the summit in recent years, "in case of an enemy invasion."
But Santiago is eager to attract tourists, and so there are plans to restore the original English-language plaques at San Juan Hill and open a historical museum near Siboney Beach, where 15,000 American troops landed in June 1898. With a centennial conference on the war to be held in Santiago in late June and early July, Dr. Acosta promised that the treatment given the American role in those events would be evenhanded.
"Americans died for the freedom of Cuba, and that should be recognized," he said. "But others wanted to annex Cuba, and that should be criticized. If relations with the United States improve, all these things can be re-examined more fairly."

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE RUSSIANS;
Russia's Stake In Iraq Bolsters Anti-War Cry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Feb. 13

 BODY:
Seven years ago, the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, begrudgingly blessed the American-led campaign to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
But now President Boris N. Yeltsin and his top aides have led the opposition to American military action against Iraq. 
 From Moscow's political and business elite to the people on the street, most Russians oppose an American air strike to punish Saddam Hussein's Government for thumbing its nose at United Nations inspectors.
Russia's opposition stems from a potent combination of foreign policy and commercial interests. In one example of the economic stakes, Lukoil, Russia's premier oil company, has signed a $3.8 billion agreement to develop Iraq's Qurna oil field once economic sanctions are removed.
But the Russian stance is also a matter of national psychology.
Russians know the United States won the cold war. But many still find it hard to accept that the United States has the power, the will and the resources to launch a military campaign in the face of determined Russian opposition.
"What gives the United States the right to attack Iraq without other nations' permission?" said an aide to a Russian bank president.
It is a message that ripples through an array of new public opinion surveys here. Russian polls show that many Russians think that United States has recklessly picked a fight with its old nemesis and is arrogantly throwing its weight around. Even American polls here chronicle a tidal wave of popular Russian opposition. A survey by the United States Information Agency shows that most Russians do not want Iraq to have chemical and biological weapons.
Still, 8 of 10 people in Moscow and in St. Petersburg, a liberal stronghold, oppose "all military action needed to eliminate Iraq's chemical and biological weapons and its capability to produce them," the survey shows. And that opposition comes from Russians who are generally more sympathetic to Western views, the agency notes.
None of this means that Russia wants to forge an military alliance with Iraq or renew cold war hostilities with the United States. There is no serious talk of providing military assistance to Baghdad.
Americans officials were disturbed when United Nations inspectors found a document indicating that Russian specialists and Iraqi officials were discussing the sale of equipment that could be used as part of a biological warfare program.
But they say Russia has a generally satisfactory record of observing the economic sanctions against Iraq. Nor is the Yeltsin Government threatening to openly flout the sanctions if American force is used.
Russian experts say American bombing will make it more difficult to win approval of the Start 2 treaty in Russia's Parliament. But the Russian military is unlikely to withdraw its support for the accord, if only because Russia's nuclear force is shrinking with age and the treaty would reduce American strategic weapons.
Still, there is no doubt that American and Russian interests seriously diverge.
Russia's foreign policy team, headed by Yevgeny Primakov, a former spymaster, has enjoyed close ties with Baghdad since Soviet days and it sees the crisis as a way to regain influence in the Middle East.
Russian oil barons are eager to dispel the threat of war and see economic sanctions lifted so they can do business in Iraq. Lukoil is eager to get started on its 23-year agreement to develop oil fields in Iraq.
"We will be ready to start practical work two months after the embargo is lifted and to bring in equipment and people," said Dmitry Dolgov, Lukoil's spokesman.
The Russian Government also hopes that Iraq will be able to repay billions of dollars it owes for weapons supplied by the Soviet Union if and when sanctions are lifted.
"Russia has an economic interest in restoring ties with Iraq, and Russian businessmen are prepared to work with their Iraqi colleagues," Gennady Seleznyov, the Communist speaker of the Parliament, said last year.
That was underscored when the head of the Volgograd Tractor Plant proudly announced today that the company had concluded a $5 million agreement to sell Iraq 250 tractors. Although this deal was approved under the terms of the United Nations relief program, it is the kind of trade the cash-strapped Russians would like to see expand.
There is also the matter of hurt pride. Its not that Russians love Saddam Hussein. But they have a hard time accepting that Moscow is only marginally relevant to Washington's geopolitical calculations.
The public's anxiety over Russia's decline as a world power was papered over to an extent during the debate over NATO expansion. Russia and NATO worked out an accord that gives Moscow a voice, but not a veto, on alliance decisions.
But there is no easy way to smooth over the current dispute. Taking center stage, Mr. Primakov staked Russian prestige on a diplomatic settlement that would stop American bombs from falling on Iraq. And now the diplomacy appears to be collapsing and both Iraq and the United States seem determined to fight.
Add to that the generally nationalist tone of the Russian press, which has shown American aircraft carriers steaming toward the Persian Gulf even as the Russian military remains a picture of decay and weakness.
A banner headline in Izvestia this week reported that an American air strike could unleash a deadly cloud of chemical gas throughout the Middle East, based on analyses by the Government weather forecasting service.
And last week, radio talk shows here were abuzz over reports of an American plan to hit Iraq's weapons sites with tactical nuclear weapons.
"Most of those polled are just afraid of a war and as usual do not understand quite clearly what is going on," said Yuri A. Levada, the head of the respected polling company, Vtsiom.
With the possibility of American military action drawing closer, Mr. Primakov today made a bid for more time. After meeting here with the American Secretary of Defense, William S. Cohen, Mr. Primakov urged Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, to go to Baghdad to discuss a possible political settlement.
But not even Russia's media held out much hope for a diplomatic breakthrough on Iraq -- or an upturn in American-Russian relations.
The independent NTV television network dutifully reported tonight that Mr. Cohen and Mr. Primakov appeared pleased after their meeting.
But then the network added sarcastically: "Maybe Mr. Cohen was satisfied with the results or maybe he was simply glad to leave the country before a spell of cold weather came."

HEADLINE: AUTO UNION BACKS TENTATIVE ACCORD WITH CATERPILLAR

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Feb. 13

 BODY:
In a reflection of the labor troubles faced by America's traditional, smoke-stack worker unions, leaders of the United Automobile Workers today endorsed a proposed contract with Caterpillar to end the longest labor dispute of the decade.
The deal, which includes a two-tier wage scale and drops the unfair-labor-practice charges against Caterpillar, is not much better than the one the union rejected more than two years ago. 
 The agreement stands in stark contrast to the triumph scored last summer by United Parcel Service strikers.
It also comes at a time when American unions are pushing hard to demonstrate a renewed vitality in a prosperous economy and have had some significant victories.
The success of U.P.S., most experts say, illustrates the differences between the industrial and service sector.
A factory, with its stockpile of machines awaiting shipment, feels little pain at the beginning of a strike, said Michael Belzer, a labor scholar at the University of Michigan. A company like U.P.S., on the other hand, had no time to waste. If packages were not delivered in a timely manner, it could devastate the company -- which had a significant impact in its negotiating stance with its union.
"Some days you win, some days you lose, and some days you just get rained out," Mr. Belzer said. "For labor, this day was clearly a loss."
The battle with Caterpillar was truly lost more than two years ago, Mr. Belzer said, when the U.A.W. folded its tent in December 1995, after a 17-month strike and told its workers to return to their jobs. Indeed, thousands had already done so, crossing picket lines in defiance of union leadership.
"A generation or two ago, it would have been inconceivable to see workers at Caterpillar cross the lines," Mr. Belzer said. "And that really weakened them."
Caterpillar also had a much easier time finding replacement workers, in part, because it employed 13,000 workers -- compared with the 185,000 workers at U.P.S. In addition, since the factory workers are better paid -- the average worker at Caterpillar earns about $18 an hour -- it was easier for the company to find replacements.
Without any international cooperation among unions, Caterpillar workers outside the United States went right on producing heavy machinery, working overtime to increase the output.
In its domestic factories, the company used modern, computer-based production lines to stay in operation. Non-union workers, including secretaries and bookkeepers, performed the manufacturing tasks with the assistance of union members who crossed the picket lines and an ample and seemingly endless supply of replacement workers.
In fact, even with most of its veteran and highly skilled factory workers on strike, this major manufacturer of complicated machinery was not only able to continue making its products but to also earn record profits of $1.67 billion in 1997.
The deal, worked out with Federal mediators in Chicago in a marathon bargaining session, would allow some workers who had been discharged for union activities to return to work. The accord would also count time spent on strike in calculating retirement benefits. But under the proposed two-tiered wage, new workers would be paid a lower hourly rate than the prevailing wage of existing employees.
The contract, which would run for six years, rather than the typical three, also calls for the union to re-admit members who crossed the picket lines to return to their jobs.
And despite the weakened contract analysts noted the importance of securing a contract at all. Workers had been without a contract since 1991, and many believed that Caterpillar had hoped to be free of the union.
In announcing the tentative agreement, Caterpillar's vice-president, Wayne Zimmerman, said the company was "very, very happy and satisfied."
But the union's vice-president, Richard Schoemaker, did not shower the accord with praise, saying only that he believed the rank-and-file would endorse it.
The deal is expected to go to a vote of union members on the weekend of Feb. 21.
Inside the factory gates in Peoria, there was plenty of anxious talk among workers about the accord. After the three o'clock whistle, as workers poured out of the plant, some of them were simply shaking their head with disgust.
"Everybody in the shop is disappointed," said one worker, who would not give his name. "They weren't all that surprised, but they were hoping for more."
After the farm crisis of the 1980's, which severely hurt Caterpillar and other makers of big equipment, the company took a tough, uncompromising stance with the union in the early 90's.
Caterpillar brought the union to its knees in 1992, successfully ending a strike after threatening to hire replacement workers.
Two years later, with no progress on a contract, the union went on strike again, alleging unfair labor practices. This time, the company did hire replacement workers during the 17-month walk-out that ended in December when union leaders told workers to return to their jobs.
The company, saying it would not discharge any replacement workers, did not initially have jobs for all union members, saying that some would have to wait for openings. By now, all of those union members have been given the chance to return to work.
But the cases of more than 100 other Caterpillar workers -- people discharged for union activities -- have not been resolved. The union contends that these workers were illegally terminated.
George Boze, a vice-president at local 974 here, said one union worker was discharged when he ordered a man who crossed a picket line to leave his daughter's wedding reception.
But there were also allegations of cars being damaged and workers being harassed by union members.
According to the proposed agreement, the company would immediately rehire some of these workers. The cases of the others would go to Federal arbitration.
"At this point, nobody knows who might get called back," said Mr. Boze. "There's no list of names yet."
 For all its negotiating successes, Caterpillar has much fence-mending to do with its work force, if friendly labor relations are a goal, as the company has insisted.
Among rank-and-file workers at Caterpillar, there is profound resentment toward the company.
There is also plenty of hostility remaining toward the replacement workers hired during the strike, as well as the workers who crossed the picket lines.
Euel Smith, an inspections worker who crossed the picket line in 1994, said the feelings had "mellowed quite a bit" but would never heal.
Mr. Smith, 52, started working at the factory at age 19, and many of the faces here are familiar to him. But friendships soured, he said, when he crossed the picket line.
"If we're doing something at work, they'll talk to me about business," Mr. Smith said. "But once we're outside the job, a lot of them will just turn and look the other way."
Some workers clearly do not believe the company is paying its fair share.
"If the vote was based on the 20 people I talked to tonight, I'd say 98 percent are going to vote against this thing," said Fay Vogelsang, 48, a union member who has worked at Caterpillar for 23 years. "I feel like we're selling Manhattan for a necklace of beads."

HONOR'S VOICE
 The Transformation
 of Abraham Lincoln.
 By Douglas L. Wilson.
 383 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $30. 
 We think we know him. But what do we really know, especially about the private man whom we all suspect to be somehow crucially tied to the public one? "Historians are forever doomed to ignorance about the early life of Abraham Lincoln," began "The Last Best Hope of Earth" (1993), a brief volume that summed up more than 20 years of learning about Lincoln by the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Mark E. Neely Jr. Now comes Douglas L. Wilson with "Honor's Voice," a solid new portrait of the private Lincoln between the ages of 22 and 33, during the years 1831-42, that puts him in a strikingly fresh light.
The book starts not from the President's legendary greatness but from his actual beginnings. Wilson, the Saunders Director of the International Center for Jefferson Studies at Monticello, focuses with careful intensity on otherwise antiquarian oral reminiscences that help illuminate Lincoln's rise. Wilson tells a story about a search for identity and self-definition, and follows Lincoln's very exacting road of self-education, his finding of a vocation in law and politics, and the partial resolution of his painfully difficult relations with women.
The evolution of his religious outlook might illustrate his education. Raised a Baptist, Lincoln never outgrew a sense of fatalism, even "a nameless sense of . . . doom." But he had the strength to go against the grain, and he quickly found the skeptics. He read in Thomas Paine about "a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost": it is the story of the Virgin Mary.
The law student, while teaching himself the rules of evidence, wrote two manuscripts of religious skepticism, long lost but also long remembered by his contemporaries. According to John T. Stuart, his first law partner, Lincoln "went further against Christian beliefs . . . than any man I ever heard." As he advanced in politics, Lincoln muted his heathenish talk, but even during this early period he learned to present himself, when necessary, "as an unfortunate victim of unbelief." A hypocrite? Wilson's readers can decide; but Lincoln was certainly someone with a sense of self-preservation. And someone at this time a very long way from the Second Inaugural.
In politics and law Lincoln rose from successful frontier fighter to peacemaker who fought with words. At times the words were not honest, and relied on smear and innuendo. Yet Lincoln carried a "compulsion" to help the helpless, and learned, to quote the Shakespeare he had come to love, that the best of men "have pow'r to hurt and will do none."
His most troublesome problem was women. The young man who had lost his mother at the age of 9 always felt awkward around them -- except for older women. He loved Ann Rutledge, she died and he fell apart. Friends and, in time, work helped Lincoln back from a perhaps suicidal mental breakdown. The depth of his grief suggests to Wilson that Ann's death challenged the core of his being. His central goal in life, his wish to rise, "to shape and even to control events," now seemed "nothing but foolish vanity."
Ambivalence characterized his later courtships and various marriage proposals. A possible reason for this, at least for a period of time, may have been a fear of syphilis -- not an unknown disease in his world. Wilson does not credit stories of Lincoln's possible love children but notes two episodes with prostitutes. If once or twice, why not more often? His longtime law partner, William H. Herndon, thought that "Lincoln had a strong if not a terrible passion for women: he could hardly keep his hands off." Nor would he get married until he was 33.
As Lincoln the outsider learned to be an insider, deep anxieties beset him about his ability to make a living, about success in law, about polite society. His journey led him from country to village to town, where he found the exciting, highborn Mary Todd. A superficial courtship was followed by a commitment to marry. In a brief diversion, he became smitten by another woman, but Mary did not let go. As his brother-in-law put it, "Lincoln in his conflicts of duty-honor and his love went as crazy as a Loon." In time he recovered the ability to rule himself, strengthening his self-respect by getting married. Love, Wilson suggests, seems to have had "very little to do with it."
Lincoln's road, therefore, was both harder and "swampier" than legend -- or scholars -- have allowed: the difficulties and temptations wider, the fears and depressions deeper. By 34 he appeared to have overcome his troubles, but not many signs of future greatness had yet turned up.
After 130-some years of Lincoln appraisals, how can a scholar, especially one as extraordinarily careful and fair as Wilson, create a startlingly new Lincoln? Wilson's achievement stems in part from the respect the culture has acquired for oral history (which often gives voice to the voiceless) and from his having put together, with his colleague Rodney O. Davis, the Szold Professor of History at Knox College, the definitive edition of the reminiscences of about 250 people who knew Lincoln: "Herndon's Informants: Letters, Interviews, and Statements About Abraham Lincoln" (1998). The two men have also been assembling, but have not yet published, the similarly massive recollections of Herndon himself -- the person who knew Lincoln better than anyone but Mary Todd. Historians have long used these oft-conflicting, difficult-to-read manuscripts, but Wilson's familiarity with them is unsurpassed.
The bulk of the reminiscences collected by Herndon were from 1865-66 and, as Wilson explains, emphasize the "honorable, or at least unobjectionable." But "Honor's voice," as Wilson calls them, "can tell us a great deal, and sometimes tells us much more than it intended."
This book establishes Wilson as the leading historian of the young and private Lincoln. Still, others sifting through the same sources may reach somewhat different conclusions, or take matters further. Consider the story about Lincoln's visiting a prostitute and, after undressing, realizing that he is $2 short of the needed $5 fee. He is offered credit but he departs, leaving the woman astonished at his integrity. Wilson knows that this sounds like "a deliberate parody of the Honest Abe Lincoln legend," yet he accepts it. But might not a less cautious biographer venture an additional step, teasing out of this story and other evidence the possibility of a homosexual young man, even if observers and participants failed to speak of such?
Focusing on the private Lincoln while mostly ignoring the public one can obscure the private, too. For example, to prevent a quorum at a session of the Illinois State Legislature in 1840, Representative Lincoln jumped out of a window of the building where the members were meeting. Wilson sees this as a sign of private distress. That the leap was intended to influence important financial legislation during a debilitating economic depression is largely lost. Biographers, then, will have to use "Honor's Voice" with both admiration and a critical eye.
IT is profitable to divide the Lincoln literature roughly into two schools: "Lincoln the man" and "Lincoln the god." Both have their uses. Wilson's book, with its understated, even prose, falls plainly into the first camp, and it makes a fine counterpoint to Garry Wills's "Lincoln at Gettysburg," with its portrait of a President who "remade America" with a brief speech. Had Wilson claimed to be showing all of Lincoln, he might be criticized for missing some of the elements that make his subject great. As it is, he makes a very important start toward a new understanding of the greatest of Americans.
Writing about Lincoln is not something to be brushed off as simply a scholarly exercise. In our multicultural age, he remains a man of world-historic significance, the very symbol of what is best about the United States. During the Iranian revolution, a reporter saw a big painted slogan in Teheran: "Government of the people, by the people, for the people." During Jiang Zemin's recent visit to the United States, the Chinese President conjured up Lincoln's memory. So has Pope John Paul II. When Colin Powell announced his refusal to run for the Presidency, he held up but one name. The Lincoln scholar's responsibilities are large. "Honor's Voice" gives Americans reason to be grateful that the field continues to attract students of ability and integrity.

A RIVER LOST: The Life and Death of the Columbia
By Blaine Harden. Norton, $13.
An author who grew up in the shadow of the Grand Coulee Dam chronicles the passage of the Columbia from a swift-moving, salmon-filled waterway to a polluted series of brackish lakes. He "has written a hard-nosed, clear-eyed, tough-minded dispatch," Hal Espen said here in 1996. The many lives that were shaped by these once-rushing waters are the theme of RIVER OF THE WEST: Stories From the Columbia, by Robert Clark (Picador USA, $15). In 1995 one critic called the book "an original and vibrant account."
 
FLYING HOME: And Other Stories
By Ralph Ellison.
Edited by John F. Callahan.Vintage International, $12.
This posthumous collection, which includes six previously unpublished works, captures Ellison's youthful voice and many of the themes he would expand on in his novel, "Invisible Man." All written between 1937 and 1954, the stories reflect the dislocation of black Americans and the cruelties, large and small, they were expected to endure. In one, a young white boy, a visitor in town, relates what it was like to watch a lynching; in another, a Tuskegee airman has the misfortune to crash his plane in Alabama. "The least of these stories are distinctive, the best are gripping and two are genuinely terrifying," our reviewer, Gary Giddins, wrote last year.
 
FRAGMENTS: Memories of a Wartime Childhood
By Binjamin Wilkomirski.
Translated by Carol Brown Janeway. Schocken, $11.
The author, a Jew born in Latvia, was a toddler when he saw his father murdered. He relates his story from the perspective of his childhood self, who neither knew the reason for the barbarity surrounding him at Auschwitz nor understood when it had actually ended. This "extraordinary memoir . . . recalls the Holocaust with the powerful immediacy of innocence," Julie Salamon said in these pages in 1997. PLAYING FOR TIME, by Fania Fenelon with Marcelle Routier, translated by Judith Landry (Syracuse University, $17.95), also evokes daily life in the death camps. Fenelon, a half-Jewish Parisian, was spared only because she could sing with the Auschwitz orchestra. Her memoir, now restored to print, "is particularly well told, with a minimum of self-pity," Raymond A. Sokolov wrote in the Book Review in 1977. The fate of survivors is explored in A HOLE IN THE HEART OF THE WORLD: The Jewish Experience in Eastern Europe After World War II, by Jonathan Kaufman (Penguin, $13.95). Chronicling the lives of five families, the author shows how they endured in the divided world of postwar Europe. His work is "profoundly chilling," one critic said last year.
 
TALKING IN BED
By Antonya Nelson. Scribner Paperback, $11.
Evan Cole, a psychologist, and Paddy Limbach, a roofer, meet at the hospital where their fathers are dying. But their awkward friendship threatens the stability of both their lives, as Evan's wife becomes drawn to Paddy. This novel is an "affecting and rewarding meditation on the confounding unpredictability of love," Stephen McCauley wrote in these pages in 1996.
 
EUROPE: A History
By Norman Davies. Harper Perennial, $24.
Concentrating on political events and his own specialty, Eastern Europe, the author gives a highly idiosyncratic view of a continent. Although in 1996 our reviewer, Theodore K. Rabb, criticized the book for historical mistakes, he praised its "telling insights, apt quotations and excellent quick overviews."
 
THE ERROR OF OUR WAYS
By David Carkeet. Owl/Holt, $13.
It's not surprising that a linguist by training should write a novel about communication. In this book, two men, a well-off entrepreneur and an unemployed linguist, negotiate the tough terrains of middle age and threatened marriages. Carkeet is "both an acute social observer and an engaging stylist," Margalit Fox wrote in the Book Review last year.
 
THE CONCERT
By Ismail Kadare. Translated from the French
of Jusuf Vrioni by Barbara Bray. Arcade, $14.95.
The author writes of his native Albania, which in this novel is undergoing its rupture with China in the 1970's. He portrays the tiny Communist nation as so isolated that it is devoid of all perspective, a situation ripe for both comedy and tragedy. "Kadare takes the reader completely inside the Albanian universe," Robert D. Kaplan said here in 1994. The same publisher has reissued Kadare's earlier novel THE PALACE OF DREAMS, also translated from the French of Jusuf Vrioni by Barbara Bray ($12.95). His subject is again totalitarianism, but the setting is the fictional United Ottoman States, where his protagonist, a bureaucratic functionary, works in an office whose purpose is to analyze dreams. The novel is "small, clever and all the more disturbing for its elegance and refinement," David R. Slavitt wrote in these pages in 1993.
 
MONKEY KING
By Patricia Chao. Harper Flamingo, $13.
The heroine of this first novel, Sally Wang, is struggling to come to terms with her father's sexual abuse, a painful childhood memory that her Chinese-American upbringing has encouraged her to bury and ignore. Last year our reviewer, Philip Gambone, called the book "a considerable achievement." Laurel Graeber

BYLINE: By Hal Espen; Hal Espen is features editor of Outside magazine.

 BODY:
Just one word: fleece.
In this American winter of our anxious contentment, fleece is, as style scouts like to say, everywhere. Unlike "plastics," that singular specter of conformity and inauthenticity that Dustin Hoffman was confronted with three decades ago in "The Graduate," fleece in our time enjoys a fuzzy, warm, unironic kind of ubiquity. Yet like plastic, fleece is a wholly synthetic product, derived from the Uberstaple of late-20th-century life: crude oil. It is, in fact, pure polyester, the stuff of hideous 70's shirts and disco tailoring -- but polyester technologically refined and reconfigured so that its organic-seeming secondary characteristics and narrative connotations have become dominant. The art historian Anne Hollander has written that fashion mutates to match "the shifty character of what looks right" at a given moment; in these first chilly months of 1998, the right uniform for both comfort and violent change in the weather is fleece. 
 A longtime fundamental of outdoor-sports product lines, fleece has lately proliferated on the streets, in department stores, in Old Navy television commercials, in baby carriages and in beds. Vogue assures us that models can't live without Patagonia's fleece vest. In L.L. Bean's Christmas catalogue this year, fleece was the unrivaled star attraction, featured on the front and back covers and highlighted in the first 14 pages; more than 170 fleece items were available. Over on Seventh Avenue, Tommy Hilfiger and Polo by Ralph Lauren offer fleece designs; Donna Karan is selling a $300 fleece robe and a $170 fleece unitard, while Nicole Miller has made dresses and skirts of fleece. In London, the street-fashion crowd has adopted fleece wear from labels like Red or Dead. Up on the slopes, wilderness skiers can pull on a Lowe Alpine Aleutian Check Hoody; snowboarders have their own subcultural choices in fleece garments, like Ned Limbo Ph.D. Beatmock shirts and hats by Rasta Imposta, Head Shreds and Chapeau de FUNK. On screen and off, Samuel L. Jackson's version of dapper owes a certain jaunty something to his plush Kangol berets.
By far the most culturally resonant version of fleece is the nonspecialized "technical" sportswear that ranges from L.L. Bean's and Lands' End's high-volume lines to more hard-core outdoor-endeavor brands like the North Face, Marmot and Mountain Hardwear. The aura of these premium lines has benefited both from constant innovation in fleece design and from waves of marketing that extols the fabric's empowering qualities. Like jungle khaki before it, fleece has become associated with athleticism and risk-taking in exotic and remote wilderness areas, and in the process, an androgynous fashionable archetype has emerged: the trekker.
More glamorous, versatile and daring than the trudging backpacker of old, the trekker roars across Southwestern landscapes in sport-utility-vehicle commercials and embraces exhaustion and annihilation in the Himalayas. He or she wages the moral equivalent of war against faceless natural enemies: cold, ice, altitude, exposure and frigid water. A new genre of death-haunted quest literature has arisen, most visibly in the best-selling nonfiction books of Jon Krakauer ("Into the Wild" and "Into Thin Air") and Sebastian Junger ("The Perfect Storm") and in the novels of Charles Frazier ("Cold Mountain") and David Guterson ("Snow Falling on Cedars"). In some sense, the incessant concern with the weather effects of El Nino and even the public's response to the movie "Titanic," with its images of insidious death through loss of body heat, fits in with this theme. It may be true, as is often said these days, that Americans are a little lost without a powerful threat to face -- international Communism, economic recession. Lacking any other nemesis, we seem to be mesmerized by hypothermia.
Given our suddenly urgent preoccupation with maintaining our core body temperature, the near-universal deployment of fleece makes perfect sense. Still, none of this happened overnight; the biography of fleece spans two decades, and it's a story with a history, a catechism, several heroes and ethical lessons. Follow the fuzz, and the charisma of those enveloping swaths of polyester proves to be an extraordinary creation.
For breaches, sweaters, shirts and caps, the answer is wool. Thus declared Yvon Chouinard in his classic 1978 book, "Climbing Ice." Chouinard, then renowned primarily as a pioneering extreme mountaineer and as a small-scale manufacturer of climbing equipment, was about to transform his obscure line of Patagonia clothing into a stupendous retail and catalogue sales success story, but the future was only dimly discernible. In the late 70's, the mantra technical had barely begun to be applied to apparel. Garments made with W.L. Gore's first generation of breathable, water-resistant Gore-Tex, which was introduced in 1976, tended to be flawed and unreliable. And fast-drying polypropylene underwear was a much-derided novelty item notorious for its tendency to retain, distill and broadcast body odor.
Cotton for comfort, wool for insulation and nylon to repel moisture were the chief options available to growing hordes of wilderness athletes who were discovering that sodden clothing could transform an outing into a miserable and even dangerous affair. (The 70's adventurer also relied on the bulbous, puffy goose-down parka, which had its own problems both as a fashion statement and as a reliable garment in inclement conditions.) Of course, earlier generations of explorers and adventurers had somehow managed to conquer mountains and survive the back-of-beyond without space-age clothing, but as the recreation boom took off, the stoical tolerance of discomfort began to seem a little stupid -- and an obsessive attention to gear became half the fun. By the mid-80's, improved versions of Gore-Tex became tremendously popular, inspiring endless debate over the art and science of wicking moisture away from the skin.
A few years earlier, Patagonia, based in Ventura, Calif., had introduced what it would later describe as its "infamously homely yet unforgettable" pile jacket -- a synthetic fleece garment that, it insisted in one of its patented authenticity-by-association gambits, was modeled on jackets used by North Sea fishermen. Its successor, called a bunting jacket, became the company's first runaway best seller in the early 80's. But the fateful date for fleece came in the spring of 1985, when Patagonia launched its Synchilla-fabric line of jackets, the first recognizably modern, fuzzy-smooth fleece outerwear.
The Synchilla jacket had supposedly been tested for an entire globe-trotting year. The catalogue rhapsodized about the garment's grand tour with prose that Patagonia (and J. Peterman) copywriters have honed to the verge of self-parody: We took it on a 40-day kayaking trip to South America, used it all fall fly-fishing in Wyoming and Montana and then took it on a trip to Nepal -- where every day for 21 days we put on our jackets in the morning, wrapped them around our waists at midday and used them as pillows at night. We even washed them in a yak-watering bucket with cheap Chinese lye soap so strong it faded the freckles on our hands. Along with an itinerary, Synchilla came with a set of scientific-sounding attributes: the fleece was light (nine ounces per square yard), did not stretch out of shape and absorbed very little water. Soon Synchilla Snap-T's with Patagonia's horizontal Andean ridgeline logo on the left breast became a status symbol for outdoor types of all persuasions.
Backed by Yvon Chouinard's reputation for insisting on fanatical quality control and for possessing an exquisite, almost tortured corporate conscience, technical fleece was accepted as the real thing. For polyester, which had so ignominiously fallen from favor at the end of the preceding decade, being embraced by the environmental purists and gnarly role models who bought Patagonia was the beginning of a triumphant comeback.
In Lawrence, Mass., the executives at Malden Mills watched the spread of Synchilla with growing intentness. After all, Malden and Patagonia had collaborated on the design of Synchilla, and Malden manufactured Synchilla and virtually all of the high-end fleece being sold through outdoor specialty catalogues and stores across the country. The company also made "lots of crummy fleece," as one Malden executive admits now, but it began to see that its fortune lay not in remaining merely a faithful supplier to brands like Patagonia but also in establishing its own brand as the quality standard.
Malden Mills Industries, which is privately held, was founded in 1906 by Henry Feuerstein, an Orthodox Jew from Hungary who had won and lost a fortune in the New York City garment business before trying his luck in Massachusetts. Malden became a leading manufacturer of furniture upholstery, fake fur and commodity fleece for the bunting trade.
Under the founder's grandson, Aaron Feuerstein, the company had declined to abandon Lawrence when almost all of the fabric mills left in search of cheap nonunion labor in the South and abroad beginning in the 50's. But Malden had suffered a serious scare in 1981, when its overreliance on fake fur forced it to declare bankruptcy under Chapter 11 and reorganize its business. Through his alliance with Patagonia and other up-and-coming outdoor-equipment brands, Feuerstein saw a way to escape the capriciousness and low margins of the wholesale-commodity business. Malden would eventually pour more than $100 million of research-and-development funds into devising better and more kinds of synthetic fleece than anyone had ever dreamed of and would become to fleece what Levi Strauss was to denim.
After first establishing its fleece in the 80's under the brand name Polarfleece, among others, Malden relaunched its high-performance fabric as Polartec in early 1991. The new name explicitly echoed the notion of technical clothing, and its new mountain-range logo seemed to be a conscious homage to Patagonia's. Malden's ambitions had grown far beyond the idea of providing only insulation. It began manufacturing fleece suitable for every layer of clothing, from underwear, socks, hats and gloves to sweaters, jackets and pants, both as inner layers and outerwear. It added four-way stretch and laminated breathable windproof and water-resistant membranes inside its two-layer fleece.
The range of garments reflects Malden's obsessiveness about fleece, as do its patents and trade secrets. Close attention is paid to variations in the polyester filament yarns it uses: tenacity, lubricity and colorfastness are crucial characteristics. Next, in order for polyester to become fleece, its knit design must incorporate a surface covered with tiny loops. The truly cunning stage of making fleece is the final one -- the finishing -- in which thousands of tiny needles grab and pull out the loops before shearing trims the fleece to a velourlike smoothness or a peltlike pile. The resulting products range from lightweight next-to-the-skin fleece ($4.50 a yard wholesale) to warm-water wet suits ($25 a yard). Basic Polartec 200 midweight fleece wholesales for $7 to $8 a yard; the price will increase four times or more by the time the material reaches the consumer in a finished garment.
Taking another cue from Patagonia and its rivals, Malden has been fond of featuring trekking and adventure-travel archetypes in its Polartec advertising: Inuits, Himalayan yak herders and Scottish Highlands climbers. But the product's slogan, The Climate Control Fabric, was more essential to the company's purpose, which has been to spread the gospel of layering, moisture management and personal shelter beyond the inner circle of outdoor athletes to the mass of consumers. Remember the 80-20 rule, Tom Mendl, a product manager at Malden Mills, says. Eighty percent of the people who purchase premium outdoor clothing don't buy it for the use it was intended. They're out there walking the dog in cold weather, and that's it.
They're in a celebratory mood up at Malden Mills these days, and it's not just because they expect to sell $500 million worth of fleece and other fabrics this year. In more ways than one, the success of fleece has been a vindication for Aaron Feuerstein, the company's white-haired, 72-year-old C.E.O. It gave him the confidence to rebuild after a fire destroyed three buildings and 600,000 square feet of manufacturing space at Malden's Lawrence headquarters just before Christmas 1995, and it gave him the means to stand in front of his workers three days after the fire and tell them he was keeping them on the payroll and covering their health benefits while the rebuilding went forward. Everyone wept, including the television news crews. Utilizing equipment salvaged from the fire, some fleece production resumed within a week.
It was perhaps the closest thing to a real-world It's a Wonderful Life in the annals of American business, especially when people learned that Malden paid its workers -- a polyglot group representing 52 nationalities, including many first-generation Dominican and Puerto Rican immigrants -- a living wage far above the industry standard. Feuerstein became a national hero; he sat with President Clinton's family and heard himself extolled in the 1996 State of the Union speech. Last September, he dedicated a gleaming, airy new computerized fleece-manufacturing facility.
Feuerstein can recite yards of Shakespeare and Shelley as sonorously as he can praise his fleece. It's a fabulous fiber, almost miraculous, he declares. Very lightweight, comfortable and useful, exceptionally warm, and yet it has all the esthetics of the most expensive natural-fiber fabrics. Malden fleece comes in more than 100 styles, nearly 5,000 colors and 1,000 patterns. Feuerstein will tell you that the branding of Polartec has been so successful that even Patagonia and his old partner there, Yvon Chouinard, will begin using the Polartec label on new fabrics. (Although Malden and Patagonia continue to have a close, friendly relationship, it must be a little bittersweet for the Californians to acknowledge the ascendance of their formerly silent manufacturing partners, who are also suppliers to Patatgonia's competitors.) Nike has switched largely to Polartec for its outdoor fleece apparel.
Malden is targeting anyone who works and plays outdoors. Talks are under way with the U.S. military (the Green Berets are already using a very technical version of Polartec's Power Stretch line, and Polartec is standard-issue wear for American troops stationed in Bosnia), with the Postal Service and with utility companies around the country. The company is going after the golf-apparel business in a big way. And more and more, fleece is making its way to the indigenous people whose way of life contributed so much tribal mystique to fleece: Sherpa guides are well stocked with Polartec hats and sweaters; so are Indians in the Andes and natives in the Arctic regions.
Meanwhile, Malden's success has inspired counterfeiters to sew bogus Polartec labels into inferior fleece garments and to attach phony hang-tags. Nothing makes a Malden product manager sound more aggrieved than a discussion of the idea that cheap fleece -- which tends to mat, pill, shed and deteriorate prematurely -- can easily be confused with bombproof Polarfleece and Polartec. Consumer trust is particularly vital in the burgeoning children's market.
And, of course, Malden can still claim 90 percent of the market in its bedrock business of making technical clothing for outdoor sports. Malden makes most of the fleece that Marmot Mountain Ltd. in Santa Rosa, Calif., sells. Everyone wants something technical, but they also want to look old school, like the guides and mountain climbers in vintage photographs, reports Daniel Bohlman, a 23-year-old former professional mountain biker who works in customer service for Marmot. Fleece with a pile texture," he says, "has distinct technical advantages, but it's also part of the retro resurgence. And customers love fleece with embroidered ribbon work. If it looks remotely tribal or ethnic, it adds to the fleece. And I can try to sell them on the E.C.O. line of fleece" -- the acronym stands for Environmentally Correct Origins -- "made from recycled plastic soda bottles, but all they want is technical.
Real mountain climbers still wear fleece, even as the mortal risks they take become more routine and less sacramental. The gear and the clothing have become so sophisticated that if you employ good judgment, climbing is relatively safe, even though there's clearly always going to be objective danger up there, like a cornice falling on top of you, says Kim Gattone, a Santa Fe-based climber who wore lots of fleece on her way to the top of Tibet's 26,900-foot Cho Oyu last fall. But it just doesn't compare to what the old explorers went through. All you have to do is read about them and what they were using, and you say, 'Oh, my God.'
Fleece, then, is on the verge of taking over the entire world; Aaron Feuerstein's eyes light up when he talks about the potential of fleece catching on in China. The only question that remains, as Malden races toward a future in which it becomes a billion-dollar company and as everyone you know eventually turns up wrapped in a colorful, nappy cocoon, is this: What is to become of that precious, perishable nimbus of authenticity that still hovers around fleece?
Probably something akin to the dilution of meaning that has befallen other formerly potent fashion sheaths in the aftermath of relentless exposure -- coverings like denim for the counterculture, leather for various demimondes and even shamelessly unveiled human skin itself. Eventual obsolescence is the inescapable and melancholy fate of the authenticity that mass marketers have attached to fleece. To be sure, fleece is an ingenious and beneficial technological invention, but one day soon we'll recognize it as fake in every way and we'll be a little bit ashamed of what we once felt about it, if we think about it at all.

HEADLINE: Whatever Happened To Politics?

 BODY:
Your series "Whatever Happened to Politics?" (Jan. 25) addresses an important issue -- but not a new one. Two hundred years ago, the French intellectual Madame de Stael described her country in terms that apply equally well to the United States today. France, she wrote, was dominated by "a mass of complacent men concerned only with their personal affairs," desiring nothing but "material comfort and tranquillity." The French believed that "things will go better if the government does not act. Far from calling for its assistance, people regard it as an obstacle." 
 Indifference to politics was hardly a sign of national decline. After 1799, when de Stael wrote, France enjoyed more than a century of economic growth and artistic creativity. With luck, the apolitical United States will do equally well in the next hundred years.

Reviving Long Beach Takes Another Step Forward

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN

DATELINE: LONG BEACH

 BODY:
IN recent years, this seaside city once the playground of the wealthy, then a dumping ground for the elderly poor and the mentally ill -- has made a remarkable comeback.
Smart new high-rise oceanfront buildings like the Avalon Towers rental and the Sea Pointe Towers condominium have supplanted most of the single-room-occupancy rooming houses and the seedy nursing homes that had taken root here in the 60's and 70's. 
 Stores have a 95 percent occupancy rate, according to Stanley Fleishman, chairman of the local Chamber of Commerce, and boutiques are opening. And young families attracted by the Atlantic Ocean beaches and the 53-minute commute by train to Manhattan are moving here.
But city officials want more. They want Long Beach, which has three-and-a-half miles of ocean with a boardwalk, to have hotel, conference and catering facilities that can attract business and leisure visitors for extended stays.
"Long Beach is the only resort community without a hotel room, and the only waterfront community without a waterfront restaurant," said City Manager Edwin L. Eaton.
Two years ago, city officials placed a moratorium on development of several vacant oceanfront parcels along a three-block stretch extending from National to Long Beach Boulevards.
Then the city selected the largest parcel, 6.1 acres bounded by Riverside and Long Beach Boulevards and East Broadway and the boardwalk, as the site for hotel development. Under the plan, the city is to assemble the property, which has six separate owners, through condemnation if need be and turn it over to a developer. The developer must compensate the city for acquisition costs, including legal fees, and must build a hotel complex.
Earlier this month the City Council moved a step closer to that goal by selecting the Parkoff Organization of Great Neck as the developer. Parkoff has proposed a 218-room hotel with a spa, banquet and conference facilities, restaurants and stores and an open-air amphitheater.
Under the terms of the Feb. 3 Council resolution, Parkoff has six months to find the money to pay for the property and to find a hotel operator. It has an additional six months to find construction financing for the $50 million project.
The company is a real estate investment group that owns and manages apartment houses and retail space in New York City and on Long Island.
"We're tremendously excited because this development will become a magnet for those people who now come here to walk along the boardwalk and then get in their cars and go somewhere else," said Michael G. Zapson, the City Council president. "We also think this is a very low-density use of this site."
STILL unresolved is the price of the site, but A. Richard Parkoff, the president of the Great Neck company, said he was able to submit his proposal because in a condemnation "there are rules and laws as to how property is valued."
"We have done our due diligence and already anticipate what the value is going to be, so we're not working in the blind," he said.
The 6.1-acre property, dubbed a "superblock" because of its size, has 700 feet of frontage on the boardwalk. The city owns Shore Road, which crosses the property, but it will be demapped. The largest landowner is the Haberman Group of Manhattan, which controls 2.7 acres; under the zoning, it has the right to build two 10-story buildings, each with 110 apartments. In 1986, investors paid $6.7 million for the same parcel, but lost it through foreclosure. Haberman subsequently acquired the property for $1.2 million, according to city officials. Owners of the smaller parcels can only build one- and two-family houses.
Purchase prices will be negotiated based on appraisals, and any disputes will be settled in court. But a challenge to the city's power to condemn appears to be unlikely.
"The eminent domain law specifies that if there is a public purpose, the municipality can condemn," said Joel K. Asarch, the city's Corporation Counsel. And in a community without hotel accommodations and catering facilities, a hotel is a public purpose, he said. Jacob Haberman of the Haberman Group, who is a lawyer, agreed that the city would be within its rights.
The resolve to acquire the superblock and see it developed for a hotel complex grew out of three public hearings in 1995 and last year, which indicated most local residents preferred hotel development to more condominiums, Mr. Eaton said.
"People saw what we saw, that here was one of the last big oceanfront parcels, so let's make it the definitive Long Beach project rather than condominium towers that don't offer anything that we don't already have," he said.
But the city first commissioned a study to see if a hotel was feasible, he added, because "we didn't want to be part of a failure."
The study, prepared by the Mineola office of Hospitality Valuation Services International and completed a year ago, concluded that a hotel would be economically viable and last year the city issued a request for proposals.
The City Council chose the Parkoff Organization over the two other contenders, the Haberman Group and Nathan L. Serota & Sons of Valley Stream, because Parkoff gave the city more of the elements it wanted, including more restaurant facilities, a complete spa and a 400-seat amphitheater, Mr. Eaton said.
THE superblock has a long history. At one time it was the site of the Long Beach Hotel, built in 1880. The rambling 900-foot-long, 150-foot wide three-story structure burned down in 1907, the same year William H. Reynolds, a State Senator turned real estate entrepreneur, began selling house lots with the promise that Long Beach would become a French Riviera on the Atlantic Ocean.
For many years, the city was an elegant summer resort, attracting the well-to-do until jet travel to Europe and improved road access to the Hamptons drew vacationers away.
"We're going to build a nice hotel that will be a place where you can have a bar mitzvah or a wedding, where you have a spa, where you can stay for the weekend or for the summer and where we can bring in professional volleyball teams," said Mr. Parkoff. "I have concepts in my mind that will keep this hotel filled."
As now visualized, the complex, whose architect is Breger Terjesen Associates in Manhattan, will have a 10-story hotel with a 100-seat restaurant, with additional outdoor dining on terraces occupying the top floor.
The main lobby entrance on East Broadway will have a two-and-a-half story high atrium, with 15,000 square feet of retail space on the ground level, and 14,000 square feet of conference and office space on the upper level. A 40,000-square-foot banquet hall with seating for 600 will adjoin the lobby.
The hotel's other amenities will include a 30,000-square-foot, two-story spa with an indoor pool and an indoor volleyball court. An Olympic-size outdoor pool, which the lobby will overlook, will be flanked by additional shops. The hotel will also have three outdoor tennis courts that can be covered during the winter.
The lobby level will also have a two-story restaurant with seating for 250 not counting outdoor dining. Strollers on the boardwalk will have direct access to the hotel.
Some of the 218 hotel rooms will be equipped with kitchens, and can be combined to become two- and three-bedroom suites. All will have views of either the ocean or of Reynolds Channel which borders Long Beach on the north, and all will have balconies.
The buildings will be Art Deco in style, and in pastel colors, said James O. Bermel, the project architect.
Flanking the hotel will be an octagonal amphitheater suitable for outdoor concerts and other functions. Parkoff has also proposed a five-story, 100-unit residence with two- and three-bedroom apartments for people in their sixties and older who want hotel services, including meals. The entire hotel complex will have parking for 600 cars.
Although some elements of the plan can change -- for example, a multi-plex movie theater could replace the assisted living residence -- construction of the hotel, restaurants and catering facilities are not negotiable, Mr. Eaton said. Use restrictions will be incorporated in the deed Parkoff receives from the city.
Mr. Parkoff said he would be working with an investment banking firm to put the construction financing together.
Once the financing is in place, a builder will be selected. "I am not a builder, but neither is Donald Trump," Mr. Parkoff noted. "I am the creator of the project and I will orchestrate the necessary parts to bring this about."

HEADLINE: For a Growing Region, a 'Nassau Hub'

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
A NAME not yet coined may one day describe the 2.9 square miles of central Nassau County that planners and government officials call the Nassau Hub.
The name would designate a hybrid place that was neither urban nor traditionally suburban, but rather an integrated yet decentralized low to midrise supercenter of stores, offices, industries, museums, campuses, government offices, stadiums and theaters, laced with green spaces and abundant parking. 
 It would be a city that was not a city, a "there" in a wealthy suburban county that lacks a core and hungers for a stronger identity and an attraction to draw people from Nassau and beyond.
For such a place to exist, the planners and many officials agree, a major new transit system, financed with hundreds of millions of Federal dollars and supported by local subsidies, would have to relieve severe congestion and move people from point to point.
Sounding a warning heard for years, the planners and officials said that unless the traffic problems were solved soon the hub would sprawl out of control and strangle, a victim of its successes and broken spokes.
The latest attempt to address the problem is a $200,000 six-month study paid by the county and the Town of Hempstead. The Long Island Regional Planning Board, the Nassau County Planning Department, the Regional Plan Association and the Laboratory for Urban and Suburban Studies at the New York Institute of Technology carried out the work.
Without choosing a favorite, the study offers three alternatives. They are an elevated "people mover," larger elevated trolleylike cars that run on tires and a ground-level light-rail system with elevated sections over roadways and a connection to the Long Island Rail Road.
The study also looks at additional bus service as an immediate way to reduce congestion. The existing bus services are underused, suffer from congestion and run at a deficit, requiring multimillion-dollar subsidies from the county.
The hub, the largest employment and shopping area on Long Island, includes the former Mitchel Field, Roosevelt Field, the former Roosevelt Raceway and surrounding areas. The Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum, the Roosevelt Field mall, other major stores, office complexes, warehouses and Hofstra University and Nassau County Community College are in the zone. The executive director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board, Lee E. Koppelman, said Federal support would be needed for the transit options.
"Mass transit at the hub has now become essential," Mr. Koppelman said. "Just with the documented growth that could take place, the existing job base in the hub of 44,000 will increase to 60,000. With that kind of increase there will be a lot more traffic."
County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, who has called the proper development of the hub "the linchpin of Nassau County's future economic vitality and identity," has proposed building a sports complex near the coliseum for the Islanders and other franchises, to be ready in 2001.
Mr. Gulotta is also proposing additional hotel rooms, converting the coliseum to a convention center and developing a museum area that would include the Cradle of Aviation Museum. That plan would draw even more traffic. A redevelopment of the former raceway also adds to the glut.
The executive director of the Regional Plan Association, Robert D. Yaro, said the projected development in the hub was crucially important.
"The place is strangling in traffic already, and there is four million feet of commercial space already out the door and permitted," Mr. Yaro said. "This study suggests the benefits if that four million square feet is organized differently."
Scattered "single-use destinations surrounded by a sea of parking" would make any transit system ineffective, Mr. Yaro said. What is needed, he suggested, were mixed-use centers where transit stations were close to entrances and convenient to multiple destinations.
The study is candid about the intractable nature of the traffic problems, saying: "It must be stressed that mass transit solutions will help reduce existing automobile congestion. But since the additional growth anticipated in the hub will inescapably generate more overall movements to, from and within the hub area automobile usage will continue to grow."
"The vast oceans of parking lots at Roosevelt Field is one of the principal resources of the hub," Mr. Yaro said.
The Meadowbrook State Parkway is the lone limited-access road with exits to the hub area. Hempstead Turnpike, Stewart Avenue and Old Country Road, all east-west thoroughfares, are heavily used and frequently congested.
"You've got to do something, and it's very clear there just isn't any potential for widening parkways," Mr. Yaro said. "Everything that can be done to the roads has been done. So you have to get creative."
Mr. Yaro said a transit system that provided even marginal reductions in car trips to or within the hub would significantly lessen traffic. "The difference between highway gridlock and free-moving traffic is the last 5 to 8 percent of cars," he said.
Any effort to control development in the hub to create mixed-use centers would require extraordinary cooperation among developers, prospective tenants and government officials. Most of the area is in Hempstead.
Mr. Yaro said that would be a challenge, but "a lot less of a challenge than fixing the congestion in this area if it keeps building out the way it has."
"What we have now is a whole that is less than the sum of its parts," he said. "The idea is to reverse that. It's absolutely essential for the economy of Nassau County and Long Island that we get this right."
What happens at the hub, he added, could become a model for development in Hauppauge and Melville, two future hubs, and for other parts of the country.
Light-rail connections from the L.I.R.R., possibly from a new station, would require support from the rail line and its parent, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Seventeen light-rail systems operate in the United States. Proposed extensions and new systems in 29 cities would add 800 miles of light-rail track in the next several years.
Last week the Government approved using money from a passenger ticket tax to build a light-rail link from the L.I.R.R. at Jamaica Station to Kennedy International Airport. The $1.5 billion project would be partly financed by the $3 Passenger Facility Charge that is added to tickets for flights at Kennedy.
The Nassau study does not have proposals for taxes or fees to finance the transit systems. It estimates costs that range up to hundreds of million dollars for plans like full and partial loops through the hub.
The death this month of State Senator Norman J. Levy of Merrick, the influential chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee, means the loss of a forceful promoter of suburban mass transportation in Albany.
In addition to light-rail, the study also outlines options that would accommodate greater sprawl and address the deep-seated reluctance of drivers to abandon their cars.
"Our assumption is that people are not going to mend their ways," said Paul Koch, co-director of the Laboratory for Urban and Suburban Studies at the New York Institute of Technology. "Developers are going to keep on developing in the way they are used to."
To overcome resistance to mass transit and the problem delivering passengers to widely separated hub locations, Mr. Koch said, a people mover that is in use in one of the suburbs of Chicago held promise.
"A people mover can get into tight areas, it can go all around the place," Mr. Koch said. "Our concept is that you have a very small unobtrusive system that can duplicate a lot of the perceived advantages of the automobile."
Such people movers have automated electric cars that seat four passengers. They run on rubber tires along elevated pathways. A central computer route cars to selected destinations. Cars would run separately, not in trains.
The system, called Personal Rapid Transit, or PRT, tries to duplicate automobile travel. Passengers would never have to ride with strangers. They would control their destinations, and there are no schedules.
"There are a lot of cars waiting at the station," Mr. Koch said. "One is waiting for you, and when you get in it knows your destination."
The third option, the elevated trolleylike car on rubber tires, would be propelled by a set of wheels in the runway that would contact a fin extending from the car. Mr. Koch said rubber tires were a preferred over rails because they were quieter.
Some people have suggested that drivers in the hub had to accept that the time they spent in traffic was part of any hub visit, just as they would accept delays in going to a large amusement park or sports stadium.
The co-director of the laboratory, Michele Bertomen, has suggested that if drivers adjusted to congestion and delays in areas like the hub, that would have humanizing aspects.
"We forget that often a slower life is a more civilized one," Ms. Bertomen wrote in an article in Newsday. "In a time when road rage makes national headlines, it may be psychologically necessary to catch a glimpse of a car, with an identifiable person inside, once or twice a day."

HEADLINE: When Households Included Slaves

BYLINE: By NANCY NEWILL DONIGER 

 BODY:
AT a time when the White House is urging Americans to engage in a candid conversation on race relations, and the General Assembly in Hartford has enacted legislation requiring school districts to report annually on their efforts to reduce racial, ethnic and economic isolation, Connecticut educators say the dialogue is already well underway.
"The dialogue is going on. I meet people in the state who are genuinely interested in the issue," said Daniel Cruson, the town historian in Newtown and a history teacher at Joel Barlow High School in Redding who has written a book about slavery in rural Connecticut. Surprisingly, he said, many people were unaware that slavery existed in Connecticut. 
 Gwen Parks, a chairwoman of the Newtown High School History Department, said she sees the release of Steven Spielberg's film, "Amistad," about the 1839 mutiny of Africans aboard a ship of that name, the ensuing trial in New Haven and an 1841 Supreme Court ruling that the Africans were free men, as a powerful catalyst for increased interest in black history.
Historical societies, libraries, schools and universities across the state are giving workshops on the Amistad and other intriguing facets of black history, Ms. Parks said.
Gloria Williams, who teaches a graduate course in cultural diversity at the University of New Haven, said that while she was born and raised in the New Haven area, she had never heard of the Amistad case while she was growing up.
"I feel cheated," she said. "There are so many things that happened right here in Connecticut I never heard about." Ms. Williams said she would now like to see the heightened interest in black history lead to greater communications among people of other ethnic groups.
Jackee Bryant, a self-described history buff and chairman of an annual African-American Day parade in Hartford since 1994, said: "With all the years the Amistad story has existed, it amazes me that people are just now becoming aware of it."
Mr. Cruson attributes the general lack of awareness that slavery existed in Connecticut to the low number of slaves in the state. Slaveholding households in the state typically had only one or two. Little record of their lives remains outside emancipation documents and some records of births, deaths, marriages and church membership.
"From the 1780's, state residents came to realize that slavery was not right," Mr. Cruson said. The majority of slaves in the state were emancipated between 1780 and 1813, following the Revolutionary War. Legislative efforts to abolish slavery began in 1784. In 1790 the first year a national census was taken, Connecticut slaves numbered 2,759, and the free black population stood at 2,801. The number of slaves declined to 310 by 1810, 97 by 1820 and just 17 by 1840.
Laws were intended to ease the institution of slavery out of existence, without violating the property rights of owners or resulting in freed blacks becoming a burden on the towns.
Some of the freed blacks acquired houses and property, although their net worth was a fraction of that of their white neighbors, based on probate records studied by Mr. Cruson. Their low numbers, and the disapproval associated with inter-racial marriage, resulted in isolation and population decline of blacks in rural areas, which persists to the present day, he said.
Free blacks tended to move to the cities in search of social and economic opportunities. Blacks from the South also migrated to the cities, planting the roots of urban isolation that forms the basis of the recent Sheff v. O'Neill lawsuit, he noted.
That complaint by 17 Hartford-area school children alleges this isolation has resulted in their being denied access to the equal education guaranteed under the state constitution. In its defense, the state argued that the segregation was not intentional, but the state Supreme Court last year ordered the legislature to enact an integration plan, without specifying the details or appropriating funds.
Gov. John G. Rowland appointed a diversity panel that made a slate of recommendations, including public funding for early school education and the formation of more charter schools.
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., Mr. Rowland's predecessor, had ordered each of Connecticut's 169 municipalities to form a diversity committee and develop voluntary proposals to reduce racial isolation. While the voluntary plans were accepted by the state's cities, they were defeated by the majority of towns.
Ms. Williams and Ms. Parks would like to see the voluntary proposals, which include recommendations to build more magnet schools, encourage cooperative programs between the cities and suburbs, and recruit more African-American teachers in suburban schools, taken down from the shelf, dusted off and given renewed consideration.
Gloria Rodriguez is assistant principal in charge of English and history at Wilbur Cross High School in New Haven, the school with what may be the most ethnically and economically diverse population in the state. The school offers black history, a Latino Caribbean course and "literature outside the canon" of traditional high schools, Ms. Rodriguez said.
She, too, would like to see more urban and suburban exchanges and dialogue. "It's really important for people to come together and talk about problems and solutions," she said.
Ms. Parks is the principal writer of a resource guide on African-American history by the state's Department of Education in accordance with legislation making African-American, Puerto Rican and Native American history as well as the great famine in Ireland part of the core curriculum taught in Connecticut public schools.
Members of Delta Sigma Theta, an international African-American sorority, hope to make the guide readily accessible for teachers of every grade level, Ms. Parks said.
The General Assembly in 1995 authorized the development of what is being called a freedom trail, with more than 60 historical sites including several in Farmington, considered the Grand Central Terminal of the Underground Railroad in Connecticut.
The Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation has released an educational poster of historic sites in the settlement of African-Americans in Connecticut, for use in grades 4 to 12, illustrating how historical research can be presented to students in an engaging format.

Airport Lounge Vetoed
Last week, the new County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, scrapped the previous administration's plans to build a lounge for business executives at the County Airport. In a press conference at the airport on Monday, Mr. Spano, a Democrat who took office on Jan. 1 after a 14-year reign by Republicans, called former County Andrew P. O'Rourke's plans for the lounge "a stealth expansion" of the airport. 
 The 900-square-foot lounge, proposed during the final days of the O'Rourke administration, would have cost about $413,000. Mr. Spano said that even though the contracts awarded by the Board of Acquisition and Contract will be rescinded, companies will be compensated for losses or work undertaken.
Mr. Spano said the move signals "a new era in positive neighborhood airport relations." He said he did not want to expand the terminal "at the expense of the quality of life of our residents, which is our biggest economic-development asset."
 
Legislators' Ratings
With Democrats in the United States House of Representatives scoring significantly higher than Republicans on their environmental record, Sue W. Kelly, who represents the 19th District in Westchester, was a standout among Republicans in ratings issued recently by the League of Conservation Voters.
The league, a political arm of a national environmental coalition, gave Ms. Kelly a score of 81 out of a possible 100 points for her record in 1987, compared with a score of 58 during the 104th Congress the year before.
The organization rated her among the most improved members of the House of Representatives. She received pluses in 13 of 16 categories.
By contrast, the score for Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat representing the 18th Congressional District in Westchester, dropped in 1987 to 88, compared with a 96 the year before. She lost points for being absent during a vote on wildlife refuges and for voting for a radioactive waste disposal site in Texas, the league said. She received 14 pluses.
Representative Eliot L. Engel, a Democrat from the 17th District, received an 81 in 1987, compared with a 96 for the 104th Congress. He lost points last year for several votes the league considered anti-environmental, including two in favor of nuclear waste dumps. He received 13 pluses and 3 minus points.
Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican from the 20th District, received a 75, up from a 65 for the 104th Congress. While his record showed concern for endangered species, for example, he lost points for voting for a bill that benefits ranching interests at the expense of fish, wildlife and water resources. He received 12 pluses.
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, received a score of 29, in part for positions considered anti-environmental by the league, on a rider to a bill that would have allowed states to build roads across national parks and another that would have provided subsidies to mining companies. He received pluses in two of seven categories applied to Senators. Mr. D'Amato's score was an improvement over the year before, when he received a total score of 4.
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat, received an 86, slightly down from the 10th Congress when he got an 89. Mr. Moynihan also favored the hard-rock mining subsidies, presented in an amendment that was eventually killed. He received six pluses.
 
Thruway Crackdown
The State Police's Operation Share, a joint effort by Federal, state and local agencies to catch speeders and other traffic offenders on the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey Thruway, was a resounding success, according to a recently released report. (The acronym Share stands for Statewide Highway Aggressive Regional Enforcement.)
On Jan. 28, about 50 members of the state police collaborated with officers from the following agencies: the United States Transportation Department, the United States Customs Service, the United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wildlife, the state's Department of Motor Vehicles, the County District Attorney's Office, police officers from Yonkers, New Rochelle and Mount Vernon and others.
Authorities issued more than 500 summonses along the Thruway during a 10-hour period.
As a result, 33 trucks were taken out of service, 23 of which were towed off of the Thruway because their violations were considered severe, David Hebert, a spokesman in the District Attorney's Office, said.
A tractor-trailer operator who was hauling dry goods was arrested for driving while intoxicated near Yonkers, after his blood alcohol level was found to be in excess of three times the threshold of intoxication for commercial vehicle drivers, the District Attorney's office said.
Also, a 34-year-old man and a 24-year-old woman were arrested for criminal possession of a controlled substance after the police said they found 21 grams of crack cocaine on the pair.
 
Economic Development
The Westchester Partnership for Economic Development, a public-private coalition, has begun the Westchester Cities Initiative to assist urban centers.
Five of the county's six cities -- Mount Vernon, New Rochelle, Peekskill, White Plains and Yonkers -- were once all hubs of economic activity.
The new effort will attempt to help them regain some of their former status (Rye is the sixth city).
"In recent years, some of the focus of economic growth has shifted away from these established areas, which is not good for the cities themselves and which also hurts the county," William M. Mooney, the partnership's chairman, said.
Paradoxically, economic growth has shifted to the suburbs, where officials and residents often fight to keep development at bay.
"From a community planning perspective, it makes total sense to have the major economic development initiatives go to the locations that both want them and that have the infrastructure to support them," Mr. Mooney said.
The partnership's cities team includes the following members: Joe Armentano, chairman and chief executive officer of Patsems/Paraco Gas Corporation; Neil DeLuca, former Deputy County Executive; Lawrence Dwyer, president of the Westchester County Association; Robert W. Elliot, Mayor of Croton-on-Hudson and chairman of the Westchester Municipal Officials Association; Margaret Gotti, Pace University's vice president of government and community relations; Joyce Lannert, Planning Commissioner; Robert M. Maccarone, Deputy Commissioner of Corrections, and Peter Puccillo, Finance Commissioner. ELSA BRENNER

HEADLINE: In Suburbia, Unexpected Neighbors

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
RESIDENTS of several upscale New York suburbs have acquired neighbors in recent years that many never expected -- large rental apartment buildings.
A number of suburbs that had vigorously resisted multifamily housing for decades -- towns known in the apartment development industry as "high-barrier-to-entry communities," zoned to protect land from unwelcome development -- are now or are soon to be the sites of apartment complexes with hundreds of rental units. And almost all the units are the work of one deep-pocketed development company, Avalon Properties, whose only business is building luxury apartments for rent. 
 New Canaan in Fairfield County and Bronxville in Westchester County are two such communities in which rental developments are now being prepared by Avalon, a five-year-old company based in Wilton, Conn.
Since 1993 Avalon has built 15 complexes containing from 102 to 932 apartments each in Fairfield and Westchester, on Long Island and in New Jersey -- and it is developing 20 additional complexes in the same areas with the potential for a total of 6,022 units.
Its success has been won at a cost of millions of dollars spent on legal battles with communities that want no part of multifamily housing, no matter how luxurious.
The company is viewed by many local ad hoc groups as a tiger at the gate, bent on destroying their way of life by bringing what they perceive as rootless transients into their tranquil single-family, large-lot, residential neighborhoods.
Such groups become particularly agitated when a designated percentage of the apartments is reserved for lower-income tenants, in accordance with laws in several states that give developers greater density in return for providing units below market rates.
The 1989 Affordable Housing Law in Connecticut allows developers extra units in return for setting aside 25 percent of a project at lower rents. Municipalities seeking to reject these projects must prove in court that they will be injurious to the town's welfare. So far, none has.
Lawsuits brought by Avalon against the Fairfield County towns of Trumbull and New Canaan resulted in four and six years, respectively, of litigation, compromises and eventual victory for the developer.
"It wasn't the project itself or Avalon that we objected to," said Kenneth Halaby, a former chairman of Trumbull's Planning and Zoning Commission. "The complex is a fine addition to the town, beautifully built and very upscale. What we resented was the state telling us how many affordable housing units we must have and where. We have our own master plan to provide for this, and we have to be careful because Trumbull is fully developed."
New Canaan tried to take an Avalon site by condemnation, defying court rulings against its efforts to reject the developer's 104-unit project. Eventually, the town and developer swapped sites and Avalon is now going through the approval process.
"Friction will continue when developers go into more rural communities," said Richard Bond, New Canaan's First Selectman, or chief executive, "but people do have to break out of a box of conventional thinking to make things work for all parties involved. That's what we tried to do."
In Wilton, another affluent Fairfield County community, "they said these apartments are needed for residents to retire to and young people to start out," said Richard L. Michaux, 54, Avalon's chairman of the board and chief executive. But Wilton stiffened its regulations after the 102-unit Avalon Springs complex was built. The town now requires a public hearing solely for site plans in cases where properties like Avalon's are zoned for multifamily development.
Other developers find it difficult to match Avalon's product in size, quality, amenities and service, in part because "it's very difficult to compete with their ability to amass capital," said Clay Fowler, principal of the Spinnaker Companies in Stamford. The company owns and manages 1,300 luxury apartments in Fairfield County, with 400 more for Norwalk and White Plains in the design stage. "They clearly have a predominant position and an insatiable appetite for new projects," said Mr. Fowler.
His Stamford complex, called The Fairfield, has 263 units with a pool, lounge, fitness center, and barbecue area. He is building rentals in Portland, Ore., and Seattle in partnership with Carl Kuehner, a Wilton builder of luxury homes. Mr. Kuehner, who sold a Danbury parcel to Avalon, said Avalon was "better at managing these products than we are, and have a much larger portfolio than we will ever choose to have."
In order to acquire a site in Bronxville, Avalon formed a partnership with Arthur Collins, a developer of high-end residential condominiums in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and the South. Mr. Collins had entree to the town, which he described as "very hard to deal with in terms of approvals."
"We had the right project at the right time," he said, "and were the right people to do it."
Avalon is obtaining access to land and towns through other builders "because they can't acquire land fast enough to meet their need to use capital," said Mr. Fowler.
Ross Cassata, builder of 3,200 Long Island rentals over 37 years, views Avalon as "one of our main competitors."
"Lately we are refocusing on luxury garden apartments with similar amenities," he said. "Being a public company they have deeper pockets and work on a slim profit margin of 7 or 8 percent, beating us out of some properties."
But Bryce Blair, 40, senior vice president for development and acquisition at Avalon, said his company's profits were 10 to 13 percent.
PROFITS derived from standardized designs and bulk purchasing are supplemented through such details as "gas heating and cooking because what people save on utility bills they can spend on rent," said Samuel B. Fuller, 36, Avalon's Northeast regional vice president of development and acquisitions.
Lately, Avalon has been entering communities closer to New York and other major cities.
"We're being invited in by the New Rochelles of the world," said Mr. Michaux, Avalon's chief executive, "to help revitalize their downtowns with housing. That's something we're seeing more and more of." New Rochelle accepted Avalon's proposal to build a 1,000-apartment complex and ground-floor shops in four buildings near the railroad station.
Michael Barry, vice president of The Applied Companies of Hoboken, a builder of rental apartments in New Jersey for 30 years, said that "Avalon is developing in some of our areas."
"We're just a few blocks from each other in Jersey City, but we view it as friendly competition," said Mr. Barry. "The more development and investment in an area the better it is for everybody."
On Jersey City's riverfront, Avalon is building its first high-rise, a 26-story complex called Avalon Cove South, next door to its mid-rise Avalon Cove, where rents reach $4,000 a month.
A competitor, Roseland Properties of Roseland, N.J., has approvals for 4,360 units over the next decade at Port Imperial in West New York, N.J. "We will have one-, two- and three-bedroom luxury apartments in several mid- and high-rise buildings, with pools, business centers and health clubs," said Carl Goldberg, principal in the firm. Roseland owns 3,500 units around the state and manages 6,000 more. "We completed a second Port Towers in Jersey City close to the Avalon project," he said.
"Avalon Cove is the highest end of the luxury rental market," said Thomas M. Gallagher, director of Jersey City's Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce. "Their units are a little larger and they provide a high level of amenities on site. Residents at that income level are willing to pay a premium for that."
"I think other developers have responded," he continued, "and tried to offer more. The Hudson County waterfront is very competitive, and when anyone is willing to test the outer limits of the market and been successful, as Avalon has, you'll see other developers follow."
Mr. Michaux said Avalon had embraced the policy of "smart growth," typically in Stamford, where the company has built its 402-unit Avalon Grove complex near the Stamford Town Center, theaters and restaurants.
"We think there's a better way to enjoy a community environment, where you can walk to work, retail, nightlife, and not have to get in the car to do all your errands."
The term "smart growth" was originated by the Urban Land Institute in Washington a nonprofit educational organization advocating high-density housing in suburban sprawl areas, situated near public transportation and utilizing existing infrastructure.
Some academicians who study the residential construction industry agree with the concept for additional reasons. "Avalon is onto something," said Catherine Pancak, professor of real estate at the University of Connecticut at Storrs. "The state has been underserved by well-built, high-quality rental apartment complexes, so there is a strong demand. Historically we've had high house prices, making ownership less attractive as an option, and that will continue."
Dr. James W. Hughes, professor of planning and public policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J., acknowledges the demand but recognizes the reasons behind local opposition. "Larger apartments with school-age children produce a net loss to a town," he said. "Communities with limited or no public sewers and water are afraid of having to extend or build them, setting up a model for greater density and the loss of rural character. And in more developed suburbs, the sites being built on are the last greenfields around. A lot of residents want to see them remain that way."
THE only community to date from which Avalon withdrew because of local antipathy and land acquisition problems is Rye Brook, a Westchester enclave of upper income residents that incorporated in 1982, separating itself from the largely working-class Village of Port Chester.
Rejection of multifamily projects is more prevalent in the Northeast than in the Mid-Atlantic region and the South, where garden apartments originated. "Opposition," said Charles H. Berman, 44, president and chief operating officer of Avalon, "comes from what is increasingly referred to in the industry as CAVE, Citizens Against Virtually Everything. It doesn't matter whether it's a new golf course, road, school improvement, or public amenity. Depending on the leadership in a town, a community can be paralyzed to a point that change doesn't occur. That makes some people happy, but I'm not sure it's the majority; it's just the most vocal."
Avalon was organized in 1993 as a real estate investment trust and named after the legendary resting place of King Arthur. Currently capitalized at $2.1 billion, it operates from offices in Alexandria and Richmond, Va.; Braintree, Mass.; Princeton, N.J.; Chicago and Minneapolis, as well as Wilton.
But its genesis goes back to the 80's, when Mr. Berman and Mr. Michaux were regional partners of Trammell Crow, then the largest rental housing developer in the country. Mr. Berman headed the Northeast division, Mr. Michaux was in charge of the Mid-Atlantic region. Given the tortuous process of borrowing what little money was available from insurance companies and pension funds in the early 90's, the two men decided to go public with their own company when Trammell Crow chose to remain private. An amicable arrangement was reached whereby the partners bought out the two divisions that they headed with proceeds from the sale of stock, acquiring 8,500 apartments from Boston to Virginia.
Last month Avalon bought 60 percent of Trammell Crow's Midwest assets for $196 million. Last year Trammell Crow sold off half of its $3 billion in real estate assets to various REITs. The Avalon partners are now larger than their former parent.
"We sold because it's a great year to be a seller," said Ronald Terwilliger, national managing partner of Trammell Crow Residential in Atlanta. "We've watched this REIT phenomenon grow. It looks like it's here to stay, but I enjoy being private. In terms of wealth creation it's a better place to be."
Avalon is currently the largest residential landlord in Connecticut and arguably the sixth largest developer and manager of luxury rental housing in the country, with 19,724 luxury apartments in 66 complexes in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Its stock, a substantial amount of which is owned by the Crow family, rose from the initial public offering of $20.50 to $29.25 at the close last Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Typically, Avalon builds generic low-rise garden complexes designed by Niles Bolton Associates of Atlanta. Units are arranged around landscaped courtyards, or, in more urban areas, contained in mid-rise and high-rise structures, presenting an exterior that is architecturally harmonious with its surroundings.
They are larded with amenities that include pools, indoor basketball and squash courts, clubhouses with kitchens for parties, fitness and computer centers, children's playgrounds, an in-house service staff, and a concierge who will arrange for dry-cleaning and car rental, accept packages, walk the dog and feed the cat.
RENTS range from $1,000 to $4,000 a month depending on location, size and amenities, and dissatisfied tenants are hard to find, perhaps because the management allows them to break their leases, retrieve their security deposits and move out, as long as they do it within the first 30 days of the lease. Occupancy rates average 95.6 percent and tenant turnover is around 50 percent a year.
Last year Britton and Poonam Manasco and their 21-month-old son moved from California to a two-bedroom apartment at Avalon Grove in downtown Stamford. Growing up in Hong Kong and having lived in New York, Mrs. Manasco likes urban life. "We plan to stay a year, but if something bigger comes up we may take it," she said. "The management is so nice. They helped me start a children's play group."
Miguel and Monica Mancevo live at the 504-unit Avalon Cove in Jersey City. "It's only a 20-minute drive to my office on East 40th Street," said Mr. Mancevo, "and when I come home late at night I feel safe, comfortable." Their 11-year-old son, Mark, "loves the pool and the basketball court," Mr. Mancevo said. "He never wants to move."
Looking to the future, said Mr. Michaux, Avalon's chief executive, "we would be comfortable with capitalization of $4 billion or $5 billion by 2002. Over the five years we've been public we have created a product prototype that works, and a strong balance sheet. We feel we can export this to high-barrier-to-entry markets and downtown locations in the West. Over time we will get into New York City and Chicago, but for now we like to feel around the edges."

HEADLINE: The View From/Hartford;
A Revival for Housing, Downtown, of All Places

BYLINE: By R. L. FELSON 

 BODY:
SCULPTORS, painters, musicians, dancers -- in short, artists of all kinds -- are moving into a long-vacant building on the western edge of downtown Hartford that city and state officials, developers and business leaders are hailing as the first step in years to create new housing in the center of the city.
The building, at 555 Asylum Street, known as Artspace, is also being touted as a small step in what many city and business leaders say is the beginning of a resurgence of downtown development in a city that has seen virtually none since the late 1980's. The 46-unit, four-story building, a former office furniture store and before that, an auto dealership in the 1920's and 1930's, offers low- and moderate-income artists living and working space in one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. "For the city of Hartford, it not only gives the city some refreshing color, but downtown just badly needs housing to spur retail and other services," said Don Walsh, vice president of Imagineers, the management company of Artspace. More than one third of the units have been rented since the building opened in January. 
 Mr. Walsh said he believed Artspace, a $6 million renovation project, would inspire other developers to either recycle vacant downtown space or begin looking at new housing projects downtown, which often feels deserted after business hours.
The idea for Artspace came to Peter DeWilde Shapiro, a Hartford lawyer and one of three developers of the project, from his daughter, Kerith Shapiro, a performing artist who was living in a complex for artists in St. Paul, Minn. "St. Paul was dead downtown and had a lot of the same problems as Hartford," said Ms. Shapiro, who now lives at Artspace as the resident manager. The St. Paul development helped contribute to that city's downtown revitalization, and Ms. Shaprio, who grew up in West Hartford, said, "I really hope this leads to major changes in Hartford."
Marc S. Levine, a partner in Artspace and a Hartford developer and lawyer, said the project probably would not have been undertaken had it not received tax credits and other grants from the city and state. Mayor Michael Peters was able to get the developers a meeting with Gov. John G. Rowland's office. Mr. Rowland has been an advocate of using the arts to spur economic development in Connecticut's cities.
Mr. Levine, who was approached by Mr. Shapiro and the other partner in the venture, Elie R. Pallandre, president of a real estate consulting firm in West Hartford that bears his name, said the development could have been a low-income housing project.
But, Mr. Levine said, "That's not really what Hartford needs. We must have an increase in people living in the central city for revitalization to be successful and it has to be a mixed income strata, including middle and upper classes." Under Federal and state guidelines, those renting the units must earn 60 percent or less of the region's median household income -- $24,720 for one person; $28,260 for two people, and $35,340 for a family for four. Units rent for about $590 for one bedroom, $720 for two bedrooms and $830 for three bedrooms.
The apartments, designed by Tai Soo Kim Partners, a Hartford architectural firm, feature 10-feet-high windows, 14-foot ceilings and spectacular views of the downtown skyline, the State Capitol, Bushnell Park and Union Station, across the street.
Scott Spencer, who lived with Ms. Shapiro in St. Paul, and will co-manage Artspace with her, said the variety of tenants moving in amounts to "a complete panorama of diversity" in terms of ethnicity, age and artistic endeavors. Mr. Spencer, a musician and sculptor, said tenants include other sculptors, painters, musicians, poets, writers, carpenters, dancers and poets. "There are people who survive on painting to costume designers," he said. New residents have come from as far away as New York City and Massachusetts.
Galley kitchens were designed to give residents as much studio space as possible. A ground floor community room features residents' artwork and photography, and it is expected that other residents will use the room as performance space. The room was the site of a grand opening party Jan. 5, at which local and state political and business leaders, including Governor Rowland, attended.
Arthur Anderson, president of Imagineers, the Artspace management company, said that in looking at the party guests, including many from the city's arts community, he was reminded of the parties held downtown 10 years ago in the midst of a downtown building boom. "This symbolizes a demand that people deny exists," he said. "People want to live downtown and they want to feel the vitality."
One incentive to encourage the new residents to stay downtown is that after 15 years, tenants will be invited to buy their units and form a co-op. Mr. Shapiro, one of the partners, said he remembers what a residential community downtown can do to the vitality of a city. He himself used to live in the Goodwin building on Asylum Street before it was converted into an office building and luxury hotel in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: HOME REPAIR;
Spray Painting Safely

BYLINE: By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI

 BODY:
A BRUSH and a roller are sufficient for painting most projects, but for jobs that are large or have intricate surface detail, it's easier to spray the paint onto the work surface. Spray painting is less tedious than brush painting and generally gives a smoother, uniform paint surface.
There are disadvantages to spray painting however; it is not economical and in fact can be downright wasteful. That's because only a fraction of the paint is actually deposited on the work surface. The rest is distributed as airborne particles called overspray. Depending on the spray setup, it is possible for as much as 75 percent of the paint to be lost in overspray. 
 There are two types of sprayer units, air-powered units and airless ones. Air-powered units can be costly because they require an air gun and a compressor unit. (Prices will vary depending upon the size of the compressor, but a basic unit will cost around $200.) Air-powered sprayers allow you to spray a variety of finishes and are a better choice for fine work. Airless sprayers are considerably cheaper than the air units, but they produce sprays with large, heavy paint particles, so they are not good for laying down a really smooth finish.
Air-powered units work by blowing a stream of compressed air at high pressure through the nozzle of the gun. The paint is forced up into the air stream, where it is atomized into a fine mist that is deposited on the work surface. There are two types of air-driven guns: siphon feed and pressure feed.
In siphon-feed guns, the compressed air creates a partial vacuum as it passes though the paint tube near the gun nozzle. Outside air pressure enters the paint cup (the metal can that screws onto the nozzle unit) through a small inlet hole and forces the paint up to fill the vacuum. It is then forced out through the nozzle by the compressed air. Siphon-feed guns are ideal for blowing out lightweight paints and finishes, and therefore they are a good choice for extra-fine work. But they can only draw paint from the attached paint cup, so the user is forced to periodically stop painting and refill the cup when painting large projects.
Pressure-feed guns do not create a vacuum; instead, they channel some of the compressed air directly into the paint reservoir. The increased air pressure forces the paint up into the nozzle where it is propelled out as a mist. These guns create high internal air pressure, so they can be hooked up to a remote pressure tank, making it unnecessary to stop painting to refill the paint cup. They can also handle heavier paints, so they are a better choice for big outdoor jobs.
Spray guns are also classified as bleeder or non-bleeder types. Bleeder guns pass air through the nozzle as long as the compressor is running; only the paint flow can be turned on or off. This type of gun is designed for use with a compressor that does not have an air reservoir. The non-bleeder guns can stop the flow of air with the trigger control and are designed for use with a compressor equipped with a storage tank.
Airless sprayers have an electric motor that drives an internal piston back and forth in the gun. As the piston is pulled back, suction is created and pulls the paint up into the nozzle. The forward piston stroke forces the paint through an orifice that atomizes it into a mist. Airless sprayers do not produce the fine paint mist that air-powered units deliver, so there is less overspray and more paint is deposited.
Regardless of the sprayer you choose, you need to prepare the work surface, working area and even the paint before you can start painting. Preparing the work surface involves scraping, sanding and cleaning it, and also masking areas that are not to be painted. It is not always necessary to mask all areas; you can hold a large piece of cardboard as a shield to block the overspray from hitting places you don't want painted. Preparing the work area entails laying down dropcloths and erecting barriers to keep the overspray confined.
Filter all paints before loading them into the spray gun. Even new paint can have large particles that have coagulated into globs; if they are not removed, they will clog the gun. They can be strained out by pouring the paint through a commercial strainer or through an old nylon stocking.
Spray painting can be dangerous. High-pressure sprayers shoot paint with enough force to penetrate the skin. Protect yourself by donning the proper safety gear. Wear a respirator designed for paint spraying (not a dust mask), a long-sleeved shirt, goggles and gloves.

HEADLINE: P.S.E. & G. Is Honored By Clinton

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A commitment to its hometown of Newark won Public Service Electric & Gas, New Jersey's largest utility company, an award from the White House.
P.S.E.&G. was one of five companies saluted by President Clinton at a reception last week. The utility was recognized for spearheading the South Ward Neighborhood Partnership in Newark, a coalition of more than 50 organizations committed to neighborhood revitalization. 
 The centerpiece of the company's urban initiative in Newark is a $6.8 million, 100,000-square-foot light industrial complex being built with Federal and state financing and a loan from P.S.E.&G. Leaders of the initiative say the building will bring 200 to 300 jobs to the South Ward neighborhood.
The building, scheduled to be completed this fall, will offer special features to lure tenants and employees, including employment training, after-school programs and child care.
Also last week, Public Service announced plans to expand its urban initiative to six other cities: Paterson, Trenton, Elizabeth, New Brunswick, Camden and Jersey City.
Al Koeppe, senior vice president for external affairs at the company, said the effort in those cities, as in Newark, would begin with gauging what the communities want.
"We had a strong base of philanthropy in this company for a long time, but it didn't always ask the cities what they needed," said Mr. Koeppe. "So a premise will be to reach out first in the neighborhoods and the communities."
Joining Mr. Koeppe as guests at the White House yesterday were Shirley Ward, coordinator of public service's urban initiative, and Gail Davis, the urban initiative executive.
At the White House ceremony, President Clinton presented the Ron Brown Award for Corporate Leadership to the International Business Machines Corporation, for work force diversity initiatives, and to Levi Strauss, for an anti-racism program.
P.S.E.&G. won an honorable mention along with Bright Horizons of Cambridge, Mass., and Lancaster Laboratories of Lancaster, Pa.
The Ron Brown Award was named in honor of the former Secretary of Commerce who was killed in a plane crash in Croatia in 1996. While the award was encouraged by the Clinton administration just over a year ago, it is privately financed and administered.

HEADLINE: On the Waterfront

BYLINE: By ANDREA KANNAPELL 

 BODY:
TAKE a good look at New Jersey's Hudson River waterfront and you can almost see them. The shimmering ghosts of the Gold Coast are back: phantom luxury apartments and office buildings lining the river in Jersey City, Hoboken, Weehawken and Edgewater.
But this time, it seems, these phantasms are not being blown away, as so many 1980's dreams were, by the variable winds of demographics, economics and politics. In fact, the 90's Gold Coast is building -- sometimes quite literally -- on the groundwork laid in the 80's. 
 "We sold it as the Gold Coast, but it might have been silver or tin at that time," said Thomas Leane, a planner for Jersey City in the 80's who is still deeply involved in the waterfront's fate. "Now, it has sort of reached the massing necessary to be gold."
People with money want to be on the waterfront: Aging baby boomers with empty suburban nests; would-be Manhattanites deflected by ridiculous rents; flourishing Wall Street businesses that want to expand.
Investment money is accessible again. Interest rates are low, and with the Asian crisis, banks are looking for local borrowers. Insurance companies and pension funds have regained enough confidence in real estate to reinvest. A newly fashionable kind of company, the real-estate investment trust, seems to offer boundless capital. And the recession in the late 1980's and early 1990's drove away most of the newcomers; most of the surviving developers have long histories in the clubby, competitive world of construction.
With a few exceptions, the court battles have been settled and the political storms have calmed. So has New York City's combative stance, because there is much less empty office space in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
During the recession, much of the infrastructure along the Hudson River waterfront was quietly upgraded. Sewer systems were revised and replaced; roadways were built or rebuilt and the local ferry system was reinvented. . Now, New Jersey Transit is building -- not planning, building -- a light rail system from Bayonne to Hoboken. Cities are in, and Governor Whitman has promised to help them grow.
"The pioneering is over," said Richard S. LeFrak, the president of the heavyweight Lefrak Organization of Queens. "We're into the developmental phase. It's a lot of chemistry. You can't just plant your flag like Columbus and then all of a sudden you get a Starbuck's."
The reference isn't rhetorical. A Starbucks is opening this month in one of his office towers at Newport City, a development sprouting shopping malls, apartment towers and office buildings that Mr. LeFrak calls "the biggest piece of the pie" on the Jersey City waterfront.

Empires in the Air And a Hedging of Bets
But will the Gold Coast really happen this time? Will 18 miles of abandoned warehouses, railroads and shipyards along the Hudson be transformed into a vast stretch of office towers, vertical neighborhoods and shopping malls? And if it is, what will that mean for Hudson and Bergen counties?
More than a dozen developers contacted for this article discussed project after project, painting empires in the air, talking about New York City's sixth borough.
That's their job. To live, Tinkerbelle needed believers to applaud. To build apartments, developers need believers to loan them money. To build offices, they need corporate believers to sign leases.
It is telling that, of the myriad development dreams hovering along the waterfront, it is residential and retail projects that are under construction. No new office projects have broken ground in five years. And most of the residential units are rentals. The watchword is caution.
"It's easier not to go broke with rentals," explained Fred Daibes (pronounced DAY-beez). His company, Daibes Enterprises, bought waterfront properties cheaply when the first Gold Coast evaporated, and has already spent $22 million out of a projected $100 million to turn the old Alcoa site in Edgewater into St. James Towers, a 460-unit residential complex -- all of it rental.
"If you can't rent an apartment for $2,000, you can rent it for $1,800 or $1,700," Mr. Daibes said, "and as long as you can rent it, you have money coming in to pay off the interest. But with condos, you can wait there a long time with it empty."
In the 80's, new condos went begging for so long that developers turned to auctions, where deluxe suites sold for a fraction of their original asking price.
Another error: bad timing.
The miles where the Gold Coast is supposed to appear were once jammed with shipyards and factories served by railways. But after World War II, the nation began abandoning rail in favor of the federally subsidized interstate highway system. The union-heavy North began losing industry to the Sun Belt. Container shipping consolidated dockwork to fewer and fewer spots.
By the early 80's, much of the waterfront was fenced off, idle and abandoned. Municipalities became major property owners. And the buyers started collecting: Leonard Stern's Hartz Mountain with 75 acres of Edgewater, Arthur Imperatore Sr.'s Arcorp with miles of Weehawken, the Lefrak Organization's 600-plus acres at Newport. Daniel K. Ludwig, one of the world's richest men, bought scores of acres to the south.
During the bad years, Lefrak and Hartz hung on, at a cost. Gene Heller, the president of Hartz's real-estate branch for 25 years, believed in building, not waiting. Leonard Stern, the company's president, was determined that Hartz would lie low until the economy turned. In a rift that fueled real-estate gossip for years, Mr. Heller left Hartz, bought a chunk of its property, and with his son Tod built Edgewater Commons, the first shopping center along River Road. That center, completed in the summer of 1996 with a huge Pathmark, Barnes & Noble, Bed, Bath & Beyond and assorted other stores, has been credited with giving the first breath of revival to the waterfront.
Mr. Ludwig, who earned his billions in part by inventing the supertanker, died in 1992, before the homes and offices he hoped to build next door to Newport City could become reality. With the estate left to charity, the decision to sell the waterfront land was obvious, said Ed McDermott, the president of Mr. Ludwig's trucking company, National Bulk Carriers. "There was simply no market at the time," he said.
Thomas Leane, the former Jersey City planner hired to oversee Harsimus Cove, found himself selling it off to an assortment of the waterfront's current players.
"It was bought for $58 million," Mr. Leane said. "We won't make a tremendous amount. We'll try to get out whole."
Sales are going well, he said. He expects to need a new job by the end of the year.
Of the early buyers, Mr. Imperatore was hardest hit. Even as his ferry company grew from a tiny operation to the impressive NY Waterways, which collects millions of fares every year, his real-estate bid faltered, and Roseland Property Company ended up controlling much of it.
In hindsight, many developers say, financing for buying and for building was just too easy to come by.
"There's an old joke," said Peter Mangin, the president of Garden State Development, which has plans for a Jersey City tower that, at 850 feet, would be New Jersey's tallest by far. "Developer comes back from a meeting at the bank and says to his partner, 'I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is, we got that $20 million loan. The bad news is we have to put up $5,000.' "
Loose lending practices were encouraged by unregulated appraisers, Mr. Mangin said. "They would rate a $5 million project at $7 million," he said, "and then the bank would say, you want $10 million?"
Now, banks don't do that, and appraisers are state-licensed. "Nobody's doing anything stupid," Mr. Mangin said.
The signature Gold Coast failure was Port Liberte, a debacle begun in the mid-80's that was intended to be a vast townhouse and condo development. Jutting out into New York Harbor south of Liberty State Park, it was supposed to have a Dutch streetscape, the feel of a Mediterranean village and a Venetian-style canal system. In 1989, its banker (CityFed of Somerset) reported a $52.7 million loss on the project and was seized by Federal regulators. With about 300 of its 1,674 units built, the project went belly up, leaving scores of pioneering residents in an unhappy partnership with the Resolution Trust Corporation.
That same project stands to become the revival story of the 1990's. The Applied Companies, a Hoboken developer founded by a former tenant lawyer, Joe Barry, has bought Port Liberte, has finished selling the already built units and plans to start construction on a modified version of the original plan this summer. The plan includes a nine-hole golf course.
(No one needs a crystal ball to see golf in the waterfront's future. Bayonne wants to put in an 18-hole course. Plans for an 18-hole course in Liberty State Park were abandoned, after much controversy, in 1995.)
 
Words Don't Make It So (But They Sure Help)
The developers are well aware that talk is talk, not steel and concrete. After estimating current office space in Jersey City at 6.5 million square feet (the equivalent of three World Trade Center towers), Brant Cali, a vice president of the Mack-Cali real-estate investment trust, calculated that if all the Jersey City developers' grand plans were turned into reality, there would be 16 million square feet of new office space.
"Do I think it's all going to get built? Not really," he said. But the point of such outlandish estimates is not prediction. "What fuels the marketplace is what could be, not what is. Realistically speaking, you can't sell pessimism."
Dozens of fantasies were announced with great fanfare in the 1980's, often accompanied by glowing newspaper accounts untouched by skepticism. There was the Harsimus Cove residential project south of Newport, the huge housing-and-office complex along the Weehawken waterfront, the bulky conference center with hotels, offices, and retail and residential space on the Hoboken piers. They didn't happen. Most didn't even get as far as Port Liberte.
"The Gold Coast didn't happen because the economic climate didn't let it happen," said Edwin H. Cohen, a director at Cushman & Wakefield who supervises leasing for Lefrak's Newport office projects. "It started happening and then the recession hit."
Asked if there were any guarantees this time, he laughed. Hard. "Nothing is a guarantee," he eventually said. "But all signs are pointing to its happening, and there are not any signs that it's not happening."
A couple of existing buildings have changed hands, based on expectations that office rents will be rising and that unoccupied spaces can be filled. Lefrak just sold the one-million-square-foot Newport Tower to TrizecHahn, a Canadian company, for $159 million. And miles upriver from "Wall Street West," as developers like to call Jersey City, a Long Island company called Crown Properties just bought 300 Boulevard East, a 300,000-square-foot tower, for $15 million. The tower, built by the junk-bond giant Drexel Burnam in 1987, went into foreclosure when junk bonds collapsed.
A dozen new projects have been designed and approved, but most won't break ground until lease agreements have been signed with anchor tenants. Developers need signed leases to get financing.
A deep-pocketed developer with enough confidence in the market to risk his own capital can build speculatively, without lease commitments. Emanuel Stern, the 34-year-old president of the real-estate arm of his father's company, Hartz Mountain, is the first waterfront developer to announce a speculative office tower, saying that he will break ground in June on a Hartz-financed 400,000-square-foot office tower by the Colgate clock in Jersey City.
There are insiders who say that Mr. Stern is just dangling the start date like a carrot, and that he won't really start building without tenants. Mr. Stern acknowledged, as every developer did when asked, that plans often don't come through as announced.
"But there are two things you can look at," he said. "A developer's reputation. Does he live up to his word? I think, if you look, you'll see that when Hartz said it was going to do something, it did."
The other thing, he said, is money. He paid $10 million for the Colgate property. "Paid!" he said. "Cash!"
"I know one thing," he added. "I know we're going to be in the ground in June."
Further off are plans that would turn Jersey City into enough of a Tallville that somebody might start keeping official statistics. (At the moment developers and architects keep a loose count.) Garden State Development's 850-foot-tall building would upstage 101 Hudson, the 550-foot art deco tower at Exchange Place, as the tallest building in New Jersey, the company says. And that would knock the Newport Tower, at 528 feet, down to third place, and 10 Exchange Place, at 460, to fourth.
The planned skyscraper, the American Financial Exchange, is a joint venture between an up-and-coming youngster, Garden State Development, and a national behemoth, Mack-Cali, which was created at the end of 1997 by a merger of two old, family-run New Jersey developers.
Once office construction begins in earnest, it's a race. Low vacancy means rising rents. That increases the value of stock in investment trusts, the real-estate equivalent of mutual funds. It also gives impetus to new building. But the more office space available, the greater the likelihood rents will stabilize or descend.
So the developer wants to build fast before there's too much competition. "The first guy gets the worm," Mr. Stern said.
 
The Infrastructure: Ready for Prime Time?
Suppose the worm-nabbing moment arrives. What about the residents, new or old, of the waterfront communities?
One focal question is whether the infrastructure is ready for a population gain of thousands. Not everywhere, it seems.
Jersey City started developing a master plan back in the 60's, so that even during slow economic times, the sewers and roadways and substations that major development would require were rolling into place. "Planning takes a long, long time," said Robert D. Cotter, the director of city planning for Jersey City. "And implementation is now into, what, a third of a century?"
But other municipalities didn't get that kind of head start.
Some have played a good game of catch-up, getting developers to install firehouses and sewer systems along with their apartment towers. And most Mayors, like Bret Schundler of Jersey City and Peter LaVilla of Guttenberg, say that the increased tax base more than pays for any increase in municipal services, like garbage collection.
Still, there are big question marks. Concerns about River Road, which runs along the waterfront lowlands, grow with each plan announced for West New York, Guttenberg, North Bergen and Edgewater. The road is being widened and lengthened, but it already carries so much traffic that neighboring Cliffside and Fort Lee are anxious and angry. Cliffside closed off Oxen Hill Road for a while, so traffic from River Road couldn't exit through the town.
Mayor Jack Alter of Fort Lee said he had turned away developers who saw shopping malls in the town's future because it couldn't handle any more traffic.
"It would be ironic," he said, "if we get jammed by their traffic because they build the shopping centers we won't allow. But that's the way it's going."
And what would thousands of new, well-to-do residents mean to politics in Hudson County, where the majority of the waterfront lies?
These municipalities have long been heavy with working-class immigrants. In the old days, they were Irish, German, Polish and Italian. After decades of being blocked, black residents finally won footholds. Newer groups are Indian, Asian and Hispanic -- people who are just starting up the economic ladder.
The economic split will presage a political split, according to James W. Hughes, the dean of Rutgers' Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy and an appointee to the state's Property Tax Commission. "In effect," he said, "you really have two Hudson-Bergen counties, the old parts that are creatures of the industrial economy, and a new waterfront that's part of the information age."
Dr. Hughes believes, surprisingly, that it is the older parts of the county that are the future bastions of political power. New residents are likely to be childless, he said, and lobbying for schools is one major reason citizens bother to vote. The kinds of problems new residents might face -- mail delivery or sanitation, say -- would be addressed with a building manager, not a politician.
There have already been some political shifts. In the optimistic years of the first Gold Coast, the older ethnic groups started feeling left out, and an anti-development sentiment took hold just as development was taking off. In 1985, mayoral elections in Jersey City and Hoboken swung on whether voters thought a candidate was likely to "sell out" to developers.
Development didn't stop, but it took a few unusual turns.
During the "pro-old-timers" term of Mayor Anthony Cucci of Jersey City, it was decided to put at Exchange Place a monument to the 1940 massacre of Polish soldiers in the Katyn forest. The 17-foot statue, a cavalryman with a bayonet through his back, is in the middle of what planners call "the view corridor," framed by the World Trade Center Towers. That placement is itself a sort of memorial to the bygone strength of the old ethnic groups.
 
Interests Converge, And Developers Salivate
Mayor LaVilla says he does not expect much of an electoral impact in Guttenberg when people fill the townhouses on his waterfront that K. Hovnanian, New Jersey's largest homebuilder, just broke ground on. A third of the town's 9,000 citizens already live in one development, the gargantuan, three-building Galaxy Towers, built in 1976.
Inside and outside the towers, Mr. LaVilla said, his constituents care about two things: cutting taxes and reducing crime. The Hovnanian development, he said, will bring more people who want the same -- and will, at the same time, cut taxes and reduce crime.
"Development on dormant land brings in new taxes," he said, "and, assuming the new units don't cost more in terms of municipal services than they pay out, homeowners' taxes should drop. And crime? Well, townhouses selling for a quarter of a million to half a million, that doesn't exactly bring in a bad element."
Mayor Schundler expects new Jersey City residents to slowly switch, as he did, from apartments to brownstones, from renters to homeowners, from singles to married with children. "Their impact to date has been minimal," he said of the new arrivals, "but that's not to say it's not there."
He said that with both an Urban Enterprise Zone designation and new development, Jersey City is moving in the right direction for older and newer residents, with lower property taxes and a fund for refurbishing decaying areas like Central Avenue, Martin Luther King Boulevard, West Side Avenue and Journal Square.
There is at least one down side, he acknowledged. "Rents rise as a function of rising property values," he said, "and property values are rising, no doubt about it." But he said that "rent control should mediate that for most old-time residents."
Such rosy views only brighten the gleam in developers' eyes.
Emanuel Stern, on a tour of Hartz properties along the Hudson, was asked to imagine the best of all possible futures.
"If things go well," he mused as his car whizzed by cranes, "we'll build multi-thousands of units of residential units and large amounts of commercial real estate, and this will become the sixth borough."
And the worst case? He paused. "Basically, I see the same thing," he said, shrugging. "Just taking longer."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Excelsior's Manager Tries to Dodge the Bombs in Latin America

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
ONE night three years ago, as Donald W. Hoskins lay asleep in his small apartment in Lima, Peru, a powerful guerrilla car bomb exploded a block away.
"I found myself underneath my bed at 2 in the morning thinking, 'What am I doing in Peru?' and, 'Maybe there is a reason why stocks here are so cheap,' " recalled Mr. Hoskins, the manager of U.S. Trust's Excelsior Latin America fund. 
 On a recent morning in Manhattan, surrounded by computers flickering the zigs and zags of stock exchanges from Mexico City to Buenos Aires, Mr. Hoskins talked about the kind of risk and turbulence that emerging-markets investors are learning to live with.
"Investing in Latin America is clearly exciting," he said. "You go beyond the Ritz-Carlton world of business."
Exciting indeed. After taking over the fund last February, Mr. Hoskins turned in a sizzling return of 31.9 percent for the second and third quarters of 1997, compared with an average return of 25.8 percent for all Latin American funds, according to Morningstar Inc., the fund trackers in Chicago. "I was beginning to think this was kind of easy," he said.
Then, disaster. His big exposures to Venezuela and steel stocks, particularly Brazil's Gerdau Siderberg, sent Excelsior farther south than most competing funds during the selloff in emerging markets late last year. Excelsior was down 14 percent for the fourth quarter, versus 12.1 percent for its peers. In January, it fell an additional 13.4 percent, versus 10.8 percent for the Latin group, but this month the fund has regained almost half of that loss.
"I learned humility," Mr. Hoskins said, chalking up his losses to falling oil prices, fears that Korean steel would flood world markets, and Venezuela's failure to reduce its government bureaucracy.
Already a jogger, Mr. Hoskins just took up classical guitar. "Hopefully," he said, "it is an antidote to stress."
A better antidote might be improved performance. And with Gerdau Siderberg, at 3.7 percent of his portfolio, and other steel picks suddenly recovering, Mr. Hoskins noted earlier this month that Excelsior was on the rebound. Still, he said, he wants investors to judge him over a two-year period, not week to week.
The cause of Excelsior's volatility -- and, he said, the source of what will eventually be superior returns -- is his concentrated stock-picking strategy. He has only 41 stocks in his portfolio, about one-third the number in most Latin American funds. "What we try to identify is those companies with the kind of strategic competitive advantages that are sustainable," he said. "What we look for is a company that has a price to cash flow that is lower than its long-term sustainable growth rate."
Such thinking has led Mr. Hoskins to take big positions in companies like Telebras, Brazil's telephone giant (12.3 percent of the portfolio), and Grupo Elektra, a Mexican appliance retailer (2.1 percent), which can benefit from urbanization and the expansion of the middle class. He shuns Chile as pricey, except for American depository receipts of Concha y Toro, the winery (1.6 percent), because, as a wine collector, he concluded that Chilean wines have a vast price advantage over American and European competitors.
Mr. Hoskins says he picks stocks, not countries. But he is confident that Latin American governments will continue to push privatization, cut waste and work to keep their currencies stable.
"There is no alternative," he said. "Latin America has gone through every possible avenue, with disastrous results: import substitution, military governments incurring huge inflation with irresponsible fiscal budgets, guerrilla warfare. Asia flu? This, too, shall pass."
BUT he said investors in Latin America should be prepared for volatility, even if bombs aren't shattering the windows, and even if the region's markets have recovered nicely from the collapse of the Mexican peso in 1994 and 1995. Certainly, the Asian crises have made Latin America's markets and currencies look vulnerable again, especially with trade deficits swelling.
How bad can it get? Mr. Hoskins noted that the Bovespa index of Brazilian stocks has fallen 30 percent or more no less than six times since November 1987, plummeting 80 percent in one swing. Still, a dollar invested in the index in late 1987 would be worth $15 today -- nearly four times more than the same dollar invested in the Dow.
"If I'm interested in getting the $15 versus the $4, am I willing to ride through the storms?" he asked. Answering his own question, he said he had invested most of his own money in Latin America.
At 37, Mr. Hoskins has long bounded around the globe. As the son of two diplomats, he attended kindergarten in Saigon at the height of the Vietnam War and lived in Thailand, Burkina Faso and Mauritania. But he did not spend much time thinking about Latin America until he took a consulting job with the World Bank in 1993. A few months later, he tested his entrepreneurial talents in Peru by starting a flower delivery business. He later took a job at a Lima brokerage house.
It is clear that Latin America is more than just another stock play for him. His office is full of Latin American art, including a Peruvian wall hanging he bought while taking a four-day hike on an Inca trail high in the Andes with his wife, Paola, who is Peruvian. He has even acquired a taste for the South American novelists Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Jorge Amado.
Mr. Hoskins likes to travel around Latin America -- and not only to corporate board rooms. He says he believes passionately in face-to-face contact with management. At Pao d'Acucar, a Brazilian grocery chain, he was impressed that the headquarters had been built above one of its stores to keep executives in touch. It is now 2.2 percent of his portfolio. And by drinking tequila with some executives over lunch in the Banamex corporate dining room in Mexico City, he said he avoided a potentially losing investment by getting them to talk about their mortgage portfolio, which he viewed as shaky.
This kick-the-tire approach takes Mr. Hoskins to the tango clubs of Argentina, where the lyrics are somber, pessimistic expressions of lost love, and the samba clubs of Brazil, where love songs are happy. There is an investment lesson to be learned in both types of clubs, he said.
"When an Argentine businessman says, 'We are struggling but we hope to pull through,' that could indicate it's going to be a stellar year," he said. "If a Brazilian businessman said that, be prepared for bankruptcy."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
This Deficit Is Soaring Again

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
Remember the twin deficits? A decade ago, the trade and budget deficits were the whipping boys, supposedly joined at the hip and blamed for all the world's economic woes. Unless the United States could bring them down, disaster was said to be assured.
Those dire forecasts proved unfounded. The American economy has performed so well that the budget deficit is set to vanish this year. Alas, the same cannot be said for the trade deficit. It declined for a while -- falling by more than half from 1987 to 1991 -- but since then has grown and grown. The 1997 figure, to be announced this week, is likely to be in the range of $195 billion, breaking the $191 billion record set in 1996. 
 You don't need to memorize that figure. That's because the trends are now solidly in place for the trade deficit to rise rapidly in 1998. And in a year or two, you may hear anguished commentary on the negative effects of such a huge deficit.
For now, though, Washington's concerns are limited. The just-released annual Economic Report of the President has only a brief discussion of the trade deficit, expressing little concern and ending with, "In the strongly expanding full-employment economy that the United States now enjoys, it should be easier for Americans to see that trade deficits do not necessarily reduce output and employment."
This year, we can expect Asia to be exporting things at give-away prices, in a desperate bid for dollars. For a time, anyway, that will help to hold down inflation in this country, as cheap imports flood in. Meanwhile, Asia will be importing fewer capital goods, in part because its access to capital will be limited.
The net effect will be to cause the trade deficit to zoom, slowing the American economy as well. The stock market already reflects part of that move. Consumer stocks have soared in the last few months, reflecting the willingness of Americans to keep buying things. But companies that depend on exports, or those that produce industrial commodities, are not doing so well. Since the October market low, Disney and Wal-Mart are each up more than 40 percent, while companies like International Paper and Union Carbide have done nothing for their shareholders.
Right now, the huge trade deficit -- which effectively means we are buying cars and computer parts with dollars rather than in exchange for goods and services -- is not hurting the dollar. Other countries have their own problems, and the dollar is in great demand. But that could change. Within a year or two, a falling dollar could mean that imports cost more, causing inflation to rise.
The dollar's woes could be exacerbated if the great European currency experiment, a common currency called the euro, looks like a success. Now, the dollar is strong in part because some think the euro will be weak. But that could change. Europeans dream of the euro becoming a reserve currency, and of central banks holding euros as well as bucks. If so, that could lead to a round of dollar selling.
One can then imagine what would happen. The Federal Reserve, now so friendly and unconcerned about inflation, might tighten, seeking to fight inflation and to defend the dollar. Senators would denounce unfair trade practices and push for protectionism. The stock market might fear recession.
For now, the rising trade deficit seems to have no ill effects, and it therefore gets little attention. That situation is unlikely to last forever.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Where Every Worker Is Ruler of the Thermostat

BYLINE: By LISA NAPOLI 

 BODY:
WHEN economists debate how to increase workplace productivity, they discuss many factors: automation, the availability of labor, even the rise or fall of wages. Rarely, though, does anyone mention room temperature.
Yet, according to 10 years of surveys conducted by the Center for Building Performance and Design, the No. 1 complaint of office workers is that the workplace is too cold. The No. 2 complaint? That it's too hot. 
 To Volker Hartkopf, this is more than the punch line of a Dilbert cartoon. Mr. Hartkopf, the center's director, considers it proof of a core principle: that to get more productivity from employees, a comfortable work environment is essential.
"It has to do with lighting, thermal quality, visual quality, air quality," he said, ticking off ingredients of his recipe for a pleasant workplace. "If a person worries five minutes a day about this, and makes just one phone call to facility management to complain about the temperature, that's 1 percent of their productivity."
"The building is only a piece of the whole situation," he acknowledged. "You can have a wonderful building and a terrible boss or an awful organization, and you will be prevented from being productive. But if the building makes you sick or freeze or is acoustically such that you can't concentrate, it keeps you from reaching your potential."
In a $4 million, 7,000-square-foot living laboratory on the campus of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Mr. Hartkopf and a team of architects and engineers have created a prototype for what they have called the "intelligent workplace."
Along with a host of other technical improvements, the workplace features raised floors to accommodate air flow and cables that allow work stations to be equipped with individual controls for lighting, acoustics and temperature.
The environmental controls, which the center's staff developed with engineers from Johnson Controls, are installed on each desk, letting a worker cool or heat his area as needed; when the desk is unoccupied, the system automatically shuts down. The controls also let a worker shift the position of lighting or breathe fresh air through individual vents.
But the center, of course, is addressing issues beyond heating and ventilation. The workplace also features "plug and play" technology that allows computers and telephones to be quickly installed and moved, making it easier to make rooms bigger or smaller, without large-scale interior work.
Built on top of the campus's Margaret Morrison Carnegie Hall, the workplace, which houses the center's offices, is an odd bit of office architecture, trying to wed new technology to the original structure, which was constructed in 1904. The office exterior, aiming to blend with the hall's Beaux Arts design, is made of bolted recyclable steel, with high, wide windows that are flanked by solar panels.
Research in the field of construction is unusual, acknowledged Steven Lee, the center's associate director; of the $500 billion spent on capital construction each year, only 1 percent is designated for research. But as increases in productivity slow and as concerns rise about repetitive stress and other workplace injuries, he said, such research reflects a growing interest in ergonomics and efficiency.
"The economic arguments are becoming more and more compelling," he said. "Improving productivity, the fear of being sued, the push from the facilities side for improvements -- it's slowly happening."
The project is backed by a consortium of 18 groups from the public and private sectors. Technology companies like Johnson Controls and Siemens are using the workplace to show off their products and to see them work with one another.
Other corporations, like BankAmerica, are involved because they are looking for better ways to integrate technology into existing buildings, or are interested in workplace concepts like teaming.
Energy efficiency remains a government priority, too. Indeed, in his latest budget, President Clinton proposed tax credits for corporations that invest in several energy-efficient devices, including solar panels. Environmental mandates are also helping to fuel the Government's interest.
"Particularly in view of the Kyoto agreements to reduce energy consumption, this is of interest to the entire world," said John Chamberlain, the director of administration for the Environmental Protection Agency, and a member of the center's board. Other Government agencies that are sponsors include the Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.
Mr. Chamberlain also said that in the competition for good employees, businesses would likely be forced to give human considerations more weight.
"Companies who are having to compete for skilled workers are going to have to give those skilled workers nice places to work," he said.
EVEN without a new building, Mr. Hartkopf said, many businesses are shortsighted about integrating new technologies -- spending, on average, $8,000 to $10,000 an employee a year for hardware, software, training, and networks but only a fraction of that on how to accommodate the people who use them.
"There is this macroeconomic situation where people are apparently willing to spend that much money for these technologies and be cheap on the building," Mr. Hartkopf said. "To save on construction while potentially suffering multiples of that on every year's basis doesn't make sense."
Mr. Lee said that a new building designed with efficiency principles might cost 50 to 100 percent more than a conventional counterpart, depending on the builders' expertise. The personal environmental control system, for example, costs from $900 to $1,400 a unit, and that excludes the installation costs. But, he added, an "efficient" building could reap as much as 30 percent in energy savings each year.
Proving that such environments increase productivity is still a challenge. There is no simple formula that can calculate all the benefits of the system -- and thus help convince budget-conscious administrators to adopt it for their companies.
One study of the personal environment system alone, at West Bend Mutual, an insurance company in Milwaukee, showed a 4 percent productivity increase, Mr. Lee said. The center is trying to consolidate the results of this and other studies to give companies a clearer view of the potential impact.
Some companies are already using lessons learned at the center. The new headquarters of Owens Corning in Toledo, Ohio, for example, is long and narrow, giving most employees access to natural light. The 400,000-square-foot structure features individual air controls at each work station.
"There's a constant wash of air from floor to ceiling, which improves air quality," said Scott Linville, the company's facilities manager. "People love having control."
Mr. Linville said the plug-and-play feature had proved particularly useful for sharing information.
"It's never a problem to get a team to meet," he said. "There are more than 80 meeting rooms, and they are all equipped so people can show up with their laptops and plug in."
The high-technology center wants to illustrate the benefits of smart design by giving employees from some of its sponsoring companies a chance to use its office space, on a rotating basis.
For now, 10 center employees work in the space. Else Holter, a staff assistant, likes the control panel on her desk, which allows her to regulate the air flow in her area, and the plug-and-play feature gives her the freedom to set up her computer and phone a number of ways.
But she raved most about a nontechnological wonder.
"In some of my previous jobs, I worked in a windowless office, where in the wintertime I would arrive when it was still dark and leave work when it was dark," Ms. Holter said. "Here, I can look out, open my window or the door to get fresh air. Nature is a wonderful think tank."

HEADLINE: AT THE GATE;
Stepping Out From Its Cubicle

BYLINE: By SANA SIWOLOP 

 BODY:
OFFICE furniture is not the kind of workplace topic that glues crowds to the water cooler, but that's never stopped Steelcase.
Founded in 1912 as the Metal Office Furniture Company, Steelcase, the world's largest office-furniture maker, churns out high-quality products like ergonomically correct chairs and customized cubicles. 
 Now Steelcase hopes that people will buy into the business, commonplace though it may be. As early as this week, the company, based in Grand Rapids, Mich., will make an initial public offering of 12.15 million shares, at $23 to $26 each. And although Steelcase faces some tough competitors and the industry as a whole is vulnerable to an economic slowdown, investors may find Steelcase a reasonably priced prospect in a now-booming business.
Certainly, the stock performance of some of Steelcase's competitors may prompt many investors to jump in. Last May, for example, one rival, Knoll Inc., went public at $17 a share. Since then, its stock has more than doubled, closing on Friday at $37.125. Herman Miller, another competitor, has also seen its stock zoom, from the mid-30's last May to $59.6875 on Friday.
There is no guarantee, of course, that Steelcase's stock will have a similar snap. But there's little doubt that the office furniture market is zinging along. According to BIFMA International, an industry group, office furniture shipments, which had grown at a compound annual rate of 7.2 percent from 1994 through 1996, sped up to a 14 percent gain in 1997.
A booming economy is fueling much of the growth. But other trends are at work, too.
For example, companies are paying more attention to health, safety and comfort issues, and, for efficiency's sake, integrating technology directly into office work stations. A desire for more collaborative work environments is an impetus, too. "One of the major demands that's driving this market is the need for space that promotes team effort, yet is flexible enough to avoid large reconstruction costs," said Alan Andolsen, president of Naremco Services, a Manhattan consulting firm.
Steelcase's size may help it benefit from this strong demand. According to the latest industry statistics, from 1996, Steelcase had about 20 percent of the office furniture market, nearly twice the share of Herman Miller, its nearest competitor.
And as the whole industry tries to offer furniture that is, in Mr. Andolsen's phrase, "less Dilberty," Steelcase has long experience to draw on. In the 1950's, for instance, it introduced furniture in a variety of colors.
Thanks to its sizable and growing research-and-development budget, Steelcase is still innovative, analysts say. Among its many products are an elegant, ultrathin folding conference table and a high-tech work cubicle. The cubicle, meant to tap into employers' desire to offer more egalitarian, cost-efficient work space without sacrificing too many creature comforts, has amenities like individual temperature controls and piped-in music.
The company has an eye on new markets, too, analysts say. Recently, it rolled out a product line that includes removable, reconfigurable architectural elements like floors, walls and lighting, as well as complementary furniture. Steelcase hopes the line will catch on with real estate developers who are designing or retrofitting buildings.
That target market may welcome the overture, Mr. Andolsen said. "Developers are trying to offer a whole range of services -- like copy shops -- to take a major load off of companies," he explained.
Steelcase's innovation has helped its sales to grow faster than the industry average. From roughly 1994 through 1996, the company's annual sales growth, at 9.9 percent, outpaced the industry's by two to three percentage points.
Moreover, the Steelcase offering is attractively priced -- especially after the recent run-up in the stocks of its public rivals.
Shares of Knoll Inc. and Herman Miller are now trading at 21 and 29 times earnings per share, respectively, over the last four quarters. But at the midpoint of its expected price range, Steelcase has a multiple of just 19, said Eileen Ohnell, an analyst at the IPO Plus Aftermarket fund in Greenwich, Conn.
Measured by enterprise value -- which basically compares market capitalization with sales -- Steelcase stock also "looks fairly good," Ms. Ohnell said. Steelcase has an enterprise value of 1.4, while Herman Miller's is 1.7, and Knoll's, 2.1
Steven Tuen, an analyst at IPO Value Monitor in Manhattan, also believes that Steelcase stock is slightly undervalued.
Given the expected stock price and the company's expected earnings, "We think there's a potential for 10 to 15 percent upside for the company" in the next six to 12 months, Mr. Tuen said.
Still, there are some risks in Steelcase. As with other office furniture companies, Steelcase's business will suffer if the economy softens, causing reduced office construction and slower growth in white-collar jobs.
And the office furniture market is highly competitive. Both Knoll and Herman Miller logged record sales and profits in 1997, not only because of overall industry sales growth, but also because of product improvements and other factors.
With the whole sector booming, such competition is muffled. But if business slows, it may get louder.
And while Steelcase's size may give it a leg up, its competitors have their own edges. According to Todd Brickhouse, an analyst at Wheat First Union, a brokerage firm in Richmond, Knoll is now the industry's lowest-cost company, and Herman Miller's new, modestly priced product line has had great success. Indeed, some investors may prefer these enterprises to Steelcase, despite its less expensive stock.
There is another significant apparent risk to this offering. But it dwindles upon closer inspection.
The nearly $300 million in offering proceeds will go not to Steelcase but to shareholders who are selling out. Often, investors worry that such sales mean that the shareholders, typically company founders or executives, are skedaddling because they see clouds on the company's horizon.
But the portion on the block -- owned by members of one of Steelcase's founding families, the Wege family -- is relatively small, at just 8 percent of the company, and still leaves the Weges with a 20 percent share. Ms. Ohnell says the offering probably speaks more to a desire to diversify the Wege holdings than to any lack of confidence in the firm.
Steelcase managers as a whole seem optimistic, too, holding a collective 40 percent stake even after the offering, Mr. Tuen noted. "There's strong management interest in this company," he said.

HEADLINE: The World;
Forget the Maine. Spain Is Back.

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
THE explosion of the battleship Maine in Havana harbor 100 years ago today set the stage for Spain's retreat from the last remnants of its empire in the New World, and for the emergence of the United States as a global power. Yet as the American Century draws to a close, a resurgent Spain is once again flexing its muscles in Latin America and pushing aside any lingering memories of "El Desastre," as the Spanish-American War is often called there.
If it was the cross and the sword that inspired Spain's initial foray into the Americas 500 years ago, it is the checkbook and the satellite dish that are leading what one Colombian magazine calls "the second Spanish conquest." 
 Though Spain has focused on building trade with its European neighbors since joining the European Community in 1986, Spanish companies have also invested billions of dollars in Latin America in those 12 years. They have bought up telephone companies, banks and airlines in places like Argentina, Chile, Venezuela and Puerto Rico as local governments privatize enterprises once owned by the state.
"In every corner of the continent, you have a Spanish company pushing ahead, building hotels or investing in rail systems," said Antonio de Oyarzabal, Spain's Ambassador to the United States. Just last week, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya announced the purchase of Banco Ponce, a leading bank in Puerto Rico, which became an American possession as a result of the 1898 war.
 
Clout in Europe
At the same time, Spain's political clout in the region has been enhanced by its integration into Europe. Latin American governments know that the European Union's commissioner for Latin American affairs is a Spaniard, as are the Secretary General of NATO and the chairman of the European Parliament. Latin Americans see Spaniards as their natural advocates when approaching Europe, and the Spanish Government seems to like the idea.
"We will be much stronger in Europe as long as we grow in America, where we have a certain strength," Mr. de Oyarzabal said. Spanish policy makers have a phrase for this strategy -- creating an Ibero-American space. It includes state visits by King Juan Carlos I, treaties liberally salted with aid and cultural exchanges, and, since 1991, an annual Ibero-American Summit.
Largely at Spanish insistence, the European Community now has embassies in virtually every Latin American capital that help administer economic and technical assistance and organize joint programs with regional trade groups like Mercosur and the Central American Common Market. On its own, Spain offers aid and trade credits, supplies teachers and helps train new civilian police forces in countries like El Salvador and Guatemala. "For a middle-sized European country, Spain plays a disproportionately large role in Latin America," said Joaquin Roy, director of the Iberian Studies Research Institute at the University of Miami. "A shared language and heritage help tremendously, no doubt about it."
Modern technology has advanced Spain's cultural penetration of Latin America as well, much to the delight of cultural nationalists who dread Americanization of the region. Television Espanola is carried on cable systems almost everywhere, and Spanish magazines like "Hola!" and "Interviu" circulate widely, thanks to gossipy cover stories about the Spanish royal family or celebrities like Julio Iglesias.
On any beach from Cancun to Vina del Mar in Chile, affluent Latin Americans consider it chic to be seen toting around best sellers from Spanish publishers like Seix Barral, or the latest winner of Spain's literary brass ring, the Cervantes Prize. Since 1990, the value of Spanish book exports to Latin America has quintupled.
With that higher profile, however, have come signs of the reappearance of anti-Spanish sentiment. Such feelings have deep roots among Mexicans, who long ago began calling their former colonian masters "gachupines" an epithet akin to "gringos." Still, for much of this century the Spanish immigrant, whether the tailor on the corner, the nun teaching in a rural school or the refugee from Franco's fascism, was generally regarded with affection and sympathy because Spain was a poor country laboring under inept or dictatorial rule, just like most of Latin America.
Now, however, Spain's transformation into a prosperous, democratic and decidedly modern European state has reversed many of those stereotypes and some of the affection. In some places, the stereotypical image of the Castillian businessman with the slick-backed hair, fancy suit and lisping accent now competes with that of the ugly American in unpopularity. "They're barely off the plane from Madrid, and they're flaunting their money in our faces and sleeping with our women," a Havana taxi driver complained. "Let them just stay home."
At the official level, relations between Spain and Cuba have been tense since Spaniards elected Jose Maria Aznar Prime Minister two years ago. He has been pressing Cuba for changes toward democracy, and Fidel Castro's regime has responded with a barrage of personal insults. Last month, with the centennial of the Spanish-American War approaching, Cuban leaders accused Spain of inflicting genocide on Cuba during the 19th Century, and of failing to apologize.
 
Following the Leader
Nevertheless, Spain's transition from backward dictatorship to industrial democracy is widely admired by politicians elsewhere in Latin America, who have often looked to the Spanish experience as a road map. When Gen. Joao Figueiredo, for instance, was Brazil's President in the early 1980's, he evoked two of Spain's champions of democracy by saying he hoped to be remembered as "the Juan Carlos or Adolfo Suarez of Brazil."
And for all the complaining about the new Spain, one essential fact remains: Like it or not, the blood, language and culture of Spain run deep in the Latin American soul. His recent strident anti-Spanish rhetoric notwithstanding, Mr. Castro himself is a son of a Spanish soldier who came to Cuba in the late 19th century to fight the very Cuban rebels Mr. Castro now exalts. The soldier stayed on, becoming a wealthy Cuban landowner.
"An extraordinary number of Cuban leaders are the children of Spaniards, and that puts pressure on them to show they are more revolutionary and nationalist than anyone else," Dr. Roy explained. "It's just like Poles, Jews or Italians who immigrated to the United States. First-generation Americans also feel forced to show that they are more American than the Americans."
Later generations, he might have added, often reconnect to roots in the old country.

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Making Way For Fidelity's Heir Apparent

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
SHE does not carry an electronic organizer, or write with a $200 pen. No flashy touches adorn the hushed tones of the suits -- not Armani -- she favors.
For the billionaire daughter of the billionaire chairman of the world's largest mutual fund company, even a slight display of ostentation runs counter to character -- a character that acquaintances old and new describe as understated, soft-spoken, modest and down to earth. 
 So far, that puts Abigail Pierrepont Johnson, 36, on much the same path as her father, Edward C. Johnson 3d, who is 67 and the chairman of Fidelity Investments.
"I watched her father take over the company from his father," said William J. Hayes, a longtime executive who retired last year after seven years as head of Fidelity's equity mutual fund division. "He took his time learning the operation. He didn't go in the first day and say: 'I'm it. Let's do this.' That's the same way I've observed Abby as she has joined the management side."
Perhaps if she leads Fidelity for 26 years, as her father has, Ms. Johnson will also acquire his reputation for gruff, caustic leadership. Or perhaps she will maintain the genial style of her grandfather, Edward C. Johnson 2d, who led Fidelity from its founding in 1946 until turning it over to his son, then 42, in 1972.
But for now, Ms. Johnson, who one year ago moved into Fidelity's middle-management ranks after eight years as an investment analyst and fund manager, has adopted the roles of both teacher and student.
As a teacher, she shepherds new portfolio managers, offering tips on things as obscure as the economics of oil drilling, or the best time of day to trade certain stocks. At the same time, she is slowly slipping into her role as the company's heir apparent -- learning, at the right hand of several of her father's closest advisers, how to manage people in a business where ego can play an important role in success.
Financial circles from the Charles River to Wall Street have been abuzz in the last year with speculation about whether Abby, as she is known, will succeed her father and, if so, when. But she says she still has not decided whether she will seek to -- or wants to, which is not the same thing -- ultimately take the reins.
She makes it clear, however, that in the turmoil that has surrounded Fidelity for more than a year, she has sensed both the opportunity and the obligation to take a bigger role in the family institution. "I really loved running money, and I wasn't eager to give it up," Ms. Johnson said. But at the time, moving into corporate management "seemed like the right thing to do," she said. "Someone was going to need to make that jump."
Sitting in a modestly furnished office with a view of Boston Harbor, Ms. Johnson, the eldest of Ned Johnson's three children, brightens noticeably when discussing her early memories of Fidelity. As a youngster, she said, she often visited the company's headquarters on Devonshire Street. "I remember going to the trading room and being captivated by the energy, the excitement," she said.
Two dozen toy models of heavy machinery -- dump trucks, tractors, steam shovels and cranes -- sit atop a filing cabinet, remnants of her first full-time assignment, as an analyst and manager of the Select Industrial Equipment fund. A stem of basil is growing in a coffee mug on her desk, watched over by a half-dozen photographs of her daughter, soon to be 3 years old. Outside her 35th-floor window, airplanes headed for the nearby Logan International Airport drift by at eye level.
Fidelity has operated in rarefied air for decades. But more recently, a dense fog has formed around the company. In late 1996, as Fidelity was watching over more than $400 billion of Americans' investments in mutual funds -- nearly twice as much as its nearest competitor -- rafts of the company's esteemed fund managers were departing.
Fidelity controlled 13 percent of the market in an industry where only 10 other companies had more than a 2 percent share, but the performance of its most popular mutual funds, and its reputation for investment acumen, were sagging. All around it, the mutual fund business was changing.
Where employers once offered only Fidelity funds in their retirement plans, they started to demand choices from other fund companies. The company's market share began to dip. And confidence among the company's retail customers was deemed so low that Fidelity, known as relentlessly controlling of the flow of information about its business, sent top executives on a six-city road show to answer questions and reassure individual investors.
Last winter, as Mr. Hayes prepared to retire as her boss, Ms. Johnson realized that "some people would need to step forward to take his place," she said.
"If you had asked me about it six months before I stopped running money, I would have said 'of course not,' " she said of her move to management. "But in this business you have to be opportunistic. It doesn't make sense to lay out a rigid plan and be adamant about pursuing it."
AS Fidelity's largest shareholder, with 24.5 percent of the voting stock of the FMR Corporation, Fidelity's parent, and with a net worth estimated by Forbes magazine at $3.4 billion, Ms. Johnson can do whatever she wants. What she wants to do for now, she insists, is simply to learn how to manage the people who manage America's money.
"I'm concerned that there is a misperception that Fidelty's philosophy has changed, that we are willing to accept poor performance," she said. "Nothing could be farther from the truth. This company was founded on top performance and everything we do is dedicated to achieving it."
To do so, she said, "I think a lot about career paths," referring mainly to those of the fund managers she oversees, but with a nod of acknowledgment that people wonder most about her own. "If you want a group of people to hold together over the long term, you have to think about where each of them is going."
Ms. Johnson said her experience as a Fidelity fund manager helped her fit naturally into her new job as one of three senior vice presidents who assist Robert C. Pozen, the head of Fidelity's mutual fund division.
Her specific roles include overseeing equity information systems -- the vast computer networks that give Fidelity's fund managers access to the reams of research generated by the company's army of investment analysts. In addition, she acts as a liaison with other parts of Fidelity's empire, screening requests for new funds from the marketing department or filtering demands for access to fund managers from brokers and financial advisers who sell Fidelity funds.
"I don't want the fund managers having to worry about whether we should use Unix or Windows NT as our new operating system," Ms. Johnson said. "And I don't want our portfolio managers flying off to East Podunk every week to meet with two brokers. We want the portfolio managers investing and picking stocks."
She shares responsibility for riding herd over three groups of portfolio managers, including those who run some of the company's biggest funds, like Magellan, Growth Company and Low-Priced Stock.
Helping to supervise people who were her peers just a few months ago can make for an awkward transition. But if Ms. Johnson feels natural in the role of coach to those who are still playing in the game, it is probably because she always worked as hard as anyone else.
"You never would have known she was the heir to all of this," said one former Fidelity fund manager, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "She did not want to be regarded as the scion of power. And as an analyst at industry conferences, she was running to visit 300 companies like all the rest of us."
After college, Ms. Johnson spent two years at Booz-Allen & Hamilton, the New York consulting firm. "I thought it would be too bad if I never worked someplace else," she said. She joined Fidelity after graduating from Harvard Business School in 1988, spending five years as a Fidelity analyst, offering investment ideas to more experienced fund managers. Then came three years as the manager of a succession of three general equity portfolios, a tenure that produced a better-than-average record.
In May 1996, as Fidelity's fund management ranks underwent their second big shake-up in three months, prompted by the departure of the Magellan manager, Jeffrey N. Vinik, Ms. Johnson became manager of the $1.3 billion Fidelity Trend fund.
While the Trend fund was smaller than her previous assignment, the move had echoes of the family heritage. It was at this same fund that her father demonstrated his investment prowess from 1959 to 1965, guiding it to average annual gains of 30 percent, more than twice those of the typical growth stock fund.
MS. JOHNSON'S own tenure at the Trend fund was less remarkable. In roughly eight months, the fund, which tries to detect investment currents ahead of the crowd, gained 9.6 percent, well below the 13.4 percent gain in the average growth stock fund tracked by Lipper Analytical Services.
Some Fidelity watchers have noted that Ms. Johnson's departure from the Trend fund (and before that from the OTC fund, which she took over in 1994) occurred as those funds started to struggle. Skeptics carped that the company was protecting its favorite daughter's track record. Fidelity has dismissed the suggestion, saying the changes were dictated by companywide shifts.
While she clearly relishes her new role, Ms. Johnson says she recognizes that Fidelity revolves around its portfolio managers. "In some ways, there is nothing more fun" than being a portfolio manager, she said. "You set your own schedule, set your own priorities, particularly here at Fidelity where you have tremendous resources available to you. You have a lot of autonomy, but you also have individual accountability."
The balance of those two characteristics -- autonomy and accountability -- are what give Fidelity its unique culture, Ms. Johnson said. And the company's core belief -- that mutual funds are best managed by individuals, not teams -- will remain in place, she believes, notwithstanding outsiders' speculation that Fidelity may adopt the team approach favored by a Boston rival, Putnam Investments, and many other management companies.
While the give and take among individuals is key to sharpening their skills, she explained, each person performs better when directly accountable for decisions.
"There is a balance," Ms. Johnson said. "You need individual contributors who work as a team. You have to have your own opinion, but be accountable for your fund. And when discussion groups of fund managers get together to talk about their favorite ideas, that debate is the basis of having an intellectually challenging environment."
That, Ms. Johnson said, was the environment fostered by her grandfather, who in 1946 established the Fidelity Management and Research Company to provide investment management services to the Fidelity Fund, of which he was president, and the hundreds of other mutual funds that followed.
Ms. Johnson acknowledges that Fidelity's growth in recent years has strained the bonds that have held the company together for 50 years.
"People who don't know each other as well don't feel as comfortable challenging each other," she said. Fully half of the company's 25,000 employees have been at Fidelity for less than three years, and many of its fund managers are in their 20's and 30's.
TO deal with the added strain on fund managers, Mr. Pozen, who was named early last year to head Fidelity's mutual fund division, forged a management team that included Ms. Johnson and two others: Robert A. Lawrence, head of the high-income division, who also oversees the asset allocation funds and is the liaison between fund managers and the trading desk, and Richard A. Spillane Jr., who oversees the international fund managers.
Their job, Mr. Pozen said, is more than to simply make sure that fund managers do not stray from their assigned investment objectives. They also serve as mentors.
Ms. Johnson's method is more gentle prodding than overt direction. "Have you considered . . . ?" begins a typical conversation with a junior fund manager. "One thing I've always found helpful . . . ," she adds.
"I'm trying not to tell them what to do, even though part of me desperately wants to," Ms. Johnson said. "I try to get them to think about prioritizing how they spend their time. They need to figure out the right balance of resources -- Fidelity analysts, maybe a little bit from the sell side. They already know how to pick stocks."
In listing the people who have had a significant influence on her life, Ms. Johnson does not stray outside the walls of Fidelity. "Obviously Peter Lynch had a huge impact on me, as he had a huge impact on everybody who worked for him," she said. "He's got his values clearly thought out, and he's very focused on them. So many of the principles that made us successful came from him." Now a vice chairman of Fidelity, Mr. Lynch quit managing the Magellan fund eight years ago to spend more time with his family.
Ms. Johnson also points to James C. Curvey, Fidelity's chief operating officer, the No. 2 executive at the company. "When I got my first summer job at Fidelity, I talked to Jim Curvey, who was head of human resources, about what I thought I could learn to be good at," she recalled. It has been lost to posterity whether Mr. Curvey told her that if she worked really hard, she could end up running the company. But her career path is certainly an issue that she has discussed with her father -- in broad terms, at least.
"If I ever thought about making a change, of course I talked to him," Ms. Johnson said. "I learned everything I learned early on -- about business, the markets, and a lot of things about life -- from him." Now, she lamented, "he cares more about his granddaughter than about me."
Although she misses the travel in her former job, Ms. Johnson lists one big plus in her new one: being able to spend more time with her family, including 3-year-old Julia. Last spring, shortly after starting her new management job and near the height of the turmoil inside the fund business, Ms. Johnson rushed home many evenings to attend to a task she considered as important as work -- reading to Julia from a children's book about weddings, in preparation for her role as a flower girl in the wedding of Elizabeth Johnson, Abby's 34-year-old sister.
UNTIL recently, Abby was the only one of Ned Johnson's three children to work at Fidelity. Last year, her brother, Edward C. Johnson 4th, who is 33, joined Fidelity's real estate division. Elizabeth Johnson's husband, Robert C. Ketterson Jr., works for Fidelity Capital, a venture capital unit. (Abby Johnson's husband, Christopher J. McKown, is the co-founder of a health care services company.)
Since Julia's birth, Abby Johnson has been less active in local charities. But according to people who know her well, what stood out about Ms. Johnson's outside activities was how little time she spent with groups traditionally associated with the wealthy.
Her parents and siblings are fixtures at art openings and society galas, but Ms. Johnson's volunteer priority was Planned Parenthood.
"Providing basic health care is a pretty important thing," she explained. "I like the idea of supporting something that provides a basic necessity -- one that I take for granted but that not everybody can."
Ms. Johnson has a less serious side, as well, one that manifests itself in subtle ways -- as if she coyly wants to see if you, too, see the humor in something.
Something like Jojo, for example, a three-foot-tall piece of folk sculpture, set on a three-foot pedestal, that adorns one corner of Ms. Johnson's office. Actually titled "Shakey Man," the work, by the Massachusetts artist Pat Keck, is a wildly decorated human figure with flame-red hair, a beaded garment and a peculiar way of gyrating when a handle on the pedestal is pressed.
"When the market gets a little shaky, I like to give him a little shake," she said.
Other symbols here and there could be quiet signals of what Ms. Johnson sees as her role at Fidelity -- for example, the slim volume, "Mastering the Public Spotlight," by the Boston media consultant Arnold Zenker. The book is tucked among the business best sellers on her bookshelf.
The men who are tutoring Ms. Johnson have both her father's ear and their own ideas about how Fidelity must operate in the rapidly changing mutual fund industry. Mr. Johnson himself, of course, will play no small part in the decisions. Notorious for his dislike of publicity, Mr. Johnson declined to be interviewed.
"If he had his druthers, he probably would like to see her take over the company," Mr. Curvey said. "But first he wants her to do what makes her happy. If that is to run this company, he'd be all for it. If that is spending time with her family, he'd say 'fabulous.' "
When Mr. Johnson took over the day-to-day management of Fidelity from his father, there were concerns about whether he had the vision to carry the company, or whether, because of its rapid growth, it would stagnate under its own weight. So it is not surprising that similar worries are raised by outsiders about Ms. Johnson.
Perhaps her toughest obstacle may be that Fidelity -- indeed, the entire Boston-based mutual fund industry, if not most of the financial world -- is dominated by men.
Fidelity's operating committee counts no women among its 13 members. Ms. Johnson is the lone woman on the parent company's six-person board, though Fidelity says 24 percent of those in the company's professional investment ranks are women as well as a smaller portion of its senior executives.
Ms. Johnson says she is not worried. "As a female Fidelity executive, I feel comfortable in saying that our goal is to hire on talent and nothing else," she said.
But Ms. Johnson, of course, is not just hired talent; she is Fidelity born and bred.
"As I said, I'm opportunistic," she said. "For now, I have a challenging job where I can have an impact and maintain some kind of normal life. And I've indicated that I care about some balance and some kind of normalcy in my life."
Beyond that, she said, "I just don't know."

Today's Cars and Drivers Can Grow Old Together

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
JUST a quarter century ago, a car that stayed presentable for 100,000 miles was a marvel. By the time the zeros rolled around again on the odometer, the bodies of most cars were scarred by rust and their engines rattled ominously. And each year, it seemed, Detroit ordered up cosmetic changes that made the previous year's model look ancient.
This, in the view of auto industry critics, was "planned obsolescence," a deliberate strategy to build cars that would quickly fall apart or look old-fashioned, forcing customers to buy new models. Auto executives contend that no such strategy ever existed. 
 But the fact remains that for more than a decade, American automobile makers have been producing much more durable cars. They were forced to do so because Americans were turning by the millions to higher-quality Japanese imports, and because of tougher Federal regulations. Planned obsolescence, if it ever existed, was no longer practical.
A car that once might have been headed for the junk heap at 60,000 miles is now just getting its second wind. Polls show growing public acceptance of used cars as alternatives to new cars. All of which is good news for consumers, but not necessarily for the auto industry.
More cars these days are performing like Paul A. Balinski's white 1989 Ford Mustang GT. Mr. Balinski, a 32-year-old machinery leasing agent in Bridgewater, N.J., has put 230,000 miles on the car and had only one major repair, a new transmission. "The only reason the transmission went is that I bought that car when I was 22 years old and I was a speed freak," he said. "All my friends say that given the way I drive, I'm lucky."
But there may be more than luck involved. Car engines are increasingly designed to last for 150,000 miles, and bodies are now made of highly corrosion-resistant steel. Even the seats have more durable fabrics and leathers that do not show wear as quickly.
The average age of cars on the nation's roads is soaring as a result, increasing by two months each year. According to the Polk Company, which tracks registration data in all 50 states for the nation's 201 million vehicles, the median age of registered cars reached 8.1 years in 1997, a record high.
What is truly remarkable is that the average age of cars is rising during a time of economic growth. Americans used to hold onto their old clunkers during recessions, then trade them in when an improved economy brought them raises and promotions. From 1986 to 1989, when the economy was growing at a brisk clip, the median age of cars on the road fell to 6.5 years from 7 years.
 
Rising Expectations
Cars are lasting longer because Americans increasingly expect their cars to keep running a long time and shun brands that fail to do so. New car buyers expect to be able to resell their purchases within several years for at least half of what they paid, or to pass their cars on in reasonably good shape to teen-agers or friends.
As used cars become more reliable, they no longer carry a penurious stigma. The Dohring Company, a market research business, documented the trend in a survey of car shoppers this winter. Given a choice between a $15,000 new car and an identically priced, 3-year-old used car that cost substantially more when new, 62 percent of the respondents chose the used car. Not surprisingly, sales are plunging for small cars, which typically sell for $15,000 or less.
And used cars are becoming easier to buy and sell, because banks now offer loans for used cars at nearly the same interest rates as for new cars, and are even beginning to offer used car leases.
Some car dealers and bankers have a more disturbing explanation for the recent popularity of used cars. Rising income inequality has left fewer Americans able to afford new cars at all, they say, while the few who can afford new cars are choosing more expensive models fully loaded with options. Market researchers say that the most affluent third of the population, whose inflation-adjusted incomes have been rising steadily, now account for a huge and growing share of new vehicle purchases.
These affluent buyers increasingly demand compact disk changers, powerful engines and other amenities. So when dealers fill in their factory order forms to stock their showrooms, they ask for cars with every possible option, even though this makes the cars less affordable.
"It's bizarre. When I order now, I check every box because I'll find someone to buy it," said Daniel Rudolph, a Buick and GMC dealer in Lewiston, Idaho. "In my area, I see a gap opening between the haves and the have-nots. The middle class is kind of disappearing."
 
A Two-Edged Sword
Consumers may be delighted with the greater reliability and appeal of used cars. But for auto makers, it is a two-edged sword. Sales in the United States peaked during the last economic expansion at 16 million cars and light trucks in 1986. But even with very low unemployment, sales have been stuck for the last four years at a strong but steady 15 million vehicles.
The quiet, seldom-voiced worry in the auto industry involves what will happen during the next recession. With many Americans already holding onto their cars so much longer during good times, no one knows how long people will keep driving their cars during bad times.

HEADLINE: The Nation: The Antitrust Dilemma;
Smokestack Doctrine, Digital Age

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
TO the digitally fluent of Silicon Valley, the heartland of America's high-tech economy, the Government's antitrust battle with the Microsoft Corporation has become known, half-jokingly, as "our O. J. trial"-- a high-profile, high-stakes case whose outcome will surely be divisive, whether for or against Microsoft.
The Microsoft case, then, seems destined to fit neatly into the rich tradition of national ambivalence about the doctrine of antitrust. For more than a century, the antitrust laws have been an uneasy compromise between two American values, populism and capitalism. 
 The Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was passed in response to worries about the power of the industrial trusts built around the essential business network of the day -- the railways. Opponents warned darkly that the act would legitimize "fearful assaults on capital." Even supporters moved cautiously, producing a law of less than 200 words that, in broad language, prohibits anticompetitive agreements and the abuse of monopoly power.
The Sherman Act and the Clayton Act of 1914, which bans anticompetitive mergers and some predatory tactics like discriminatory pricing contracts, remain the foundation of the nation's antitrust policy. The Microsoft case, begun last October, has started a wide-ranging debate over how the smokestack doctrine of antitrust applies -- or should not apply -- to the information-age fields of computing and the Internet.
Adapting the laws of antitrust to the digital age will be a challenge. Traditionally, the focus of antitrust enforcement by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission had been to look for a dominant company in a business engaging in raising prices, the surest evidence of monopolistic abuse.
 
A Natural Evolution
But the old rules do not apply so cleanly to high-tech industries like computer software. Recent economic analysis suggests that software markets often evolve naturally toward monopoly. Consumers and suppliers sometimes prefer the efficiency of learning a single industry-standard technology, which one company may own. Once established, the dominant producer benefits from what economists call "network effects" -- meaning a product or service becomes more valuable the more people use it.
So a high market share, even 80 percent or more, is not necessarily a flashing red light to antitrust police. More telling is that prices in the information industries, after adjusting for performance improvements, are generally falling. So there is scant evidence of monopolistic abuse in pricing, the simplest barometer of consumer welfare.
In Washington, the Justice Department and trade commission officials concede that the context may have changed, but they insist that the antitrust issues in the high-tech arena are not new. "There is an accumulation of market power in some of these industries that would be the envy of John D. Rockefeller," observed Robert Pitofsky, chairman of the commission.
In the high-tech field, the antitrust agencies are focusing mainly on two related issues: the use, and possible abuse, of market power as a dominant company in one market moves into a new market; and ways to insure that there is a competitive market for innovation in new businesses.
"We want to make sure that innovation thrives because innovation is the greatest stimulant to economic development in these industries," said Joel I. Klein, the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the antitrust division. "You want an environment where entrepreneurs believe that they can be the next Microsoft."
Such reasoning led the Justice Department to sue Microsoft last fall. The case, in some ways, is a narrow contract dispute, but it has opened the door to the larger debate over antitrust policy. The Justice Department sued Microsoft for allegedly violating its 1995 antitrust consent decree with the Government by forcing personal computer makers to install its Internet Explorer browser as a condition of licensing its Windows operating system, the industry standard.
The consent decree prohibits Microsoft from tying the purchase of one product to another -- precisely, the Justice Department asserts, what Microsoft is doing with its licensing of Explorer and Windows. Microsoft contends that Explorer is not a separate product, but merely a "feature" of Windows.
A Federal judge in December ordered Microsoft to temporarily offer PC makers the choice of installing Windows without its Explorer browser. Microsoft said it could not be done, but eventually offered PC makers the alternative of stripping off the Explorer icon from Windows. Microsoft is appealing. The company says that if the Government wins, it will be a step on the road to Government meddling in the software industry.
The Justice Department insists that Microsoft should be free to become bigger and richer, and vanquish rivals in the process. But, the Department adds, it should not be allowed to use its operating-system monopoly to gain an unfair advantage in the new market of Internet software. The stakes are high, the Government insists, because much of commerce will soon be conducted over the Internet. The Justice Department is also considering a broader suit against Microsoft under the Sherman Act, but it has not decided whether to go ahead.
 
A Threatening Innovation
Yet even the consent-decree case points to the thorny issues facing the Government and the courts as they weigh complex matters of efficiency, market power and consumer welfare. From the internal Microsoft memos presented to the court, it is clear that the company saw the leader in browser software, the Netscape Communications Corporation, as a threat to Microsoft's lucrative operating system business. That is because Netscape's browser could replace Windows as the first screen people see.
So Microsoft, in short, chose to make a potentially threatening innovation a free "feature" of its operating system. To some, the tactic was a powerful display of how Microsoft deploys the market power of its Windows monopoly. That could become an issue only in a broader Sherman Act case. Yet Microsoft would be able to marshal some forceful arguments in its defense. The Sherman Act deals with the intent as well as the effect of market behavior. Microsoft would surely say that while the effect of its strategy may be to harm rivals and reduce competition, its intent has been to improve Windows, generating an efficiency gain for its product and consumers.

Chart: "Monopoly Not"
The text of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Penalties have been increased over the years by a series of amendments. In 1890, when it was written, the maximum penalty for criminal violation was $5,000 and one year in jail.
 Section 1 -- Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be illegal. Every person who shall make any contract or engage in any combination or conspiracy hereby declared to be illegal shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding ten million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, three hundred and fifty thousand dollars, or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.
 Section 2 -- Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or conspire with any other person or persons, to monopolize any part of the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, shall be deemed guilty of a felony, and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished by fine not exceeding ten million dollars if a corporation, or, if any other person, three hundred and fifty thousand dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding three years, or by both said punishments, in the discretion of the court.

HEADLINE: Auto-Lease Disclosure: Simplicity, Please

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Small Print Becomes Large in the New Car and Truck Leases" (Spending It, Jan. 25), which noted new Federal disclosure rules: 
 While some of the new requirements will be useful to consumers, the regulations as a whole, unfortunately, go in the wrong direction. Disclosure to consumers is fundamentally different from disclosure to government bodies or to investment professionals. The latter type of disclosure should provide as much detail as possible, under the assumption that economists, accountants and finance professionals can use the information to piece together a better picture. Consumers, on the other hand, generally do not have the time, expertise, or inclination to do such calculations. The disclosure statement should do it for them.
The new disclosure requirements on leasing include terms like "Depreciation and any amortized amounts," "Rent charge" and "Total of base monthly payments." While the form tries to explain these terms, they still carry little meaning to the average consumer and are not of much use for more sophisticated buyers, either.
A lease disclosure should be shorter. It should contain only a few important numbers. Consumers need to know the value of the vehicle (preferably the latest transaction price), the amount to be paid up front, the monthly payment on the lease and the best estimate of the true market value of such a vehicle at the end of the lease. This estimate can be based on the value of a similar used car in the so-called blue book.
These numbers and an appropriate interest rate are sufficient to provide accurate financial comparisons among all possible transactions. One can compare buying and leasing a given vehicle, different leases for the same vehicle, leases on different vehicles or buying one vehicle and leasing another.

HEADLINE: DIARY

BYLINE: BY PATRICK J. LYONS

 BODY:

INDONESIA
A Flight to Rigor
When in dire straits, don a straitjacket. That seems to be the thinking in Indonesia, where a proposal to peg the value of the badly battered rupiah to the dollar is gathering momentum. Instead of relying on interest rates and central bank intervention to defend the rupiah's value, the plan, called a currency board, would require that every rupiah in circulation be backed by dollars or other foreign exchange kept on deposit in the board's reserves. The method has been used successfully in Hong Kong and elsewhere, but the International Monetary Fund called Indonesia's plan premature, worrying that it would deny the country the flexibility it needs to work its way out of economic trouble. 

SOUTH KOREA
Belabored
South Korea's President-elect, Kim Dae Jung, thought he had a groundbreaking deal with the country's unions to legalize layoffs and inject some flexibility into a smotheringly rigid labor market. Then the deal teetered unexpectedly when a militant labor federation demanded a renegotiation and promised a general strike if it was ignored. Just as suddenly, the federation called off the threatened strike a day later, ostensibly on patriotic grounds. Analysts saw the episode as a warning shot across Mr. Kim's bow; investors were rattled and bid down Korean stocks, swamping the effect of progress on debt rescheduling announced earlier in the week.
 
OWNERSHIP
Whose Rock Is It?
Prudential Insurance can't help but make headlines. With hope that the effects of expensive scandals over dodgy sales practices in its life insurance and securities arms are behind it, the giant insurer made noises last week about going public. Since 1943, the company has been owned mutually by its policyholders, an arrangement that makes it a little harder for the company to raise capital for expansion and a lot harder for top executives to build fortunes for themselves. With $179 billion in assets, Prudential would be by far the biggest company ever to demutualize, and the deal would require a new law in New Jersey, Prudential's home state -- not much of an obstacle, analysts say, considering the company's local influence. Prudential executives, vowing to avoid the egregious examples of some past insurance company conversions, promised that insiders and investment bankers would not cart away big slabs of The Rock, leaving policyholders with gravel.
 
MERGERS
Buy, Buy, Buy
Billion-dollar mergers are getting to be a dime a dozen. CVS, the No. 1 drugstore chain, agreed to buy No. 10, Arbor Drugs, for $1.48 billion. In the water treatment business, United States Filter will swap $1.5 billion in stock for Culligan Water Technologies of "hey, Culligan man" fame. The Canadian National Railway agreed to acquire the Illinois Central Corporation for $2.4 billion, drawing a "T" in railroad tracks across the continent from Nova Scotia to Vancouver and Winnipeg to New Orleans. But the serious money of the week came from Long Island's largest employer, the software giant Computer Associates, which made an uninvited $8.4 billion cash bid for Computer Sciences, a Southern California provider of technology services.
 
NEST EGGS
Betting the House
For the first time in decades, the average American household has more of its wealth invested in stocks than in real estate. An analysis of the latest Federal Reserve figures, for the third quarter of 1997, showed that equities make up 28 percent of household wealth, more than double the levels of 1990 or in the period just before the 1987 market crash. Real estate accounts for only 27 percent. Families, which are richer than ever before, are holding much less in cash than they did seven years ago, down from 17 percent to only 12 percent of household wealth. But Americans also appear to be resting on their laurels. Commerce Department figures released last week showed that Americans saved only 3.8 percent of their disposable income last year, the least since before World War II.
 
STOCKS
About Time
A year ago, the Dow Jones industrial average was way ahead of the overall market. Now it's behind. But investors and the news media still treat it like a lodestar. The Dow finally fought its way back last week to the record heights of last August, regaining all the ground it lost in the October market plunge. Most of its buoyancy has come from just a few members, like AT&T, which has soared more than 50 percent since Aug. 6; many of the rest have been stinkers, dragging the index's performance down south of broader measures like the Standard & Poor's 500 and the New York Stock Exchange composite, both of which matched their preplunge highs in December. Smaller stocks have also been lagging. Neither the Nasdaq composite nor the Russell 2000 has yet regained its preplunge high.
 
TRUCKS
Seeing Other Dangers
Auto insurers are beginning to look beyond a vehicle's occupants when judging safety hazards, and when it comes to light trucks, they don't like what they see. Concluding that pickups and sport utility vehicles pose much greater risks to other drivers than cars do, but don't keep their own occupants a whole lot safer, a group of insurance companies called for major design changes. At the other end of the weight spectrum, the Environmental Protection Agency accused makers of heavy truck engines of designing them to run cleanly during emissions tests but filthily (and thus more cheaply) on the highway. Even when they meet Government standards, heavy trucks generate more than 15 times as much nitrogen oxide air pollution as cars do, vehicle for vehicle.
 
ANALYTICS
Mum's the Word
Macy's didn't tell Gimbels, and Bloomberg L.P. certainly didn't want to share trade secrets with its archrival, Reuters Holdings. Is that a reasonable attitude? Lawyers for Reuters are considering arguing that Bloomberg's standard subscription contract, which obliges customers to keep Bloomberg's secrets secret, is "unreasonable" and thus invalid. This matters to Reuters because one of its subsidiaries has been accused of a bit of skulduggery in its scramble to compete with Bloomberg's highly successful specialty computer terminals for market analysts and traders. The Government is investigating whether Reuters had a consultant subscribe to the Bloomberg service and then pass along data so Reuters could "reverse engineer" Bloomberg's system and replicate its abilities. Reuters isn't admitting anything but allows that such a thing is "possible."
 
TRENDS
Pastryfaced
Twice in eight days, cream pies have found their way into the surprised faces of high-profile chief executives, but for very different reasons. Microsoft's chairman, William H. Gates, was hit on Feb. 4 in Belgium, apparently by professionals. Microsoft attributed the splat to accomplices of a certain Noel Godin, who makes a living selling videotape of the famous, messy and nonplused to television. By contrast, Thursday's pieing of the Procter & Gamble chairman, John E. Pepper, at an awards banquet in Columbus, Ohio, was the work of an activist protesting P. & G.'s use of live animals in product testing. Mr. Gates's incoming confection was a tasty but fattening Belgian custard; Mr. Pepper got a more politically correct tofu cream, presumably not made with Olestra.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: POLICY;
U.S. Builds Its Case on Shifting Assertions

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO 

 BODY:
Last November, after Saddam Hussein allowed United Nations weapons inspectors to return to Iraq, President Clinton made clear just how crucial their work was for global security.
"They must be able to proceed with their work without interference, to find, to destroy, to prevent Iraq from rebuilding nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to carry them," he said in a speech at the White House on Nov. 21. 
 But once again, Mr. Hussein has blocked the weapons inspectors from doing that. And on Friday, Mr. Clinton described a far more modest goal.
"What we want to do is to significantly diminish the capacity of the Iraqis to reconstitute, to develop, to deploy their weapons of mass destruction, and to threaten their neighbors," he said.
As the United States moves closer to military action against Iraq, Mr. Clinton and his national security team have shifted from the sweeping language of what they would like to do, voicing a more sober appraisal of what they believe they can do if they start dropping bombs.
On Friday, he and his aides began a campaign to prepare Americans for an air campaign that they say will involve the death of Iraqi civilians and even of American service people. In the process, they are struggling to refine their message.
"The closer you get to a military option," said the White House spokesman, Michael D. McCurry, "the more precise the language must be so that Americans can understand the mission."
Not since the buildup to the American-led war to drive Iraq out of Kuwait seven years ago have American officials waged such an anguished and lengthy effort to prepare the country and the world for the use of force.
But the often inconsistent public statements over recent months on the goals of American policy toward Iraq have left Congress, the American public and even officials within the Administration confused.
Mr. Clinton and his aides know that they will be judged on the basis of whether they succeed in the military mission they set for themselves in public. If people are killed on both sides but there is no visible success, the Administration will face the question: What was the point?
But thus far, by its own admission, the Administration has been unable to make its political and military goals understandable.
In an acknowledgment that the stakes -- and the risks -- of the policy need to be explained better, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen and President Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, will conduct an unusual town meeting at Ohio State University in Columbus on Wednesday, to "talk to the American people."
The meeting will follow remarks Mr. Clinton is to make at the Pentagon on Tuesday after he receives a briefing on the military planning. One White House official described his remarks as an address to the American people.
The White House is getting so many questions from Congress and reporters about imprecise goals that it is compiling a record of all public statements on the Iraq crisis as a first step toward articulating a consistent line, a White House official said. Two weeks ago the Administration distributed written "talking points" for all officials who have to speak publicly about Iraq.
Congress seems particularly confused about what the endgame is, and in some cases it questions the value of bombing at all unless the purpose is to get rid of Mr. Hussein. The Administration's position is that achieving that militarily is infeasible and assassinating him is illegal.
Senator Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, which will ultimately decide whether to finance a military operation in Iraq, expressed the frustration of many of his colleagues when he said early last week: "We want a better understanding of what the objective of all this is. That is not clear."
Even some senior and midlevel Administration officials who deal with Iraq in the White House, Pentagon, State Department and intelligence community have expressed frustration that the Administration has not done a consistent enough job explaining the policy.
At one point last November, Mr. Clinton said that the United States would not allow economic sanctions against Iraq to be lifted until Mr. Hussein was out of power, a statement that went beyond United Nations resolutions and stated American policy, and had to be rolled back.
During a news conference with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on Feb. 6, Mr. Clinton said that the goal of military action was to "substantially reduce or delay" Iraq's ability to develop and use nonconventional weapons. But he left out the crucial second part of the formula, "to limit his ability to threaten his neighbors," which is diplomatic code for striking at conventional military targets as well.
"His answer was not as thorough as it could have been," said one White House official of the President's remark.
On other occasions, midlevel spokesmen have suggested that Mr. Hussein's weapons of mass destruction had to be "eliminated," which White House officials have called an unfortunate word choice.
Part of the difficulty is that the diplomatic and military goals are not identical, and Administration officials sometimes have not distinguished between them. Lawmakers complain not that they cannot get Cabinet-level officials to brief them, but that the officials are talking too much and not all with the same words.
"Different people required to speak publicly have been saying things in their own way," Mr. McCurry said. "The task has been to lock in one formula."
Another White House official put it less diplomatically. "The criticisms are correct," he said. "We don't have a clear, explainable objective like getting Saddam out of Kuwait. Some people are saying we are walking things back. It's more that there's been sloppy speech."
If the United States had its way, diplomacy would prevail. The inspectors would return to Iraq with unrestricted access to all potential weapons sites and carry out a 1991 Security Council resolution that empowers them to destroy all of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and forbids Iraq from ever developing them again.
When Mr. Clinton laid out "what's at stake" last Nov. 17, he said it was "essential that those inspectors go back to work."
"The children of the world depend on it," he said.
But military planners have made clear that bombs will not necessarily accomplish that. And there is a growing consensus throughout the Administration that the inspectors may never return. Mr. Clinton suggested as much when he said at his Feb. 6 news conference -- twice -- that the inspection regime may be "dead."
Even the limited military goal of substantially reducing or delaying Mr. Hussein's ability to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons arsenal may be overly ambitious. Last November, Gen. Anthony Zinni, the commander in charge of the Persian Gulf, acknowledged at a briefing at the Pentagon that "there is a lot not known about his weapons of mass destruction capability." He added, "I certainly do not feel we have a good sense of what he has."
And Defense Secretary Cohen acknowledged in a hearing with the Senate Armed Services Committee on Feb. 3 that when it comes to Iraq's chemical and biological weapons, "you can reconstitute them in a fairly short period of time."
Those statements complicate the Administration's task in explaining why military action that could result in substantial civilian casualties in Iraq and the death of Americans in uniform is worth it.

HEADLINE: Using Gifts as Bait, Peru Sterilizes Poor Women

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS 

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Feb. 14

 BODY:
For Magna Morales and Bernadina Alva, peasant Andean women who could barely afford to feed their families, it was a troubling offer but one they found hard to refuse. Shortly before Christmas, Government health workers promised gifts of food and clothing if they underwent a sterilization procedure called tubal ligation.
The operation went well for Mrs. Alva, 26, who received two dresses for her daughter and a T-shirt for her son. But Mrs. Morales, 34, died of complications 10 days after the surgery, leaving three young children and a husband behind. She was never well enough to pick up the promised gifts, and the family was told it could not sue the Government over her death because she had agreed to the procedure. 
 "When you don't have anything and they offer you clothes and food for your kids, then finally you agree to do it," said Mrs. Alva, a neighbor of Mrs. Morales in the northern village of Tocache. "Magna told them that her husband was against the idea, but they told her, 'Don't worry, we can do it right now, and tonight you will be back home cooking and your husband will never realize what happened.' "
Tales of poor women like Mrs. Morales and Mrs. Alva being pressed and even forced to submit to sterilization operations that have left at least two women dead and hundreds injured have emerged from small towns and villages across Peru in recent weeks in what women's groups, politicians and church leaders here say is an ambitious Government family planning program run amok.
Critics of the program, which was begun in 1995, charge that state health care workers, in a hurry to meet Government-imposed sterilization quotas that offer promotions and cash incentives, are taking advantage of poor rural women, many of whom are illiterate and speak only indigenous Indian languages.
The critics, who include many of the program's early supporters, say the health workers are not telling poor women about alternative methods of contraception or that tubal ligation is nearly always irreversible. They also charge that many state doctors are performing sloppy operations, at times in unsanitary conditions.
"They always look for the poorest women, especially those who don't understand Spanish," said Gregoria Chuquihuancas, another Tocache resident. "They make them put their fingerprint on a sterilization paper they don't understand because they can't read. If the women refuse, they threaten to cut off the food and milk programs."
While it remains unclear whether such actions were sanctioned by the Government or were the work of overzealous health workers -- the Government denies there are sterilization quotas, though it acknowledges goals for budgetary purposes -- independent investigations by members of the Peruvian Congress, the Roman Catholic Church, local journalists and a United States Congressional committee have chronicled dozens of cases of abuse.
"The Government's program is morally corrupt because nurses and doctors are under pressure to find women to sterilize, and the women are not allowed to make an informed decision," said Luis Solari, a medical doctor who advises the Peruvian Episcopal Conference, which speaks for the country's Catholic bishops.
"No one has the right to intervene in people's life this way," Dr. Solari said. "It's criminal."
From its inception, Catholic church leaders have vigorously opposed the family planning campaign because it promotes artificial forms of birth control, which the church disavows. Augusto Cardinal Vargas Alzamora of Lima has warned Catholics that they will be committing a "grave sin" if they resort to sterilization. Tubal ligation is still only the third most practiced form of contraception in Peru, after abstinence and the I.U.D., family planning officials say. Abortion is illegal.
The Government has vehemently rejected charges that it is conducting a campaign to sterilize poor women and says that all its sterilization operations are done with the patient's consent, as required by law.
Health Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that in the last year the program had suffered from "lapses in judgment" by individual health care workers and doctors, who had been reprimanded. But the officials said that such cases were isolated incidents that had been blown out of proportion.
Reached on his cellular telephone, Deputy Health Minister Alejandro Aguinaga, who oversees the program, said he did not wish to speak with The New York Times.
Three years ago, when President Alberto K. Fujimori announced plans to promote birth control as a way to reduce family size and widespread poverty in Peru, family planning experts, feminists and even many opposition politicians expressed broad support for the initiative. But the mounting criticism of the sterilizations has tarnished the image of the family planning program, one of the most ambitious in the developing world.
In 1997, state doctors in Peru performed 110,000 sterilizations on women, up from 30,000 in 1996 and 10,000 in 1995. Last year they also performed 10,000 free vasectomies on men, a slight increase over 1996. However, women remain the main focus of the Government's program because men are less likely to agree to sterilization, on the mistaken ground that the procedure could impair their virility.
Health Ministry officials estimate that the 1997 sterilizations will result in 26,000 fewer births in 1998. This is good news, they say, in a country where the fertility rate -- the average number of children born per woman -- is 3.5, compared with 3.1 for Latin America in general and 2 for the United States.
The rate is 6.2 children for Peruvian women who have little or no education and 7 children for those who live in rural areas. That compares with a rate of 1.7 children for women who have at least some college education and 2.8 for urban residents of all educational levels.
Concern over reports of forced sterilization has led to an investigation by the United States Congressional Subcommittee on International and Human Rights Operations, which is seeking to determine if money from the United States Agency for International Development was used in the Peruvian Government's campaign.
Officials in Washington said in a telephone interview that the agency had no role in the Peruvian Government's family planning program. They said that money and training for family planning services went directly to nongovernmental agencies in Peru that have no connection with the Government's program.
The officials said that they had deliberately taken steps to disassociate the agency from the Peruvian Government's family planning program after it became clear that, while well intentioned, it was too hurried and ambitious to avoid the pitfalls that it has now encountered.
Joseph Rees, the subcommittee's chief council, said that after a recent fact-finding mission to Peru he was convinced that no United States money was directly used to finance the Peruvian Government's campaign.
But he expressed concern that some money may have trickled through in the form of infrastructure, management or training support. Because some United States-sponsored food programs are operated from the same Peruvian Government medical posts that administer family planning in rural areas, Mr. Rees said that it was possible that some of this food could have been used to bribe women to undergo sterilizations.
"The bottom line here is whether the Peruvian Government is more interested in doing family planning or population control and whether the United States wants to risk being associated with a program where that notion is so far unclear," Mr. Rees said.
Meanwhile, despite the reported abuses, the number of women undergoing sterilizations in Peru has remained steady. Preliminary figures for January indicate that at least 10,000 women underwent free tubal ligations by state doctors.
The opposition Renovacion Party, a conservative group that has always objected to the program, says it has collected more than 1,000 complaints from women who say they were either injured by Government sterilization or pressured into agreeing to the operation.
Arturo Salazar, a Renovacion congressman, said the Fujimori Government had given no thought to the long-term effect of so many sterilizations, which if left unchecked, he said, will severely diminish Peru's rural population, deprive the nation of security on its frontiers and impede economic development in the countryside.
But those issues are of little concern to Martha Eras, also of Tocache, who is struggling to care for her new baby girl, who was born in August despite the Government-sponsored sterilization that Mrs. Eras voluntarily underwent eight months earlier. It appears that the doctor was in such a hurry that he did not check to see if Mrs. Eras was pregnant.
"My husband joked that it was immaculate conception," she said.

HEADLINE: Capitol Hill Looks At Issue Of Art Stolen In Wartime

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 12

 BODY:
Members of the House Banking Committee put aside their normal concern for monetary policy and deposit insurance today and turned their attention instead to the plundering of art during World War II -- and what to do about it now.
The unusual hearing, which included the rare appearance on Capitol Hill of the directors of four top art museums, marked a new stage in Congressional efforts to help victims of the Holocaust and their heirs win restitution for lost property. Until now, the efforts had focused primarily on gold, dormant bank accounts and insurance. 
 Experts have estimated that hundreds to tens of thousands of works of art looted during the Nazi reign in Europe remain unidentified and in the hands of museums, dealers and collectors around the world. In recent months, a handful of ownership claims have been lodged for art works in against American museums.
But James N. Wood, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, told committee members that the problem was "one of the most pressing and difficult questions facing American art museums today."
With the recent opening of wartime archives in the United States and Europe and the publication of books on looted art, more claims are expected. Many will be difficult to assess, given the lack of records and the time gap since the Third Reich began its effort to eradicate Jews in the 1930's.
Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said that a new Association of Art Museum Directors' study group, which he leads, would establish guidelines and procedures to help museums deal with claims.
Mr. Wood, Mr. de Montebello and their colleagues from the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington all said that they were continuing to investigate the ownership of works in the collections of their museums.
Although none of the witnesses who testified before the House Banking Committee saw a need for legislation, some suggested ways Congress could help.
Gilbert S. Edelson, the administrative vice president and counsel of the Art Dealers Association of America, pleaded for the unification, or at the least, coordination of groups doing research on lost art, including the World Jewish Congress and the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington.
"We should do now what should have been done many years ago," he said. "There should be a central registry and database where claims for the recovery of looted works could be registered, kept on file and where the information would be made available to all interested parties."
Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn said that he and his fellow Democratic Representative from New York, Nita M. Lowey of Rye, planned to introduce legislation to provide $5 million to private organizations helping families trace their losses and $5 million for checking the provenance of Federal art holdings. Their bill would also require anyone who purchased art, including museums, to do a reasonable title search.
In written testimony, Ronald S. Lauder, chairman of the World Jewish Congress's new Commission for Art Recovery, called for the declassification of additional wartime archives. "We need to press other nations to do the same," he added.
Several witnesses also said that international discussions of some type would be useful, largely because European law generally differs from American law in one crucial aspect: In the United States, no one can purchase good title for a stolen piece of art, no matter how many times it changed hands after the theft; in Europe, good-faith purchasers do obtain a clear title.
The purpose of the hearing was less to develop legislation than to raise public consciousness about the problem of stolen art, said Representative Jim Leach, the Iowa Republican who heads the committee.
"We need, it seems to me, new structures to come to grips with this problem," Mr. Leach said. "New databases, new clusters of experts, new international covenants."
Mr. Wood, Mr. de Montebello and their colleagues from the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the National Gallery of Art in Washington all said they were continuing to investigate the ownership of works in the collections of their museums.
But despite a consensus in the hearing room to develop some mechanism to resolve ownership claims outside the court system, none of the witnesses had an answer to the major questions of the day, which were asked repeatedly by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of Manhattan: "Who do you see deciding the standards of proof and who will determine whether those standards are met? And who will be the adjudicator and how can we enforce a standard in other countries?"

HEADLINE: Clinton Tells Indonesia to Stick to Reform

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 14

 BODY:
President Clinton called President Suharto of Indonesia on Friday night and warned him that Indonesia was once again on the verge of action that could imperil the $43 billion bailout of the country.
White House officials said today that Mr. Clinton had stopped just short of threatening to cut off aid if Mr. Suharto proceeds with a plan to change radically the way the country values its currency. 
 But the stakes were as much political as economic: Few experts doubt that withdrawal of the aid package, which was organized by the International Monetary Fund, would greatly aggravate Indonesia's economic turmoil, fueling the price riots that are breaking out.
The 30-minute call came just after Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the I.M.F., warned Mr. Suharto that Indonesia was close to violating the conditions of a pact the two men signed a month ago -- the second such accord since October.
Mr. Suharto has proposed a currency board, which would lock in an exchange rate for the rupiah that the fund fears could lead to sky-high interest rates and much wider unemployment. Currency boards have been successful in restoring economic discipline when used at a time of stability. Washington worries that in Indonesia, the effort would collapse after draining the last of Indonesia's $20 billion in foreign reserves.
If Mr. Suharto set up a currency board, Mr. Camdessus wrote, "we would not be able to recommend to the I.M.F. board the continuation of the present program because of the risks to the Indonesian economy."
But the deeper fear is that the monetary plan would strengthen the rupiah just long enough for Mr. Suharto's children and friends to convert their fortunes into dollars at a favorable rate and sweep the money out of the country.
Mr. Clinton's aides were circumspect in discussing the conversation with Mr. Suharto. In the past, American officials have dealt with Mr. Suharto, Asia's longest-serving leader, with care to avoid making him feel cornered. "There's a lot of concern here not to create the conditions for an anti-American backlash," a senior White House official said.
Another official said Mr. Suharto should understand that if he ignores both the President's conversation and the I.M.F. letter, the terms of the American relationship with Indonesia could easily change.
That relationship has been a very difficult one. While Washington regards Mr. Suharto, 76, as an unpredictable authoritarian whose main concern is to secure his family's fortune, there is no clear successor.
Mr. Clinton's strategy so far has been to get Mr. Suharto to accept conditions that would greatly change the culture of crony capitalism that Indonesia has nurtured.
Mr. Suharto, though, ignored virtually all of the conditions in the first package, signed in October. That led to a meltdown of its currency in late December and early January, and Mr. Clinton sent an emergency mission to Jakarta to deliver a strong message: Execute the reforms mandated, or watch the economy collapse.
Mr. Suharto signed a second, tougher accord a few days later, calling for the closing of weak banks, the breakup of monopolies and the end of financing for special projects run by Mr. Suharto's children and close friends.
Some of the provisions have gone into effect, raising prices of fuel and food. That, in turn, has prompted riots, most of which have been directed at ethnic Chinese shop owners, who are a small but economically powerful minority.

HEADLINE: Building Revives, but Renovation Thrives

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Construction cranes, an endangered species on the New York City skyline only a few years ago, have returned to roost. The yammer of rivet guns and the hiss of arc welders fills the air as new steel frames rise.
But the revival of new construction is only part of the story. Less visible, but taking up a larger role in the city's construction mix than ever before, is the renovation of the buildings that are already here. 
 From the Empire State Building, where tons of limestone are being stitched onto the building's skin, to the office buildings of Wall Street that are being converted into apartments, the city is quietly rebuilding its interiors and exteriors.
There are no hard numbers about how many people are employed in renovation work, since state and Federal surveys do not differentiate among construction workers. But numbers from the New York City Department of Buildings and anecdotal evidence suggest that while new construction has revived from its low point during the recession of the early 1990's, renovation work -- pushed by tax incentives, changing tastes and altered economics -- has grown even faster.
In fact, the number of applications for new buildings in 1997 was only about one-third of the total in 1989, when new construction in New York peaked, according to the Department of Buildings. Yet employment in the construction industry has come back strongly, to nearly 80 percent of its 1989 peak.
The growth in alterations, renovations and restorations partly explains why. The number of applications for such work is up 18.3 percent in the last four years, and the volume of restoration work on buildings covered by the city's landmarks laws has risen even faster -- up 50 percent since 1993 alone, and more than double the level of a decade ago, according to the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
The Board of Education is even considering a special vocational high school to teach the restoration arts.
"The vision of the school would be a place where young people could learn preservation skills -- why paint changes color over time, why arches don't fall," said Kenneth K. Fisher, a City Council member from Brooklyn who is backing the school plan. "The craftsman of the next century is going to need these skills."
In a city that has tended to treat the present -- not to mention the past -- as an obstacle to building an ever larger and grander city, the implications of this shift are profound. Knocking down a building in the 1990's to make way for a new one doesn't make as much economic sense as it once did, builders say. Preserving and renovating has become increasingly viable and profitable.
"The fact is, the market is really not strong enough to support new construction, except in unique locations," said Thomas Elghanayan, the president of Rockrose Development Corp., one of the city's largest developers. "And because of zoning changes, what's already there usually exceeds what you could put back if you tore it down anyway."
Like the economic restructuring that has swept through many other industries in recent years, the shifting construction mix in New York means adjustment. Workers may need to re-educate themselves, and in some cases, relearn the skills of their grandfathers.
"We're trying to teach these kids how to do it right, which means, how they used to do it," said Shaun McGloin, a bricklayer for 25 years before he switched to restoration in the 1980's. He now teaches the new/ old skills at the International Masonry Institute, a hands-on training academy in Queens run by his union, the Bricklayers and Allied Craftworkers International. "You try and think like they did back then," Mr. McGloin said. "What was a guy thinking when he did this a hundred years ago?"
This is Luis Arango's world. Mr. Arango, a 23-year-old native of Colombia, climbed aboard his first scaffold as an apprentice masonry renovator last month at the Serbian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Sava on 26th Street in Manhattan. His job was to repoint the bricks -- apply new mortar between the spaces to restore both the strength and appearance of the wall.
But what he realized when he got there, he said, suspended high above the street, was that the work's significance went beyond mixing stone and sand and mortar. He was standing in a place where no one had been, in all probability, since the day some anonymous bricklayer stood there before the Civil War.
"They told me nobody had touched these bricks in 150 years," Mr. Arango said, his voice filled with awe. "I felt like an artist up there."
Builders and architects say that a city law passed in 1980 requiring property owners to regularly inspect and maintain buildings over six stories in height gave the renovation business a boost.
And the city's efforts in the 1990's to rejuvenate the Wall Street area through tax breaks for restoring or converting old commercial buildings to new uses also helped. At the same time, many architects and builders, battered by a collapse of new construction during the recession of the late 1980's and early 1990's, were looking for new sources of revenue.
Changing tastes also contributed. Some Manhattan companies of the so-called new media Internet industry, for example, have said that old buildings have the image they want for their hip young offices, and many will not rent space in the austerely functional boxes of commerce built in more recent years.
Satisfying that new demand means creating what is in many cases a whole different order of labor. Where new construction is based on teamwork and speed and giant pieces of steel and blueprints coming hot off an architect's drafting table, renovation is often small and detailed and to a great degree, even personal work. Blueprints mostly don't exist. That means workers, architects and engineers have to try, as best they can, to imagine what was intended by the original builders, so that it can reproduced or repaired.
Archeology and respect for the past coexist with seat-of-the-pants improvisation. Sometimes, workers say, there are no tools to repair something that was created by an anonymous artisan of the past. A teaspoon, for example, when ground down to a point, makes a good wedge for inserting mortar between very old bricks.
And now the skill requirements are about to change again. Newer buildings, constructed after World War II and so just now beginning to enter their middle age, used entirely different materials from the iron and stone high-rise structures built before the war.
"These buildings are just starting to reach the age of reckoning," said Joan Gerner, a vice president and director of the preservation division at Lehrer McGovern Bovis, a large construction management firm in Manhattan that created for the first time in the 1990's a special division to focus on restoration and renovation work.
But even some of the youngest old buildings can present peculiar problems. A building in Lower Manhattan near the South Street Seaport, for example -- built in 1971 for offices and now being converted to apartments by Rockrose Development -- needed a buildingwide system of steel trusses to stop it from swaying. Its steel frame, said Mr. Elghanayan, Rockrose's president, was "underengineered." So the big I-beam trusses used to solve the problem were incorporated into some of the apartments as a deliberate part of the design and the appeal.
Renovation experts say their work is often a sort of archeology of building missteps: They focus on what didn't work when it was originally built, or what went went wrong as it aged. White glazed bricks, which became a fad in apartment house construction in the 1950's and 1960's in places like Manhattan's Upper East Side, have not weathered well in New York's freeze-and-thaw weather cycles -- they crack.
"It's rare that we open up a wall and say, 'Yep, this is the way it should have been done,"' said Paul Millman, a founding partner at Superstructures: Engineers + Architects, where about 60 percent to 70 percent of the company's contracts are now for restoration. On the other hand, Mr. Millman added, "we're only opening up walls that have problems."
One byproduct of the restoration focus, other building experts say, is that New York, long celebrated or despised for its headlong race toward the future, may be settling down.
"There is a level of visual comfort in being able to live and work in New York City and knowing that when you go away and come back, it will still look familiar," said Norman R. Weiss, a professor at Columbia University's graduate school of architecture, planning and preservation.

HEADLINE: Architects' Designs Envision Columbus Circle as a Great City Crossroads

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Navigating Columbus Circle, the chaotic intersection at the southwest corner of Central Park, can be a dangerous proposition for cars and pedestrians. With the New York Coliseum exhibition hall on the west side of the circle all but shuttered, the statue of Columbus stands over a bleak, windswept landscape.
Now that the state and the city, which own the Coliseum in a joint venture, are renewing efforts to sell the 3.4-acre site for commercial development, the Municipal Art Society has commissioned six architectural teams to develop proposals to reinvent Columbus Circle as a great crossroad for pedestrians, public transportation and drivers. 
 The Giuliani administration is in the midst of redesigning the circle, but the art society fears that concerns over traffic flow are overwhelming civic imagination and the chance to create a great public space.
"This is a critical intersection of what makes New York New York," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society. "It's a linchpin between Lincoln Center and the Upper West Side to the north, and Broadway and the theater district to the south. The public realm should be rediscovered and redeveloped."
The designs seek to call attention to the circle's pivotal role in the life of the city. The effort harks back to the turn of the century, when the Majestic and Circle theaters drew large crowds to the area, and to the 1930's, when New Yorkers gathered there for outdoor lectures, impromptu debates and demonstrations.
Two of the architects have taken a monumental approach, with Rafael Vinoly of New York proposing a gigantic trellis or hemisphere forming an overpass for the entire circle.
Similarly, Machado & Silvetti Associates of Boston and the Olin Partnership of Philadelphia have planned an illuminated "halo-like structure" 340 feet in diameter atop 140-foot pylons. At 59th Street, a metal sculpture of a human figure would hold up the halo, and a Broadway proscenium would mark the path to Times Square.
Another New York architect, Michael Sorkin, took a different tack, proposing a 12-foot-high egg-shaped glass dome over the island in the center of the traffic circle that would allow light into the subway mezzanine below as pedestrians walked across the structure. Weiss / Manfredi Architects of Manhattan also sought to expose the subterranean life below Columbus Circle by opening up the center island and placing a ramp that descends to the subway level.
The architectural firm Kennedy & Violich of Boston offered the only design that turned Columbus Circle into a "three-quarter roundabout," by extending the southwest corner of Central Park out to the center island. Light poles in concentric circles around the rim of the area would create a "luminous canopy."
In contrast to the other proposals, Dan Kiley of Vermont designed a more naturalistic setting. Two concentric rings of trees would mark the inner and outer edges of the circle, which would be carpeted with granite cobblestones. Jet fountains enclosed in Plexiglas would encircle the center island.
This is the second time in a decade that the Municipal Art Society has intervened at Columbus Circle. In the 1980's, the society was one of several groups that organized the great umbrella protest against a massive project planned for the Coliseum site. Thousands of opponents turned up in Central Park with black umbrellas to demonstrate what they said would be the mile-long shadow thrown by the proposed set of dual towers.
In response, the developer, Mortimer B. Zuckerman, scaled back his plans, only to see the project succumb to the recession of the early 1990's.
Now, the art society hopes it can generate a public debate and influence the redesign of Columbus Circle.
"There is the possibility here of shaping a great public space," Mr. Vinoly said. "This is the last big, totally grand opportunity to make a statement that, in the context of the end of the millennium, could become a transforming public space in the city."
The designs will be on view at the Municipal Art Society, 457 Madison Avenue, beginning Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Almost All the News on Kenya Is Turning Out Bad

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Feb. 10

 BODY:
No one has to tell Bernard Mulei that the Kenyan economy is in deep trouble. He hawks tours to passers-by in downtown Nairobi, and these days tourists are as scarce as the endangered species he entices them to see.
"High season, we used to get five or six tourists a day," he said, as he scanned the busy street for foreigners and found none. "Now you might get one. Some guys go two or three weeks without getting anything." 
 A month after President Daniel arap Moi won re-election to a fifth term, his Government is facing the monumental task of putting back together an economy shattered by torrential rains, political upheaval, ethnic violence, a steep drop in tourism and the suspension of foreign aid.
Diplomats have taken the opportunity in recent weeks to push Mr. Moi and his allies once again to take a stronger stand against official corruption, suggesting that a resumption of foreign aid and low-interest loans to Kenya might hinge on such actions.
"Kenya's between a rock and a hard place economically," one diplomat said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "They really need this money. That's the only leverage we have."
Some diplomats have also used their leverage to urge the Government to do more to stop ethnic clashes in the Rift Valley, which have taken at least 100 lives in the last three weeks. Coming after months of political tension and demonstrations, the violence has scared away investors and tourists, business leaders said.
Though the election on Dec. 29 was generally peaceful, since then Mr. Moi's supporters from his Kalenjin ethnic group have clashed repeatedly in the Rift Valley with Kikuyu people, who by and large supported their kinsman, Mwai Kibaki, the runner-up. The police and local authorities have been slow to respond to attacks on Kikuyu families, diplomats said.
The United States has been at the forefront in pressuring Mr. Moi to put an end to the violence. Last weekend, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for democracy, visited the region where the killing has been taking place, talked to victims and then met with President Moi on Monday.
In the meeting, Mr. Jackson said, he told Mr. Moi that regardless of how the violence began, the United States was expecting some "hands-on" leadership from Mr. Moi in bringing the clashes under control. He also urged opposition leaders, who have accused Mr. Moi of orchestrating the attacks, to "cool down provocative rhetoric." Mr. Jackson said that Kenya's economic recovery was being crippled by the violence, and he suggested that aid from the United States and American support for loans might be jeopardized.
"There is a debate about who started it," Mr. Jackson said. "There can be no debate about whose responsibility it is to end it. The Government must do it."
Mr. Jackson's visit came as Kenyan officials met with a delegation from the International Monetary Fund for the first time since the Washington-based lending institution suspended a $205 million low-interest loan to Kenya last July, citing rampant corruption among top officials.
Issues in the talks included several promises Kenya made last August to persuade the fund to restore the loans, including a commitment to crack down on official graft and improve efficiency among civil servants. The fund's decision on resuming aid is seen as critical to Kenya's economic future. It is usually a guidepost for other donor countries, who together provide about $500 million in aid annually.
A series of disasters have beset Kenya's economy in the last six months. Heavy rains and floods wiped out roads and bridges, twice cutting the main highway to the port of Mombasa in the last month. The rains have destroyed crops as well, crippling production of coffee, tea, corn, wheat, beans, rice and sugar. The drop-off has hurt exports and caused local prices to soar.
The deluges have also caused epidemics of malaria and cholera, overburdening a creaking health care system at a time when nurses were on strike. The floods also contributed to an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever, a rare illness that has killed at least 600 people and thousands of livestock in the last three months.
The political and ethnic turbulence before the December election also hurt this nation of game parks and beach resorts, where tourism is the largest earner of foreign exchange. Kenya's balance of payments was hit hard by a $280 million decline in tourism receipts because of ethnic clashes on the Indian Ocean coast in the second half of 1997.
Then in January, when more clashes over land and political allegiances erupted between Kikuyu and Kalenjin ethnic groups in the Rift Valley, tourists and foreign investors continued to keep their distance.
"Foreign investors are not very comfortable with the political situation right now," said Lincoln Ndwiga, a Nairobi stockbroker. "They are the big players. If they shy away, so do the local investors."
To make fiscal matters worse, strikes in December forced the Government to agree to labor settlements with teachers and other civil servants that provided for a tripling of salaries, which is likely to add millions in unexpected expenditures to the $3.1 billion annual budget.
"We definitely need an important infusion of foreign aid," the new Foreign Minister, Bonaya Adhi Godana, said. "Obviously we would be glad to have had it not only restored but increased."
These problems would have been tough for any government to handle, but there is ample evidence that Kenya's has not been particularly well managed in recent years, diplomats and foreign economists say. The country's infrastructure has visibly crumbled in the last five years, despite millions of dollars in loans from the World Bank for improving roads.
On average, the Government completes only about 3 percent of its capital projects each year, a fraction of the average for most countries. Even though the World Bank has approved nearly $600 million in loans for major projects, it has been able to disburse only about $30 million because the Government has been so slow to get projects off the ground, officials said.
In addition, Kenya's civil payroll is bloated with nearly 485,000 workers. The country is also paying horrendously high interest rates of more than 25 percent on its treasury bills and commercial debts. About a third of the budget goes for debt service, most of it to domestic banks.
The budget deficit is expected to balloon to around 4 percent of this year's domestic output. Few resources are left over for building roads, hospitals, schools.
"This is catastrophic," said one diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. "You can't develop a country with these kinds of numbers."

HEADLINE: Hartford Plans $135 Million Expansion for Bradley Airport

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Feb. 13

 BODY:
The number of its passengers has already risen 18 percent in the last four years, to 5.4 million last year, but Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks wants to keep growing.
With Gov. John G. Rowland's support, the airport is planning to spend $135 million to build a new, larger terminal and improve services to persuade more passengers who live well outside the Hartford area -- in Fairfield County and western Massachusetts -- to use Bradley instead of the New York airports or Logan International in Boston. 
 Bradley's growth has resulted largely from the improved economy, and the expansion will assure further growth, said Robert F. Juliano, chief of the bureau of aviation and ports for the State Department of Transportation.
"If we continue to improve facilities and provide better amenities, you will see an increase, especially in the fringe market," Mr. Juliano said. He said Bradley, which had 4.57 million passengers in 1993, hoped to draw 8.6 million by 2010.
The airport has two terminals now and officials plan to replace the older one with a new terminal to open in 2003.
The new one will have 30 gates and cover 600,000 square feet, compared with the current 24 gates over 400,000 square feet in the terminal to be replaced. The ticketing and baggage claim areas will be correspondingly larger.
All the gates in the new terminal will have covered boarding ramps to airplanes; seven gates in the old building do not have them, Mr. Juliano said.
Sixty percent of the expansion will be paid for by existing airport fees and 40 percent by a state bond issue. Governor Rowland has included the $135 million for the expansion in his budget for next year.
Mr. Juliano said Bradley had already started to draw more people from areas around Hartford, and hoped to expand on that success. Bradley has advertised itself in those areas, and Connecticut Limousine, a private bus service, is now offering service from New Haven and Bridgeport to Bradley, Mr. Juliano said.
Sara E. Unrue, a manager of New Haven Travel Service, said her local customers were using Bradley more frequently because of the convenience.
There is little traffic going into Bradley, the airport is small and the long-term parking is relatively inexpensive.
"Once you realize you don't have to go to New York, you don't want to go to New York," Ms. Unrue said.
Bradley's goals for expansion are somewhat similar to what has been accomplished at T. F. Green Airport in Warwick, R.I., outside Providence, where the number of airline passengers increased 64 percent last year, to just over four million.
The Providence airport opened a new terminal with 17 gates in September 1996, and a month later Southwest Airlines also started its first service to the Northeast.
Bradley's expansion is getting support from the business community in the Hartford area. Michael Meotti, president of the Connecticut Policy and Economic Council, said expanding Bradley airport was an important key to economic growth for the entire Hartford region.
At present, Bradley is offering nonstop flights to 32 cities including Dallas and Miami, but it is offering none to the West Coast, although United will start nonstop service to San Francisco in June, Mr. Juliano said.
"If you could combine ease of travel to the airport with more nonstop service, then you get a really good combination," he said. "Bradley has the potential of being more than a generator of magazine sales and coffee sales in the terminal."

Hispanic Baby Boom

 BODY:
The number of babies born to Hispanic women in the United States has reached a record high.
The National Center for Health Statistics revealed that 18 percent of the total number of births were to Hispanic mothers. In 1995, the latest year for which complete data are available, 679,768 Hispanic babies were born, which is up from 532,249 Hispanic-origin births in 1989, when 14 percent of all babies born in this country had Hispanic mothers. Hispanic residents make up 10.3 percent of the country's population. 
 Much of the increase is the result of high fertility rates among Mexican-Americans, particularly recent immigrants. The study also estimated that this group of women would average 3.32 births over their lifetimes, compared with 1.7 births for Cuban-American women and 2.2 births for Puerto Rican women, rates that are comparable to those of black and non-Hispanic white women.
The findings suggest that, as a result of immigration and a high birth rate, people of Mexican heritage are in a position to become a major force in the coming decades in economics, politics and culture.

HEADLINE: Our Consumer Culture Gets What It Deserves

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Stanley Lebergott (Op-Ed, Feb 10) belittles Hillary Rodham Clinton's concern that the content of television advertising may be undermining the ethics of delayed gratification and mutual respect that sustains capitalism and democracy. Rather than address the sociological claims, Mr. Lebergott flies to the doctrine of consumer sovereignty: "Who creates this 'consumer-driven culture' but 270 million Americans?" The consumer gets what she wants. But does she? 
 We often indulge our short-term interests at the expense of our true, long-term interests. Aware of our weakness, we alter our environment to compensate. Indeed, private property is itself such an alteration. But what kind of environment does modern advertising create? "Just do it!"
Time and again, polls show that Americans believe their culture too myopic, too materialistic and too eroticized.
May not a free society regulate itself to promote the virtues it admires?

HEADLINE: Our Consumer Culture Gets What It Deserves;
Luxuries vs. Needs

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Stanley Lebergott's Feb. 10 Op-Ed article is marred by a flawed assumption all too common among even professional economists: that resources directed away from luxuries to meet more pressing social needs are removed from the economy entirely instead of continuing to circulate through it. 
 True, our "consumer-driven culture" creates the employment and income enjoyed by many Americans. But a less consumer-driven culture might continue to spur prosperity while turning its energies to greater concerns than Polartec jackets.
If Americans bought, say, one fewer bottle of Evian per person, we could generate half a billion dollars to build homes for the homeless.
Evian employees would suffer, but construction workers would prosper. The plan, of course, relies on the voluntary generosity of millions of individuals, but this is the kind of cultural change we might envision if professional economists stopped arguing it out of the realm of the possible.

Here's How The Chiefs Stock Up

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
WHILE keeping up with the Joneses is a middle-class tradition, catching up with the Gateses has become the game for chief executives, whose 1997 pay and company stock holdings will be disclosed in the weeks ahead as companies mail their annual reports.
Pearl Meyer & Partners, an executive compensation consulting firm in Manhattan, analyzed stock and stock options of chief executives at 200 of the largest publicly traded companies. The firm tossed out the top 10 and bottom 10 wealth holders and found that the remaining 180 chiefs had an average of $57.8 million in their company's equity on the last day of 1997. That includes shares owned outright or in tax-deferred accounts and options, both those that can be cashed in and those not yet vested. 
 (The chief executive at the bottom of the list, Robert E. Stauth of the Fleming Companies, a grocery distributor, held just $322,560 of equity.)
For some perspective, in 1995, the latest year for which estimates are available, the median net worth of American households, including the value of houses and cars, was $45,630, according to Edward N. Wolff, a New York University economist.
The richest 1 percent of Americans, a million households, have at least $7.9 million each, he estimated.
Another perspective: Executives No. 2 through No. 10 hold a total of $15 billion of their companies' equity. That is $4 billion more than the next 190 chiefs combined -- but just three-fourths as much as the gain in Bill Gates's fortune since the start of 1997. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 CORRECTION:
A listing last Sunday with an article about stocks and stock options held by the executives of large companies referred incorrectly to holdings in Coca-Cola. They were those of Roberto C. Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive who died in October, not of his successor, M. Douglas Ivester.

HEADLINE: Pastor's Church Trial Attests To Divisiveness of Gay Issue

BYLINE: By GUSTAV NIEBUHR 

DATELINE: OMAHA

 BODY:
Joining a man and a woman before God is standard duty for members of the clergy. But for performing a union of a different sort, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, a United Methodist minister here, will soon be tried in a church court.
At issue is Mr. Creech's officiation at a covenant ceremony last September uniting two women in his congregation, First United Methodist Church. The event resembled a Methodist wedding, with Scripture readings, an exchange of vows and a celebration of communion. 
 But it came a month after Mr. Creech's bishop told him not to do it and a year after Methodist leaders added a statement to the denomination's rule book forbidding ceremonies uniting people of the same sex.
Mr. Creech said in a recent interview that he could not, as their pastor, refuse the women's request and that he considered the church's opposition to unions of people of the same sex to be discriminatory. He could lose his ministerial credentials if convicted.
The trial, which is scheduled to begin on March 11 in a Kearney, Neb., church, will highlight a divisive pattern emerging within Protestantism, where the consensus against homosexuality has been eroding, as it has elsewhere in society.
Issues concerning homosexuality, especially the question of whether to ordain noncelibate gay men and lesbians as ministers, have touched off rancorous debates at church conventions, where opponents often cite biblical injunctions against homosexual acts. A few cases have ended up before ecclesiastical judges.
No major Protestant denomination has voted to allow the ordination of homosexuals as ministers, nor has any developed official rituals to bless same-sex unions. But the stands that denominational leaders have taken vary considerably.
In 1996, for example, the United Methodists firmly rejected a measure to allow homosexuals to be ordained.
Last year, the regional bodies of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) went a step further, amending the church constitution to bar anyone sexually active outside marriage from serving as a minister, elder or deacon.
By contrast, the United Church of Christ leaves the matter up to its regional associations, a few of which have ordained openly gay men and lesbians as ministers. In 1997, priests and lay leaders at the Episcopal Church's General Convention narrowly rejected a proposal to develop liturgies for blessing same-sex unions.
"This is the polarizing issue," said Michael McClellan, an Omaha lawyer and a member of the First United Methodist Church who will be Mr. Creech's co-counsel. A retired Methodist bishop will serve as judge and other ministers as a jury.
The number of same-sex unions quietly blessed by clergy members is not known. The privacy surrounding such ceremonies has helped insure that no minister has ever been tried for performing one in the 8.5 million-member United Methodist Church, the nation's largest mainline Protestant denomination.
"This is going to be a test case," said Mr. Creech, 53, who has been suspended with pay. "This didn't start as a strategy. It began as a couple coming to me." Mr. Creech is married with a stepdaughter and has an adult son by a previous marriage.
James V. Heidinger 2d, president of Good News, an evangelical movement among Methodists, said the trial would "be a shot heard round the church." The ceremony, he said, was "a clear violation of biblical principles, as well as the tradition of the church."
Mr. Creech described his position on homosexuality and the church as a Divine calling. "I really believe this is God's history and I'm part of what God is doing," he said. "I've been invited into it and given a responsibility."
Bans on ordaining homosexuals as ministers and blessing same-sex unions, he said, reflect "a cultural prejudice that has been institutionalized in the church." In 1997, he signed a statement, titled "In All Things Charity," that called for support for ordaining gay men and lesbians and for developing ceremonies for "same-gendered couples." The statement has been signed by more than 1,300 Methodist ministers, or about 3 percent of the denomination's 37,000 ordained ministers.
The Rev. Jeanne Knepper, a spokeswoman for Affirmation: United Methodists for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgendered Concerns, said a few signers had performed same-sex unions. "I could give you -- but I won't give you -- the names of 20 United Methodist pastors who have done these ceremonies," she said. Mr. Creech, she added, "is not anywhere near alone: he's the lightning rod."
Mr. Creech is charged with violating Methodism's "The Book of Discipline," its laws and administrative rules. In 1996, the denomination's policy-making body, the General Conference, added a sentence to the book's "social principles" section: "Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions shall not be conducted by our ministers and shall not be conducted in our churches."
That section also contains an earlier statement describing homosexuals as people of "sacred worth," but calling homosexual acts "incompatible with Christian teaching." Mr. Creech's trial will turn on whether the 1996 statement against same-sex unions is legally binding, rather than merely advisory, as Mr. Creech and his supporters contend.
The controversy has shaken members at Mr. Creech's church, a 200,000 square-foot complex atop a small hill. Financial pledges are down, as is Sunday School attendance. Some of Mr. Creech's critics have quit attending, while some supporters have picketed the offices of the Nebraska Bishop, Joel N. Martinez. Church staff members say many in the 1,900-member congregation feel caught in the middle.
Founded in 1855, the First United Methodist Church has undergone tumult before, although nothing like this. One early pastor carried a six-shooter in the pulpit. Another, considered a Southern sympathizer in the Civil War years, was run off by the congregation. In 1975, a tornado struck the church buildings.
At one time, said the Rev. Donald D. Bredthauer, the acting pastor, First United Methodist "was sort of seen as a high-steeple church," meaning socially exclusive. But he said that was no longer true for a congregation that prepared meals for people with AIDS, backed an organization that lobbies for civic improvements in poor neighborhoods, Omaha Together One Community, and supported Habitat for Humanity, which builds housing for the needy.
"We've not stopped doing our other ministries just to take care of this," Mr. Bredthauer said.
Bishop Martinez appointed Mr. Creech to the church in 1996. He had served congregations in North Carolina. But his critics said that they found out only later that Mr. Creech left his last pulpit in Raleigh, N.C., amid a bitter dispute over his support for local gay rights initiatives.
A chapter in a book, "Congregations in Conflict: The Battle Over Homosexuality" (Rutgers, 1996), by Keith Hartman, describes that experience, saying that the congregation divided mainly along generational lines, with older members largely opposing Mr. Creech.
Mr. Creech later went to work as a lobbyist for the North Carolina Council of Churches, where he became known as an opponent of the death penalty.
The rift at the First United Methodist Church began in January 1997, after Mr. Creech preached that "to be gay was in itself healthy, normal and natural." The sermon, he said, "got a pretty strong reaction."
Bob Howard, a retired insurance company executive, said he had complained to Mr. Creech that it was "the fourth sermon we had heard on the subject."
Mr. Howard said the minister "listened very well, but the word was, 'I'm going to continue down that path.' " Mr. Howard canceled his financial pledge in protest and later stopped attending.
Melvin J. Semrad, a gas and electric company executive, said he urged Mr. Creech "to slow this train down," to give skeptics a chance to adjust. And last April, Mr. Semrad said, he warned Mr. Creech that his preaching was "going to drive a wedge" into the congregation.
"We believe we are an open church," Mr. Semrad said, "but we also believe in the 'Discipline.' " The Methodist rule book, he added, "is not for someone to pick and choose."
But Deb Keeney, an administrative assistant in a local school, said that Mr. Creech was "helping us fulfill our vision" at the church.
Before he arrived, the church had drawn up a statement of purpose, called "Vision Focus," which said, in part, that members would "welcome and celebrate the diversity of God's children," including "all economic levels, races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, marital states, abilities and age levels."
Mr. Creech, Ms. Keeney said, "came to the church knowing this was the vision we had, and had no inkling there were people who did not agree with that."
But not everyone in the church had attached such weight to the statement. Frank Rathbun, a church member who is a retired natural gas company executive, said the way the statement was interpreted under Mr. Creech "turned out to be much broader than when people agreed to it."
All this might have remained within church walls had not the two women asked Mr. Creech to perform a covenant ceremony for them. He agreed last July and wrote to Bishop Martinez, who, he said, instructed him not to conduct it.
Mr. Creech said he replied to the bishop "that I felt that it was my responsibility as a pastor to do it," and that the "Book of Discipline" statement was "unjust and discriminatory." (He has not identified the women, nor have they spoken out.)
After the ceremony, more than 400 First United Methodist members wrote Bishop Martinez, saying the event challenges "the principles of our Christian faith." A Methodist minister in western Nebraska filed a formal complaint. In November, the bishop suspended Mr. Creech.
Two months later, a church investigative committee ordered a trial. Bishop Martinez issued a statement promising to expedite the process. He did not return calls seeking comment on the case. But Mr. Creech released his own statement, saying, in part, "I believe that the sin of heterosexism is no less a sin than that of racism."
His supporters have organized a group called "Support the Vision." At a recent meeting, one woman described Mr. Creech as "a beautiful man of Christ" who "was sent here for a purpose, for all of us to be tested."
But Virginia Semrad, Melvin Semrad's wife, likened Mr. Creech's relationship with the church to a marriage gone sour. "He was not known, we did not court each other long enough," she said. "I feel Jimmy Creech cannot, should not, return to his pulpit."
Although Mr. Bredthauer occupies the pastor's office, it remains largely as Mr. Creech left it. The wall behind the desk displays portraits of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Mohandas K. Gandhi and Archbishop Oscar Romero of San Salvador, all victims of assassins. There is also a picture of Rosa Parks, the African-American woman who in 1955 refused to yield her seat to a white man on a segregated bus in Montgomery, Ala..
Mr. Creech, who grew up in Goldsboro, N.C., said he had been "very much affected" by the Civil Rights movement, although he had not taken part in it. "It was people willing in that moment to be faithful, to take a stand, to do the right thing, that ultimately brought about change in the South," he said.
He acknowledged that within a congregation, such boldness could be disruptive. But the sacrifice, he said, amounted simply to the loss "of artificial unity and peace."
"In order for there to be any kind of growth," he said, "there must be conflict."

HEADLINE: A Great Escape, A Dwindling Legacy

BYLINE: By ISABEL WILKERSON; ISABEL WILKERSON, a national correspondent for The Times, is writing a book about the aftermath of the Great Migration.

 BODY:
STANDING at ground zero of the Great Migration of blacks from the South to the promised city of Chicago, along the ribbon of barely recognizable land just below the Loop, you must suspend what the physical eye sees and imagine things as they were, not as they are. You must picture yourself in 1942 walking through a river of people in hats of butterfly wings and freshly pressed suits promenading down a haughty boulevard known then as South Parkway and now called, since the world has changed, Martin Luther King Drive.
You must see a preening hotel where there is now a boarded-up building. You must see the Metropolitan Theater where there is now a rubble-strewn lot. You must imagine the new arrivals -- sharecroppers from Egypt, Miss., and Natchez and Belzoni, and domestics and janitors from Jackson and Little Rock -- gazing star-struck at the blues-daddy juke joints and segregated hotels, scanning the crowd for faces from back home, buzzing about the big money they would make at the steel mills and packing houses and rivet factories for the war, and everyone wanting to know if Cab Calloway would be at the Regal tonight. 
 Restoration efforts have only recently begun. But there are some important things to see even now. The original home of The Chicago Defender, once the most powerful newspaper in black America, which Pullman porters secretly disseminated during their stops in the South and which blacks passed among themselves as they gathered the courage to leave. The original Chess Records studios where Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley set their Southern blues to vinyl and laid the tracks for rock-and-roll. The Supreme Life Insurance building, now being restored, which housed the first black insurance company in the North. The places where Nat King Cole played and Joe Louis lived, and the stomping grounds of famous residents like Louis Armstrong, Richard Wright, Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry, Mahalia Jackson and Ida B. Wells.
But you cannot expect to see what thousands of Southerners saw when they first stepped off the Illinois Central steam-engine trains at the 12th Street Station, their cardboard luggage tied with string. The station is long gone, sacrificed to the city's hunger to remake itself and dispense with the past. But the remaining landmarks can serve as guides to what once was, as markers to trace the social and cultural world that grew out of one spoke of the largest migration in the country's history.
The migration, from World War I to the 1960's, redistributed six million Southern blacks who fled to nearly every major American city in the North and West. They were fleeing the racial caste system that consigned them to the lowest rung and the racial violence that came with it. The waves of people crested at wartime when factory jobs were plentiful and paid what seemed like unbelievable money to people accustomed to picking 100 pounds of cotton for a dollar. To big manufacturers, it was cheap, hungry labor. "Chicago was built on the backs of black migrant workers," said Harold Lucas, president of the Black Metropolis Convention and Tourism Council. "They worked the stockyards and the factories and the steel mills. Their hard work helped the country make it to the technology age."
The first migrants settled in what would become the northern tip of their new neighborhood, about two miles south of the Loop, in a tight sliver of land extending several blocks on either side of what is now King Drive. With the east and west boundaries fixed by segregation, the neighborhood spread south as the population swelled, past 31st Street, past 35th Street, past 43d Street.
By the mid-1940's, according to "Black Metropolis," the landmark 1945 study of black Chicago by St. Clair Drake and Horace Cayton, it was said, "If you're trying to find a certain Negro in Chicago, stand on the corner of 47th and South Park long enough and you're bound to see him."
"It was so beautiful," said Gerri Oliver, who migrated from Jackson in the 1940's and owns Gerri's Palm Tavern, 446 East 47th Street. Once a tony supper club frequented by the Duke Ellington crowd, it's now a struggling set piece used by the occasional Hollywood film crew and the neighborhood regulars, who must wait to be buzzed in before they can get the whisky sours and herbal tea and wisdom she serves up. "Everybody was sharp," she said. "You didn't meet a stranger."
The neighborhood came to be known as Bronzeville after the Chicago Bee, a black newspaper of the time, held a contest in 1930 to elect a "mayor of Bronzeville." It took on greater significance than most publicity stunts, coming when blacks could not dream of becoming mayor of the whole city.
Sadly, they found the North could be as hostile as the South. Many trade unions did not accept blacks. Most beaches were off-limits. And housing laws confined them to Bronzeville, where demand was so high that small apartments were divided into one-room units spilling over with children and newly arriving relatives. The overcrowding bred many of the ills that still plague the inner cities: gangs, drugs, crime.
Because the migration unfolded with little mainstream documentation and was taken for granted even by many participants, the idea of preserving its history has only recently caught on in Chicago. After housing restrictions were eased, the neighborhood went into steep decline, losing population and many landmarks from its heyday. The site of the Regal Theater and the Savoy Ballroom is now a parking lot. The headquarters of Fuller Products, once the Avon of black America, and countless other buildings are long gone, leaving vast stretches of wasteland. The packing houses and steel mills either have been razed or are rusting and abandoned, like the shifting economy that has now left the children of the migration out of the economic loop.
The loss makes for oddly sad moments on tours of Chicago. The old Grand Terrace Cafe, 315 East 35th Street, was the site of spectacular floor shows with mulatto dancers in ostrich feathers and the Earl (Fatha) Hines orchestra regaling a mostly white audience. It is now a hardware store. But a group from Germany wanted souvenirs. "Give me something I can take back to Europe," Mr. Lucas, who was leading a Black Metropolis tour, remembers them saying. So they bought plungers, he said, which reminded them of the cones trumpeters used to make wa-wa sounds.
Buildings still disappear. Barbara Morris, who runs Black Coutours, liked to include the Metropolitan Theater, once known for live shows. It was one of the few theaters left from the war years -- until a month ago. "I did a tour one day," Ms. Morris said. "The next day I went back with another group, and it was in shambles. I said, 'I know it's over here.' But it was gone."
Bronzeville is now getting long-overdue attention. In the last decade, grass-roots organizers have begun to track important buildings scheduled for demolition, trying to save them. The city has begun to revitalize the area with better signage and street improvements. The children of the migrants have begun restoring the turreted mansions along King Boulevard, while developers are filling the spaces with pink-brick townhouse colonies with names like Bronzeville Pointe. And tour organizers have stepped in with guided excursions -- most of themarranged for groups -- to help visitors who may feel uneasy negotiating the area's desolate stretches on their own.
The single most visible landmark is also the newest. Near the northern tip of Bronzeville, at 26th Place and King Drive, stands a 15-foot statue by Allison Sarr. The monument, erected in 1996, depicts a southern man carrying a suitcase held together with string. He is in midstep, facing north with a look of uncertain optimism. He wears a suit of shoe soles cast in bronze in honor of the migrants who put one foot in front of the other to get to the Promised Land. The statue is ringed by pink concrete trunks and is the neighborhood's symbolic entrance.
The Great Migration had no single Moses directing what essentially were the private decisions of a multitude. But perhaps the most influential figure at the start was a Georgia-born lawyer named Robert S. Abbott, who came to Chicago in 1897 after finding it impossible to practice law as a black man back home. With the zeal of an abolitionist, he set out to empty the South of as many blacks as he could through the pages of The Defender, the weekly newspaper he founded in 1905. He filled his paper with anti-South diatribes, fearless coverage of lynchings ignored by the mainstream press and glowing depictions of life up north. The paper attracted some of the best black writers of the era; Langston Hughes was a columnist for years. The Defender is now a daily of more modest reach, its circulation down to 25,000 from 200,000 in the war years. Its current location is 2400 South Michigan Avenue, but it is not open for tours. The old Defender building stands at 3435 South Indiana Avenue, and there is talk of restoration.
In South Side blues joints in the 1940's, the height of the exodus, migrants like Muddy Waters churned out gut-bucket blues from Mississippi, down-home folk music that grew worldlier in the big city. A row of recording studios, perhaps the most famous of which was Chess Records, sprang up along Michigan Avenue to capture the music and send it across the world.
The former nightclub owners Phil and Leonard Chess sent their right-hand man, Willie Dixon, a blues bassist from Mississippi who wrote most of the label's hits, to scout talent in the streets of Bronzeville. Bo Diddley was one of the blues men Dixon found. During the glory days of the 1950's and 1960's, he and Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Etta James and many others passed through the studio, belting out the blues with nightclub realism in an echo chamber in the basement. Eventually young musicians like Mick Jagger and Eric Clapton heard the music and drew inspiration. The Rolling Stones, who took their name from a Muddy Waters song, made their first American recording at Chess in 1964.
"The blues is the roots, and everything else is the fruits," Mr. Dixon used to say. One of his many songs was Led Zeppelin's hit "Whole Lotta Love," first recorded by Muddy Waters and acknowledged publicly as Mr. Dixon's work only in the last few years since settlement of a copyright-infringement suit by him.
But despite their contributions, the musicians who came north found the studio, like Chicago itself, only a marginal improvement over the South's segregation. Black musicians were not permitted through the front door. They had to climb a back stairway to the second-floor studio, their guitars and basses in tow. They had to fight for royalties, often losing to the music industry.
A royalty dispute at Chess took a bitter turn in the 1960's when Chuck Berry tried to leave the label and, with little money left, ended up living in the cavelike echo chamber in the Chess basement, according to Shirli Dixon Nelson, Mr. Dixon's daughter, who manages the site. "These people are alive," she said. "They need to be celebrated. When will these people be acknowledged for their contributions?"
To that end, the building is now a museum dedicated to blues history and education, run by Mr. Dixon's family through a foundation under his name. Renamed Willie Dixon's Blues Heaven, it opened last September. Eric Clapton and Keith Richards are on the board of directors; Mick Jagger is a donor. The museum has been renovated as a gallery-in-progress of blues artifacts, where visitors can see the chess pieces built into the first-floor walls and the basement where Chuck Berry is said to have holed up.
In the 1930's and 40's, the Supreme Life Building was at the center of Bronzeville commerce, its imposing entrance facing 35th and South Park. Besides the insurance firm, it housed some smaller businesses. It is here that John H. Johnson, who founded Ebony and Jet magazines, had his first office. Louis Armstrong, who migrated from Louisiana, lived for a time in a row house a few yards down. Ida B. Wells, the writer and crusader against lynching, lived in a grand graystone across the street at 3624 South King Drive. The Supreme Life building, at 3501 South King Drive, is now under restoration, and neighborhood preservationists hope that it will become a tourism anchor.
The packing houses and steel mills that fueled the migration are mostly dilapidated hulks now -- those that remain. At one time, the Union Stockyards, about two miles west of Bronzeville, spread over 475 acres. The site, from Halsted to Racine and roughly from 39th to 47th Streets, is now an industrial park with warehouses and city government buildings scattered among vacant fields. Building signs advertise hundreds of thousands of square feet for lease. The only thing left of the stockyards and the people who toiled for the Great Hog Butcher is a yellow stone archway, turreted and castlelike, with a steer's head on top facing east to the country it fed.
Other points of historic interest include the old headquarters of the Chicago Urban League, 4500 South Michigan Avenue (also known as the Swift Mansion), where migrants went to find employment and housing; the Wabash Avenue Y.M.C.A., 3763 South Wabash Avenue, where many migrants first stayed upon arrival and which is awaiting restoration; and the Eighth Regiment Armory, 3533 South Giles Avenue, the original home of the black regiment that fought in World War I. The Chicago Bee Building is at 3647-55 South State Street; a public library occupies the building where the now-defunct newspaper once operated. A few steps north is the Overton Hygienic Building, 3619 South State Street, which was alive with black law firms and photo studios and other businesses restricted to Bronzeville. It was the headquarters of a cosmetics company founded by the owner of the Chicago Bee and is being restored as an office building. Of all these, only the Bee Building is open to the public. But the rest are worth seeing for perspective on the setting and boundaries of Bronzeville.
The Ellis Island of the migration is gone. It was 12th Street Station, the terminus of the Illinois Central, whose locomotives brought a southern peasant class to freedom in a New World. Perhaps it is not coincidence that one of the railroad's first attorneys was Abraham Lincoln.
The station site is now pavement and grassland adjacent to the old tracks out by Indiana Avenue. Twelfth Street is now Roosevelt Road. The area fanning out from this fabled ground is where Mayor Richard M. Daley now lives, a fortress of tony brick row houses with concrete lions and wrought-iron gates, bearing boutique names like Central Station and Prairie Place, their pitched roofs sprouting with optimism -- like the people who trod the same soil half a century ago.
 
Turning pages of Bronzeville's past
 The Chicago Office of Tourism offers a half-day bus tour of Bronzeville, including a stop at Blues Heaven and the DuSable Museum of African American History, which is not in the Bronzeville district but like nearly everything else in black Chicago has roots in the Great Migration.

HEADLINE: The World;
Remember Yellow Journalism.

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS 

 BODY:
WITH reports about suspected oral sex in the White House and possible Presidential semen stains on an intern's dress, even the most respectable newspapers and TV news programs seem ribald and over the top these days. But such reports are tame, really, compared with the excesses of the coverage 100 years ago that incited the Spanish-American War.
Many an American history student will recall the telegraphed exchange between William Randolph Hearst, publisher of The New York Journal, and Frederic Remington, the great illustrator of the American frontier dispatched by Hearst to Cuba to cover the Cuban guerrilla uprising against Spain. 
 "There will be no war," Mr. Remington wired home. "I wish to return."
Hearst, bent on beating Joseph Pulitzer's New York World at the newsstands, told the artist to do no such thing: "You furnish the pictures and I will furnish the war."
And furnish the war Hearst did, with screaming headlines and frequently inaccurate articles that fanned the American conflict with Spain. Then, like today, journalistic competition was intense, and often the rush to print led to the publication of unconfirmed reports. It also led to the publication of wholly fabricated reports -- something that even the most tenacious media critics today rarely allege of mainstream media.
(For the record, The New York Times, acquired in 1896 by Adolph S. Ochs, delivered sober reporting of the rebellion in Cuba.)
Many of the reporters who covered the Cuban uprising had front-page ink on their minds, not ethics. To insure access to guerrilla camps, they brought medicine and kegs of rum to the rebels fighting the Spanish colonial occupiers of the island. Hearst even sent a ceremonial sword with a diamond-studded ivory handle as a gift to General Maximo Gomez, commander of the Cuban rebel forces. An intrepid cub reporter, Ralph D. Paine, volunteered to present the sword to the rebel leader to get his first big scoop.
 
Creative Writing
Though it did not have a correspondent on the ground as the Cuban rebellion heated up in 1895, the Hearst paper shamelessly attached Havana datelines to bylined stories creatively manufactured by rewrite men back in New York who interviewed exiled Cuban supporters of the revolt.
Once Journal reporters arrived on the scene, they hardly remained detached. One, Karl Decker, tried to bribe Spanish guards to free a 17-year-old Cuban girl named Evangelina Cossio y Cisneros, who was accused of inciting rebellion. When that failed, Mr. Decker enlisted an American shipping agent and a Cuban dentist to help him climb a ladder and jimmy her jail cell's iron bars. She escaped to the United States, and Mr. Decker had a sensational scoop.
The Journal demonized as "the most sinister figure of the 19th Century" Gen. Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau, sent by Spain in 1896 to put down the revolt. General Weyler ordered huts and fields burned and peasants packed into squalid camps.
Actually, the rebels burned and pillaged too, but General Weyler drew the particular scorn of correspondents for refusing to give them access to the battlefield. When a few American reporters were briefly held by the Spanish authorities, the Hearst paper thundered that Americans had become the targets of Spanish oppression.
So as this pre-war press hysteria of long ago illustrates, bad journalism is really nothing new or unusual. Years later, American newspapers splashed across their front pages false reports of German troops cutting off the breasts of Belgian nuns, helping to dispel American public unease about entering World War I.
Today, bad journalism is often called "tabloid journalism," but at the turn of the century it was "yellow journalism," a phrase inspired by the "Yellow Kid," urchin star of color cartoons by the coveted R.F. Outcault (he worked for both Pulitzer and Hearst) and vivid symbol of the intense newspaper competition of the day. Yellow journalism reached its peak, or nadir, exactly 100 years ago today with the sensationalistic reporting of the sinking of the American battleship Maine in Havana harbor on Feb. 15, 1898.
That and all the other egregious reporting leading up to the Spanish-American War might have been considered merely cartoonish if it hadn't led to a major international conflict.
"Had these publishing titans not decided to slug it out toe to toe," wrote Allan Keller, a historian of the Spanish-American War, about Hearst and Pulitzer, "the efforts of the downtrodden Cubans to throw off the yoke of Spanish oppression might never have burgeoned into a war between Spain and the United States."
Even Richard Harding Davis, the most respected foreign correspondent of his day, could not escape the press frenzy. Unwilling to get caught up in the hype, he left Cuba on the mail steamer Olivette without asking permission from his editors at The Journal. While steaming home, he met a young Cuban woman named Clemencia Arango, who was expelled by General Weyler as a suspected guerrilla collaborator.
 
The Naked Untruth
She told Mr. Davis that she had been repeatedly disrobed on the orders of Spanish detectives searching for secret messages to Cuban exiles in Tampa. Mr. Davis wrote about the woman's ordeal, but buried it in a longer piece. When his editors got down to the undressing part they saw red meat, and had Mr. Remington draw an illustration of a young woman, her naked rear end showing, forced to strip before Spanish agents. The Journal's headline read: "Does Our Flag Shield Women?"
Reporters following up on the story later learned that the Spanish agents had used matrons to do the undressing, and, as proper gentlemen, they never viewed the woman's naked body themselves. No matter; she became a cause celebre for the war hawks.
Still, President William McKinley was cautious, and most leading American business figures were worried that war could hurt the economy. Such concerns became moot with the sinking of the Maine.
What actually caused the Maine to explode -- a Spanish mine or an accident in the ship's forward ammunition magazine -- is still a mystery. A Congressional investigation at the time was inconclusive, but that didn't stop the yellow reporting. The first story in Pulitzer's New York World carried a banner headline that left little doubt about who was responsible: "Maine Explosion Caused by Bomb or Torpedo?" The Journal published a diagram of what it called a secret "infernal machine" that struck the ship like a deadly torpedo -- apparently the figment of some journalist's imagination.
In a few weeks, the United States was at war with Spain, and took Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines with ease, becoming in the process an imperial power at the dawn of a new century. Theodore Roosevelt, whose exploits as leader of the Rough Riders would take him to the White House, would eventually call the conflict "a splendid little war begun with the highest motives."
True or not, that would have made a good headline.

 CORRECTION:
An article on Feb. 15 about 19th-century yellow journalism misattributed a famous description of the Spanish-American War as "a splendid little war begun with the highest motives." It was written in an 1898 letter from John Hay, Ambassador to England and later Secretary of State, to Col. Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt did not coin the phrase.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
Five Hotels This Side of the Ritz

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
"I HAD sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver, -- So . . . said I to myself, . . . wherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night . . . be sure to inquire the price, and don't be too particular."
The words are those of Ishmael in Herman Melville's "Moby Dick." Call him a budget traveler. 
 Not so long ago, he'd have needed a sea chest of silver had he been looking for accommodations in New York, where the average room rate topped $200 for the first time last September. Prices have been creeping up at old budget chestnuts, too, with doubles for $120 at the Hotel Edison near Times Square, $125 at the Washington Square Hotel and $160 at the Chelsea -- where today, destitute punk rockers like Sid Vicious and Nancy Spungen could never afford to stay.
To contend with high rates, some travelers hunt for midwinter and weekend specials at moderately priced hotels, or they contact discounters like Quickbook, which offered me a $125 room at the Ameritania on Broadway for $99 in late December. Others gravitate to one of the city's three Y.M.C.A. hotels, where rooms start at $43, or check in at the 480-bed hostel on upper Amsterdam Avenue, where 85 percent of the guests are young foreigners and bunks in clean, Spartan dorms start at $22.
But because tourism in New York City is booming, new hotels are springing up everywhere, with plans for about 30 more by the year 2000. Most are in the luxury and moderate categories, but some are modeled on the cheap hotels of European capitals, where the concept of budget travel has long been understood.
In Paris or Rome, such places may be old and shabby, or modern and characterless with constricted cookie-cutter rooms. You'd be wasting your breath to ask for amenities like room service, free toiletries, health clubs and porters. But the rates rarely top $100 a night, and you don't have to sleep in your clothes, standing up.
In late December, I stayed in five of Manhattan's newer economy-class hotels, and toured many more. I sought places with rates for doubles starting near $100, which is why I had to cross off my list a few attractive but slightly higher-priced properties like the Mayfair, near Times Square, and the Best Western Seaport Inn in lower Manhattan. And while I'd have stayed at the tidy pension-style Larchmont Hotel in Greenwich Village in a flash, its 56 rooms have shared baths and toilets. So it seemed unfair to compare it to my other choices, which all offered private baths.
I wasn't expecting all the comforts of my Manhattan apartment -- just a clean, safe, affordable place to spend the night. Which is why the 102-room Gershwin Hotel, which opened in 1993 on East 27th Street, a block north of Madison Square Park, seemed like such a plum.
The digs are basic. But someone there has a sense of style, eking authentic minimalistic fun out of budget trappings, with huge fluted sconces framing the front door, little Andy Warhols and Roy Lichtensteins in the lobby, a floor of dorms for models, and a back room used for screenings, fashion shoots, private parties and auditions.
I arrived three hours before check-in and could have killed time by reading for a role in a movie called "Body Parts," discussing sightseeing options with the gamin at the concierge desk, having coffee in the downstairs cafe, or getting quietly soused in the pocket bar off the lobby with a young hipster from Australia. But the harried front-desk clerk found me something right away and sent me up in the elevator to a moderate-size, irregularly shaped $80 room at the front on the fifth floor. Honking horns blared from a bay window, shrouded in Hitchcockesque Venetian blinds.
The room had a freshly renovated air and a retro color scheme -- greenish carpeting, yellow walls and olive molding. The bathroom was clean but a tight squeeze, with a tiled shower, sink, toilet, soap, two plastic cups wrapped in cellophane and big green towels unaccompanied by washcloths. I didn't bother to call for washcloths because in my experience, their absence is the hallmark of a true budget hotel.
The room seemed reasonably secure, but was sparsely furnished with a double bed covered by a faded paisley spread, two plastic chairs and a cafe table, a TV affixed high on the wall hospital style, and a bedside table with a Princess phone. I tried to make a call, but couldn't get an outside line, and then rang the front desk for instructions. After that, the phone stopped working altogether. Though I was promised a replacement, it never came.
The R train stops two blocks west of the Gershwin, and there are buses on Fifth and Madison Avenues. But I was happy to stay put, because the once-dreary neighborhood around the hotel now has trendy restaurants like Asia de Cuba, the Globe and Joanie's. You can shop for bargains a few blocks downtown at Daffy's and Filene's, visit the flea market down the Avenue of the Americas on the weekend, or head up Madison to check out Robert Redford's class picture at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, between 30th and 31st Streets.

 THERE'S nothing chic about the 100-room Quality Hotel Eastside, in a brick building at Lexington Avenue and 30th Street, at the foot of Murray Hill. But I found a modicum of middle-American-style comfort, a surprising number of amenities and ersatz Early American furnishings to boot.
The place is part of a plucky little chain called Apple Core Hotels, which has converted two other midtown buildings and plans to open a fourth hotel on West 46th Street in March. The rates for Apple Core hotels were listed as starting at $109 but I paid $99 for a small double at the Quality Eastside.
Buses head downtown on Lexington Avenue, and the 28th Street stop of the No. 6 train is a five-minute walk away. To the north, Grand Central Terminal is within striking distance and the Chrysler Building's silver pinnacle looms. Otherwise, the neighborhood is fairly undistinguished, except for a great Viennese pastry shop called Chez le Chef and an abundance of Indian restaurants with cheap lunch specials.
But the spiffy awning out front at the Quality Eastside bodes well, leading to a cafe (where the waitress doubles as the concierge). The lobby beyond has built-in bookcases, trompe l'oeil arbors painted on the ceiling, a big front desk, two elevators and a porter. In the basement, there's a tiny workout room and business center with computers, fax and copier. I never saw another guest, which made me feel slightly unnerved, but the nice receptionist knew exactly where to send me for chicken curry -- $5.95 at the Joy of India, just off Lexington Avenue on East 29th Street.
The most impressive features in my chamber on the fifth floor were the hair dryer and coffee maker in the tiny but spotlessly clean bath, the iron and ironing board in the roomy closet, and the remote-controlled TV with cable and a premium movie channel. The room had a queen bed with a blue spread and pencil post headboard, a duck decoy border and a calico-curtained window. Still, a general lack of warmth and slightly funky smell in the hall kept it from evoking the Ethan Allen catalogue.
Oddly, I felt more at home at the 144-room Portland Square Hotel in the thick of midtown, on West 47th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Seventh Avenue. That's because it is a true bare-bones budget spot, like so many of the places where I've stayed in Europe.
Don't let the Portland's handsomely renovated red brick facade and Greek Revival porte-cochere fool you. Inside, the lobby is Pepto-Bismol pink, decorated with security monitors and lockers. There, clusters of young foreigners debate in French and Italian how to divide the bill. The front desk is behind glass, recalling a sleazy liquor store's checkout counter. And I wouldn't be inclined to book a shared-bath room in the west wing, where the toilets looked none too clean and someone had been smoking in the hall.
But I did well enough in a double ($80 for one, or $94 for two) at the back on the second floor of the east wing. The door had two locks and the chamber's quietude was tomblike. The attached bath was quite clean and bigger than a few rooms I've paid $80 to sleep in.
The forest green carpeting looked new, there was a safe beneath the built-in armoire and desk unit, which supported a television, and the curtains at the rear window overlooking the ugly backs of buildings on West 46th Street matched the spread on the double bed. There, I slept as deeply as if in a sensory deprivation tank -- which, come to think of it, is rather what the room looked like.
Of course, there's no lack of stimuli on West 47th Street, with Rockefeller Center to the east and the Theater District to the west. I did a bit of happy-hour dabbling at Cafe Un Deux Trois on West 44th Street and at Shaan, an Indian restaurant on West 48th Street, where drinks come with a plate of delectable fried vegetable and tandoori appetizers. Then, I met a friend who had free tickets to a movie.
You can get just about anywhere in the city from the nearby Times Square subway station. But to reach my next hotel, all I had to do was take a little stroll, stopping at the TKTS Booth in Duffy Square at 47th Street to buy a half-price seat ($36.25) for a preview of the Paul Simon musical, "The Capeman."
The 40-room Broadway Bed and Breakfast occupies several restored red-brick buildings on West 46th Street at Eighth Avenue, with a well-cared-for feeling and a 24-hour doorman. The burnished wood front desk and comfortable sitting room are reached from the ground-floor entrance by a set of steps, San Franciscan in its Victorian style and steepness. There, over a free morning paper and Continental breakfast, I saw couples in from the suburbs and nicely dressed Europeans studying city maps. It soon became clear that they had theater tickets, so I fit right in.
Several hours before check-in, I was given a $105 room with a full-size double bed. Rates for rooms with three-quarter-size double beds started at $95, but the only thing available when I made a reservation was a $135 room with a queen-size bed. I booked that, but asked to be remembered for a cancellation at a lower rate, never imagining I would be. But at the Broadway B & B, where the friendly staff refutes stereotypes of New York meanness, I got the downgrade I wanted.
After the Connecticut coziness of the lobby, I was surprised by the Broadway glitziness of my second-floor double, decorated in greens and golds, above the Acorn Liquor and Wine Store on noisy Eighth Avenue. Inside, there was everything a traveler could want -- a clean, if minuscule, bath with a shower and hair dryer, a TV, a bedside table, excellent lighting, a clothes rack, a director's chair and a little table. All this in a space not much larger than my bath at the Portland Square!
But I really shouldn't complain, because staying at the Broadway B & B turns the Theater District into a neighborhood. When the curtain falls, you can be back in your room in half a block, or sitting down to a late dinner on Restaurant Row, just across Eighth Avenue from the hotel. There, places like Joe Allen and Orso tend to be expensive. So I went to the Hourglass Tavern, where the tables were cramped and the service slapdash, but a two-course prix fixe (I had pork loin) cost only $12.75.
THE 103-room Cosmopolitan Hotel, at the Chambers Street stop of the Broadway express and local subway lines, isn't close to the theaters. But this rare downtown budget hotel at 95 West Broadway is in the heart of an area with its own seductions -- the art galleries of SoHo, Chinatown, South Street Seaport, Wall Street and the marvelous restaurants of TriBeCa.
The sign for the hotel, which opened in 1995, is tiny and rather hidden, on the east side of the street. There's no cafe, concierge or place to sit in the small, blond-wood-paneled lobby -- which didn't pose a problem during my stay, because I saw just a few other guests.
The single elevator moves like molasses, and my $89 double on the seventh floor looked as if it had just come off the assembly line -- with gray walls, red carpeting, a television, a ceiling fan and white motel-style furnishings. In the immaculate little bath, I got a pleasant shock -- washcloths, cleverly folded to resemble fans. And at night, without even moving from the comfortable double bed, I could see that lots of workers were burning the midnight oil in the World Trade Center.
In the afternoon, I took a run to the World Financial Center and Hudson River Park, cleaned up and had a half-glass of Pommery Brut Royal ($5.50) at the Bubble Lounge just up West Broadway. Then I checked prices at restaurants like the Screening Room, Montrachet, Nobu and the Odeon before settling in at a place I could afford, Bodega, for a chicken burrito dinner ($9).
The next morning, I bought a sinfully rich cheese Danish at the new Bouley Bakery, and talked with a young woman from Germany, who wanted to know how I could afford to live in Manhattan.
"It's tough, but worth it," I said, and then toddled home to my apartment.

KIDS' STUFF
 Toys and the Changing World
 of American Childhood.
 By Gary Cross.
 Illustrated. 283 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $29.95. 
 It is hard to imagine a less fun book about toys. There is nothing in Gary Cross's history of American toys about the psychology of the child's imagination or the cultural meaning of particular toys. There are not even telling descriptions of the low-taste items that clutter the aisles of Toys "R" Us.
Instead, with all the grave lamenting that marks American cultural history these days, Cross offers the following narrative: Since toys became an important item of manufacture in the 19th century, they have gradually been removed from the control of parents to a "fantasy world free of adults," controlled by a "mass consumption economy." The seeds were sown when "parents increasingly accepted play rather than work to teach the young values and skills. And manufactured toys increasingly were the tools of this learning." In the 20th century, as parents became less sure what world they wanted their children to grow up in, what skills they wanted them to imitate, what values they wanted to instill in them, toy makers have created an "ethos of fantasy consumerism" removed from "the experience and expectations of parents" and have sold it directly to children through television and advertising. Building blocks became Barbie's Boutique.
This history is one of many subsets of a broader academic narrative that goes something like this: The high Industrial Revolution began a process of mechanization, commercialism and standardization that has dissipated the values we once had. Family, neighborhood and church have morphed into the Consumer Society. We are adrift in a soulless world of things. And so on, and on. (My fellow academics are especially fond of this narrative because it confirms their sense of themselves as fallen aristocrats, whose refined tastes honor a vaguely feudal past in a world too commercial to appreciate their intelligence, their importance and their books.) Cross, a professor of history at Pennsylvania State University, begins "Kids' Stuff" bewildered and saddened in a contemporary toy store and concludes it adjuring parents to "give meaning to the things of play" -- that is, toys.
Who can doubt the truth of what has become a kind of monomyth? Who can doubt Cross's parochial version of it? The evidence has been all around us for some time. If you doubt Cross's descriptions of the amoral toy business, with its character licensing, program-length commercials and expandable lines of accessories, you can read G. Wayne Miller's "Toy Wars: The Epic Struggle Between G.I. Joe, Barbie, and the Companies That Make Them" (Times Books/Random House, $25). In trashy, fast-moving prose, Miller (a journalist from whom Professor Cross could learn something about narrative) gives a star-struck account of the Hasbro-Mattel conglomerate wars, in which executives with "steel blue eyes" restructure deals after "sumptuous" breakfasts in expensive hotels and make speeches in which "the pure joy of dreams" comes to life, not through toys but through having Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg of Dreamworks on either side of you. Or you can read Dan S. Acuff's "What Kids Buy and Why: The Psychology of Marketing to Kids" (Free Press, $28), a sort of Total Quality Management guide to creating, developing and marketing products to the "filiarchy," which I take to mean the Rule of Sons. Acuff, who has a doctorate in education and has been a consultant to Nike and Disney, deploys a Product Leverage Matrix to help companies in the kids business analyze products that will appeal to the "underlying abilities, motivations, needs and behaviors of the young target." Pages like flow charts follow. Miller and Acuff can tell you more about the decline and fall of joy than Cross learned from his sources.
The problem with narratives of lament is that they're too true to be good. To borrow a phrase from Wallace Stevens, the freshness of their insight has been fresh a long time. The evident truth of our culture of consumption is exceeded by its familiarity. Cross needs only to allude in shorthand to the monomyth that gives his story whatever resonance it has. Phrases like "products of the faceless world of machines and commerce," "a complex and rapidly changing world of popular culture," "traditional cultural" are added on to his historical data in discrete paragraphs and not pursued. Indeed, he treats his received ideas as if they were facts. "Kids' Stuff" is filled with interesting information on the history of toys and, to a lesser extent, on the economics of the toy industry, but it is conceptually either uncertain or trite.
Cross mentions, for example, a contradiction in parents' desires to prepare their children for the grown-up world with structured, imitative play and to protect them from that world by allowing the free run of their imaginations. But without a clearer sense of what a child's play is like, we cannot be sure that the contradiction is real. The "child's world of imagination or fantasy" is a phrase, like other phrases, to be assumed, not examined. Is this child's world invariable? What aspects of it might be useful in the adult world? What distinguishes imagination from fantasy? Why did "the young" want "superpower fantasy and excitement" in the 1970's and 80's? And how does he know that superhero fantasy "became more intense and pleasurable the more it was alienated from adult reality"? What aspects of "adult reality"?
Cross puts very little spin on, or passion into, his subject. For him, it seems, toys are merely another means of reinforcing the monomyth, illustrating only what other products and rituals can be made to illustrate: the decline of our way of life. What has happened to toys, he notes, has happened in many aspects of contemporary culture; the "toy problem is the consumer's problem."
In one of his better phrases, Cross says that "playthings are only props on a wider stage of wills and motives." He knows that bigger subjects are there: the changing view of childhood in America, the creation of a culture of children (and adolescents), the meaning of play, the ethos of business conglomerates. But discussing that wider stage requires more engagement with ideas, and more psychology, sociology, popular and material cultural theory than Cross seems to have at his disposal. Since children continue to love the toys they play with and don't seem to be psychologically maimed or imaginatively stunted as a result (Cross offers no evidence of this in any case), the opportunity was there for a complex and bracing story of American cultural development. That opportunity has been missed.

HEADLINE: An On-Line Lesson in Thin Mints and Lemon Pastry Cremes

BYLINE: By INGRID EISENSTADTER

 BODY:
It's time again for that annual celebration of grass-roots entrepreneurship, the Girl Scout cookie sale, when Scouts fan out across America, striking fear in the hearts of the Keebler elves and earning their cookies and dough badges.
But even this seemingly low-tech ritual is being changed by the Internet. Driven by the lure of the new technology badge, some Scout councils are selling cookies on line. 
 More than a third of the country's 319 Girl Scout councils have gone on line in the last two years. And two New England councils -- the Swift Water council in Manchester, N.H., and Patriots' Trail in Boston -- have been among the leaders in moving cookie sales onto the World Wide Web. Both have secure servers, allowing them to take credit card orders. The council in San Francisco is adding an encryption program, too.
In Boston, Prosoft, which provides information technology training, volunteered to teach Web design to the girls. Patrice Buckley, 15, a Scout for nine years, said, "Prosoft taught us Microsoft Front Page 98 and I was part of designing the site."
Amanda Michienzi, 17, a Girl Scout for 12 years, said, "We did the links, learned some HTML coding, and we put our own voices on the site with hyperlinks."
To buy cookies on the Web, one fills out an E-mail form that links to credit card processing services. Scouts working on Web sites track the orders, send E-mail acknowledgments and ship the cookies. A minimum order of three boxes plus shipping comes to about $13.
Each council takes guidance from national headquarters in New York but makes many business decisions itself. Although the New Hampshire Scouts accept orders only within their designated territory, Boston Scouts fill orders from anywhere in the country, as do San Francisco Scouts. Boston-area girls forward names of out-of-area cookie buyers to local councils for follow-up sales, but in San Francisco the Scouts have not made a decision on that.
Janine Carlson, communications director in San Francisco, said: "Territory is still a gray area. Hawaii went on line last year and got inquiries from all over the globe."
What does the future hold? Will thousands of freebooting Girl Scout troops hoist the Jolly Roger on the Internet high seas, pirating away one another's cookie sales? The organization's guidelines on cookie sales speak of "honor" when addressing Internet sales to insure that "competition is fair," and that "sales are made locally."
Even before the Internet, Scouts had begun promoting their cookies using the media, creating press releases or taking public service announcements to radio stations. "The cookie sales teach entrepreneurship," said Beverly Cheuvront, director of public relations for the Girl Scout Council of Greater New York, which does not have a Web site. "The girls set up a business plan and figure out how many cookies they need to sell to meet a specific goal, which may be renting a bus or going to summer camp."
This year, the San Francisco-area girls are trying to finance a trip to summer camp in England, and the Patriots' Trail Scouts are hoping to pay for a trip to Ireland. Nationally, income from cookie sales also goes toward scholarships for economically deprived girls, programs for the elderly, recycling efforts and the girls' educational and civic outings.
To be sure, the vast majority of the almost 200 million boxes of thin mints, trefoils and other cookies sold each year are sold door to door. The country's 2.6 million Girl Scouts ring up more than $500 million; in three months, they sell almost as many cookies as Nabisco sells all year of its Oreos, America's best-selling cookie brand.
In Boston, both Patrice and Amanda continue to sell door to door. "I've been selling cookies for 12 years," Amanda said. "I've known my customers since I was a Brownie."

HEADLINE: Publisher Finds Dream Role As Chief of Smaller Realm

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL

 BODY:
It is late afternoon, in the dim sunlight of a SoHo bistro, and Peter Mayer is savoring life in a single time zone and the remains of his steak frites.
When he presided over the global empire of Penguin Books, this was his hour of struggle, the moment when his body rebelled against the corporate life of the gypsy chief executive -- frenetic commutes between New York and London; offices with secretaries and back-up secretaries; the weighty travel bag of books and manuscripts that tilted his 6-foot frame. 
 "I was tired all the time, falling asleep in the afternoon, and very often during dinner, I would nod and wake up," Mr. Mayer recalled. "I didn't realize it was that stressful. I think that if anyone had told me then how much better it could be, I wouldn't have believed it."
Even so, many of his closest friends had nagging concerns when Mr. Mayer cheerfully announced plans to depart Penguin in early 1997, after 19 years leading the company, to "begin life again" at 61 in his dream role of independent publisher.
Mr. Mayer, a restless man with a deep, ebullient voice and a cumulus of graying hair, had often confided in friends that he longed to take personal charge of the Overlook Press, the eclectic publishing company he had started with his father in 1971, before leaving for Penguin. He believed that control of Overlook would allow him to pursue his passion for books into his 80's -- well past normal retirement age.
But it meant leaving the corporate cocoon of Penguin -- with revenues then of more than $650 million -- for a publishing house in SoHo with 11 employees and $3 million in sales. It meant shedding the chauffeur, the power and the perks and entering Overlook's airy fourth-floor offices through a service entrance on Broadway and occasionally answering the telephone when his staff was distracted.
"I was concerned," Martin Garbus, a lawyer who is one of Mr. Mayer's closest friends, said. "Could Peter, for Act 3 of his life, be as influential?"
To prepare for corporate decompression, Mr. Mayer devised his own form of boot camp to flex his independence.
Carrying basic necessities in a backpack, he set off to travel alone for six weeks in Southeast Asia, guided by a well-thumbed economy travel book from the Lonely Planet series, which offered tips on youth hostel living.
"This was no grand trip, but a voyage on $3 a day without advance bookings," said Mr. Mayer, who was mugged while riding on a motorcycle taxi in Vietnam. "No running water and bad beds wherever I showed up. I wanted to know if I could still do it -- to help me get ready for noncorporate life, in a way. It worked: using sign language and a phrase book will humiliate anyone."
Corporate life intruded during a side trip to Hanoi, when Mr. Mayer checked in with his old London office and learned from his young Harvard-trained successor, Michael Lynton, about the first hints of something that had gone terribly wrong during Mr. Mayer's tenure at Penguin. Later there would be public disclosures about an accounting scandal involving unauthorized discounts, which ultimately prompted Pearson P.L.C., which owns Penguin, to take a $163 million charge against 1996 earnings and to pay $25 million through Penguin to settle a lawsuit over the issue filed by the American Booksellers Association.
Penguin Books sued Christine Galatro, a credit director for the company in New Jersey, in connection with the scandal. The company accused Ms. Galatro of hatching an elaborate $1.4 million embezzlement scheme that led to a cover-up that Penguin contends grew into exponential losses -- charges that her lawyer has denied.
Mr. Mayer said he did not know the credit manager and pointed out that the problem also eluded notice of the company's auditors, Arthur Andersen & Company. Still, he acknowledged, "I think there's always some kind of technical responsibility in the sense that when you're the chief executive officer, you're responsible for everything, whether in the reality this is something that happened at a very low level."
Still, the scandal mortified him, according to friends.
"That was horrible for him, no question," said Roger Straus, the founder and publisher of Farrar, Straus & Giroux and a longtime friend of Mr. Mayer. "It was on his watch, as they say in the navy."
Those humiliations did not seem to drain the reservoir of respect that Mr. Mayer had built up over the years in the publishing industry, although he was fiercely criticized by newspapers in London, home base for Pearson, for failing to uncover the accounting problems.
He had such a long history in publishing that many of the executives in the corporate suites of major trade houses could claim early apprenticeships and first jobs with Mr. Mayer, in positions from file clerk to publicity director. "He lives and breathes publishing and it was very infectious," recalled Mark Gompertz, the vice president and publisher of trade paperbacks at Simon & Schuster, who worked for 10 years at Overlook Press while Mr. Mayer was juggling Penguin and his own company. "There were constantly authors coming in and out," Mr. Gompertz said. "Some would call it very old world publishing. He had this way of cultivating authors and it just rubbed off."
He was driven, manic and so scattered that fabled stories circulated about times when he was so preoccupied with the press of business that he would go to a restaurant and forget to order or he would dine twice because he had forgotten an earlier meal. His breezy letters -- which often went through several drafts before they went out to far-flung employees -- were legendary for their pointed lessons in publishing.
"I honestly believe I learned more as a file clerk at Overlook reading his correspondence," said Ira Silverberg, the editorial director at Grove Press, who said Mr. Mayer's second career offered new inspiration. "It's the romance of the industry. It shows that a publisher is not just a multinational conglomerate game and that people can return to the roots of publishing."
Since Mr. Mayer has returned to his roots, he has moved Overlook Press to larger quarters in SoHo, with offices whose white walls, blond wood floors, exposed pipes and African sculptures give them the air of a hip art gallery. Mr. Mayer has also exchanged his corporate pinstripes for a more casual uniform of blue denim shirt and khaki pants. His blood pressure is low and he has shed 20 pounds.
But the plunge from corporate to independent publishing is still causing some adjustments. Information for sales projections is harder to come by with a small staff.
"There are not enough bodies around to do all the ideas you have," Mr. Mayer said. "I think I made some mistakes in my first six months because I thought, now that I'm a small publisher, I have to do everything like a small publisher. I suddenly realized that you can be small, but if you have a big idea, there's no reason you can't do something large."
At the annual Frankfurt book fair in Germany -- where the world's elite publishers hold their clubby reunions every autumn -- Mr. Mayer's once vast trading space shrank to the size of a New York studio, with two chairs and a table and a sausage stand for a neighbor.
"I did worry that no one would stay and talk to me," Mr. Mayer said. "You never know whether some of them are talking to you because of your company or because of you."
Space was cramped, but Mr. Mayer observed his standards. Others made do with plastic cups; Mr. Mayer served white wine in glass goblets to visitors and peddled big ideas -- the foreign rights for publication of a sweeping fictional saga of the Central Intelligence Agency by Robert Littell, which sold for more than $600,000.
The concept for the book was Mr. Mayer's idea, one of the big notions that he said small publishers can achieve. The idea appealed to Mr. Littell and his longtime agent, Ed Victor, who has also recently steered David Wallechinsky, the author of "The Complete Book of the Olympics," to Overlook.
"You go to some of the big houses and they're on auto-pilot," Mr. Victor said, explaining why his authors moved to Overlook. "They do what they always do: print copies and send them on the well-worn grooves. There are so many things a company can do, and Peter is doing it for us."
Mr. Mayer remains on the watch for books for his company that -- naturally -- have been overlooked. Overlook has had notable successes in the past with books on ceramics, graphic design and the martial arts, including a perennial seller, "A Book of Five Rings," a Japanese guide to ancient wooden sword fighting that is on the reading list for Newt Gingrich's Congressional staff.
Since his return, Mr. Mayer has endeared himself to the "Friends of Freddy," a fan club for devotees of Freddy the Pig, the hero of Bean Farm, by pledging to rescue the pig from out-of-print obscurity. Overlook is planning to publish all 26 titles in the children's series by Walter R. Brooks, who chronicled Freddy's exploits from 1927 to 1958.
Along with titles like "Freddy the Detective," and "Freddy Goes to Florida," Mr. Mayer has been hunting for other unusual titles in obscure topic areas. He is particularly proud of one of his latest discoveries, a book that claims to be the definitive bible of falconry.
He talks about these titles with the same sort of enthusiasm that he has for a coming biography of Gustav Mahler or a Singapore novelist's tale of a young girl sold into slavery in the 1950's.
"I'm happy as a book publisher," he said. "I loved my 19 years being a C.E.O. I loved it to distraction, but I couldn't do it till I'm 80. So I love being big and I love being small."

To the Editor:
Your Feb. 11 front-page article on the increase in stock ownership creates the misimpression that most households have substantial portfolios. But the most recent data show, not surprisingly, significant concentration among the most wealthy and relatively meager holdings among middle- and low-income families. 
 Half of the stock market is held by the richest 5 percent of American households. In contrast, the bottom 75 percent of households own less than 20 percent of all stock, and those in the bottom 50 percent own less than 5 percent. (These figures include stocks held through pension plans.) American families continue to depend on their paychecks, not on the stock market.

HEADLINE: West Fears Bosnia Funds Aid Hard-Line Serbs

BYLINE: By MIKE O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: SOKOLAC, Bosnia and Herzegovina

 BODY:
Late last year, as United States and World Bank officials were negotiating the details of a $17 million aid program for Bosnian Serbs, they were given an unnegotiable demand, the officials say. Bosnian Serb authorities linked to the former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has been charged with war crimes, insisted that unless areas they controlled received 15 percent of the money they would block the whole deal.
With the Bosnian Serb member of the three-person Bosnian Presidency threatening to veto the aid plan, they got what they wanted and the deal went through. It became another chunk of the increasing flow of loans and grants to the part of Bosnia where the authorities are seen as implacable opponents of Western policy. 
 As the American Government throws its weight behind a new group of Bosnian Serb politicians it says are more cooperative, Western Governments are preparing to spend some $130 million on new aid projects in Bosnian Serb areas.
Diplomats in Bosnia and human rights monitors in Washington say they fear that some of the aid will strengthen leaders who oppose Western efforts to promote peace and ethnic tolerance or, through lax auditing, make those leaders richer.
The situation sharpens a dilemma long present in Western policy in Bosnia: the conflict between principle and practicality -- whether aid should go to hard-core nationalists, even criminals, in hopes of enticing them to become more moderate or merely as the unfortunate price of carrying out broader goals.
Following the United States' lead, the West leapt to give financial support to Dr. Karadzic's successor, Biljana Plavsic, after she split with other nationalist politicians. American diplomats call the new Bosnian Serb president a moderate, though they acknowledge that her actions fall short of her promises to back Western efforts to carry out the peace accord that ended the Bosnian war two years ago.
That a lot of the aid goes to authorities who routinely renege on commitments is acceptable for now, in the view of the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, Brian Atwood. Money is a tool for gaining influence and encouraging political change, he said.
"If we're too rigid on the terms we'd never move any money," he said. "You do the best you can, but it does no good to be so rigid you basically don't engage."
A senior American official who is helping shape policy said, "Moral absolutism will not get us very far in Bosnia policy." He said that in the last few months some Bosnian Serb leaders had become less difficult to deal with because they want Western aid.
 
A Town Controlled By a Few Serbs
In this small town, Sokolac, an agricultural center in mountains dabbed with sheep herds and rustic cottages that Bosnians consider the heartland of Serbian nationalism, local leaders are pleased to have been selected for a $750,000 World Bank loan to remake the water system.
They can't explain, though, how they met the criteria for the loan. They say the water system is not below the level needed to satisfy basic human needs or protect the health of its 12,000 customers. Nor is it insufficient to supply water for initial economic recovery. Only a leap in the town's growth would substantially tax the system.
"We're hoping to have 30,000 people living here in a few years," said Mitar Odvic, the water system manager. "Considering that, what we have now is not adequate."
In Sokolac, the small group of Bosnian Serb men who control almost all government, business and daily life have defied pressure to share power or allow thousands of refugees from other ethnic groups to return home.
In the benefits they will get from the World bank loan, and in their opposition to the peace accord, they are typical of many authorities to whom financial aid is being directed.
Officials of Western assistance programs say money is always precisely targeted and scrupulously monitored. It is supposed to be for urgent needs, and only for areas where local authorities can be trusted to unify and stabilize the country by doing what was promised in the peace accord.
That accord recognized a Bosnian Serb Republic and a Bosnian-Croat Federation in Bosnia. Two important elements of it that are nearly universally ignored in the Serb Republic are the arrest of war crimes suspects and the return of refugees.
 
Aid That Helps The Wrong People
But many experts say that without aid the Serb-controlled region of Bosnia they control will remain an economic wilderness.
"Their part of the country cannot make it back with the previous level of assistance," said Rory O'Sullivan, head of the World Bank mission in Bosnia. "If half of the country is dead economically, the whole country cannot survive."
Criticism of the aid programs comes from the belief that much of the money is going to the worst Bosnian Serb leaders, either through oversight, or so that they will not obstruct the aid that might help moderate leaders.
"There is always the temptation to push out money to get economic results," said Nina Bang-Jensen of the Coalition for International Justice, a nonprofit organization based in Washington. "But economic results on a corrupt foundation will fail," she said, "You have to support the right people."
In the United States Congress there is also concern that foreign aid money in Bosnia may not be achieving American goals as well as it should. Thirteen lawmakers wrote Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright asking her not to approve the World Bank loans.
One of them, Senator Frank Lautenberg, the New Jersey Democrat, said in a telephone interview that Congress sees little payoff for the money being spent. "They'd better start showing results soon," he said. "There's not a lot of patience around here."
In the last two years, even as foreign diplomats condemned Bosnian Serb authorities for their refusal to carry out essential tenets of the 1995 peace agreement, the World Bank lent about $15 million and the European Union donated about $80 million for projects in the area those authorities controlled. The United States Agency for International Development provided $19 million in loans and grants, most of it for economic development, to the same area.
With the formation recently of a new Serb Republic Government that foreign diplomats say will be more amenable to the peace agreement, Western officials want to distribute much more money. The United States alone expects to contribute about $5 million dollars a month.
There are no exact figures, but estimates are that about 900,000 people live in the Serb Republic.
New World Bank loans were approved by the United States in December. Congressional critics objected, but Secretary of State Albright issued a waiver to legislative restrictions on giving aid where authorities have not done enough to arrest suspected war criminals. Most of the more than 50 people under indictment on charges of war crimes are thought to be living in the Serb Republic.
 
Refugees Kept Out As Suspects Go Free
World Bank officials, like officials of other Western aid programs, said their projects were approved after careful research, and with the towns ranked according to need. Even so, 15 percent of the World Bank money went to towns like Sokolac, in the eastern part of the Serb Republic, where many officials are under the sway of Dr. Karadzic, who is considered a principal barrier to peaceful reunification of the country.
The loans had to be endorsed by the three-person Bosnian presidency, where the Bosnian Serb representative threatened to block all loans unless communities in the eastern part of the Serb Republic got a share, according to Western officials.
"It is necessary to include a portion of the aid to the eastern Serb Republic because of the veto Karadzic has over the entire process," said a senior American official.
"That's the way business gets done," said a State Department spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Foreign consultants to the World Bank who oversaw the research into which towns qualified for assistance say most of the data were collected by local officials who work for the same hard-line politicians the West is trying to marginalize.
All the towns receiving American, World Bank or European Union money were reviewed by the office of the chief Western monitor in Bosnia to insure the aid would help only communities where there is a reasonable hope that officials may become cooperative.
But in Sokolac, international refugee officials said not a single Muslim or Croat refugee has returned, nor did they expect local political leaders would allow any to return soon.
In the town of Bijeljina, also to benefit from the new batch of World Bank loans, American soldiers recently detained a well-known war crimes suspect who had been living there openly. His friends say he was under the protection of local officials.
Another Bosnian Serb-controlled town, Foca, cleared to get World Bank money, was dropped in late December after human rights groups in Washington pointed out to the State Department that officials in Foca are thought to be harboring several men indicted on charges of war crimes.
For United States assistance in the Serb Republic in the last two years, nearly every project required a memorandum of understanding in which local authorities agreed to follow the peace accords by allowing refugees to return and arresting war crimes suspects. But, Bosnian Serb authorities have arrested no war crimes suspects. Of the 560,000 Muslims and Croats expelled by Bosnian Serbs during the war, only about 3,000 have been allowed to return, according to the United Nations.
Senior American diplomats, including Secretary of State Albright, insist they will only support Bosnian Serb political leaders who support the peace accords. But American aid officials say they don't have the staff to monitor compliance when it comes to loans and grants.
A senior United States aid official conceded American funds in Bosnia could easily go to companies controlled by opponents of American policy. Often, said the official, the money is disbursed without a close check on the company.
"It's a concern," the official said. "We don't have resources to look at the bona fides of every company."

HEADLINE: U.N. Team Mapping Iraqi Leader's Palaces

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 15

 BODY:
A United Nations team began mapping Iraq's presidential compounds today, attempting to help resolve one of the main disputes in the crisis over United Nations inspections of suspected weapons sites, Iraqi sources said.
The teams are not actually investigating the compounds, which Iraq has said are off-limits to United Nations weapons inspectors. Instead, United Nations officials hope to use the maps to determine which areas of the sprawling compounds are legitimate targets for inspections and which areas should remain closed. 
 Iraq has said unrestricted inspections would violate its sovereignty.
The United States, which has threatened military action against Iraq if it does not open the compounds to inspectors, did not immediately comment on the map-making team.
But Iraq called the development a "positive step," and warned that a United States military strike could destroy a well-functioning United Nations monitoring system of suspected weapons sites.
"The military attack would practically destroy the system, which relies on communications, cameras," said Gen. Amir al-Saadi, an Iraqi presidential adviser.
He also denied assertions that Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz ever described presidential palaces as "absolutely forbidden." The claim was made earlier today by the chief United Nations weapons inspector, Richard Butler, in a CNN interview.
General Saadi said that Mr. Aziz, in a meeting with Butler, had in fact pleaded for a postponement on the discussion about presidential sites.
Asked if the Iraqi Government is open to inspection of at least part of the restricted sites, General Saadi said: "We are flexible." He did not elaborate.
Access to the presidential sites is at the core of the current crisis. The United States and Britain have threatened to attack Iraq if President Saddam Hussein does not completely open his palaces to United Nations inspectors.
The inspectors, working under United Nations Security Council resolutions passed at the end of the Gulf War, are responsible for overseeing the elimination of Iraq's long-range missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Iraqi compliance is needed for United Nations economic sanctions to be lifted.
The United Nations and the United States say the inspectors can search any place they want. Iraq has refused, citing national sovereignty.
Under pressure to resolve the crisis, the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, ordered the map-making team to Iraq on Friday.
The team, led by Staffan de Mistura of Sweden, arrived today and visited one of the eight disputed sites, Iraqi sources said.
Mr. de Mistura, a former United Nations humanitarian coordinator for Iraq, and the two Austrian map-makers accompanying him are expected to finish charting the eight sprawling presidential compounds in three or four days.
There have been growing calls for Mr. Annan to head to Iraq to end the standoff. Mr. Annan was to meet Monday afternoon in New York with United States Ambassador Bill Richardson and envoys of the other four permanent members of the Security Council -- Britain, China, Russia and France.
Russia, France and China have been urging the United States not to attack.
If the meeting produces an agreement, Mr. Annan could leave by mid-week.
The Clinton Administration is under growing pressure in Congress to set a deadline for an attack. But on NBC television today, White House National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the Administration "has been very careful not to set an artificial deadline."
He repeated the United States position that the timeline for commencing military action is "not measured in days but it's also not measured in months."
Also today, Russian officials continued their efforts to resolve the standoff.
In Baghdad, a Russian envoy, Viktor Posuvaluk, went into a third week of talks with the Iraqi Government on trying to reach a diplomatic solution to the crisis.

HEADLINE: Mr. Suharto's Extended Run

 BODY:
Indonesia, battered by economic crisis and unprepared for the eventual departure of its dictator, President Suharto, is jittery over increasing unrest. Well it might be. The last time the country changed rulers, in the 1960's, half a million people died in the upheaval, most of them ethnic Chinese. Another violent transition can be avoided by planning now for an orderly and swift shift to democratic rule.
For that to happen, Washington must register its objections to the 76-year-old Mr. Suharto's plan to have himself re-elected to a new five-year term next month. America has complex interests in Indonesia. It needs to promote wiser economic management, calm investors, maintain regional security relationships and minimize the pain suffered by the poor. But discouraging Mr. Suharto's re-election by a compliant Parliament should be part of the mix. Recovery has been set back by his shifting responses to the financial crisis, including his new proposal to lock in exchange rates with a currency board before putting in place reforms that could make fixed rates sustainable. 
 Democracy can only come about through Indonesian efforts. Mr. Suharto has perpetuated his grip by eliminating rivals in the military or officially tolerated parties and insuring that no plausible successor is ever groomed. If he is to be peacefully eased from power, it will likely require the consent of Indonesia's armed forces, which have played a dominant role in politics and the economy since independence. That role should be rapidly phased out, for the sake of military professionalism as well as democracy. Members of Indonesia's civic, labor, environmental and religious associations should be allowed to compete freely for political leadership.
Moving toward democracy will not be easy in a country that has known only dictators in its 48 years of independent life. But the costs of a blocked political system are already visible in recent threats made against the Chinese minority as food prices and unemployment have risen. The Chinese account for less than 4 percent of Indonesia's 200 million people but own as much as 70 percent of the country's private wealth. Yet for every international tycoon among them, like Mochtar Riady, there are thousands of small shopkeepers and merchants threatened with losing all they have to angry mobs.
Increasing democracy will not eliminate tensions between Indonesia's Muslim majority and Chinese minority. But it can provide more constructive outlets for public fear and anger than now exist. It also opens new possibilities for replacing an economic system based on cronyism and corruption with an honest, accountable marketplace.

Georgia's Chief Reveling In His Sky-High Ratings

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The joke making the rounds under Georgia's gold dome these days is that Gov. Zell Miller has achieved an extraordinary approval rating of 77 percent, and that he has somehow managed to do so without being accused of having sex with an intern.
Some governors limp out of office, bruised by years of scandal, legislative warfare and political miscalculation. Southern Democratic governors often end up fleeing the rising Republican tide. Mr. Miller, by contrast, is skipping homeward like a schoolboy on the last day of class. 
 In his eighth scandal-free year in office, the 65-year-old Democrat has received the highest approval ratings of his tenure, in a Georgia State University poll released this month. His ratings, which have risen gradually and consistently throughout his two terms, hardly varied by sex, race, age, income or political party. Though the booming economy has buoyed many incumbents, no governor in the country enjoys comparable popularity, said Thad Beyle, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina who compiles ratings of governors.
Mr. Miller burst on the Georgia political scene as an aide to Gov. Lester Maddox, the arch segregationist. He went on to become the darling of progressive Democrats, watched the coronation of New South politicians from Jimmy Carter to Newt Gingrich, and ultimately proved one of the most durable politicians in the region. More than anyone, Mr. Miller realizes that political popularity can be fleeting, and that it ultimately may play little role in history's assessment. But he suggests that his success holds some lessons for other Democrats, particularly in the South, where his once dominant party is struggling to maintain relevance in the face of steady Republican gains.
Georgia, in fact, is the only state in the region that has not elected a Republican governor since Reconstruction, a distinction that gives this year's election special symbolic weight. Mr. Miller is prohibited from running for a third consecutive term, and he has rejected entreaties to run for the United States Senate against Senator Paul Coverdell, choosing instead to return to his earlier calling as a college professor. Though Mr. Miller predicts that his successor will be a Democrat, many political experts maintain that the race will be closely contested.
When Mr. Miller explains his formula for Democratic success in a bipartisan world, the tenets sound so simple as to seem self-evident.
He has focused his energies and his lobbying on a narrow agenda of innovative proposals with broad appeal, many of them supported by extensive polling. He has created ground-breaking educational programs -- entitlements, really -- designed deliberately to benefit all Georgians, not just the poor.
With great calculation, he seized on initiatives that he knew would yield visible, tangible results. After winning support for a state lottery -- not an easy task in a religiously conservative state -- he dedicated the proceeds to creating the nation's only publicly financed prekindergarten program and a Hope scholarship program that pays full college tuition for any Georgia student who maintains a B average. The Hope scholarship program, which stands for Helping Outstanding Pupils Educationally, was the model for a similar plan recently proposed by President Clinton.
Since 1993, more than 300,000 students in a state of 7.5 million people have received Hope scholarships, and more than 60,000 4-year-olds have enrolled in prekindergarten. "They are broad-based and you can see them," Mr. Miller said of his education programs. "It touches your family, or touches someone's family that you know."
Mr. Miller has paid little attention to claims of partisan ownership of issues, unabashedly co-opting Republican proposals when he sensed they were popular. And ever since losing a nearly ruinous fight to remove the Confederate stars and bars from the state's flag in 1993, he has studiously avoided divisive social issues that distract attention from his core goals of creating jobs, improving schools, cutting taxes and fighting crime.
Around their kitchen tables, he argues, Georgians are talking about jobs and health care and schools, not about partial-birth abortion, gay rights and school prayer. When the General Assembly debated a proposal to eliminate race-based preferences in state programs this month, the Governor remained conspicuously mute.
"When I was growing up in the mountains of Appalachia, the most valuable thing a family could have was a good hunting dog, a good hound dog," said Mr. Miller, who was raised in the tiny mountain town of Young Harris. "And what made that dog good was that it didn't chase rabbits. It stayed on the trail and it didn't go off on all these little rabbit trails. It stayed focused. It's awful easy to get off on chasing rabbits."
Of course, Mr. Miller has also enjoyed the benefit of a sterling economy, a factor for which he says he deserves some, but not all, of the credit. The state's unemployment rate is 3.8 percent, compared with 4.7 percent nationally.
"There are some places that are doing better than others, and there are some governors that have put more emphasis on the economy and job creation and attracting business than others," he said. "That's always been a very, very big area with Georgia governors. Probably I spend more of my time than any other way on job creation."
Mr. Miller's Republican critics snicker that they are not surprised that the Governor is so popular. After all, they say, he, like President Clinton, has borrowed their agenda.
But Mr. Miller dismisses that evaluation as simplistic. Philosophically, he says, he is very much a Democrat.
"I happen to believe that government, if used in the right way, can make a great difference in an individual's life, and I think that has been more clearly enunciated by Democrats than by Republicans," he said. "I listened to F.D.R.'s fireside chats on an old Philco radio during the Depression in Appalachia, and I saw changes. I myself received the advantage of the G.I. Bill, which is one of the best Government programs ever conceived."
That being said, Mr. Miller has sounded traditionally Republican themes by placing reasonably tough restrictions on welfare recipients, by building more prison beds than any previous Georgia governor, by passing a two-strikes-and-you're-out law for violent felons, by calling for the elimination of parole and by enacting two large tax cuts, one in 1996 and one this year.
"They are not Republican programs," Mr. Miller said. "They're programs that are important to a majority of the citizens, regardless of what their political party affiliation may be. It's where the people are. And that's the most important thing."

HEADLINE: In Flush Times, New York City Wants Unpaid State School Aid

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
The Capitol rings these days with calls for spending the state's record surplus, but in that happy din, barely a word is said about a growing concern for New York City officials: the state owes the city at least $600 million, and much more by some reckonings, for expenses in the city school system over the last decade.
No one doubts that the city deserves the money, yet no one seems to think that anything but a small fraction of it will ever be paid. It is a story of disarray at the city's Board of Education, the state's disregard of its debts, and a city accounting system, supposedly the most rigorous of its kind, that allowed officials to ignore the growing problem for years. 
 The board has long failed to file its claims for state aid on time, and in the last recession, just as the late claims began to mount, the state simply decided it would not honor them. Now, the debt has swelled to an amount equal to at least 8 percent of the city school system's $7.5 billion budget, or enough to build more than 20 new elementary schools for 20,000 students.
The City Comptroller, Alan G. Hevesi, has begun warning that it is no longer possible to pretend that the unpaid school aid is of no concern. His alarm sounds discordant at a time when the city is running a record surplus, but he insists that unless state lawmakers suddenly decide to make good on the debt, the city will soon be forced to acknowledge that it has a hole of more than $600 million in its $34 billion budget. That, he added, could harm the city's bond rating.
The problem dates to the 1989 fiscal year, and is primarily rooted in the Board of Education's chronic practice of submitting bills late for reimbursement by the state. Other school systems around the state have had similar problems, but never as routinely. The state's unpaid obligations -- dating from 1996 or earlier -- to all the other districts around the state total $80 million, about one-eighth the amount owed to New York City.
In the early and mid-1990's, in some aid categories, the Board of Education filed only about 50 percent of its reimbursement claims on time, Mr. Hevesi said. That record has improved significantly in the last few years, he said, but late billing remains a problem.
To understand the problem, it helps to know a few things about state budgeting. Each year, the Governor and the Legislature decide on a complex series of formulas for calculating school aid. Using those formulas, the lawmakers estimate how much the school systems will ask for, and appropriate that amount.
Until the late 1980's, if the requests exceeded the appropriation, the state simply appropriated more money. And if a school system submitted its bills a year or two late, the state usually paid them anyway.
But lawmakers ended both practices in 1990, the start of a period of yawning state budget deficits. Since then, any money appropriated for school aid but not spent is rolled over into the next year, in effect wiping clean the previous year's legal duty to pay expenses. Even bills submitted within the year have sometimes gone unpaid when the state did not appropriate enough.
Although the state's days of penury have eased, it has not gone back to its once-lenient treatment of school aid bills. Each year, the budget includes some money to pay off those old debts, but usually no more than a token.
"At the beginning, it was just maladministration by the Board of Education, but it was taken advantage of by the people in Albany," said Mr. Hevesi, who was an influential member of the Assembly when the problem took hold. "This was a subsidy to the state. It allowed them not to pay the bills."
In recent hearings here on the state budget, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew called payment of the old debts his first priority among his dealings with the state. "It is an outrage that local governments and school districts across the state cannot get paid for the services they have provided on behalf of the state, pursuant to state law," he said.
The state has accumulated large surpluses three years in a row -- for the fiscal year ending March 31, it is expected to be $2 billion -- yet it is unusual to hear lawmakers talk about old debts. In his proposed 1999 budget, Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, would allocate just $16 million to paying the Board of Education's prior claims. When asked, the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said he would favor making larger payments, but he rarely raises the issue on his own.
"There's a psychological element to all of this," said Stephen K. Allinger, the Board of Education's representative in Albany. "The legislators got the school aid approved, they bragged about what their communities got. So now there's new money, but they can't bring themselves to pay for what they feel they already bought a couple of years ago, when they could use it to buy new goodies."
Mr. Hevesi reached the same conclusion, but said the problem was politics more than psychology. "The pressure on the Legislature to spend the money on other things is enormous," he said. "Why would they say, 'No, you can't have this $100 million for new projects because we have to pay our bills'?"
For the most basic forms of school aid that it has requested for decades, the Board of Education has generally submitted its bills on time. But the state's new, tight-fisted treatment of old bills coincided with the arrival of major new expenses that proved particularly challenging to the board's creaky bureaucracy.
Enrollment in the city system has climbed steeply in the 1990's, creating a pressing demand for new schools. The city created a new School Construction Authority to handle the building binge, but that agency has persistently been a troubled one.
In 1989, state law greatly expanded the school system's responsibility for preschool and summer school programs for disabled children, and enrollment in those programs boomed. And in the 1990's, the demand grew for expensive, special education programs for which the Board of Education is required to pay, but is not equipped to provide.
All of these new and rising expenses -- for construction, special education and the disabled -- have one thing in common: The Board of Education relies mostly on outside contractors to provide them. And that, officials say, has made it harder to account for all the expenses and submit the bills on time.
For fiscal years 1989 through 1992, the unpaid expenses averaged $22 million a year. But in 1993, as the construction and programs for the disabled got under way in earnest, the figure soared to $128.3 million, and it has remained over $100 million a year since.
For the fiscal years 1989 through 1996, the city has billed $633 million in school aid that has not been paid. Bills are still being paid under the state's fiscal 1997 appropriation, so it is not clear how much of the state's obligations for that year will go unpaid.
Some of the claims that have been filed might be rejected by the State Department of Education and the State Comptroller's office, which must approve them before they are paid, but in the past, all but a small fraction of the bills have been found valid.
The unpaid bills have not created a cash flow crisis for the city schools, for a number of reasons. Most of the state's school districts are independent entities, but the Board of Education is an arm of the city, and when the state fails to pay bills, the city still makes good on them. The city's budget is large enough to absorb some fairly large problems, and in recent years, the city, riding the booming financial markets, has been flush with cash.
Mr. Hevesi contends that the city's stringent accounting rules helped mask the problem. The rules, known as generally accepted accounting principles, were imposed on the city by state law in the 1970's, after the city nearly went bankrupt.
One feature of the accounting principles is that they show money that is owed to the city as an asset, an "account receivable." So even as the state's debts to the city went unpaid, the city's books appeared to be balanced. Those same rules, however, require that the city must eventually stop listing money as an asset on its balance sheets if there is no real expectation that it will be paid.
City and state officials say it is inevitable that some day soon, one of the city's fiscal monitors -- the Financial Control Board, or the outside auditors the city is required to hire each year -- will call an end to the pretense and declare the city's budget out of balance. That could threaten the city's credit rating, and under state law, it would require budget-balancing moves by the city, like cutting expenses or increasing taxes.
Mr. Hevesi says that this year he will begin writing off as a loss any state claim that is 10 years old or more.
"Look, there's plenty of blame to go around on this thing," an influential Assembly member from the city said. "The Board of Ed was sloppy, the city people didn't notice, and we just looked the other way."

HEADLINE: Bills Regulating Managed Care Benefit Doctors

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: SPRINGFIELD, Ill.

 BODY:
The debate over managed health care and consumer rights that is just beginning in Congress has been stirring a populist backlash in state capitals for several years. It is shattering historic alliances, turning doctors against doctors, doctors against business and business against otherwise pro-business Republicans.
Politicians and lobbyists frame the debate as a conflict over consumer desires for good quality care and for affordable care. But they say that in the back rooms of lawmaking, the debate is only tangentially about consumers. Mostly, they say, it is about protecting the incomes, jobs and turf of the health care system's biggest and richest vested interests. 
 Under the banner of consumer protection, legislators are wrestling with the complaints of specialist physicians who have been losing their patients, fees and autonomy, those of insurance and managed care companies whose profits have sunk in competition for patients, and those of employers who pay for much of the coverage.
"It's all over the place, all under the guise of consumer bills of rights," said Trish Riley, executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy in Portland, Me., an association of state health officials and lawmakers.
So far, said Paul R. Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, a research group in Washington supported by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the providers, primarily doctors, are winning. "Elected officials feel their unhappiness," Mr. Ginsburg said. "It's the providers who are organizing and saying, 'This is what you want to do.' The quip going around is that this is physician protection, not consumer protection."
Probably no state illustrates the conflicts more clearly than Illinois. The State House of Representatives passed a sweeping managed care law last April, thanks to the nearly solid support of specialist physicians, and it now faces dismembering in the Senate, where business lobbies are stronger.
"We called it a patients' bill of rights," said Barbara Flynn Curry, a Democrat and House majority leader. "But it was certainly as much about the protection of physicians."
"The real issues in Illinois have nothing to do with patients," said Donna Ginther, the Springfield lobbyist for the American Association of Retired Persons. "They have to do with insurance companies and providers. How a bill will look depends for the most part on discussions between the providers and the health plans. We can influence the outcome. But is the debate about us? No."
Lawmakers, business and consumer advocates say that managed care is entrenched today, with 60 percent of the nation's insured population covered by it. By imposing businesslike disciplines on health services, they say managed care has wrung excess from the system and stopped the rising cost of care.
But many also condemn the industry for going too far, with delays, denials and limitations on essential care. So in the aftermath of Congress's rejection of President Clinton proposed overhaul of the health care system four years ago, state politicians have been seizing upon consumers' and doctors' complaints of abuses under managed care.
Molly Stauffer, a senior policy analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said that 17 states enacted comprehensive consumer rights laws last year, and she predicted that at least six more would this year. Ms. Riley said most of the provisions states were enacting were high on the agendas of specialist physicians.
She said more than half of the provisions let women choose obstetrician-gynecologists as personal physicians, bypassing primary care doctors who act as gatekeepers under managed care plans, and mandate hospital stays, typically of at least two days, for childbirth. Many also require plans to make quicker referrals to specialists and to let patients appeal rejections of care to outside arbitrators.
Now the Federal Government has joined the debate. In his State of the Union Message last month, President Clinton urged enactment of a "Consumer Bill of Rights," and in Congress, improbable alliances of liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans are weighing similar bills.
Ms. Ginther said that in Illinois, as in most states, the rights that consumers are winning are a few that all the lobbies can live with, like allowing some emergency room visits without a health plan's prior approval.
But on other issues, consumer groups are losing out to the large special interests. Examples include Government-subsidized health care for all, access to official records of complaints against doctors and health plans, expanding consumer rights to sue both for malpractice, or penalties for overbooking patients and keeping them waiting.
"When you cut through all of this, there are certainly some things that are helping consumers," said Jay Dee F. Shattuck, lobbyist for a coalition of employers that includes the Illinois plants of General Motors, Ford and John Deere. "But when you get down to the political fight, it's about physicians' rights and a business community that's saying, 'Whoa! We remember the days when there was double-digit inflation.' "
In Springfield as in Washington, lawmakers describe the conflict in predictable ways. "We're struggling here with a balance of public sentiment and affordable coverage," said State Representative William E. Brady, Republican of Bloomington, who voted against the House bill. "My personal fear is that if the Government gets overly involved, we would eliminate the free enterprise aspects of the issue."
Representative Mary E. Flowers, Democrat of Chicago and one of the bill's two chief sponsors, said, "To be a roofing contractor in this state, you have to be licensed and regulated. Health maintenance organizations are not regulated. They are dealing with people's lives. They would have to comply with some kind of rules. They would have to be accountable."
For the most part, however, lawmakers are grappling less with matters of big and small government and consumer rights than with the conflicting agendas of physicians and business. "What this issue has done," Mr. Shattuck said, "is put two very strong Republican interest groups at loggerheads."
Managed care is shredding the physicians' image as independent entrepreneurs allied closely with business. As they lose prerogatives in dispensing care and submit to cuts in their fees to hold onto managed care patients, their perspective has changed from button-down white to factory-floor blue.
"When I see a patient," said Dr. Jane Jackman, president of the 18,000-member Illinois State Medical Society and a family doctor in Springfield, "she needs a quick diagnosis. But I have to get permission for any test that costs more than $100 that I don't do in my own office. I have to call an 800 number to the managed care office for a decision of whether it can or cannot be done. Quite often you're asked for more documentation and about why you have to do it."
In the debate over consumer protection, doctors promise better quality care, which they equate with consumer desires for a choice of doctors and easy access to specialists. But for doctors outside a patient's health plan, choice also means a patient's right to choose them and thus to assure them work.
Managed care plans, for their part, warn that tighter regulation and provisions like those in Ms. Flowers's House Bill 626 expanding consumer and physician rights jeopardize their control of the cost of care.
Bob Burger, executive vice president of the Illinois Association of Health Maintenance Organizations, cites one provision in the bill requiring each H.M.O. to appoint an independent medical staff to share medical decisions with management.
Mr. Burger said the law also gave doctors special privileges. "We'd have to provide them with legal due process before dismissing them," he said. "That's very expensive. We can't operate like that."
In the face of such constraints, managed care companies warn that they would have to charge much more for premiums, co-payments and deductibles, making insurance less affordable for all consumers.
Were it not for the inclusion of the Illinois State Medical Society's agenda, the House consumer protection bill would have died aborning. Ms. Flowers and Representative Carolyn Krause, Republican of Cook County, developed most of the initial provisions with the Campaign for Better Health Care.
But in a house in which Democrats have just a two-seat majority, most Republicans and some Democrats opposed the bill. Then on the night of April 24, on the eve of the vote, doctors agreed to drop a bill of their own and persuaded the authors to remove provisions from their bill that doctors opposed.
One of those provisions gave subscribers access to consumer satisfaction surveys of physicians; another let an ombudsman intervene with doctors in health care decisions on behalf of consumers. Both provisions were retained, however, as restraints on H.M.O.'s.
With that agreement, 19 Republicans, mostly supporters of the medical society's bill, joined most Democrats in approving Bill 626 by a 73-to-34 vote.
Now the bill is before the Illinois Senate, where Republicans have a 31-to-28-seat majority. There, the H.M.O.'s, the Chamber of Commerce, the Illinois Manufacturers Association, the National Federation of Independent Business and Mr. Shattuck's Employment Law Council, along with family doctors who serve as the H.M.O.'s gatekeepers, are putting together a very different version of their own.
Michael Murphy, chief lobbyist for the H.M.O. Association, said his industry had asked for the anti-consumer image that has fueled the popular backlash. "We became green eyeshade accountants," he said. "We need to do whatever we can to show we care about prevention and good care." But, he added, "we're not about to die on the cross of specialist physicians' rights to get there."
A bill that excludes provisions deemed to protect doctors might have little left for consumers. House Speaker Michael J. Madigan of Chicago predicted that a compromise bill that the House and the Senate ultimately write might still wear the label of consumer protection, but it would be a dim shadow of 626.
"Do we stand our ground?" he asked. "That could mean no bill at all. My expectation would be to accept a watered down version."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Reception Courts Black and Hispanic Legislators

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Feb. 15

 BODY:
With a bounce in his step, Assemblyman John J. Faso, a Republican, made his rounds at a popular reception in the Omni Hotel ballroom, shaking hands at the conference of a group dominated by Democrats: the New York State Association of Black and Puerto Rican Legislators.
But in contrast to the other social gatherings of the conference, this reception was something of a landmark -- the first to be held by Republicans in the 27-year history of the conference. The hosts of the gathering on Saturday night were the Republican State Committee and the New York Black Republican Council. 
 The conference, which brings together black and Hispanic elected officials from throughout the state, has been the weekend's epicenter of activity for the politically ambitious in this year of races for governor, lieutenant governor, state comptroller, the United States Senate and the House of Representatives.
Mr. Faso of Kinderhook, who is considering running for State Comptroller against H. Carl McCall, the Democratic incumbent, said that the Republican reception gave him a forum to make his name better known.
"It's a great opportunity to meet people, network and, potentially, lay the groundwork for a campaign," Mr. Faso said, standing in a room of hundreds of black Republican political activists and business people.
"I think this shows that the Republican Party recognizes that we need black Republicans," said Mr. Faso, whose potential opponent, Mr. McCall, is the state's highest-ranking black official. "There is a Republican Governor and a Republican Senator," the Assemblyman said, "and we want people to know that the Republican Party is a path to opportunity."
For Democrats as well -- a great number of them -- the conference, informally known as the Caucus, provided many opportunities to forge alliances and make an impression.
There was Representative Charles E. Schumer, a candidate for the United States Senate seat held by Alfonse M. D'Amato, dancing to vintage rhythm and blues. There was Mark J. Green, the New York City Public Advocate and fellow Senate candidate, swaying to music in a church service this morning.
There was Richard Kahan, a former state economic development official who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, at virtually every event, stopping attendees and introducing himself. And there was James L. Larocca, a former State Transportation Commissioner, holding his own reception to draw attention to his campaign for Governor.
There was State Senator Catherine M. Abate of Manhattan, who is running for Attorney General, walking through a hotel lobby and restaurant, shaking hands and asking a district leader or two for support. At several points, Ms. Abate nearly bumped into G. Oliver Koppell, a former Attorney General who is trying to recapture his old job.
Not all the candidates attended. More than a few attendees commented on the absence of former Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, and District Attorney Charles J. Hynes of Brooklyn, who is running for Governor. Gov. George E. Pataki sent a letter apologizing for not being able to attend.
The widest and most eclectic array of political aspirants could be seen at the banquet tonight for nearly 2,000 elected officials, party district leaders and activists, and union leaders.
Before taking his seat at the table with Don King, the boxing promoter, the Rev. Al Sharpton walked by Representative Edolphus Towns, against whom he is considering running, without exchanging any words. Attorney General Dennis C. Vacco, a Republican, spoke to an audience that included two Democrats seeking his job. While Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the New York City Council and a candidate for governor, greeted guests on one side of the hall, another gubernatorial candidate, Lieut. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, shook hands on the other.
"This gives the opportunity to everyone who is running for something to get some visibility," said State Senator Larry B. Seabrook, Democrat of the Bronx, who is chairman of the black and Hispanic legislators' association. He is considering running this year against Representative Eliot L. Engel, another Democrat from the Bronx. "For politicians," Senator Seabrook said, "visibility is what's it's really all about."

 BODY:
A vociferous crowd of casino opponents halted a proposal Saturday to hold a referendum on a proposal under which the Seneca Nation of Indians would purchase land in Niagara Falls and legalize high-stakes casino gambling on it. But Michael Schindler, president of the Seneca Nation, left open the possibility that the issue could be reconsidered. 
 "It is not a dead issue," Mr. Schindler, who was elected on an anti-casino platform in 1996, told the crowd of more than 300 people.
The Niagara Falls Redevelopment Corporation wants to make an Indian casino the centerpiece of its $140 million plan for the city.

The Buddha is quoted as saying, "Life is suffering." More accurately, his first noble truth reads, "There is no lasting satisfaction." Therein lies the answer to the question of Stanley Lebergott's Feb. 10 Op-Ed article: "What's wrong with buying stuff?" 
 Material consumption as the answer to the mystery of life leads to an endless escalation, because all things do grow old. "But," one might fairly ask, "what's the problem with that in an escalating economy?" The answer, it should be obvious, but obviously is not, is that the web of life can't support six billion humans on a spending spree.

HEADLINE: FRESH HAZARDS -- A special report.;
For Oystermen, a Harvest of Risk and Burden

BYLINE: By DONNA ST. GEORGE 

DATELINE: EMPIRE, La.

 BODY:
Blessed by a gentle breeze, Mitchell and Frank Jurisich stand on the deck of their wide, white fishing boat as it scuds across a Louisiana bayou. Beneath them lies a bed of rock-heavy oysters, ready to be wrestled from the sea, in a rite of harvest handed down three generations.
"In the early days they couldn't get people to do this work," Mitchell Jurisich, a beefy man of 34, says as he culls and sacks the black-shelled bivalves with his brother. "To get these oysters from the bottom to the oyster bar takes a lot of heartache." 
 These days the struggle is more complex than the oystermen of the Louisiana bayou ever imagined. In an era of growing concern about hidden dangers in the nation's food supply, their way of life depends on a shellfish blamed for more severe illness than any other seafood. Since Federal officials started cataloguing cases in 1989, an average of 10 people a year have died from eating raw Gulf oysters that carried a little-known bacterium, Vibrio vulnificus.
Millions of people eat Gulf oysters with no ill effect, and here, as in many other industries, health officials are grappling with a kind of moral arithmetic of regulation, weighing lives potentially lost, workers displaced and traditions ended.
"You get into these societal, ethical questions," said Glenn Morris, an epidemiologist at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. After being steeped in the oyster issue for 18 years, Dr. Morris said, "I'm still on the fence."
In Louisiana, the top processor in a region that harvests nearly 60 percent of the nation's oyster crop, the livelihood of about 900 oystermen is at stake. The coastal version of family farmers, many work as their fathers and grandfathers did, on water bottoms leased from the state and inherited like liquid land.
From 1991 to 1996, they have seen the price they get for oyster meat come in 35 to 40 percent lower than expected as a result of public alarm over health issues, according to a study at Louisiana State University.
Here in Empire, 55 miles southeast of New Orleans, oystermen are battling a paradox of the Gulf: the same warm, brackish waters that make it the nation's most abundant oyster grounds create ideal conditions for Vibrio vulnificus.
Vibrio vulnificus, first reported in medical journals in 1979, is natural in the water and harmless to most people. Its presence cannot be detected by smell, sight or taste in the fleshy, gray-skinned morsels that people savor. But when the Gulf gets warmest in the summer and early fall, the benign bacterium turns deadly for a small group of people with chronic medical conditions.
"The most commonly affected are people with liver disease and more specifically alcoholic liver disease," said Sean Altekruse, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Liver ailments like hepatitis and cirrhosis are a factor in 80 percent of cases.
The Food and Drug Administration has shifted its approach to this new threat several times, buffeted between industry leaders who have opposed major restrictions and consumer advocates who want Gulf oysters either pasteurized or taken off the market during warm-water months. For now, the F.D.A. has settled on a program of public education and fishing rules.
Still, Vibrio vulnificus is not widely known. As a result, people like Daniel Gregor, 46, can become its unknowing victims.
Mr. Gregor, a construction contractor from Cape Coral, Fla., was meeting his fiancee's family for the first time over lunch in a New Orleans restaurant on Aug. 15, 1996, when he ate raw oysters. A recent blood donor, Mr. Gregor had been told he might have hepatitis C but had no idea it could be a problem, said his fiancee, Elizabeth Lyle.
Ms. Lyle recalled that she had asked the waitress about the wisdom of eating oysters in a month without an R, in violation of the adage. " 'We eat them all year-round here,' " Ms. Lyle recalled the waitress as saying. A health warning at the raw bar was not pointed out. By the next morning, Mr. Gregor was in an emergency room with a high fever. A day later, he was in a coma.
"It happened so quickly that I never had the chance to say any last words," said Ms. Lyle, a teacher, who watched in horror as her intended husband -- with his "merry blue eyes" and rich storyteller's voice -- died 10 days after the lunch.
Vibrio vulnificus is the worst of the pathogens linked to raw oysters, and it has not been found to cause illness in oysters outside the Gulf. The vast majority of people who become ill from raw oysters endure nothing as traumatic as Mr. Gregor did and are reacting to more innocuous pathogens, primarily a group called Norwalk-related viruses.
These viruses, spread when sewage is dumped into the water, have sickened at least 440 people in four reported outbreaks in the last four years, causing flu-like symptoms -- vomiting and diarrhea -- that pass in a day or two. Experts say they believe that thousands of other cases have gone unreported.
Unlike oysters that are cooked to high heats, those served raw can contain pathogens ingested in the waters where they grow. Coastal states have instituted educational programs to prevent sickness. But in the Gulf, the problem is trickier: the greatest hazard has nothing to do with pollution.
Mr. Gregor was one of 35 people nationally who fell ill from Vibrio vulnificus in oysters in 1996, when the most illnesses were recorded, and he was one of 24 who died. In 1997, 15 people fell ill and 8 died.
Those numbers are small in the context of the 170 million half-shell Gulf oysters harvested yearly from April through October, when nearly all Vibrio vulnificus infections occur. Even in the worst year, 1996, there was only one illness for every 812,000 servings of 6 raw Gulf oysters. But the remarkable death rate -- 56 percent of those who get sick -- creates a quandary in public health.
"It's a difficult societal question when the risks are to relatively small subpopulations and even the incidence within that small subpopulation is relatively small," said Philip Spiller, director of the seafood office of the F.D.A.
 
The Traditions
Croatian Immigrants Arrived in 1800's
Frank Jurisich, 33, slows the boat to a near-stop at one of his family's oyster beds, marked by tall white plastic poles bearing a yellow tip. Working the winch, he lowers a dredge into the water and, turning the wheel again, drags the dredge along the bottom, five feet below.
Within minutes Mr. Jurisich reels up a dark, briny load, spilling it onto a bare aluminum table. It lands with a clattering thud: rough, mottled, misshapen shells, no sign of the delicate oysters within.
"They're just like rocks until you open them up and see how they taste," Mitchell Jurisich says, opening a silvery round beauty and eating it with a smile.
The brothers work with many third- and fourth-generation farmers of the marsh in the heartland of oyster country, Plaquemines Parish, a rural outpost where the Mississippi converges with the Gulf of Mexico in an expanse of bays and bayous.
Here, Croatian immigrants settled in the 1800's, building houses on stilts in a remote area swarming with mosquitoes and alligators.
"It was harsh country out there in the marshland -- this was not prime real estate -- but the immigrants were perfectly satisfied to do what they had learned in Yugoslavia: fish," said Ron Dugas, a state biologist.
Generation after generation, families anchored their lives to the oyster. Paid $10 to $22 per sack of 200 to 300 oysters, often working six- or seven-day weeks, oystermen have made a living that often improves with each generation. On average, they earn $25,000 to $40,000 a year.
Much of the harvest is trucked to the oyster-loving mid-Atlantic region, where environmental problems in the Chesapeake Bay have reduced its oyster crop to a small fraction of its glory days.
Even today there is continuity in the oystering life -- in the grit and muscle it demands, in the hardy families who embrace it -- but the relationship between man and mollusk is more complicated than it once was.
"It was physically tougher for our fathers and grandfathers," Frank Jurisich said as he planted his rubber boots at the helm of the family's 69-foot boat, named St. Ann, the patron saint of the local Catholic church. "But with all of the regulation and politics, it is harder for us."
 
The Threat
Bacterium Grows In Warm Waters
Oystermen have always had worries: predators, hurricanes, poachers, luck. But since the 1980's, oystermen along Louisiana's 350-mile coastline have confronted a threat they could neither see nor control: Vibrio vulnificus.
The bacterium has been a mysterious foe. Researchers know that it multiplies in warm waters -- and that illnesses have risen as the Gulf's summer harvest has grown. They know that sickness peaks in August, September and October and that the vulnerable are a small group among the 12 million to 30 million people with liver disease, alcoholism, weakened immune systems, insulin-treated diabetes, advanced cancer, H.I.V., severe kidney disease, chronic hepatitis B and C, hemochromatosis and a history of gastric surgery.
But researchers still cannot explain why one liver-diseased person dies from Vibrio vulnificus while a multitude of others feel nothing. The researchers do not know what the infectious dose is, or enough about hypervirulent strains.
As scientists look for answers, the bacterium has made headlines. Florida, Louisiana, California and North Carolina have passed laws requiring that consumers be warned of the dangers where the seafood is sold.
The growing fear has hurt the reputation of Gulf oysters, as have outbreaks of more ordinary food poisoning. Making matters worse, a recent health report found that oystermen had caused several hundred of the cases of ordinary food sickness by dumping their sewage overboard.
Consumers backed off in many areas. In New York, some restaurants have given up on Gulf oysters.
"There's just so many other kinds of oysters out there; there's no reason to use them," said Mark Abrahamson, of the Oyster Bar and Restaurant at Grand Central Terminal.
While prices have made a partial rebound, said Dr. Walter R. Keithly Jr., a fisheries economist at Louisiana State University, "I think the industry's lost a segment of the population and it will not come back."
 
The Regulations
F.D.A. Seeks to Find A Middle Ground
The phone rings and as Pete Vujnovich listens to the caller's voice his leathery face wrinkles with a frown. Another customer wants more oysters, and he has none to sell.
"It's the way the board of health's got us working," complains Mr. Vujnovich, 75, a broad-shouldered man with a gray stubble beard.
Mr. Vujnovich, the Jurisichs' uncle, followed his father into the bayou 63 years ago and expanded by opening a shucking house in 1951. In this era of new regulations, his two oyster boats, each operated by a son, must deliver oysters to the dock to be refrigerated every six hours in the summer. But with reefs 90 minutes to four hours away, his catch is down.
"Tell me why we can't be out there 30 hours?" he lamented.
Mr. Vujnovich and other oystermen are working under refrigeration standards imposed in 1995 to minimize illness from Vibrio vulnificus. Keeping oysters on ice does not kill the pathogen, but it does keep it from multiplying, researchers say. But after two years it is unclear that the measures have prevented more illnesses, said Mr. Spiller of the F.D.A.
The F.D.A. supports a compromise plan -- 10 hours instead of 6 -- despite protests from consumer advocates. As such standards are debated, a larger question looms: How much death is too much?
"This is only a $50 million industry, and these are problems way beyond its value," said Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.
But Mark Tamplin, a food scientist at the University of Florida, asked, "If you build a case for closing it down for 10 to 15 deaths a year, then why aren't we closing down the poultry industry?"
The Federal Government itself is not of one mind. In the early 1990's, the F.D.A. urged the public not to eat raw shellfish. Several years ago, the agency toned down its approach, proposing a ban on half-shell Gulf oysters from April 1 through Oct. 31, when bacteria is most abundant.
After an outcry from oystermen and their political leaders -- and a study that showed the value of the Gulf harvest would plummet 54 percent -- the F.D.A. changed course again, opting to educate those at risk and require refrigeration, tagging and other safeguards.
"I don't think the agency thinks there is a single right answer," Mr. Spiller said.
While not happy about restrictions, many oystermen realize the need for extra care. Through four generations of working the water in Golden Meadow, 40 miles west of Empire, no one in the Collins family had known of anyone who had become ill, said Wilbert Collins Sr., 60. Then several years ago, Mr. Collins said, he was told about a cancer patient who he said ignored a health warning and died after eating his oysters.
"It really makes you feel bad," he said. "You don't want anyone dying off the oysters you caught."
 
The Future
Possible Answer Lies In Pasteurization
John Tesvich, 40, is a fourth-generation oysterman whose great-grandfather perished in the Gulf Coast hurricane of 1893. With his industry facing this new natural disaster, Mr. Tesvich started looking for solutions.
With two partners, Mr. Tesvich hired researchers and in Empire founded Ameripure, which processes oysters with a mild pasteurization to eliminate detectable levels of Vibrio vulnificus. But oysters still look and taste raw. After 20 months, the company sells in 26 states, at 6 to 8 cents more an oyster wholesale. Some experts say the oysters taste just as good; critics argue that they are less juicy and a little rubbery.
Impressed with the technique, consumer advocates argue for mandated pasteurization for Gulf oysters. But the F.D.A. is reluctant.
"It would be a rather profound step," Mr. Spiller said, given the brief track record of the process and its few practitioners.
Oystermen have mixed feelings, but many accept that they may be forced to adopt new ways if they are to reconcile the work started by their grandfathers with modern realities about risk and sickness.
That is surely true for Sam Slavich, 47, a fourth-generation oysterman who has a college degree but never applied for another job.
"This is what I was born to do," Mr. Slavich said. "I know what the farmer who harvests corn or wheat feels because I feel the same thing about oysters."
Vibrio vulnificus has been a vexing problem, he said, because "more people are struck by lightning." But Mr. Slavich also concluded that the debate might make life more stable for the next generation.
"Hopefully," he said, "we can get to a place where nobody gets sick."
In these complex times, the Jurisich brothers look to the resilience of their forefathers.
"It's a cyclic thing," Mitchell said. "We learned that from our father."

Chart: "AT A GLANCE: Threat in Oysters"
 
VIBRIO VULNIFICUS -- A bacterium that exists harmlessly in many coastal waters but can in rare cases cause food poisoning when raw oysters are eaten from the Gulf of Mexico in warm-water months. An occasional case has been traced to raw clams.
 
INCIDENCE -- Since 1989, 167 illnesses reported; 87 of those were fatal, or about 10 a year. (To compare, 85 people a year die after being struck by lightning.)
 
SYMPTOMS -- Chills, fever, nausea, blood poisoning.
 
AT RISK -- People with liver disease (from viral hepatitis, excessive alcohol use or other causes). Also those with weakened immunities, insulin-treated diabetes, advanced cancer, H.I.V. infection, hemochromatosis, severe kidney disease and a history of gastric surgery.
 
SAFETY TIPS -- Thorough cooking kills vibrio vulnificus or other pathogens. The Food and Drug Administration recommends boiling, frying or broiling oysters for three minutes, or baking at 450 degrees for 10 minutes.
If eating raw, realize that vibrio vulnificus is more abundant in the warm waters of summer and early fall.
 
OTHER PATHOGENS -- Other vibrio strains, the family of Norwalk-related viruses and hepatitis A. They generally cause brief bouts of fever, diarrhea and vomiting.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: VOICES;
For Ohioans, Hussein Must Go, But Bombs May Not Be the Way

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON 

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Wearing the annoyed look of a man recalling a half-forgotten enemy, Paul Ward, a retired accountant, put down his shopping bag at the mall and pondered whether America should bomb Iraq.
If the United States could put an end to the leadership of President Saddam Hussein, Mr. Ward said, he was all for it. 
 "Should have been done right the first time," Mr. Ward said, contending that the United States could have driven Mr. Hussein from power during the Persian Gulf war in 1991. "But if we're going to do it, let's do it right. None of this fiddle-faddling around. I don't want to see them bomb and then a few years down the road, he's back at us. Let's go in and get it done."
With Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright and Defense Secretary William S. Cohen scheduled to hold a town meeting here on Wednesday on possible military strikes against Iraq, the people in Columbus have been weighing their sentiments on war and peace.
In talks with dozens of people at a shopping mall, it is plain that the people here, a largely white-collar region of one million people, have been following the accounts of the standoff with Iraq, which center on the Iraqi leader's refusal to allow inspection of weapons sites, and grappling with hard choices.
While most people seem to believe the United States should take action against Iraq, there is plenty of doubt, and almost universal exasperation that American forces might once again be placed in harm's way.
 "You wonder, 'Is it really worth American lives?' " asked Kelly Armstrong, a 28-year-old barber, as he carried his six-month-old son. "But if we don't do something now, then there's going to be a lot more lives lost later on."
No matter what their stance on military action, almost everyone says they have grown weary of the image of a dangerous despot tweaking the United States.
"He's just like a little bully on the playground," said Walter Cain, a 61-year-old social worker. "He's kicking sand in our face, and we've got to do something about it. We can't just let him get away with it."
That same sense of outrage, and strong demand for American respect, rang as a familar theme among people who supporter military action immediately.
"I'm really mad we've waited so long," said Renee Moos, a 35-year-old cosmetics clerk, complaining that the United States looks weak if it does not act in the strongest way possible. "They should go in and get it done now. We can't just let this go on and on."
While Gallup polls in mid-January and again in early February showed Americans divided over whether to use military action against Iraq, the surveys indicated that support for an armed attack is growing.
Still, there is plenty of anguish over what course to follow, and some voices that say America should stay out of the Middle East.
"I'm not sure it's the American people's responsibility to take care of a place so far away," said Liji Zhao, 33, who stays at home to care for two children.
This view is shared by Jodi Bacon, a 36-year-old mother of four children, who pushed a stroller through the mall. She noted that Arab allies are unwilling to help, and said some countries would condemn military aciton by the United States.
"If we take a really aggressive stance, the reaction around the world against America will be negative," Ms. Bacon said. "We need to be careful what other countries think. The world's getting smaller, and we depend on each other more."
The last time the United States prepared to take military action against Saddam Hussein, Steven Leist, a young college student, traveled to Washington to protest against it.
But Mr. Leist, now a 27-year-old clothing store worker, said he has become convinced that bombs should be dropped on Iraq.
"I used to be very idealistic, and I thought you could reform people," said Mr. Leist, who had been a theater and English major at Ohio State University during the Persian Gulf war. "But this guy is insane. And he needs to be gotten rid of."
Many people said they wished there were a way for American intelligence forces to covertly topple President Hussein so innnocent lives might be spared among both Iraqis and American troops.
"The poor people of Iraq -- they don't have much of a say in all this," said Dimitri Karmagiannis, 38, who works in computer operations. "They've got machine guns at their backs."
For all the talk in Washington about whether the sex scandal in the White House would color the Iraq situation, almost nobody here mentioned it. The one or two people who did talk about it did so almost flippantly, dismissing the notion that President Clinton's decision-making would be affected by it.
"The problem with Iraq was on the drawing board long before anyone heard of Monica Lewinsky," said Byron Peasley, a 55-year-old banker, "so I don't think it's fair to link the two."
Mr. Peasley, who gives Mr. Clinton high marks for his handling of the economy, said the President had been mostly untested on international matters.
"This would be his biggest action on the world scene," he said, "and I'm not entirely confident in his ability to handle international affairs."
To Eric Duhlen, a 25-year-old music store worker, there are no good paths to follow in the stand-off with Iraq.
"It's kind of a no-win situation," said Mr. Duhlen, his arms crossing his chest. "If he's got these terrible weapons, we can't just ignore it, and let him go.
"But everybody knows that when the bombs start falling, he's going to be safe somewhere. And then he's going to come out, and still be in power."
Nancy Ward, the wife of the retired accountant, said she had hoped after the gulf war that Mr. Hussein would eventually lose power. Now she believes the United States must crush his military.
"Sanctions and diplomacy and all that, they don't always work," said Mrs. Ward, a 66-year-old bookkeeper. "How long were we waiting for Castro to fall from power? And he's still there."

HEADLINE: Consumer Borrowing Slowed in 1997, Rising Only 4.7%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY 

 BODY:
American consumers, often portrayed as fecklessly mired in high-cost debt, appear to be saying enough is enough.
Their automobile, credit card and other installment debt, which excludes mortages, rose just 4.7 percent last year, compared with 6.9 percent in 1996 and 14.2 percent in 1995. 
 The slowdown in borrowing was easy to overlook in a year when personal bankruptcies set a record, the debt burden hovered near a decade high and the nation's savings rate established a half-century low.
While signs of strained budgets grabbed attention, the consumer kings and queens whose spending accounts for two-thirds of national output responded by throttling back. And they ended the year on a particularly sober note.
In dollar terms, consumers owed no more at year's end than they had two months earlier. Installment debt grew at a modest 3.9 percent annual rate in December, after falling 3.6 percent in November. Until then, there had been an unbroken string of increases dating to May 1993.
Though monthly numbers can be volatile and gauges of consumer confidence remain strong, the October stock market decline could have taken some of the wind out of consumer borrowing. So could the prospect of deflation pressures and economic slowdown reverberating from the Asian financial crisis.
"Consumers as a group are very responsible borrowers," said James F. Smith, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina and a former credit specialist at Sears, Roebuck & Company. "They typically pull in their horns before they cause a problem," either overextending themselves or destabilizing the economy at large.
Because consumer spending has helped fuel the economic boom, and much of that spending has been through borrowing, a drastic slowdown could be worrisome. The flip side of spending is saving, and the national savings rate fell to 3.8 percent last year, its lowest level in 58 years.
To some degree, Americans have been forced to be more frugal. Banks have been tightening their lending standards every quarter for about two years, according to a survey of senior loan officers by the Federal Reserve.
Consumers also have a heavy debt load already. Measured as a percentage of disposable income, installment debt has hovered at 20 percent for the last three years, near its highs of the late 1980's.
"Consumers seem to be sensitive to their debt levels," said James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association. The debt trouble that pushed bankruptcies to a high last year is abating by one measure. Late payments on eight types of consumer installment loans retreated during the third quarter of 1997 -- the latest data available -- to 2.52 percent of accounts from a five-year peak of 2.55 percent the previous quarter.
The relatively high interest rate on loans other than home mortgages has probably helped curb consumer appetites for loans. The Federal Reserve has kept its benchmark short-term interest rate at 5.5 percent -- justification enough for banks to keep their prime rate at a lofty 8.5 percent -- even as inflation has virtually disappeared.
Should the decline in inflation, known as disinflation, give way to deflation, or a general decline in prices, debt repayment would become far more burdensome for consumers. That is because much of the borrowed money has been used to buy assets, from homes to cars, whose value would fall. An example on a limited scale is the real estate downturn of the 1980's in which some homeowners in depressed markets suddenly found themselves with negative equity, owing more on their homes than those homes would bring at sale.
Most economists say the prospects of deflation, which is readily fought by opening up the Fed's money spigot, are very slim.
Nor do they fear that the current business expansion, expected to reach the seven-year mark next month, is in jeopardy because of overextended or satiated consumers or from worried lenders.
For one thing, the economy has terrific momentum, growing at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the final quarter of 1997 and 3.8 percent for the full year.
Another reason is history. For all their power, consumers rarely bring on recession. The obvious exception was spring 1980, when the Carter Administration, faced with double-digit inflation, slapped controls on credit and suggested that using plastic was unpatriotic. The economy plunged into a recession, which led to swift removal of the controls.
Downturns are nearly always the result of imbalances in corporate America, overheated economic conditions that force the Federal Reserve to raise rates or external shocks.
High levels of consumer borrowing have been partly explained by increased convenience spending on credit cards, for frequent-flier miles and such. If a credit card bill is paid in full each month, it may not represent an increase in borrowing, just an easier method of payment.
Demographic shifts may also play a role. An increasing share of the population has reached the ages when borrowing is heaviest, for homes, cars and education. And the rise of home values and stock investments has encouraged consumers to take out a loan, rather than sell assets, when they want to enjoy some of the fruits of prosperity.
While rising wealth provides a cushion for some consumers, for others it inspires disproportionate spending, a process that David A. Levy, director of forecasting at the Jerome Levy Economics Institute at Bard College, calls "wealth euphoria," which may or may not continue. Moreover, many of these assets are not so readily available to pay bills since they are tied up in 401(k) retirement and other savings plans, said Susan M. Sterne, a consumer specialist in Greenwich, Conn. "It's not liquid," she said.

HEADLINE: Anthem Health in Sale Talks With Canadian Insurer's Unit

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Anthem Health, an insurer with headquarters in Piscataway, N.J., has begun discussions on a sale of its business to the United States subsidiary of a big Canadian insurer, in another illustration of the consolidation that is sweeping the health insurance industry.
Executives of Anthem Health, a wholly owned subsidiary of Anthem Inc., which operates Blue Cross Blue Shield programs in several states, have been told in briefings and company memos that their organization is in talks with the Great-West Life and Annuity Insurance Company in Denver, a subsidiary of the Great-West Life Assurance Company, one of the leading health insurers in Canada, according to some of the Anthem executives. 
 Analysts said the combining of Anthem Health, which has been losing money for the last two years, with Great-West would extend Great-West's reach in New Jersey, Florida, Georgia, Texas and California and increase its bargaining power with doctors and hospitals.
It would also enable Anthem's parent to concentrate more on its profitable Blue Cross business where it has about 25 percent of the market in Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky and Connecticut.
Increasing market share to achieve economies of scale and getting out of markets where companies do not have major shares, as is the case with Anthem's New Jersey subsidiary, have been two hallmarks of the current consolidation wave.
Spokesmen for the companies refused to comment on any pending sale.
Anthem Health, which has about 483,000 customers, down from about 672,000 a year ago, has a book value of about $150 million. Investment bankers say health insurers have been selling for about 1.5 times book value, which would put an Anthem sale in the vicinity of $225 million.
Even though Anthem has been losing money, it could add to Great-West's profits as market share increased, said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, an analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein & Company.
Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at A. M. Best Company, the rating agency, said Great-West is "a very strong player" in the United States, and Mr. Abramowitz said it was about the 10th-largest health insurer in the United States.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Spanish Company Is a Star Of Volkswagen's Universe

BYLINE: By AL GOODMAN 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain

 BODY:
Managers at SEAT S.A., the Volkswagen auto maker in Spain, miscalculated when their new $2 billion factory opened near here in 1993 in the midst of a European economic slump, giving them the capacity to produce 50 percent more cars than they could sell.
The investment led SEAT to four consecutive years in the red, 1992-95, the largest being a huge $1.1 billion loss in 1993 that included provisions for a $375 million early retirement buyout to help reduce the work force. 
 Since then, however, the highly automated factory, 18 miles northwest of Barcelona at Martorell, has become one of the most productive in the Volkswagen group, and the zippy little SEAT (pronounced SAY-ott) cars finally started showing modest profits in 1996.
"SEAT has recovered very strongly and very fast," said Pierre-Alain de Smedt, 53, who was tapped in late 1996 to run SEAT after heading Volkswagen operations in Brazil and Argentina.
"A tremendous amount of work has been done inside the company," said Pedro Nueno, a professor at the University of Navarra's I.E.S.E. graduate school of management in Barcelona, which holds an annual conference on the automotive industry. "Now the company has excellent models. They are in a strong position worldwide."
Volkswagen bought 75 percent of the state-run company in 1986 and the rest in 1990. VW has remained committed despite SEAT's slow profits, confident that it can position the brand abroad as a sporty car and upgrade its image in Spain, where for years SEAT was the only affordable car and the butt of comments about poor quality.
But in the Volkswagen group, which includes the luxury Audi of Germany and the practical Skoda from the Czech Republic, a corporate spokesman conceded that SEAT still had more work than the other brands to carve out its own identity.
"Volkswagen is a brand with an image going back many years," said the spokesman, Kurt Rippholz, at corporate headquarters in Wolfsburg, Germany. "SEAT is at the beginning. It has the longest way ahead."
SEAT had profit of $42 million in 1996 on sales of $4.8 billion and will have higher profit in 1997 on sales of about $5.4 billion, Mr. de Smedt said, avoiding specifics until Volkswagen approves the 1997 accounts. But profits are still below the 6.5 percent return on sales that SEAT aims to achieve within five years.
SEAT will not enter the United States market anytime soon, preferring to consolidate its 2.5 percent market share in Europe. It had double-digit sales growth last year in Germany, Italy, Britain and Portugal, and also in Spain, where it has a 12 percent market share. In all, 70 percent of SEAT's production of 400,000 cars is sold abroad.
But it was not always so. The Franco dictatorship started SEAT in 1950, ceding a 7 percent stake to Fiat S.p.A. of Italy, and concentrated on building affordable cars for Spain's emerging middle class. The company was baptized as S.E.A.T., a Spanish acronym for the Spanish Company for Touring Automobiles; later it became known simply as SEAT.
Even before Volkswagen's entry, SEAT had tried to polish its image. It quit calling its models only by numbers, like the ubiquitous SEAT 600, and started naming them for chic Spanish locales. SEAT's Ibiza, the best-selling car at home in 1997, is named after Spain's jet-set Mediterranean island.
Volkswagen pushed for more improvements in SEAT performance and styling. The Ibiza racing version made its debut in world rally competition in 1996 and in 1997 won in its small-car category. And the engineering staff has doubled, to 400, at SEAT's secretive, gated research and design center on a bluff overlooking the sprawling 740-acre Martorell factory.
The factory makes five SEAT models, which are sold in 60 nations, and three Volkswagen models, sold mainly in Europe. Two other SEAT models are produced at Volkswagen plants in Germany and Portugal, and another model is assembled at SEAT's old factory, 20 miles from Martorell in Barcelona's port area.
SEAT's emphasis is increasingly on the Martorell factory, which cuts costs by using common undercarriages and a large percentage of common components to build various models of cars. An army of outside suppliers situated nearby deliver parts right to the assembly line, and the factory recently reached a rate of 60 vehicles per worker annually, one of Europe's most efficient.
The factory employs 8,100 workers, representing 62 percent of SEAT's total work force. Martorell's daily production of 2,040 cars may soon increase to 2,200, and for the first time in SEAT's history the plant stayed open last August during Spain's traditional vacation month.
But Manuel Gallardo Mendez, a leader of SEAT's highly unionized 13,000 employees, cautioned that while strikes were rare during the crisis years, the unions are worried about their aging members and want another early retirement buyout to make way for younger employees. In the 1993 buyout, the 3,000 longtime workers who accepted the offer received $125,000 each.
Management is cool to another buyout, preferring instead to expand sales. But it did cooperate lately with the unions to redesign the factory uniform in beige, symbolic of a move to modernize in a nation where the blue worker outfit is still the norm.
SEAT aspires to compete with Alfa Romeo and Lancia of Italy, company spokesmen said. But although it is planning for a more luxurious car, SEAT's most expensive car now is the fully equipped family-size Toledo, which costs only about $19,000, considerably less than similar Alfa and Lancia models.
Despite the upmarket aspirations, SEAT's focus in the first half of 1998 will be on small cars. Its mini-car, the Arosa, retailing for $7,300, will switch production from a Volkswagen plant in Germany to SEAT's factory in Martorell.

HEADLINE: Newspaper In Nashville Dies at 122

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 16

 BODY:
The Nashville Banner today became the latest casualty in the continuing battle between morning and afternoon newspapers, with the publisher of the afternoon daily announcing that it would close on Friday after 122 years of publication.
Like many afternoon newspapers, The Banner had suffered through years of declining circulation, despite steady population growth and a booming economy in middle Tennessee, and it simply could not find a formula for reversing the trend. 
 Last month, the locally owned newspaper's circulation was 39,839, down from about 63,000 a decade ago. It had dropped by nearly 6 percent just since September, and was projected to decline to 25,000 or less within two years, said Irby C. Simpkins Jr., The Banner's publisher.
"Nothing has been more frustrating to me during the past 18 years than to receive such solid reader feedback about our work, and yet to watch our circulation steadily decline," Mr. Simpkins wrote in a letter to readers in today's editions. "When our circulation went from 42,100 in September to 39,839 in January 1998, it was clear too many readers were no longer choosing our product."
Mr. Simpkins said in an interview that he and his partners chose to close The Banner now because of the irreversible circulation trends and because the health of the economy made it a good time for his 94 staff members to seek work elsewhere. He announced the news at a 7 A.M. staff meeting.
Afternoon newspapers, he said, have been the big losers in the rapid expansion of information services, including all-news cable television stations and Internet Web sites. "Our time slot is such that we're much more vulnerable to those competing products," Mr. Simpkins said. "You have to raise the question of how relevant is a second newspaper anymore because you've got so many competing voices in the community today."
Since 1937, The Banner has published under a joint operating agreement with Nashville's morning newspaper, The Tennessean, which has a circulation of about 150,000. Under the agreement, the newspapers operate independent editorial and reporting staffs, but The Tennessean, which is owned by the Gannett Company, handles the circulation, marketing, advertising, printing and other business functions for both newspapers. The newspapers are in the same building.
The Tennessean's publisher and president, Craig Moon, said in a statement that he regretted the loss of The Banner. "When the owners of The Banner made the business decision to close their newspaper, it mirrored the situation of many afternoon newspapers around the country that faced the challenges of changing life styles and readership patterns," he said.
Bill Kovach, an alumnus of The Tennessean and the curator of the Nieman Foundation, a journalism center at Harvard University, said the Nashville area would particularly miss The Banner's conservative editorial voice.
"It's a continuation of that trend toward the disappearance of alternative voices in major metropolitan communities," Mr. Kovach said, noting that The Tennessean traditionally has been far more liberal.
Mr. Kovach said that the two newspapers had such conflicting editorial views that The Banner even disagreed with The Tennessean in the early 1960's over the wisdom of daylight savings time. The Banner, Mr. Kovach said, "urged staying with God's own time, and Time magazine noted the conflict by saying that these two newspapers couldn't even agree on the time of day."
Patrick S. Embry, the executive editor of The Banner and a veteran of the paper for all of his 19 years in journalism, said there were some tears in the newsroom after Mr. Simpkins broke the news this morning.
"We've seen all the circulation numbers and read the obituaries of P.M. newspapers across the country, but you always hope that you'll be the one that single-handedly can right the trend," Mr. Embry said. "Such was not to be the case."
Mr. Embry, who wrote today's Banner story about the closing, did take some pride, however, in the timing of the announcement.
"At least we got to break the story on our time," he said.

HEADLINE: Asians Worry That U.S. Aid Is a New Colonialism

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Feb. 16

 BODY:
From America it may seem as if the United States is rescuing Asia from its economic mess, but gratitude is not the most striking emotion here in the region.
Instead, the rumblings of resentment and the stirrings of anti-Americanism seem most prominent. 
 "Just as the fall of the Berlin wall represents a political and ideological victory for the U.S. over socialism, the collapse of the economies in Asia marks another more subtle triumph of U.S. financial imperialism over the rest of this region," declared The Nation, a Thai newspaper.
Another Thai daily, Matichon, warned that the West is aiming at the "intellectual colonialism" and "economic colonialism" of Asia, and denounced the "financial and economic wars" that it said the West had mounted to humble the region.
Many people do indeed feel gratitude toward the United States for its help, and there is more annoyance at the politicians in their own capitals than at those in Washington. But although the anti-American sentiment so far is mild, many diplomats and scholars warn that a prime risk in Asia in the coming months is a heightened nationalism and hostility that could complicate American business and diplomacy in the region for years to come.
"There is a lot of pain here, and the pain is turning to anger," David Shambaugh, director of the Sigur Center for Asian Studies at George Washington University in Washington, said during a recent visit to Asia. "But the anger has yet to be vented at the United States. Still that could happen, because there's latent anti-Americanism in a lot of the countries."
For now, nations like Thailand feel annoyed that the United States has not done more to help its old friends in Asia. Throughout the region there is also aggravation that the United States is using the crisis as leverage to force countries to open up previously closed markets.
Even in Japan, which these days is one of the least nationalistic countries in the region, there is talk that the opening of financial markets starting this year will lead to a "second period of American rule," parallel to the American Occupation at the end of World War II.
"Inevitably, I think there will be resentment," M. Y. Yoshino, a professor at Harvard Business School and expert on Asia, said by phone during a visit to Singapore. "Many people in this part of the world are grateful for American help, but they also resent what they see as strong-arm tactics."
Indeed, there are even various conspiracy theories making the rounds. One is that the Central Intelligence Agency and the State Department, which are regularly given much more credit in Asia for effectiveness than they are at home, plotted Asia's crisis to win trade negotiations, put down China and bolster their influence in the region.
"The United States is certainly not offering a new Marshall Plan to East Asia," declared China's Communist Party newspaper, The People's Daily. "By giving help, it is forcing East Asia into submission, promoting the American economic and political model and easing East Asia's threat to the American model."
The upshot is that while Americans fret over whether it has been worthwhile to support the International Monetary Fund and its bail-outs of Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, the fear in Asia is that the United States has gained too much.
So far this is just one strain in a wide-ranging debate. It is notable that in South Korea -- where many analysts had been particularly apprehensive about anti-Americanism -- the mood has swung the other way.
Suspicion of United States policy is deep-rooted in South Korea, and when the country was teetering on the verge of collapse in November and early December, it was routine to hear blame piled on the United States. Now there is much less of that, and newspapers and politicians regularly say the economic restructuring and more open markets will be in Korea's interests.
"In the past, we might have thought that it was economic colonialism," said Lee Shin Bom, a member of the Korean National Assembly. "But now the question is how we can feed 45 million people in this country and 20 million in the North."
As a result, Mr. Lee said, Korea will accept foreign investments that once would have rankled.
The turnabout in South Korean public opinion appeared to come after the nation's leading newspaper, Chosun Ilbo, ran a remarkable series of editorials that defied the conventional wisdom of the time and laid the blame for the economic crisis squarely on Korea's own shoulders. In addition, the dissident Kim Dae Jung was elected President in December and immediately began to work to build a consensus for economic reform.
Mr. Kim calls on Koreans to accept foreign investment and other changes not because they are forced to, but because this is the best way to rebuild the nation's economy. Mr. Kim's spokesman, Ben Q. Limb, said one result would be a welcome mat for foreign companies interested in setting up shop in South Korea.
"They will be a much greater presence here," Mr. Limb said. "And they should be. We're living in a world of globalization."

HEADLINE: New Orleans Mayor Thrives on Lower Crime and Lifted Spirit

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 16

 BODY:
In the B. W. Cooper housing project, where politics and bullets alter lives, Marc Morial's performance as a mayor can be measured, quite literally, with a yardstick.
Here, as in other inner-city New Orleans neighborhoods, some worried mothers routinely had children sleep on the floor to protect them from stray bullets. Now, say people who live here, more of them sleep in their beds and even venture outside, with less risk, less fear. 
 A lot of dignity is gained, in the distance of a few feet.
"I see people coming out more; they're not on the floor as much," said Donna Johnigan, who lives in the neighborhood. She credits Mr. Morial's reform of the legendarily corrupt Police Department, and the fact that he actually seems to care whether the people here live or die, with making it a safer place to live.
"There's not a time we call him for a meeting that he doesn't come," Ms. Johnigan said. "He's there and he listens. That means everything to poor people."
With loyal support from such poor pockets in this majority black city -- Mr. Morial, a Democrat, won 93 percent of the black vote in his re-election here last week -- it was no wonder that this 40-year-old black Mayor's run for a second term was more like an evening stroll along the Mississippi riverfront.
But what is remarkable, as the demographics of his easy re-election have become clear, is how much support he pulled from all colors and economic corners of what had come to be seen as a city in trouble, especially in influential white communities and business circles that were, historically, color-conscious.
Combine that history-making white support -- he drew an estimated 43 percent of the white vote this time, almost five times the 9 percent that he won four years ago -- with that almost blanket support among black people, and the painfully neat, highly starched and smooth-talking Mr. Morial finds himself with the widest and deepest mandate in this contentious city in four decades. Almost 9 out of 10 people who bothered to vote, voted for him.
"This city was in the prone position," said Mr. Morial, who ran nonstop in the last four years not only to put in place programs to protect the people most at risk but also to rebuild this city's battered, bullet-riddled image as a dangerous place to live and visit. "It was like a patient and the family was sitting around, trying to decide whether to pull the plug. It was plagued by this coffee table rhetoric of, 'I'm frightened, I'm getting out.' Well, you don't hear that anymore."
Not even his legendary father, Dutch Morial, a two-term Mayor, ever had anything close to his son's mandate. The city's government now includes only friendly faces -- people Marc Morial supported -- on the City Council.
Mayor Morial's political coattails, at first suspect in an election in which he was confronted by two political unknowns, proved powerful enough to unseat a last significant nemesis, Councilwoman Peggy Wilson, a Republican. It is a long way from past races in which even token white candidates carried a huge white majority.
Times, from an improving economy to a significantly reduced crime rate, are just too good. And while some will argue that national trends have as much or more to do with that as anything Mr. Morial has done, others say no, he can take a bow. His re-election bid did not draw one single serious challenger.
Bill Metcalf, chairman-elect of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce and publisher of New Orleans Daily Business, endorsed him this time, but had not done so in 1993, when Mr. Morial defeated a white candidate, Donald Mintz, in what turned out to be an ugly, racially charged campaign.
"I was not sure if Marc Morial had the fire in his belly," Mr. Metcalf said. "I was wrong."
The fact is, Mr. Morial has been good for business.
The city's most destructive demon was its image. From front page stories in national newspapers to vivid images on national televison, it was one of runaway crime: people murdered in armed robberies outside popular restaurants; bullets fired into the air that killed tourists when they came down; a Miss Louisiana carjacked.
And there was nothing being done about it, because, residents here say, the police were committing some of the most soul-killing of those crimes: a police officer murdered her own partner and two young Vietnamese immigrants in a robbery; an officer ordered the contract killing of a woman who reported his drug dealing to Internal Affairs; officers were caught in a sting in which they were hired to guard a warehouse of drugs.
Mrs. Johnigan said her crime-ridden neighborhood went virtually unprotected.
People there were "tired of burying our children every day," she said.
Any resurrection of New Orleans had to begin with the Police Department. Mr. Morial brought in Richard Pennington, a veteran with the Washington force, to serve as police chief.
Higher standards were established for officers, and a new "public integrity" unit replaced the comically ineffective Internal Affairs division.
But for the poorer people of New Orleans, it was the simple installation of mini-precincts in the housing projects themselves that began, immediately, to save lives.
When Mr. Morial took office in 1994, there were 425 killings in New Orleans, such an amazing rate in a city of about 484,000 people that National Geographic magazine dispatched a reporter to chronicle the city's culture of death.
But by 1996, that number had fallen to 350. And by the end of 1997, it had dropped again, this time to 266. That means that in Mr. Morial's first term, the murder rate fell about 38 percent.
From 1996 to 1997, the city's violent crime rate -- murder, rape, armed robbery and assault -- fell 24 percent.
"People trust the police force a lot more than they used to,"said James Wright, a sociologist at Tulane University here.
Such declines in violent crime were also seen in other major cities, but experts on crime, as well as the people who endured it here, said that Mr. Morial was not just the beneficiary of a national trend.
"You can argue that he was in the right place at the right time, but he made some very visible decisions that panned out," said Wayne Parent, a political science professor at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge.
Mr. Morial's critics, and they are largely quiet now, say there is a danger in his popularity. Some of them jokingly call him "the czar." A political cartoon in The Times-Picayune here recently showed the new City Council as just a row of Morials.
Some politicians who have been adversely affected by Mr. Morial's popularity have even accused his political organization of stealing one election. When Mary L. Landrieu, a Democrat, defeated Louis (Woody) Jenkins, a Republican, for a United States Senate seat, Mr. Jenkins attributed his loss to Ms. Landrieu's connection to Mr. Morial and voter fraud. A Senate panel found some irregularities but none that warranted reversing the outcome.
Mr. Morial has always been one of the crown princes of this city, a lawyer whose father, often at odds with the white establishment, served as mayor from 1978 to 1986 and is one of its political legends. But Mr. Morial's popularity has eclipsed his father's.
He has not so much evaded scandal as he has just ignored it.
He has never been married, but has a 16-year-old daughter, Kemmah, whom he calls his "shining light." Efforts by political foes to use that against him have fallen flat.
In the previous election, news reports -- which he denied -- that he had once been admitted to a hospital for an emergency related to cocaine use never seemed to hurt him.
"The scandals were highly publicized, and he still won," said Ed Renwick, a political science professor at Loyola University.
In this most recent election, his popularity just buried any hint of scandal, Mr. Renwick said, adding, "It was never mentioned."
But now, as Mr. Morial ponders his future in a state that has been unashamedly racial, and some would say racist, in its attitudes, the young, wildly popular Mayor must wonder if his political career is at an end.
"It's hard to step from New Orleans to Louisiana as a whole," said Mr. Parent, the Louisiana State professor. "He would have to confront the politics of race."
Other political scientists say it is all but impossible for Mr. Morial to win a statewide race.
Mr. Morial is painfully realistic.
"New Orleans has evolved," he said, giving him the greatest mandate since 1961, when Victor Schiro drew 81 percent of the vote against a virtually unknown Republican. "I think the South has evolved. How far is hard to say."
He could wind up in a President's Cabinet -- he is that popular, too, among national Democrats. Or he could pull off something his father never could, and, with the weight of that popularity, force a change in the way the city elects its mayors.
Now, there is a two-term limit. He concedes that it is possible that he could try to change the city's charter and extend his career as Mayor for a few more years. Surveys have shown that, if he asks, a majority of voters would support such a change.
"Otherwise, his options are limited," Mr. Parent said.

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ: THE OPTIONS;
The G.O.P. Is Urging Hussein's Ouster

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 16

 BODY:
Before the first bomb is even dropped on Iraq, Congressional leaders are telling the Clinton Administration what it should do after that.
If diplomacy fails to resolve the crisis in Iraq, the Administration says, its strategy is not to topple President Saddam Hussein but to contain him and his elusive chemical and biological arsenal. 
 But a Republican-dominated chorus in Congress and in foreign-policy circles is demanding a long-term strategy to oust Mr. Hussein.
"Air attacks will do limited damage," said Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican and member of the Armed Services Committee. "But following that, there has to be this effort to destabilize and overthrow him. Otherwise we'll end up in the same situation a year or two years or three years from now."
Few if any lawmakers are even hinting at a replay of the 1991 Persian Gulf ground war to settle things. As another committee member, Senator Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican, said, "There are alternatives other than simply sending hundreds of thousands of ground troops into Baghdad."
Republicans from Speaker Newt Gingrich to the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, tick off a to-do list for President Clinton and his national security lieutenants.
The options include enlarging the existing no-flight and no-drive zones in Iraq, tightening the economic embargo, disbursing the billions of Iraqi assets frozen after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait to a provisional government and setting up a "Radio Free Iraq" to stir public opposition and arming.
"The doctrine here has to be roll back, not containment," Mr. Lott said on the Senate floor last week.
Not that the Administration is closed to new ideas. The national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, met for more than hour at the White House on Thursday with a dozen national security experts, including a former Under Secretary of Defense, Paul D. Wolfowitz, and a former Director of Central Intelligence, R. James Woolsey, who advocate ousting Mr. Hussein.
"Getting rid of Saddam is not a fairy tale," said Mr. Wolfowitz, who was a top-ranking official in the Bush Administration. "It's doable. But they're afraid of the same thing that Bush was afraid of: declaring a goal and not achieving it."
But as Phebe Marr, a national security expert on Iraq, put it, "There are no good options in Iraq, only less bad ones."
Until the recent crisis intensified, allied aircraft flew 20 flights a day over northern Iraq and 80 flights a day over the south to enforce no-flight zones that date from the end of the Persian Gulf war of 1991.
Proponents of enlarging the zones to cover all of Iraq say doing so would deny Mr. Hussein sovereignty over his skies and prohibit him from using helicopter gunships to help suppress any rebellions.
But the Joint Chiefs of Staff fear that patrolling the California-size area would be too costly, tying up three to four times as many aircraft as the military does now.
Mr. Hussein would be likely to test any edict by putting women and children aboard helicopters, military experts say.
Another idea is to expand the "no drive" zone in southern Iraq. Iraqi troops and tanks are forbidden to mass south of the 32nd parallel, and experts say the cost of patrolling a larger area would be prohibitive.
The Administration has also been trying to figure out whether they can tighten the already tight screws on Iraq's economy with additional financial freezes and economic sanctions. The embargo has already cost Baghdad $110 billion in oil sales alone, Mr. Berger said last week.
After a meeting on Iraq at the State Department on Wednesday, one official paraphrased the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs, Thomas R. Pickering as asking, "If you think of anything we haven't done, let me know."
The black-market flow of oil and other goods is hard to stop, a State Department official said, and the United States is not particularly eager to stop illicit oil flows to Jordan, because Iraq is Jordan's only source.
Moreover, Iran turns a blind eye to small trading ships that run along its hundreds of miles of coastline. Blocking this illicit commerce would be difficult for the marginal additional pressure on Mr. Hussein, naval experts say.
"I'm sure some young pimpled staffers on the Hill think tightening sanctions is a good idea, but not any of the adults who've looked at it seriously," said one White House official.
Finally, many critics have urged the Administration to foster the Iraqi opposition, inside and outside the country. But that option has flaws too. The opposition groups are relatively disorganized, poorly financed and decimated by Iraq's security forces.
Forces from two Iraqi opposition groups that received covert aid from Washington, the Iraqi National Congress and the Iraqi National Accord, were routed in a crackdown in September 1996 in northern Iraq by Mr. Hussein's security forces.
The United States response to that crackdown, a handful of cruise missile attacks on military targets in southern Iraq, embittered the opposition groups, who felt betrayed by Washington.
"Survivors are understandably bitter and reluctant to cast their lot with us again," Senator McCain conceded last week. "But we must prepare the groundwork for a process that may take years to bear fruit."
Indeed, leaders from the Iraqi National Congress are to meet with State Department, White House and Congressional officials on Wednesday. Washington's allies are decidedly cool to this option, at least publicly. Senators who received a private briefing from Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright last week said that even Britain, Washington's closest ally in the gulf crisis, has signaled discomfort in openly embracing a plan to topple Mr. Hussein.
"Iraq is only one bullet away from a new regime," said one senior Administration official. "The trouble is, we don't know when it's coming and where it's coming from."

HEADLINE: Wall St. to Pay To Add a Base For the Police

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI 

 BODY:
In an unusual arrangement allowing private businesses to pay for additional protection from the city police force, Police Commissioner Howard Safir has agreed to open a new police substation in the financial district paid for in part by $5 million from a downtown business group.
The plan calls for 200 officers to be based in the new station, which will be provided and maintained by the Alliance for Downtown New York, a business improvement district representing a number of influential companies in the Wall Street area. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said the substation would provide additional security in an area that could be a target for terrorists, and he contended that the private financing was a good deal for the city. 
 But some City Council members and leaders of community groups assailed the plan, saying it was unfair to assign additional police officers to Wall Street, one of the city's safest areas, rather than to more dangerous but less affluent neighborhoods.
"This is the sort of thing you would have expected 100 years ago during the days of Tammany Hall," said Councilman Sheldon S. Leffler, chairman of the Public Safety Committee. "It raises very disturbing questions about whether city resources are going to be allocated where they're needed or auctioned off to the highest bidder."
The debate over the substation is the latest controversy involving the city's business improvement districts, which levy an assessment on business owners to pay for services like security and street cleaning. Proponents say the districts play an important role in supplementing public spending, but critics have complained that the business groups essentially create a two-tier system of haves and have-nots for vital municipal services.
Mr. Leffler also said he was concerned about the involvement of Carol Safir, the Commissioner's wife, in the substation deal. Mrs. Safir, who holds an unpaid position as head of the Police Museum Foundation, initially approached the business group seeking donations to finance a new home for the museum, according to police officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Under the arrangement eventually worked out between the business group and the Police Department, police officials agreed to open and staff the new substation, at 104 Washington Street, in the First Precinct, while the businesses agreed to provide $5 million for the station as well as funds for the new museum site at 25 Broadway. It was not clear who first proposed linking the two issues.
Michael O'Connor, the former Transit Police chief who is now vice president of operations for the business group, did not return calls for comment about the proposal yesterday.
Police officials said neither the Commissioner nor Mrs. Safir would comment on the plan, which was first reported yesterday in Newsday.
Deputy Inspector Michael E. Collins, a police spokesman, said the plan for the downtown facility was similar to the department's Times Square substation, which is also underwritten by a business group.
"We are looking at other sites throughout the city that have been offered in an effort to reduce costs and cut down on overcrowding in current department facilities," he said.
Deputy Inspector Collins said the 200 officers assigned to the substation would be taken from a variety of task forces and scooter units and would be used to respond to calls throughout Manhattan. He said overall patrol strength in the First Precinct, which is headquartered at 16 Ericsson Place, would remain essentially unchanged, but the written agreement between the department and the business group specifies that at least 50 officers will be dedicated to patrol the immediate area.
Mr. Leffler said residents of his district in Queens had been trying to establish a substation in the 105th Precinct for nearly 20 years without success.
"It looks like the Police Commissioner thinks he's responsible to only two people in the city: the Mayor and his wife, not the city at large," Mr. Leffler said.
"This is a sweetheart deal for the Commissioner's wife, who is active in the business community, and the Mayor, who has been supported by Wall Street businessmen in the past and would certainly like their help in the future."
While Mr. Giuliani defended the plan, he also took pains to point out that it had been initiated by police officials and that similar plans had been discussed under the administration of David N. Dinkins.
Mr. Safir is also moving ahead with a plan to allow city police officers to work in uniform, off-duty, for businesses that receive the Police Department's approval. Although similar plans have been tried and rejected in several other cities because the moonlighting created conflict-of-interest issues, Mr. Safir said it would benefit officers, business owners and the city in general.
The Alliance for Downtown New York is one of 39 business improvement districts in the city. While the groups have been widely praised for improving many of New York's commercial areas, some City Council members have argued that the districts have become mini-governments that act with little oversight and give unfair advantages to wealthier areas.
Peter D. Salins, provost of the State University of New York and a former professor of urban planning at Hunter College, said such arrangements were a creative way for cities like New York to provide essential services without raising taxes to a level that would drive off existing businesses.
"The people that make that argument about fairness would rather have a city that would decline everywhere," Mr. Salins said.
But many community organizers say services like police protection are too important to be doled out according to a neighborhood's ability to pay. Patricia Dolan, the vice president of the Queens Civic Congress, said two of the civic groups in her organization have been lobbying for substations for years but would never be able to outbid Wall Street business owners.
"Last year, my own civic association, with a great deal of effort that almost broke the bank, gave $1,000 to buy a bicycle for the 107th Precinct," she said. "We should have saved a little more and bought a substation."

HEADLINE: Black-White Income Inequalities

 BODY:
The income gap between black and white families closed slightly between 1993 and 1996, according to the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. But the gap remains huge and may have only temporarily receded. Indeed, black and Hispanic families are further behind whites today than they were 20 years ago. The yawning gaps between rich and poor and between blacks and whites are not going away anytime soon.
The typical white family earned about $47,000 in 1996, almost twice that of blacks. Worse, the typical black household had a net worth of only about $4,500, a tenth of the white figure. A New York Times analysis of Government data shows that American households have loaded up on stocks, doubling the equity share of their savings since 1990, as stock prices soared. But blacks have taken virtually no part in the recent doubling of stock prices. About 95 percent of black families own no stock or pension funds. 
 Poverty among black children fell last year to its lowest level in decades. But at 40 percent, the level remains horribly high. Unemployment among black men fell last year to 8.6 percent, the lowest in 23 years, but nevertheless twice the jobless rate of white men.
Since 1972 black family incomes have risen less than 10 percent, at a time when white family incomes have risen almost 15 percent. Such inequality is more a problem of poor education, weak skills and the rise in single-parent families than of race. The plight of low-skilled workers has been decades in the making and will not be turned around by the temporary flush of economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Over 200 Die as Taiwan Jet Crashes in Bad Weather

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Feb. 16

 BODY:
A China Airlines flight from the Indonesian resort of Bali crashed and burst into flames while trying to land in fog and rain at Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in Taipei, Taiwan, this evening, killing all 197 passengers and crew members, including Taiwan's Central Bank governor, and at least 7 people on the ground.
The bank governor, Sheu Yuan-dong, was returning from a meeting of regional finance and banking officials with his wife, Huang Mian-mei, and three Central Bank officials. 
 The cause of the crash was not immediately clear, although Hsu Lu, the general manager of the Voice of Taipei radio station, said in an interview that her news staff was reporting that visibility was bad and that the control tower had asked the pilot not to land. Her account could not be immediately confirmed.
There appeared to be no survivors.
"In view of the gravity of the disaster, it would be very difficult for anyone to survive this disaster," Wei Hsun-chih, the deputy director of the airport, was quoted as saying by Taiwan's Central News Agency.
Ms. Hsu, the radio station official, said that there were early reports that 45 passengers had been scheduled to transfer to a flight bound for San Francisco, suggesting that some Americans may have been on board.
 "Seven foreigners were killed in the plane crash," a China Airlines spokeswoman said Tuesday, Reuters reported. Five were American, one was French and one was Indonesian. The Americans were identified as Laurence Smith, Christopher Cory, Kenneth Cowan, Jacques Augustin and Tom Hadel, but no home towns were given. The French citizen was identified as Rachel Liu and the Indonesian as Nyoman Sakadarma.
As the plane, an Airbus 300 jumbo jet, attempted to land it slammed into at least four houses several hundred yards short of the airport runway, setting them on fire.
Flames poured from the first and second floors of the buildings as firefighters sought to extinguish fires from the airplane wreckage and the burning homes, according to pictures broadcast by the BBC. Thick smoke billowed from pieces of the plane, including what appeared to be its engines.
A Central News Agency reporter at the scene described seeing charred body parts scattered near the airport. A woman surnamed Chen who was watching her home burn was quoted as saying, "There were people in the house, but it's totally finished."
As Central Bank governor, Mr. Sheu has been credited with adhering to a conservative monetary policy that has helped Taiwan thrive despite the region's economic crisis. Born in 1927 in Taipei, Mr. Sheu worked in a series of banks before being elevated to the post of Central Bank governor in 1995.
China Airlines, which is based in Taipei, has had a history of safety problems. In 1994, an Airbus identical to the one lost this evening crashed at Japan's Nagoya airport. And in 1993 at Hong Kong's Kai Tak airport, a new China Airlines Boeing 747-400 skidded into Victoria Harbor. No one was killed, but the $140 million plane was destroyed.
The jet that crashed tonight, China Airlines Flight 676, went down at 8:05 P.M., according to the China News Agency.
A boy was pulled alive from the wreckage, according to Ms. Hsu of the Voice of Taipei, but he died later.
"It seems like there was no visibility," said Ms. Hsu, who said she was repeating what her news reporters from the scene had told her. "The tower staff asked them to fly around and not to land. But after that they lost contact with the airplane."

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Madeleine's Folly

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

 BODY:
With a U.S. bombing of Iraq now increasingly likely, the question being raised by those uneasy with such a strike is: What is the endgame? Is America just throwing its weight around to punish Saddam Hussein?
The answer is really very simple. It comes down to two words: weapons proliferation. If Iraq -- already a repeat user of poison gas -- is able to snub its nose at the U.N. weapons inspectors, then the world's ability to fight the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction elsewhere would be fundamentally compromised. Libya and its friends would all be less afraid to develop germ weapons and nukes. We would all end up in a much more dangerous world. That's why Saddam has to be stopped. 
 But it is precisely because stemming weapons proliferation should be the centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy in the post-cold-war era that the Clinton Administration's policy of NATO expansion is so stupid. The U.S. should be doing everything it can to work with Russia, not only on Iraq but to shrink Russia's own nuclear arsenal, which is the greatest proliferation threat in the world today. Attention shoppers: Russia has thousands of weapons of mass destruction. It has hundreds of unemployed or underemployed nuclear scientists. And it has only the loosest controls over its nukes and nuclear materials, and it has a signed nuclear arms reduction treaty with the U.S. that has not been implemented.
But instead of dealing with this problem, the Clintonites are making it worse. They are expanding NATO to counter a threat that doesn't exist -- a Russian invasion of Europe -- and thus undermining America's ability to work with Russia on the threat that does exist -- Russia's loose nukes.
"Halting the proliferation of nuclear materials, missiles and technology is clearly our number-one foreign policy challenge since the breakup of the Soviet Empire," says former Senator Sam Nunn, who was the expert in the Senate on this issue. "But because it is number one, we should be measuring all other policies by how they affect proliferation. Not only does NATO expansion not help us deal with Russia on this issue, it is counterproductive."
The Clinton team has never had an integrated foreign policy. It treats Iraq and NATO expansion as if they were totally disconnected. One day Secretary of State Albright gives a speech telling Russia that NATO is moving right up to the Baltic-Russian border. The next day she complains that Russia isn't being helpful on Iraq. Gosh, I wonder why not?
"Thanks to NATO expansion, we have convinced the Russian political elite that they are not our partner and that their security is not as important to us as the security of the Czechs," says Jack Matlock, President Reagan's Ambassador to Moscow.
We are already paying a price for this. NATO expansion has prompted Russia's Parliament to stall its ratification of the Start 2 nuclear arms reduction treaty, which would shrink Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals from around 7,000 apiece to 3,500 apiece. That's 3,500 fewer Russian nukes pointed at us. But the deal has been frozen by NATO expansion. If the Clinton team loses the Start 2 treaty, in order to add the Czechs to NATO, it will go down as one of the greatest blunders in the history of U.S. foreign policy: Madeleine's folly.
As Mr. Matlock notes, the more we expand NATO, "the less willing Russia's Ministry of Atomic Energy is to work with us on cooperative measures" to keep its atomic scientists constructively employed -- so they don't end up in Iraq and Iran -- and the less willing Russia's military is to let us in to help it better control and destroy its nuclear materials.
Moreover, if Ms. Albright is serious about extending NATO to the Baltic States, the only way NATO can possibly defend them is with nukes. Baltic membership in NATO will, therefore, only encourage Russia to continue altering its defense doctrine -- moving to a greater reliance on nuclear weapons for defense, on more of a hair trigger, because the closer NATO gets to Russia's border the less warning time Moscow will have. But don't worry, sleep well, Latvia will be in NATO.
The Clintonites are rightly ready to go to war with Iraq to halt the spread of weapons in the Middle East. But their expansion of NATO will only increase the threat of proliferation in Russia -- where there are a lot more weapons, under a lot less control, and all pointed at us.

HEADLINE: Psychiatric Drugs Are Now Promoted Directly to Patients

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
Using tactics that were unheard of a few years ago, the pharmaceutical industry is increasingly marketing mental health drugs directly to consumers.
In a break with past practice, which was simply to advertise in medical magazines and buttonhole doctors, manufacturers of antidepressants began advertising in general-interest magazines last year. And several companies have promoted psychotherapeutic drugs to mental health patients and their families through the Internet and personalized direct mailings. 
 The marketing of mental health drugs to consumers, which surged last year, added to the explosive growth of direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs.
Drug companies say the advertising and other marketing tactics provide information that helps patients overcome their problems. Spokesmen for the industry add that patients are protected because only a doctor can write a prescription. But critics say patients who are influenced by the marketing programs may seek out doctors who might be willing to prescribe drugs that are not right for them.
Some doctors and advocates for patients say that people with certain mental illnesses are much more susceptible to being manipulated than those with other medical problems. "People who are seriously mentally ill often have impaired judgment," said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, executive director of the Health Research Group of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group in Washington.
And while the problems of ill-advised self-medication and invasion of privacy may apply to any patient taking medication, doctors say that the mentally ill are especially vulnerable. "There continues to be a clear stigma against the mentally ill in America," said Dr. Harold Eist, a former president of the American Psychiatric Association.
In the most aggressive example of approaching patients directly, Eli Lilly & Company said recently that it would offer scholarships to some schizophrenic patients who took Zyprexa, its new antipsychotic drug.
The scholarships, Lilly said, would help people with schizophrenia prepare for normal lives by taking college or professional school classes. But critics said the marketing pitch could encourage patients to risk the ill effects that can follow a switch in medication and could raise unrealistic expectations because few people with schizophrenia can cope with higher education.
In a second approach, a number of drug companies are finding new ways to collect the names of people with mental health problems as well as other information -- data that can be used for marketing purposes. Janssen Pharmaceutica, for example, urges visitors to its Internet site to register for updates on psychiatry and schizophrenia "relevant to your personal interests."
In a related program, Janssen, a unit of Johnson & Johnson, urged users of Risperdal, its schizophrenia drug, to call a toll-free number to join a "person to person" program that includes reminder calls to take the Janssen medicine. Spokesmen for the companies said the aim was to provide patients with information that they could then discuss with their doctors.
But critics said that a drug company could follow up on the initial contact with personalized letters to patients. Such letters could suggest that they demand a particular drug from their doctors, whether or not it was appropriate.
Yet another tactic involves drugs for depression, a more widespread and typically far less disabling disease. Several companies began advertising such drugs in general-interest magazines last year.
Lilly has sponsored the most extensive of the campaigns for antidepressants for Prozac, whose American sales exceeded $1.9 billion in 1997. Some Prozac ads have included postcards that invited readers to send for information kits. They were also asked to provide information about any treatment for depression and to agree, in a box labeled "Privacy Respected," to permit Lilly "and its business partners" to use the information, which the company said it would use to develop products and services.
Lilly declined to be interviewed on the campaign, but a spokesman for the drug industry strongly defended the ads. "Direct-to-consumer drug advertising is a First Amendment right," said Jeffrey Trewhitt, an official of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group in Washington.
Dr. Eist, the former head of the American Psychiatric Association, did not object to advertising of such drugs but said the collection of patient information was "intrusive."
"The information could be sold to an insurance company or H.M.O. that would then refuse to sell the person insurance or charge them a higher premium," he said. Or it "could also be used by head-hunting people" to screen candidates for executive jobs and by contestants in divorces to discredit a spouse seeking custody of children. Dr. Eist said that his concerns were based on "real examples that I know about."
Advertising prescription drugs to consumers is prohibited in Canada and most of Europe. In the United States, the propriety of the ads has long been debated by doctors, Government officials and patient advocacy groups. As recently as the 1980's, when the advertising of prescription drugs began in general-interest publications, "the feeling was that advertising was fine for an antihistamine" but that it would never do for a mental health drug, said William Castagnoli, a retired agency executive who worked on early ads for an allergy drug.
Lilly's scholarship promotion, which was withdrawn from the Internet last month after an inquiry about it from The New York Times, had said applicants for the grants "must be diagnosed with schizophrenia and be in treatment with Zyprexa."
Zyprexa competes in a tight race to dominate the $1.7 billion market for treatments for schizophrenia, an often-disabling disease that affects more than 800,000 Americans. Sales of Zyprexa, which was introduced in October 1996, rose above $500 million within 12 months, according to IMS America, a market research firm.
After The Times asked about the scholarships, a Lilly spokeswoman said that "upon re-examination of that program," applicants would no longer be required to be taking Zyprexa. Just yesterday, Lilly announced that applications were available for individuals who were being treated for schizophrenia and would be judged by an independent panel of psychiatric care professionals. The company said it had not decided how many scholarships would be awarded; it said the amounts would vary depending on applicants' financial needs and other factors.
Dr. David Kessler, who recently stepped down as head of the Food and Drug Administration and is now dean of the Yale Medical School, said the offer "could end up affecting good care -- if you are taking a drug that you shouldn't be taking, or if you would be better off not taking one."
Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and schizophrenia researcher in Washington, also criticized the scholarships for promoting "unrealistic expectations by both the families and patients."
"There is an unfortunate implication that many, maybe even most, patients put on Zyprexa will be able to go back to college," he said.
While drug industry spokesmen say the products, no matter how expensive, are more economical than other types of therapy, managed care executives say that marketing has significantly added to costs.
Dr. Sam Ho, a vice president of Pacificare Health Systems, a big California-based health maintenance organization, said direct-to-consumer advertising fueled growth in drug costs, which now account for 10 percent of the premium dollar for many health plans, up from 7 percent a few years ago. He said Prozac costs "at least 50 percent more, around $70 a month, than drugs in the same therapeutic class."
But patients may be more strongly motivated to take their medicines, advertisers say, and the doctor will always have the last word on writing a prescription.
"This is the information age, and more information empowers patients to be able to have more meaningful conversations with their doctors about cures and treatments," said Alan F. Holmer, president of the pharmaceutical manufacturers association.
Still, in a 1996 survey of 5,400 physicians, 51 percent had negative views of direct-to-consumer advertising of any drugs generally, 20 percent were positive, and 29 percent neutral, according to Scott-Lewin, a drug marketing research firm.
To be sure, not all offers of information on the Internet are come-ons to gather names for marketing purposes. Dr. Brad Tanner, president of Clinical Tools, a Government-financed private company, said 75,000 people a month visit Healthguide, its Internet site, which offers mental health mailings. "We don't share that mailing list," he said.
Pharmaceutical companies have long donated money for research and education to patient support and advocacy groups of all kinds, which often provide opportunities to promote drugs at workshops and through newsletters.
Janssen, for example, lined up endorsements from the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the American Psychiatric Association and other professional and advocacy groups for its Risperdal support system. 

CORRECTION-DATE: February 24, 1998, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Feb. 17 about the marketing of mental health drugs directly to consumers understated the number of Americans believed to have schizophrenia. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates that the disease affects more than two million Americans, not 800,000.

HEADLINE: The Fed Reports Slowdown In Industrial Production

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Industrial production unexpectedly stalled in January as utility output fell 4 percent, the Federal Reserve said today.
Manufacturing production alone rose, but at a slower pace than in previous months, indicating that the Asian financial crisis could curtail growth in this country. 
 The Fed said output at factories, mines and utilities was unchanged in January compared with December -- the first month without an increase since October 1996, when production was also unchanged -- after having risen a revised four-tenths of 1 percent in December. Analysts had expected a January increase of three-tenths of 1 percent.
"There's no doubt we're slowing down," said Brian Wesbury, chief economist at Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson Inc., a Chicago investment firm. "Asia's having an impact."
Additionally, he said, the Fed's effort to keep down inflation by holding the overnight bank lending rate unchanged is eating into growth.
The plant-use rate, which measures the amount of industrial capacity in use, fell to 83 percent in January from a revised 83.3 percent in December.
Production at utilities fell 4 percent in January, the Fed said, as many parts of the country experienced springlike warmth while ice storms in the Northeast caused widespread power failures.
Production by manufacturers grew three-tenths of 1 percent in January, slower than increases of four-tenths of 1 percent in December and 1 percent in November.
Auto and truck production fell 2.2 percent, the second consecutive monthly decline, although the Fed said vehicle output remained at a high level.
The General Motors Corporation has cut planned first-quarter production at its North American factories. Sales of small cars are slowing as customers buy larger cars amid low gas prices.
As 1998 progresses, the effects of the Asia crisis will become more pronounced, according to a forecast by two economists at the Northern Trust Company, Paul Kasriel and Asha Bangalore. "With slower export growth will come slower production, employment and personal income growth," they said. "A slowdown in export and consumer spending growth will induce businesses to cut back on their capital spending."
Still, in many ways, the economy is well prepared to weather the storm. Jobs are plentiful, inflation is low and businesses have invested heavily in equipment to improve efficiency.
David Orr, chief economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., said about the January data: "You have to look past the utilities number. I don't think anybody should read into a flat headline number that the economy is all of a sudden slumping. The Fed will not view this as a dramatic slowdown but a moderation."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasury Prices Up Sharply in Rally Linked to Asian Events

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rose sharply yesterday, pushing long-term yields to the lowest level in more than a month, in a rally powered by new turmoil in Indonesia and data suggesting that Asia's economic problems have slowed United States growth.
The 30-year bond rose 22/32, to a price of 104 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 5.79 percent, the lowest since Jan. 15, from 5.84 percent Friday. The market was closed Monday for Presidents' Day. 
 An important component of the rally yesterday was a wave of purchases by foreign investors on news that President Suharto of Indonesia had dismissed his central bank governor and was proceeding to change how the Indonesia currency is valued, in defiance of the International Monetary Fund. The uncertainty in Indonesia spilled into South Korea, where stocks fell for a seventh day.
Bonds also advanced on the Federal Reserve report that the rate of industrial production was unchanged last month, compared with expectations of a three-tenths of a percent gain. It was the first time in 15 months that industrial output did not expand.
Elliott Platt, director of research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, said the weaker industrial production figures might have reflected a decline in exports to Asia, which many forecasters believe will worsen in coming months.
The bond market tends to rally on signs of economic weakness because they diminish the possibility of higher inflation. Even with the weaker-than-expected output data, the Fed report suggested that productivity gains continued to improve, as seen in the one-tenth of a percent decline in factory hours worked.
Kenneth J. McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, an economic consulting and forecasting firm, said the evidence of improved productivity was a healthy sign because it suggested the economy could produce more goods and services without raising labor costs.
"Productivity growth sets the speed limit for the economy," he said. "The faster productivity grows, the faster the economy is capable of expanding without inflation."
In the Treasury's weekly auction yesterday, the average rate for a three-month bill was 5.075 percent, down from 5.095 percent last week. The six-month bill sold at an average rate of 5.070 percent, down from 5.075 percent.

HEADLINE: Sudan to Loosen Islamic Rule a Bit

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, the Sudan, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Nine years after it seized power in a military coup, the Islamic party that has molded the Sudan into a religious state is enacting a new constitution that officials here maintain will allow a return to party politics and greater political freedom.
Skeptics among opposition leaders and diplomats say it remains to be seen if the reforms being debated this week will be carried out. But the Sudanese National Congress met this week to approve a raft of constitutional reforms that Government leaders say will guarantee freedom of speech and assembly, as well as religion. 
 Meeting under an enormous tent behind a conference hall here in the capital, the 6,500 members of the congress, which is dominated by the governing party, debated and passed several constitutional proposals today that try to marry the principles of an Islamic state with the principles of free speech and party politics.
"We want to build a model state where you can act out fully what we profess as a Muslim and at the same time, because it is part of the religion, give everyone else their freedom," said Sayed al-Khateeb, the congress's foreign secretary. "We want to prove that you can be an Islamic state and still at the same time grant freedom to others that have different beliefs."
Political parties have been banned since 1989, when the National Islamic Front seized power in a military coup and toppled a democratically elected Government. Since then, the front's leaders have labored to create a state ruled according to the Koran's tenets, enforcing its vision of an Islamic revolution with a sophisticated security apparatus.
But a protracted civil war with Christian and animist rebels in the south, who are fighting for greater autonomy, racial equality and religious freedom, has drained the Government's resources and shackled the economy with low wages and skyrocketing prices.
For the Government, the war worsened two years ago when several northern opposition leaders in Khartoum went into exile and opened an eastern front, sending rebel cadres to attack the Sudan from Eritrea.
At the same time, most Western democracies, led by the United States, have cut off aid to the country and isolated the Government because of allegations that the Sudan harbors Islamic terrorists from all over the Middle East.
The pressure has taken its toll. Most people in Khartoum grumble openly about the Government's handling of the economy and the war, which consumes hundreds of lives and at least $1 million a day.
Against this backdrop, there have been some tentative signs that the Government is loosening its grip on the political debate. In the last year, for instance, more and more criticism has appeared in the eight newspapers published in the capital, and in one case the courts struck down a ban on an opposition newspaper.
The Government has also shown a new willingness to end the war through negotiations. In April 1997, Khartoum signed a peace agreement with several small rebel factions, promising for the first time that the south would be exempt from Islamic laws and that a referendum on independence for the southern provinces would be held.
And the Government has agreed to resume peace talks in Nairobi with the main rebel group, led by John Garang, who says he will accept nothing less than a secular system.
Still, the constitutional proposals being discussed contain several loopholes and caveats. For instance, while freedom of assembly is guaranteed, the Government could still crack down on opposition parties if the courts determined that they received money from other countries, advocated violent conflict or "go out of the bounds of religion."
Hassan al-Turabi, the Speaker of the Parliament and the ideological architect of the 1989 coup, said political parties in theory would be allowed to operate as soon as the new constitution was passed by Parliament in April. But he added that the National Islamic Front would fight hard to undercut the political appeal of other parties. "There will be a campaign against anything like that -- a political, moral, social, cultural campaign -- but no legal bar," he said. In a sense, the reforms are an invitation to northern opposition leaders like Sadeq al-Mahdi, a former Prime Minister, to give up the rebellion in the east and return to Sudanese politics as outsiders, officials of the governing party say.
Mr. Khateeb said, "Theoretically the makings of a multiparty system are here, but it depends on whether Sadeq al-Mahdi and others want to take up the challenge."
Some opposition leaders have dismissed the new constitution as a ruse intended to improve the Sudan's image abroad and entice Western democracies to resume the $800 million in foreign aid this country used to receive each year before the coup. No constitution, they argue, can be considered legitimate unless opposition leaders from the north and south take part in drafting it.
"This Government has established a reputation of saying one thing and doing the opposite," said Abel Alier, a former Vice President and a leading critic of the Government. "They can say there is freedom. But if they want to do it, they can't do it alone. They must do it with us."
Diplomats in Khartoum said the Government's motivation for passing the reforms was probably to pacify an unhappy public exhausted by repressive politics, economic hardship and war. Many Sudanese still support the two main opposition parties that were banned after the coup; the National Islamic Front attracted no more than 20 percent of the vote in the only all-party election in 1985.
"The people do want to see pluralism, and if the Government does not say these things, it shows they have no interest in the future," a diplomat said.

HEADLINE: Pratt & Whitney to Introduce New Engine

BYLINE: By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Hoping to regain its once-leading share of the global market for jet engines, Pratt & Whitney announced yesterday that it would introduce a radical new engine design that it said would be quieter, cleaner, more efficient and more reliable than anything currently offered by its competitors.
The new engine, which is expected to enter service in 2002, is designed to propel a single-aisle jetliner holding 120 to 180 passengers, like the Boeing 737 or the Airbus A320. If it performs as Pratt & Whitney promises, it will reduce emissions by 40 percent and widely surpass noise restrictions set to take effect at the end of the decade. 
 "This really kicks off the next round of the engine wars," said Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace industry analyst with BT Alex. Brown in New York.
But Mr. Demisch and others also said that Pratt & Whitney, which is a division of the Hartford-based United Technologies, still faced some daunting challenges, not least of which is the new design. For one thing, the new engine is not yet wedded to a specific airplane, a considerable gamble given the $350 million that the company has already spent on development.
The problem is that Boeing already has an exclusive agreement with CFM International, the joint venture between the General Electric Company and Snecma of France, to supply engines for the 737, the most popular plane in the world. And Pratt & Whitney is already involved in a joint venture with Rolls-Royce and others to supply engines for the A320.
Robert F. Leduc, a senior vice president at Pratt & Whitney, said that the new engine would not compete with its current offering for the A320 and that the company had a plane in mind for the new engine but had agreed with the manufacturer not to identify it.
Pratt & Whitney helped usher in the jet age and led the industry until it decided not to develop a new engine for the 737 in the early 1980's. That opened the door for CFM International, which now dominates the market for narrow-body jets, leaving Pratt & Whitney with less than 10 percent.
It has been estimated that narrow-body planes will constitute 60 to 65 percent of the jetliners to be sold over the next 19 years. "There is only one way to fix this problem," Mr. Leduc said. "We have to make a pre-emptive strike."
The new Pratt & Whitney design, which was first proposed by the company a decade ago, employs a gear box that enables the large turbofan, which creates most of a jet engine's thrust, to spin slowly while still letting the turbine that powers it to spin fast. The result is improved fuel economy and less noise.
Richard L. Kennedy, the spokesman for CFM International, said that Pratt & Whitney still had to prove that the design would work, while CFM continued to make its engines more reliable. "This doesn't come as a surprise," he said. "We have been making preparations for some time."

HEADLINE: Loan-Rate Discrimination Case Is Settled by Long Island Bank

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON 

DATELINE: ROSLYN, N.Y., Feb. 17

 BODY:
A Long Island bank has reached a $3 million settlement of allegations that some borrowers who are members of minority groups were charged inflated interest rates.
Under the agreement, more than 550 qualified borrowers will soon be receiving letters from the Roslyn Savings Bank notifying them that they are entitled to one-time payments of $5,000 each. Most of the affected borrowers are in Brooklyn and Queens, with smaller numbers in Nassau and Suffolk counties. 
 In addition to the payments, the bank and its subsidiary, Residential First Inc., have agreed to institute a training program for loan officers and tighten management oversight of all loan practices. The goal is to prevent a repeat of the unfair lending practice in which some borrowers were charged a slightly higher interest rate or additional points because of their race or national origin.
"This is an historic agreement that demonstrates New York's national leadership among states with regard to fair lending," said New York State's acting banking superintendent, Elizabeth McCaul.
"On average, if you were a minority borrower, you paid about $1,000 more for your mortgage during the life of your loan than you would if you were a nonminority borrower," Ms. McCaul said.
Noting that the Federal Department of Justice traditionally settles this type of fair-lending case, Ms. McCaul said the state was pleased with the steps to be taken by Roslyn Savings and its subsidiary. "Their efforts should serve as a model to other institutions throughout the state," she said.
The pattern of higher loan charges to minority-group members was first discovered by state banking examiners conducting their normal annual compliance examination at Roslyn and its subsidiary, said Michael Barry, a spokesman for the State Banking Department.
He said the agreement, which was announced today by Gov. George E. Pataki, covered qualified minority-group members who obtained their mortgage loans from Roslyn and its subsidiary between August 1995, when the bank purchased Residential First, and December 1997.
Mr. Barry said the basis for the violation was the Community Reinvestment Act, adopted by the state in 1979, which requires banks to help meet the credit needs of the low- and middle-income residents of the communities they serve. He said the affected borrowers would be receiving letters from the bank as early as April.
Both Roslyn Savings and its subsidiary, in agreeing to the settlement with the state, denied any violations of law. Roslyn insists that its own economic and statistical analyses demonstrated that the differences in mortgage charges were attributed to non-discriminatory factors.
Roslyn's chairman and chief executive, Joseph L. Mancino, said Roslyn entered into the settlement agreement in order to put the issue behind it.
"For more than 100 years Roslyn has maintained an unsurpassed record of financial commitment to supporting home ownership and the fullest and fairest service to every customer. I reaffirm that commitment," Mr. Mancino said in a statement released by the bank.

HEADLINE: Commercial Real Estate;
With New Freedom, Choosing a Power Supplier

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
As the date for partial deregulation of electrical power nears, managers of major properties in New York City appear divided over how to approach the impending freedom to choose a power supplier.
The choice appears to be twofold: build up an internal expertise in energy management in hopes of wringing out the maximum savings possible or turn the whole business over to a third party, an energy service company, on the theory that an outside expert can do a better job than internal managers with other things on their mind. 
 Since electrical power is the largest single cost of running commercial buildings, managers are eagerly awaiting deregulation, though some energy specialists say the savings, at least initially, may be quite modest.
Consolidated Edison will start accepting applications for what it calls its retail choice program on April 1 for the 500 megawatts, or 5 percent of the power it delivers in the city and northern suburbs, that is to be deregulated.
Those selected for the first phase will be able to choose their energy supplier, the way they now choose a long-distance telephone carrier, as of June 1. Larger blocks of power will be included in later phases, with complete deregulation scheduled by the end of 2001.
David Schirmacher, director of technical services at Compass Management and Leasing, which manages 10 million square feet of office and retail space in the city, said his company was taking a hands-on approach. "We think there is a lot of opportunity," he said. "The companies that will do well are the ones who do their research internally."
He said the company has a system that can track patterns of power use and predict future demand. Armed with that information, the company can shop for power, which will still arrive over Con Edison's wires. The supplier may even be Con Ed, because it is assumed that the power generating arm of the company will bid to protect its home market. Power bought from remote locations will also be subject to transmission fees to get it to New York.
But accurate forecasts are essential, because Con Ed can impose financial penalties if the actual power use is too much above or below the prediction. "It can be a dangerous game if you do not know what you are doing, and nobody has done it before," he said.
Charles Leonardi, general manager of Con Edison's retail choice program, agreed that it was the responsibility of the service companies or property managers to forecast power demand and schedule delivery at the proper time. Timing is important, because electricity must be used as it is generated and cannot be stored like oil or gas.
"The concern is about reliability," he said, with the company not wanting to deal with unexpected surges or drops in power. He said managers were allowed to err 5 percent above or 5 percent below their forecasts without charge.
One of the largest property managers in the area, Cushman & Wakefield, with a portfolio of 62 million square feet in the metropolitan region, has chosen to team up with a service company.
"It was a choice between building an internal staff or forming an alliance with someone who is in the market every day," said John Santora, the company's manager of asset services. Cushman & Wakefield chose Enersave of Manhattan.
He said that his company managed 200 million square feet of property nationwide and that electrical costs averaged $2.50 per square foot a year.
"That is a big annual bill and we are leaning on Enersave to get us first in line" for deregulation programs in California and Pennsylvania, he said.
Meg Carey, a vice president of Enersave, said earlier forecasts that deregulation might cut power costs 15 to 40 percent now appeared to be out of reach. "We are saying 5 to 15 percent, and 15 percent is on the high side," she said.
In addition to those savings, Ms. Carey said building managers could lower the cost of power by reducing consumption. The single biggest power drain in large buildings, she said, is for the motors that drive fans moving air internally. Installing variable-speed motors can trim that cost, she said.
Energy analysts caution that the cost of generating power is only a fraction of the final customer cost and say this will limit the savings from deregulation.
"Of the 16 cents a kilowatt you pay Con Ed for power, only about 4 cents is for generation," said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. He added that Con Ed buys much of the power it delivers to customers, rather than generating it on its own. "With deregulation, people will be trying to beat Con Ed at buying power," he said.
Nevertheless, some managers say a detailed knowledge of how properties operate will give them an advantage over third parties in buying power. "1515 Broadway has been 100 percent occupied for several years, but it is using more power now than in the past," Mr. Schirmacher of Compass Management said.
He noted that MTV, which is at 1515 Broadway at 45th Street, opened a live music studio there last year. "And we know that MTV is going to start another studio this summer," he said. "Someone who did not know that could run into trouble."

Taiwan Pushes for Role in Southeast Asia Rescue

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan, Feb. 14

 BODY:
Shunned internationally, ignored by the International Monetary Fund and technically at war with China, Taiwan has been given a rare opportunity to flex its financial muscles by the economic calamities in Southeast Asia.
Through a whirlwind of economic diplomacy, Taiwan's leaders and its business sector have planted the island's flag in Manila, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok, a flag festooned with promises of aid, investment and debt guarantees. 
 In trips shrouded in semi-secrecy, Prime Minister Vincent Siew, along with a top economic planner and about 50 business leaders, visited the four capitals in Southeast Asia last month to assess the region's needs. Because China insists that none of the countries -- the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand -- maintain diplomatic relations with Taiwan, Mr. Siew's discussions with other prime ministers and presidents were so low key that they often went unnoticed by the press.
Taiwan has $36 billion (United States) invested in the region, said the economic planner, Chiang Pin-kung, the chairman of Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, a Government department that has broad responsibility for economic policy making. "We are fortunate we don't have their problems," he said. "We are going to help them."
"We want to organize several holding companies to study and acquire companies listed on regional exchanges, hopefully including banks," Mr. Chiang continued. "We also want to increase imports from these countries and want to increase the opportunities for foreign workers from these nations."
Regional leaders are acutely aware that Taiwan is not merely a major investor in Southeast Asia but also possesses the financial strength to contribute to recovery efforts. Indeed, this week Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister, Anwar Ibrahim, the man who is responsible for economic policy, made a two-day visit to Taipei to explore the extent of possible Taiwan aid.
 The death of Sheu Yuan-dong, governor of Taiwan's central bank, in a plane crash on Monday night is not expected to have any immediate effect on Taiwan's strategy in the Asian crises.
But because Taiwan is barred from most international organizations, particularly the I.M.F., the extent and the character of its aid to Southeast Asia are somewhat restricted. A proposal by Taiwan last month to the 18-member Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum to establish an "Asia fund," a sort of free-standing loan entity for the region, was scuttled by the United States, which insisted that the I.M.F. maintain its lead role in the regional rescue plans.
Undeterred, Jeffrey L. S. Koo, the chairman and chief executive of Chinatrust Commercial Bank, Taiwan's largest private bank, said there were still broad areas in which both the Taiwan Government and the island's private sector intended to exert influence.
"I went around the region with the Prime Minister," Mr. Koo said, "and I found that the real problem with these countries was government, a lack of long-term policies, no continuity in decision-making. There were no regulations against overborrowing. They let the private sector borrow as much as possible."
"The I.M.F. or any single country cannot solve these problems," Mr. Koo continued in a late-evening interview in his office. "It needs the whole world to help. And the only way is to have the private sector's confidence restored in individual governments and economies."
As a member of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation's private sector Business Advisory Council, Mr. Koo said he would present the body with a proposal on debt guarantees and reducing corporate credit problems.
"The only way I can think of managing this is for these countries with problems to issue sovereign debt guaranteed by Apec countries," he explained. He said the Asian Development Bank in Manila, of which Taiwan is a member, "would be the locomotive" of this proposal.
Mr. Koo and the Taiwan Government envision two types of assistance: countries like Taiwan or Japan guaranteeing new sovereign debt issues of troubled countries, and regional banks in healthy economies like Taiwan's creating a convertible bond to provide loans to major companies facing credit squeezes. The bonds would ultimately be exchanged for equity in the companies.
"This was overwhelmingly supported by the heads of the four countries," Mr. Koo said, referring to Presidents Fidel Ramos of the Philippines and Suharto of Indonesia, and Prime Ministers Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia and Chuan Leekpai of Thailand, all of whom met with Taiwan's Prime Minister, Mr. Siew. "Taiwan," Mr. Koo said, "is in the position where we can do something for our neighboring friends, to salvage them. We want to help these troubled countries. And if it earns friendship, too, why not?"
And even though the United States remains cool to any plan to create an Asian-based rescue fund, Mr. Koo and other leading financiers are also planning a new investment fund for the region. "We will propose the emergency fund at the ministerial meeting in Mexico," he said, referring to the Apec meeting of finance ministers to be held in March. Although a participant in Apec, Taiwan has always had a lower-level role than other members. "The fund will invest in listed and unlisted companies," he said. "For listed companies we will invest in high technology."
Even as Taiwan's private sector is pushing its ideas at Apec, the Taiwan Government remains concerned that the United States has largely ignored its efforts. Paul C. H. Chiu, Taiwan's Finance Minister, urged that the Government be directly involved in regional recovery efforts.
"We would like to see what part we could play," he said in an interview at his office. He added that Taiwan wanted to be included in efforts by Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy United States Treasury Secretary, to organize a 21-country meeting to deal with Southeast Asia, "but we were not invited."
Despite Taiwan's immense foreign exchange reserves, now about $83 billion (United States), and a strong banking system, the Government's wielding of its financial clout more publicly than in the past has been attacked by Beijing as part of a plot to assert its independence.
China, which regards Taiwan as a renegade province, is intent on hemming in Taiwan's international stature. But the crises in Southeast Asia have created a dilemma for Beijing: It needs the region's economies to recover to remove strains on its own economy, and it recognizes that its nemesis Taiwan can do much to contribute to Southeast Asia's recovery.
"We have no objections to the countries concerned having nongovernmental economic and trade cooperation with Taiwan," Zhu Bangzhao, a spokesman for the Chinese Government, said at a recent news briefing. But, he declared, "We are strongly opposed to countries which have diplomatic relations with China carrying on any governmental activities with Taiwan."

HEADLINE: Textile Maker to Close South Carolina Mill

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ROCK HILL, S.C., Feb. 17

 BODY:
Springs Industries said today that it would close its textile mill in Rock Hill, dismiss about 480 workers and take a $23 million pretax charge.
The charge against first-quarter earnings will be about $1.14 a diluted share. The company said it expected an additional $8 million in equipment-moving and other expenses. 
 The 69-year-old plant in Rock Hill, which dyes and prints fabric, will probably be closed by midyear.
Springs, which is based in Fort Mill, S.C., said the business, which serves the home-sewing and crafts markets, continued to drag down results.
"We regret having to take this step, but continuing profit drains in this part of our business leave us no choice," Robert Moser, head of the company's specialty fabrics group, said in a statement.
The Rock Hill mill was built in 1929 by M. Lowenstein & Sons, one of many companies acquired by Springs in the last 20 years. At one time, 5,000 people worked at the plant.
Repeated efforts to sell the plant failed, and modernizing it is not economically feasible, the company said.
Springs, one of the United States' largest textile makers, said it would consolidate Rock Hill's production into more modern facilities. Springs will demolish the plant and move the 290 employees it is keeping.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
Another Record for Dow as Investors Dismiss the Negatives

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average continued its trek into record territory yesterday, posting its fifth consecutive high as an economic report pointed to slower economic growth while a new round of merger news heartened investors.
But in moving stocks higher, investors chose to focus on the positives and seemed to show little concern about either the impact that Asia's faltering economies could have on American corporate profits or about the possibility of a military strike in the Persian Gulf. 
 After trading as high as 8,446.32 -- its first time over 8,400 -- the Dow Jones industrial average closed at 8,398.50 yesterday, up 28.40 points, or three-tenths of 1 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.67 points, to 1,022.76, still shy of the record of 1,024.14 set on Thursday.
Stocks gained after the Federal Reserve reported that the rate of industrial production was unchanged in January, the first stagnation in the barometer since October 1996. The report suggested that the downdraft from Asia's financial crisis might be beginning to slow economic growth in the United States, reducing the chances that the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates.
Indeed, continued low interest rates have helped lift the Morgan Stanley 30-company index of cyclical stocks 7.75 percent this year, outpacing broader indexes like the Dow and the S.& P. 500.
But some market analysts are wary of the continued exuberant stock-buying spree by investors, pointing to the impact of Asia's financial crisis on American companies and to a possible attack on Iraq. In a sign of the Asian impact, Conagra, the American food giant, warned yesterday that second-half earnings would not meet expectations because of diminished Asian sales of poultry and meat.
"The market is expecting the best of all scenarios," said Thomas McManus, an independent investment strategist and publisher of The Strategy Connection, a market newsletter. "But the stock market will be taken aback if there is some type of military action without a resolution."
Still, crude oil prices fell yesterday, as oil traders sold on expectations that Iraq might cooperate with the United Nations on weapons inspections. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for March delivery fell 36 cents, to $15.66 a barrel, a four-year low.
Shares of oil companies were mixed. Exxon, Mobil, Amoco and Chevron were lower, but British Petroleum and Royal Dutch/Shell had modest gains.
Another boon for investors yesterday was news of several large deals. Computer Associates said it would proceed with a $108-a-share hostile bid for Computer Sciences, and the SPX Corporation, an auto parts maker, offered $48 a share for its rival Echlin.
Those deals and others lifted the total announced mergers and acquisitions through yesterday to more than $110 billion this year, topping the $107.4 billion in the corresponding period last year, when such transactions were at a record high, according to the Securities Data Company.
While merger news and the industrial production figures lifted the Dow and the S.& P. 500, smaller-company shares slumped. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.99 points, to 1,703.43. Leading the declines were Microsoft, Oracle, Applied Materials and 3Com. Despite yesterday's decline, the Nasdaq is still up 8.47 percent this year.
And after a 10-session rally, the Russell index of 2,000 smaller-company stocks slipped 1.10 points, to 453.19. That barometer is now 12.02 points away from its record of 465.21 reached on Oct. 13.
Some analysts saw the weakness in those small-stock indexes as another red flag for investors.
"I'm nervous because the rally has a narrow focus when there's so much money coming in," said Ron Reuss, chief economist at Piper Jaffray Inc. "It means we're getting kind of long in the tooth in this business expansion.
"I'm just surprised at how blase the market is about how great everything is," he added. "We've been running the economy in overdrive, but everybody's just yawning."
Asian governments may be stabilizing their currencies, he said, but "we haven't seen the resultant pain that's going to come from the economy as they try to pay down their bad loans."

Divided Loyalties Tugging at Cuba's Children

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

DATELINE: HAVANA

 BODY:
More than eight years after the cold war melted in the rubble of the Berlin wall, the children of Cuba continue to dive under desks in schools all over the island.
The drills serve to reinforce the most pervasive ideological lesson in Cuba's schools: that the United States is evil and that Cubans must always be ready to defend themselves. 
 That old message, fashioned after the Bay of Pigs invasion and the missile crisis in the early 1960's, is fed constantly to children here even when there are no tensions between the United States and any other country, as there are with Iraq now.
But it is an especially poignant message today when most families in Cuba have relatives in the United States and when, faced with enormous economic difficulties, the Cuban Government has allowed dollars to circulate freely on the island.
Nowadays, when children come home from the war drills, they slip on shoes bought with dollars sent by their grandparents in Miami or, in some cases, they work odd jobs catering to American tourists to earn dollars themselves.
In the mornings, William Jose Diaz, a 12-year-old Pioneer who is in eighth grade, swears to defend the Cuban flag against "los Americanos." In the evenings, he rushes to open the doors of tourists cars. He works outside Pain de Paris, an expensive bakery in Vedado. Most nights, he makes at least $2. When someone handed him $1 recently, the boy rushed home to buy bananas for dinner.
Years ago, it was easier for parents to keep their children blissfully unaware of both their true political feelings and the hardships they went through. But now, with the country's economy in chaos, even young children know that once they turn 7 they lose the right to buy milk.
They know that the Government issues only two school uniforms during elementary school -- one in kindergarten and the other in fifth grade. And that they are no longer able to buy toys because the Government did away with the yearly ritual of selling toys to children on the 26th of July, the anniversary of the beginning of Fidel Castro's armed uprising in 1953.
The contradictions of their young lives -- hearing one message in school and another, radically different, at home -- confuses some children. Their teachers want them to fight the Americans; their parents want to join them or, at least, to get some of their dollars.
"Mom," a 7-year-old girl recently asked her mother, "if William Clinton is so bad, why do we want to go live with him?"
Trusting their children and thinking them ready to absorb contrasting messages, many parents openly discuss their beliefs in front of them and even mock the revolutionary slogans and songs they bring home. But then they ask their children to keep it to themselves.
Some parents fear that their children will be ostracized if their teachers know that they live in a non-revolutionary home. Parents who make a living in what the Government considers illegal activities -- renting a room or selling cigars without a license -- also fear that, if their children talk, the Government may confiscate their goods, fine them or, in some cases, jail them.
The burden of living in two distinct realities affects some children in psychological and physical ways. Teresita, a 14-year-old ninth grader who lives in Old Havana, said she had never told her best friend that her parents desperately want to leave the country.
She has also never told anyone that, when the doors are locked, her mother rants against President Castro, blaming his Government for the scarcities in their home. Two months ago, Teresita began to shed the hairs of her arms and legs. The doctors told her that she lacked some essential vitamins in her diet; the mother thinks it is a result of stress.
A 52-year-old writer who insisted on being identified only by his first name, Angel, cannot stand a song praising the revolution that his 9-year-old daughter has been singing lately. He tells her to stop and his daughter obeys. The mother, worried about her daughter, intercedes.
"You want your children to be a full member of the family, to know how you feel about everything," said the mother, a member of the Communist Party who long ago grew disenchanted with the revolution but outside the home pretends to be as enthusiastic as ever. "But I worry sometimes how all this is going to affect her and how much contradiction she can really absorb in her young mind."
Yet the girl's mother, in a fit of anger, recently ripped to pieces her red Communist Party ID and threw it out the window. It was her daughter who ran three flights downstairs in a panic to retrieve the picture from the sidewalk so that no one would ever know what her mother had done.
While Angel helps his daughter with her homework, he systematically deconstructs everything she has been taught at school. She is now learning about Jose Marti, a 19th-century patriot who fought to free Cuba from Spanish colonialism. In Cuba today, Marti is also regarded as the intellectual precursor of the revolution. Angel tells his daughter that Marti would never have supported Mr. Castro's Government. The little girl giggles and rolls her eyes.
But there is very little that parents can do to shape their children's education. In a country with no private schools and compulsory education until ninth grade, parents are forced to send their children to state-run schools. They also have no say about the curriculum and, more and more these days, very little about their children's extracurricular activities.
Some parents try to exert control by taking their children late to school to avoid the morning ritual where students salute the flag, sing the national anthem and repeat revolutionary slogans. Others are turning to religion, hoping that lessons in catechism will open their children's minds to other points of view.
The Roman Catholic Church is taking full advantage of it. To make the shift easier for the children, it is incorporating some of the messages children hear in school into Sunday sermons. It is not unusual for priests now to somehow link Cuba's patriots to religion.
At a recent Mass here, Jaime Cardinal Ortega Alamino drew cheers from his mostly young listeners when he reminded them that the full name of Antonio Maceo, one of Cuba's most revered martyrs, was Antonio de la Caridad, a clear reference to Cuba's patriot saint, Our Lady of Charity.
Priests in some churches are also enticing children to attend Mass and catechism classes through a system of bonuses and rewards. Children receive bonuses for every Mass and catechism class they attend. Once a week, they can exchange the bonuses for gifts like gum, clothing, pencils and toys, all donated from churches abroad.
"They get things they want and need and we get an opportunity to show them the church's way," said the Rev. Jesus Maria Lusarreta, a priest at La Milagrosa, where more than 400 children attend catechism weekly.
During his five-day visit to Cuba in January, Pope John Paul II referred to Cuba's youth in two of the four Masses he held. At the first, in Santa Clara, some parents nodded in silence when the Pope said, "Parents must be acknowledged as the first and foremost educators of their children."
But it is difficult for parents to heed the Pope's words. Elementary school children go to school here from 8 A.M. to 4:20 P.M. On Saturdays, they often return to school for sports or political events. Sometimes they sleep over in the school to await so-called Domingos de Defensa, Sundays of Defense, days in which the children practice what it is like to be under attack and receive their lessons in a bunker.
Marta Perez Herrera, deputy director of Pepito Tey, an elementary school in Old Havana, said that, beginning in third grade, children are trained by members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces, who teach them everything from patriotic symbols to military moves. At a recent practice session in a park, uniformed men were training young children to march as one.
While the children marched, a 16-year-old girl in tight pink shorts stood in a corner a few blocks away eyeing foreigners. The girl, Yanel Noa, said she dropped out of school because she did not want to work in the fields, a requirement for all students in high school.
Had she continued in school, she would have become a dancer, she said. For now, she lives off the charity of a special friend: a 32-year-old married American man who often travels to Cuba loaded with cash.

Suharto Defies I.M.F., Removing Central Banker
President Suharto of Indonesia dismissed the head of his central bank, an act of defiance toward President Clinton and the I.M.F. that moved the country closer to possibly losing its economic rescue package.
The central bank chief had opposed a risky plan by Mr. Suharto to strengthen the Indonesian currency, saying it would subvert the I.M.F.-backed recovery plan. Page A1. 

Industrial Output Stalls
Industrial production was unchanged in January, the first time in 15 months that there was no expansion. The data suggested that the Asian financial crisis had started to impede United States economic growth. D2.
 
The uncertainty in Asia and the indication of slowing growth in the United States drove investors into Treasury securities, sending the yield on the 30-year bond down to 5.79 percent from 5.84. In the stock market, the Dow industrials hit a fifth consecutive record, 8,398.50 points, up 28.40. D8.

Unsinkable Marketers
Realizing that Leonardo DiCaprio action figures or Kate Winslet dolls might founder, marketers were slow to pick up on the success of the movie "Titanic" with merchandise tie-ins. But some companies, like J. Peterman, responded with imagination, selling replica items like clothing, life jackets, blueprints and even a 13-foot anchor. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. D7.

A judge ruled that Texas cattlemen do not have a case against Oprah Winfrey based on a state law that protects perishable food products from false and defamatory statements. But the case, stemming from comments on her talk show about mad cow disease, will be allowed to proceed as a simple business disparagement case. A10.

HEADLINE: Just Because the Grades Are Up, Are Princeton Students Smarter?

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD 

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Feb. 12

 BODY:
To their great relief, one of the first lessons anxious freshmen learn here at Princeton University is that it is virtually impossible to flunk a class.
Technically, the F still exists. And every year the dean asks 25 or so undergraduates out of 4,588 to leave temporarily because of bad grades. But in reality, as a report to the faculty and administration from the Dean of the College earlier this month showed, students who put in a so-so effort increasingly get good grades. The "gentleman's C" is not only alive and well but appears to be evolving into the "generous B" or even an A, with little distinction between the good and the excellent. 
 "For most people, if you are getting A's, it means you are doing good work," said Tucker Culbertson, 20, a Princeton junior majoring in English. "If you go to class and participate and write a semi-intelligible paper you get an A."
The report on grade inflation, which the administration hopes will cause some soul-searching among the faculty, comes somewhat belatedly to Princeton, several years after other selective institutions around the country tried to curtail soaring grade point averages. But if their experiences are any indication, undergraduates here can rest assured that their 3.4's are safe.
With great fanfare, Stanford University a few years ago brought back the F after a 20-year absence but professors have given out very few. (And they are not actually called F's; they are "not passed.") A's and B's still account for about 80 percent of the grades at Stanford.
Similarly, Columbia and Dartmouth have sought to place their grades in context by including on college transcripts information about a course, like the percentage of A's and enrollment, alongside a student's grade in a given class. But with little incentive to tighten grading, professors still give most students A's and B's.
Clifford Adelman, a senior research analyst with the United States Education Department who has studied 21,000 college transcripts from 3,000 colleges, said: "Elite schools always give higher grades. The faculty make the assumption that the kids are smarter."
Administrators are concerned about grade inflation because as grades rise, it becomes harder to determine how students compare with one another and whether colleges are maintaining high standards from year to year.
"I can pay the same price for a product that has declined in quality and that's inflation," Mr. Adelman said. "So in this situation, I can give you a B+ for a paper in 1998 and I can compare yours to a B+ given in 1988, and your paper is worse than that guy's. That's inflation."
At Princeton, the dean of the college, Nancy Weiss Malkiel, who chaired the grade inflation committee, said, "The real key is distinguishing the competent from the really excellent and we do not do a good enough job if all the grades are A's."
Opinions vary over the cause of grade inflation. Some say students these days are far more concerned about their marks, and more willing to complain about them, because the competition for graduate school admission has intensified. Others see the trend as an offshoot of consumerism in higher education in which students or their parents feel they are paying a lot of money to institutions and expect a more appreciative return. And a few offer the possibility that students are smarter nowadays.
Subscribing to the first theory is Benjamin Gum, a graduate student in Princeton's computer science department who serves as a teaching assistant. "Students really grub for grades," he said. "I have had many students come to my office to argue about 1 point -- usually when it was the difference between a 9 or a 10 -- and often when the impact on the final grade is minuscule. Perhaps this is a way of training T.A.'s to give 10 out of 10 if in doubt."
Subscribing to the second theory is Lee Mitchell, chairman of Princeton's English department, who recalled what happened when he gave a B- to the daughter of a prominent intellectual.
"She threw down the paper on my desk and said, 'This is not the Princeton way.' "
 
Student Explanation: We Do Good Work
And subscribing to the students-are-smarter theory are Princeton students themselves. The undergraduate student government has just finished a response for the dean and faculty that suggests students these days are better prepared than ever and therefore deserve the high grades.
The student government now stands in opposition to the arbitrary lowering of grades. "Princeton students are among the best in the world, and it's not at all clear that a contrived increase in the standard deviation of grades would prove meaningful or beneficial," said the group's president, David Ascher, a junior.
Students and faculty members say it is not that hard to earn at least a B and often a reasonable -- but not great -- effort brings an A.
Pinar Bilir, 19, a sophomore, said, "In one English class I got an A and all I did was write the paper and talk to the preceptor."
And a B, which normally is understood to be above average, does not appear so difficult to achieve either, though students accustomed to higher marks have been known to burst into tears at such a grade. "A B is what most anybody who finishes a course gets," said Alexander Nehamas, a philosophy professor and chairman of the Council of the Humanities, an interdisciplinary program.
Still, a few students say something should be done. "Professors want to give kids a sense of satisfaction," said Kevin A. Christal, 18, a freshman. "Most people come in with a 4.0 G.P.A. from high school so even a B is tough on some kids." To grade lightly, he added, "is good intent but it doesn't do anyone any favors."
Said Marc Rosen, a 21-year-old English major: "What happens when someone else gets an A who doesn't do as much work as you did? That can be very frustrating."
Wayne Becraft, executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers, said that when faculty members believe they have a large number of gifted students, as is increasingly the case today, "They don't want to limit the top honors to just a handful."
But Mr. Becraft also attributed higher marks to less passive parents and students, who don't hesitate to complain about disappointing grades. "If a student gets a poor grade the professor is likely to hear from them -- both," he said.
 
Did Grades Inflate Because of Vietnam?
Academics trace the improvement in grades to the Vietnam War, when a student with bad grades could be drafted, and many professors opposed to the war -- and questioning the validity of letter grades -- obliged.
"Grades started going up during the Vietnam War and never stopped," said Arthur Levine, president of the Teachers College at Columbia University. Dr. Levine conducted a study of a representative sample of grades at four-year colleges nationwide in 1994 that showed A-'s had risen from 7 percent of all grades in 1969 to 26 percent by the end of 1994. The C letter grade or lower, by contrast, dropped from 25 percent to 9 percent in the same period.
But Mr. Adelman of the Education Department said he believes concern over grade inflation may be inflated itself. He contends that the problem is limited primarily to selective colleges, which have always been liberal with A's and B's.
Mr. Adelman's study found that the percentage of A's and B's has actually dropped slightly, from 59 percent between 1972 and 1982 to 56 percent between 1982 and 1992. Assigning schools to catagories, Mr. Adelman found that the typical grade point average of graduating students at what he called elite schools is about 3.2, compared with 3.04 at those he classified as selective schools and 2.95 at state colleges.
The Princeton dean's report, a comprehensive review of undergraduates' grades over 24 years, showed 83 percent of the grades given between 1992 and 1997 fell between A+ and B-, compared with 69 percent between 1973 and 1977. More telling, said Dean Malkiel, is the drop in C+'s, which fell from 5.8 percent to 3.7 percent in the period, and C's, dropping from 6.1 percent to 3.6 percent.
The median G.P.A. for the class of 1997, the report said, was 3.42 compared with 3.08 for the class of 1973.
Those figures, the report said, suggest professors are giving average work a higher grade than deserved since there is "no compelling evidence" that "might lend credence to the view that Princeton undergraduates are somewhat abler, or better prepared, than they used to be."
"We're not struck by the fact that we're not giving D's and F's so much as by the fact that we give so many B-'s," said Dean Malkiel, who served as chairwoman of the committee that prepared the report. "I think the story as far as the committee is concerned is how compressed the grading scale is and how it is not getting fuller use."
Students fret that professors will crack down, but several faculty members interviewed said they do not expect to give more C's. Some professors said they worry that if grade point averages begin to slip, it will undermine students who are desperate to get into increasingly competitive graduate programs and reflect poorly on the university's reputation.
"We don't want to handicap our students," said Gerald Geison, a history professor.
In addition, no one wants to stand out as a tough grader; course enrollment could drop and student evaluations could prove unfavorable.
"Nobody really likes giving bad grades," said Professor Nehamas, tracing the feeling to "a real reluctance to give people negative information in society as a whole."
And, he said, he is not about to start: "Suppose I decide to give lower grades. Then I stand out, and you end up feeling like your penalizing your students."
Teaching assistants, who often do much of the grading in a class, say there is little pressure from the faculty to grade harshly. But there is subtle pressure from students accustomed to getting excellent grades in high school.
"When grading a paper, it's difficult," said a teaching assistant in the comparative literature department who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "A B- is a badge of shame. There is an expectation to get good grades, and you don't want to discourage people by giving a grade that is horrible."
Columbia University and Dartmouth College both adopted policies in recent years that attempt to put grades in context by providing additional information about them on college transcripts. Dartmouth, beginning with graduating seniors this year, will include the mean grade and class enrollment alongside a student's grade in a courses with 10 or more students.
But A's and B's remain a disproportionate share of grades, though some at Dartmouth believe rising mean S.A.T. scores for enrolled students partly explain why A's and A-'s have risen to 44 percent of grades from 37 percent 10 years ago and B-'s or below account for only 20 percent of grades given.
Columbia said it does not track the percentages of grades awarded to students.
Both Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania have talked about clamping down on grade inflation. "When you have classes with 50 percent of the students getting A's, that does seem a little silly," said Wendy Steiner, chairwoman of the English department at the University of Pennsylvania, who plans to hold a meeting with the faculty in her department on the subject next month.
The Harvard faculty studied the problem of grade inflation four years ago, and came up with some possible solutions but took no action on them.
Jeffrey Wolcowitz, associate dean for undergraduate education, said that the faculty became concerned when undergraduates' mean G.P.A.'s rose from between a B- and B in the mid-1960's to a little above a B+ now.
"That led to a great deal of discussion and a wide range of proposals," he continued. "The departments said, 'Yes, something should be done,' but there was no consensus, so nothing was done."

RISKING I.M.F. AID, SUHARTO DISMISSES CENTRAL BANKER

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
President Suharto of Indonesia defied President Clinton and the International Monetary Fund today by dismissing the head of his central bank, a step that increased the risk that the country would lose a rescue package worth roughly $40 billion.
It was the second time in the last few months that Mr. Suharto had pushed toward a confrontation with the I.M.F., and it resurrected the Asian economic crisis as a priority at the White House at a time when the Administration and I.M.F. officials thought that they had engineered the beginnings of a fragile stability. 
 The move also appeared to be an extraordinary gamble by Mr. Suharto that the I.M.F. would not abandon Indonesia, where the economy has deteriorated at an astonishing pace in recent weeks and riots over rising prices have grown more frequent. "It's a very dangerous moment we're approaching," a senior American official said. "There is the very real risk that everything could unravel."
United States officials maintain they are somewhat mystified by Mr. Suharto. They describe him as increasingly isolated and say he has disregarded the advice of his chief financial advisers, many of whom led Indonesia to its remarkably fast growth over the last decade. They speculate he is reluctant to dismantle his direct control over the economy, and some think he is angry that the I.M.F. has superimposed itself on an area of his authority.
Mr. Suharto's decision came after the governor of the Bank of Indonesia, Sudradjad Djiwandono, had argued that the President was about to subvert an economic recovery plan he reluctantly signed last month by proceeding with a risky experiment to strengthen the nation's currency, the rupiah.
The dismissal came three days after Mr. Clinton had called Mr. Suharto to reinforce a warning from the I.M.F. not to change the way the rupiah is valued.
Over the weekend, in what was interpreted in Washington as another act of defiance, all the major political parties in Indonesia endorsed as vice president -- and Mr. Suharto's presumed successor -- B. J. Habibie, one of the 76-year-old President's closest friends and the country's technology minister.
Mr. Habibie, who has taken a major financial stake in some of the Government's biggest projects, is regarded as personifying the kind of crony capitalism and state-directed spending Mr. Suharto had promised to end.
At the heart of the dispute is the question of who now has the authority to make the economic decisions for Indonesia, an archipelago with more than 200 million people: Mr. Suharto, whose 32 years in power have been marked by an aversion to sharing power, or the I.M.F., which requires countries tomake basic economic changes.
Mr. Suharto may be betting that the I.M.F. will not dare withdraw the aid package, senior American officials speculated as they prepared for yet another White House meeting tonight on how to handle the growing crisis with Indonesia.
Even with the I.M.F. rescue plan, there have been not been any real signs of renewed international confidence in Indonesia or in its currency, which has lost about 75 percent of its value since the Asian financial crises began last summer.
 The rupiah lost more value on Wednesday over the uncertainty created by the I.M.F. confrontation. In Asian dealings, the currency fell 2.5 percent, to 9,650 to the dollar. Unless Mr. Suharto abides by the terms of the agreement he signed, the I.M.F. would face a difficult choice. It could walk away, at the risk of watching the economy fall apart, or back down from its insistence thataid comes with conditions.
The time for that decision will be March 15, when the I.M.F. is to review its progress in Indonesia, and only four days after Mr. Suharto is supposed to be confirmed for another term of office.
"I don't think there would be any choice for the I.M.F. except to yank its whole plan," said C. Fred Bergsten, president of the Institute for International Economics here, who worked at length with Mr. Suharto several years ago in preparation for an annual meeting of Asian and Pacific region leaders that President Clinton began.
"Otherwise, you create a situation in which a country can agree to the I.M.F.'s conditions one day, then reverse field three weeks later," he said.
"If Indonesia got away with this, the I.M.F. could never credibly show up in another country," he added.
The last time Mr. Suharto clashed with the I.M.F. was in early January, when his proposed budget greatly exceeded the agency's limits and it threatened to withhold aid. After the rupiah plunged, Mr. Suharto agreed to stringent new I.M.F. measures to control spending and strengthen the banking system.
State Department officials say they are worried about an anti-American backlash in Indonesia, where it is widely assumed -- not entirely incorrectly -- that the United States is the secret hand operating behind the I.M.F.
The Pentagon has repeatedly expressed concerns about the strategic importance of Indonesia, both because of its control of shipping routes and because it is the world's most populous Muslim nation, which so far has kept good relations with the United States.
Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen visited Indonesia last month to reiterate that message, at the exact moment Mr. Suharto was agreeing to the I.M.F.'s new conditions.
The immediate argument with Indonesia is over an arcane financial technique.
Mr. Suharto has said he is planning to create what is known as a currency board, a system that would lock the rupiah's exchange rate to the dollar and theoretically restore some of its value. Such systems have been used successfully in Hong Kong and Argentina.
Under Mr. Suharto's plan, the rupiah's rate would be 5,000 to the dollar, about twice as strong as its current exchange rate. To maintain that rate, Indonesia would sell dollars, buy rupiah and raise interest rates as high as necessary.
The Indonesian leader presumably hopes that the strengthening of the rupiah will reduce the cost of imported goods that have set off riots throughout the country.
But he may still back away from the plan. Sustaining the exchange rate requires huge amounts of dollars and a strong banking system, which can withstand the sky-high interest rates. Indonesia has neither.
Its $20 billion in foreign exchange reserves, the United States Treasury believes, would be drained in days or weeks.
That was the position the former central bank chief argued with Mr. Suharto before he was dismissed.
Many American officials suspect that Mr. Suharto may have another, less obvious motive: to save his family fortune, estimated at $30 billion.
If the exchange rate is briefly but sharply improved, Mr. Suharto's family and friends would have a brief moment to convert their huge holdings into dollars and get them out of the country.

HEADLINE: $15 Million Gift Is Aimed at Keeping Newark Students in School

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: NEWARK, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Challenging students to aim for academic greatness, officials from the Ford Foundation and Lucent Technologies told ninth graders at the Malcolm X Shabazz High School here today that they would provide $15 million for a program intended to help them graduate and then go on to college.
The challenge came as the pairing of the technology company and the foundation announced the grant to the Newark public schools in an effort aimed at improving academic achievement by helping students as young as kindergarten age and following them all the way through college. At that point, the program will provide scholarship money to college-bound students who meet certain criteria. 
 The program will be one of the most ambitious of its kind, one that will invest a significant amount of private and foundation money to try to bring a new order of discipline and standards to an urban school system that has been losing too many of its students before they graduate.
The effort began when officials from Lucent were searching for a way to help public education and learned of the success of an eight-year-old program in Houston that had brought about dramatic improvements in achievement by making all of the adults involved in a child's life feel responsible for his or her academic success.
"It's not just about money," said Richard A. McGinn, the chief executive of Lucent, a technology company in Murray Hill, N.J. "The issue really is about responsibility. It's got to be a part of the fabric of every single day."
The Newark program, like the Houston program, will be called Project GRAD. It will focus on Shabazz High School and the seven elementary and junior high schools that feed into it. Beginning with this year's 375 freshmen, the program will provide $6,000 in college money for those students who meet a set of criteria: they must maintain a 2.5 grade point average and participate in two college-based summer academic sessions.
That would be a tall order for a school that draws students from some of Newark's most economically depressed neighborhoods and that graduates only about 60 percent of them.
Yesterday, at the assembly of ninth graders in the auditorium of Shabazz High School in South Newark, school officials and representatives from Ford and Lucent stressed that it was up to students to make the project a success.
"You have to sign on to be a part of this project," the principal, Mary Bennett, told students. "It is a special opportunity and it carries with it a responsibility."
The students responded with barks, after their mascot, the bulldog, and many of them made a gesture with both hands pushing up towards the sky, in what one student said means "push it on up."
The program will be put in place this spring, when training will begin for teachers from kindergarten to eighth grade, to learn new ways to teach children responsibility for their education. Also, high school students and their parents will be asked this week to sign contracts saying they will work together to accomplish the goals that would earn them scholarships.
Of the $15 million, Lucent and Ford are each providing $5 million and have pledged to raise the remaining amount. Company officials said the original $15 million should take the schools through the first five years of the program, which the partners said would continue indefinitely. The donation will go to a school district that, with an enrollment of 44,453, has an annual budget of $550 million.
The program was the brainchild of Henry Schacht, who recently retired as Lucent Technologies' chief executive officer. Mr. Schacht is also a trustee of the Ford Foundation and had been searching for a way to make a difference in the schools, said Deborah Stahl, the executive director of the Lucent Foundation, which is administering the grant.
Chris Pipho, a senior fellow at the Education Commission, a national nonprofit research group in Denver, commended the project for its scope, calling it "admirable and a significant amount of money."
 "My guess is that this would have an impact because you can literally follow through with students until after they graduate," he said.
 Steven Zwerling, senior director of the Ford Foundation, said the academic changes expected of the program are sweeping, ones that will be measured by tangible data, not just by anecdotal examples.
"Hard data will define the success of this program," Mr. Zwerling said. "If we can do that together, and I underline the word together, then we're doing something that starts to feel historic."
Beverly Hall, who was appointed Superintendent of the Newark schools after the state took over the troubled district in July 1995, said the achievements would come because everyone involved in educating a child would raise their expectations of what they could accomplish. Dr. Hall said she was convinced of the success of the Houston program after she and other Newark officials visited there a few months ago.
In Houston, the program has made measurable gains in achievement in the city's schools. For example, nearly 50 percent of one high school's graduates are now attending college, up from 10 percent four years ago, and the drop-out rate has declined to 3 percent from 20 percent.
Principal Bennett said her school graduates about 60 percent of its students. In the 1996-97 school year, according to Shirley Harris, the district's director of student services, Shabazz had 1,188 students. That year, a total of 70 students dropped out: 47 in the 9th grade, 9 in the 10th grade and 7 each in the 11th and 12th grades.
The drop-out rate for Shabazz High School is considered 5.9 percent of the total enrollment in the 1996-97 school year, she said, although that number hardly tells the story of how many children were lost to the system.
Several students at the high school said today that they were happy about the new opportunity at a school where many of their classmates do not go to college. A group of girls said their high school was known more for its athletic accomplishments and for the fashion savvy of its students.
"Mostly everybody says it's a school about fashion," said Rashanah Cromer, 14.
In Houston, the program has raised academic achievement at its feeder schools and increased the number of students who attend college. It began with one high school and has since been expanded to two more high schools, reaching a total of 17,000 students in 24 schools
For Izamara Gamez, a senior at Houston's Jefferson Davis High School, the program brought a new awareness of higher education. It also changed her family's expectations, she said. Her two older sisters became pregnant and did not finish school. She said no one really expected her to do any better.
"My father didn't think it was possible," she said. "I'm expected to go to college now. Hey, they're giving you the money."

Clinton Goes to Pentagon And Warns Iraq of Strikes
President Clinton, speaking at the Pentagon, said he would order air strikes against Iraq unless President Saddam Hussein stopped lying about outlawed weapons and impeding international controls. The speech, which was broadcast live by television networks, was intended to rally public support for possible action. A1 

Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations announced that he would go to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi officials this weekend in an effort to resolve the crisis. A8
 
In 1995, well after the end of the gulf war, military officials in Iraq struck a deal with Russian companies to build a plant that could have been used to produce biological weapons, American officials said. A8
 
Jordanian Anger at Israel
Jordanians reacted angrily to an Israeli commission's report that absolved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of responsibility in a bungled attempt in Amman to assassinate a Jordanian citizen who was a leader of the militant Islamic group Hamas. King Hussein has ordered that security cooperation between the two countries be suspended. A7
 
Sudan Promises Reforms
The Islamic party that has molded Sudan into a religious state is enacting a new constitution that officials maintain will allow a return to party politics and greater political freedom. But opposition leaders say it remains to be seen whether the reforms will be carried out. A3
 
An American Flag in Teheran
The American flag flew in Teheran without harm for the first time in two decades. A huge Stars and Stripes was among 17 flags hung from the ceiling of a sports stadium for an international wrestling competition. The event is the first time that American athletes have competed in Iran since the country's Islamic revolution in 1979. The five-member American team was cheered as members entered the stadium, bearing a flag provided by the hosts. A3
 
Sinn Fein Threatens Suit
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said that it would seek an order in an Irish court to block any move to expel it from the Northern Ireland peace talks. Officials presumed the suit would contend that the legislation establishing the peace talks was approved by the British Parliament, not the Irish body, and was therefore not applicable in Ireland, where the talks moved on Monday. Both British and Irish Governments said they wanted to suspend Sinn Fein because the I.R.A. was involved in the killings of two civilians last week. A5
 
Yeltsin Criticizes Budget
On the eve of a parliamentary vote on this year's budget, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia criticized Parliament, saying that it had to learn to live within its means. The International Monetary Fund is to make a decision soon on whether to disburse the latest installment of a three-year, $10.1 billion loan. A4

McKinney's First Accuser Testifies at Court-Martial
Brenda L. Hoster, the retired sergeant major whose accusations of sexual misconduct led to the court-martial of a man who was once the Army's top enlisted soldier, testified at the court-martial. Ms. Hoster described a night two years ago when she said that Sgt. Maj. Gene C. McKinney propositioned her in a Hawaii hotel, forcibly kissed her and reminded her that he could overpower her if he chose. A12
 
Cattlemen Lose a Round
A Federal judge ruled that a group of Texas beef producers could not use Texas' food-defamation statute as a basis for their lawsuit against Oprah Winfrey, though the trial could continue as a standard business-disparagement case. A10
 
A Spokesman Wishes He Hadn't
The White House press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said he regretted remarks he made in an interview with the Chicago Tribune about the possible explanations for a relationship between President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky. The grand jury heard from two witnesses who could provide information on the inner workings of the White House, Lewis C. Fox, a retired Secret Service officer, and Steve Goodin, a former Presidential assistant. A14
 
Dismissal of Jones Suit Sought
President Clinton's lawyers asked a Federal judge to throw out Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit. The lawyers asserted that even if Mr. Clinton did confront her with a crude sexual proposition nearly seven years ago, Ms. Jones had produced no evidence that he violated any laws. A14
 
Fund-Raising Indictment Ready
The Justice Department has prepared an indictment accusing a Democratic fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, with lying about her role in organizing a 1996 event at a Buddhist Temple in California attended by Vice President Al Gore, law-enforcement officials and Ms. Hsia's lawyer said. A12
 
Ex-Midshipman Convicted
A jury convicted Diane Zamora, a former Naval Academy midshipman, of capital murder, and a judge sentenced her to life in prison. A18
 
Tobacco Protection Opposed
Two leading authorities on public health, C. Everett Koop, the former Surgeon General, and David A. Kessler, the former Commissioner of Food and Drugs, said that they opposed giving tobacco companies protection against lawsuits. A19
 
Alcohol's Link to Breast Cancer
An analysis of six long-term studies conducted among a total of more than 300,000 women has confirmed that drinking alcohol can raise a woman's risk of developing breast cancer. But the increase in risk is very small for those who consume no more than one drink a day. A16

HEADLINE: STANDOFF WITH IRAQ;
In Clinton's Words: Containing the 'Predators of the 21st Century'

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 17

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's address yesterday to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Pentagon staff about the situation with Iraq:
Thank you very much, Mr. Vice President, for your remarks and your leadership. Thank you, Secretary Cohen, for the superb job you have done here at the Pentagon and on this most recent very difficult problem. Thank you, General Shelton, for being the right person at the right time. 
 Thank you, General Ralston, and the members of the joint chiefs, General Zinni, Secretary Albright, Secretary Slater, D.C.I.A. Tenet, Mr. Bowles, Mr. Berger, Senator Robb -- thank you for being here -- and Congressman Skelton. Thank you very much, and for your years of service to America and your passionate patriotism -- both of you. And to the members of our armed forces and others who work here to protect our national security.
I have just received a very fine briefing from our military leadership on the status of our forces in the Persian Gulf. Before I left the Pentagon, I wanted to talk to you and all those whom you represent -- the men and women of our military. You, your friends and your colleagues are on the front lines of this crisis in Iraq.
I want you, and I want the American people, to hear directly from me what is at stake for America in the Persian Gulf, what we are doing to protect the peace, the security, the freedom we cherish, why we have taken the position we have taken.
I was thinking as I sat up here on the platform, of the slogan that the First Lady gave me for her project on the millennium, which was, remembering the past and imagining the future.
Now, for that project, that means preserving the Star Spangled Banner and the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and it means making an unprecedented commitment to medical research and to get the best of the new technology. But that's not a bad slogan for us when we deal with more sober, more difficult, more dangerous matters.
Those who have questioned the United States in this moment, I would argue, are living only in the moment. They have neither remembered the past nor imagined the future.
So first, let's just take a step back and consider why meeting the threat posed by Saddam Hussein is important to our security in the new era we are entering.
This is a time of tremendous promise for America. The superpower confrontation has ended; on every continent democracy is securing for more and more people the basic freedoms we Americans have come to take for granted. Bit by bit the information age is chipping away at the barriers -- economic, political and social -- that once kept people locked in and freedom and prosperity locked out.
But for all our promise, all our opportunity, people in this room know very well that this is not a time free from peril, especially as a result of reckless acts of outlaw nations and an unholy axis of terrorists, drug traffickers and organized international criminals.
We have to defend our future from these predators of the 21st century. They feed on the free flow of information and technology. They actually take advantage of the freer movement of people, information and ideas.
And they will be all the more lethal if we allow them to build arsenals of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. We simply cannot allow that to happen.
There is no more clear example of this threat than Saddam Hussein's Iraq. His regime threatens the safety of his people, the stability of his region and the security of all the rest of us.
I want the American people to understand first the past -- how did this crisis come about?
And I want them to understand what we must do to protect the national interest, and indeed the interest of all freedom-loving people in the world.
Remember, as a condition of the cease-fire after the gulf war, the United Nations demanded -- not the United States, the United Nations -- demanded, and Saddam Hussein agreed to declare within 15 days -- this is way back in 1991 -- within 15 days his nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them, to make a total declaration. That's what he promised to do.
The United Nations set up a special commission of highly trained international experts called Unscom, to make sure that Iraq made good on that commitment. We had every good reason to insist that Iraq disarm. Saddam had built up a terrible arsenal, and he had used it -- not once, but many times, in a decade-long war with Iran, he used chemical weapons, against combatants, against civilians, against a foreign adversary, and even against his own people.
And during the gulf war, Saddam launched Scuds against Saudi Arabia, Israel and Bahrain.
Now, instead of playing by the very rules he agreed to at the end of the gulf war, Saddam has spent the better part of the past decade trying to cheat on this solemn commitment. Consider just some of the facts:
Iraq repeatedly made false declarations about the weapons that it had left in its possession after the gulf war. When Unscom would then uncover evidence that gave lie to those declarations, Iraq would simply amend the reports.
For example, Iraq revised its nuclear declarations four times within just 14 months and it has submitted six different biological warfare declarations, each of which has been rejected by Unscom.
In 1995, Hussein Kamal, Saddam's son-in-law, and the chief organizer of Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction program, defected to Jordan. He revealed that Iraq was continuing to conceal weapons and missiles and the capacity to build many more.
Then and only then did Iraq admit to developing numbers of weapons in significant quantities and weapon stocks. Previously, it had vehemently denied the very thing it just simply admitted once Saddam Hussein's son-in-law defected to Jordan and told the truth. Now listen to this: what did it admit?
It admitted, among other things, an offensive biological warfare capability -- notably 5,000 gallons of botulinum, which causes botulism; 2,000 gallons of anthrax; 25 biological-filled Scud warheads; and 157 aerial bombs.
And I might say -- Unscom inspectors believe that Iraq has actually greatly understated its production.
As if we needed further confirmation, you all know what happened to his son-in-law when he made the untimely decision to go back to Iraq.
Next, throughout this entire process, Iraqi agents have undermined and undercut Unscom. They've harassed the inspectors, lied to them, disabled monitoring cameras, literally spirited evidence out of the back doors of suspect facilities as inspectors walked through the front door. And our people were there observing it and had the pictures to prove it.
Despite Iraq's deceptions, Unscom has nevertheless done a remarkable job. Its inspectors -- the eyes and ears of the civilized world -- have uncovered and destroyed more weapons of mass destruction capacity than was destroyed during the gulf war.
This includes nearly 40,000 chemical weapons, more than 100,000 gallons of chemical weapons agents, 48 operational missiles, 30 warheads specifically fitted for chemical and biological weapons, and a massive biological weapons facility at Al Hakam equipped to produce anthrax and other deadly agents.
Over the past few months, as they have come closer and closer to rooting out Iraq's remaining nuclear capacity, Saddam has undertaken yet another gambit to thwart their ambitions.
By imposing debilitating conditions on the inspectors and declaring key sites which have still not been inspected off limits, including, I might add, one palace in Baghdad more than 2,600 acres large -- by comparison, when you hear all this business about presidential sites reflect our sovereignty, why do you want to come into a residence, the White House complex is 18 acres. So you'll have some feel for this.
One of these presidential sites is about the size of Washington, D.C. That's about -- how many acres did you tell me it was? -- 40,000 acres. We're not talking about a few rooms here with delicate personal matters involved.
It is obvious that there is an attempt here, based on the whole history of this operation since 1991, to protect whatever remains of his capacity to produce weapons of mass destruction, the missiles to deliver them, and the feed stocks necessary to produce them.
The Unscom inspectors believe that Iraq still has stockpiles of chemical and biological munitions, a small force of Scud-type missiles, and the capacity to restart quickly its production program and build many, many more weapons.
Now, against that background, let us remember the past here. It is against that background that we have repeatedly and unambiguously made clear our preference for a diplomatic solution.
The inspection system works. The inspection system has worked in the face of lies, stonewalling, obstacle after obstacle after obstacle. The people who have done that work deserve the thanks of civilized people throughout the world.
It has worked. That is all we want. And if we can find a diplomatic way to do what has to be done, to do what he promised to do at the end of the gulf war, to do what should have been done within 15 days -- within 15 days -- of the agreement at the end of the gulf war, if we can find a diplomatic way to do that, that is by far our preference.
But to be a genuine solution, and not simply one that glosses over the remaining problem, a diplomatic solution must include or meet a clear, immutable, reasonable, simple standard.
Iraq must agree and soon, to free, full, unfettered access to these sites anywhere in the country. There can be no dilution or diminishment of the integrity of the inspection system that Unscom has put in place.
Now those terms are nothing more or less than the essence of what he agreed to at the end of the gulf war. The Security Council, many times since, has reiterated this standard. If he accepts them, force will not be necessary. If he refuses or continues to evade his obligations through more tactics of delay and deception, he and he alone will be to blame for the consequences.
I ask all of you to remember the record here -- what he promised to do within 15 days of the end of the gulf war, what he repeatedly refused to do, what we found out in 1995, what the inspectors have done against all odds. We have no business agreeing to any resolution of this that does not include free, unfettered access to the remaining sites by people who have integrity and proven confidence in the inspection business. That should be our standard. That's what Unscom has done, and that's why I have been fighting for it so hard. And that's why the United States should insist upon it.
Now, let's imagine the future. What if he fails to comply, and we fail to act, or we take some ambiguous third route which gives him yet more opportunities to develop this program of weapons of mass destruction and continue to press for the release of the sanctions and continue to ignore the solemn commitments that he made?
Well, he will conclude that the international community has lost its will. He will then conclude that he can go right on and do more to rebuild an arsenal of devastating destruction.
And some day, some way, I guarantee you, he'll use the arsenal. And I think every one of you who's really worked on this for any length of time believes that, too.
Now we have spent several weeks building up our forces in the gulf and building a coalition of like-minded nations. Our force posture would not be possible without the support of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, the G.C.C. states and Turkey. Other friends and allies have agreed to provide forces, bases or logistical support, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Spain and Portugal, Denmark and the Netherlands, Hungary and Poland and the Czech Republic, Argentina, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand and our friends and neighbors in Canada.
That list is growing, not because anyone wants military action, but because there are people in this world who believe the United Nations resolutions should mean something, because they understand what Unscom has achieved, because they remember the past, and because they can imagine what the future will be depending on what we do now.
If Saddam rejects peace and we have to use force, our purpose is clear. We want to seriously diminish the threat posed by Iraq's weapons-of-mass-destruction program. We want to seriously reduce his capacity to threaten his neighbors.
I am quite confident, from the briefing I have just received from our military leaders, that we can achieve the objective and secure our vital strategic interests.
Let me be clear: A military operation cannot destroy all the weapons-of-mass-destruction capacity. But it can and will leave him significantly worse off than he is now in terms of the ability to threaten the world with these weapons or to attack his neighbors.
And he will know that the international community continues to have a will to act if and when he threatens again. Following any strike, we will carefully monitor Iraq's activities with all the means at our disposal. If he seeks to rebuild his weapons of mass destruction, we will be prepared to strike him again.
The economic sanctions will remain in place until Saddam complies fully with all U.N. resolutions.
Consider this -- already these sanctions have denied him $110 billion. Imagine how much stronger his armed forces would be today, how many more weapons-of-mass-destruction operations he would have hidden around the country if he had been able to spend even a small fraction of that amount for a military rebuilding.
We will continue to enforce a no-fly zone from the southern suburbs of Baghdad to the Kuwait border and in northern Iraq, making it more difficult for Iraq to walk over Kuwait again or threaten the Kurds in the north.
Now, let me say to all of you here -- as all of you know -- the weightiest decision any president ever has to make is to send our troops into harm's way. And force can never be the first answer. But sometimes, it's the only answer.
You are the best-prepared, best-equipped, best-trained fighting force in the world. And should it prove necessary for me to exercise the option of force, your commanders will do everything they can to protect the safety of all the men and women under their command.
No military action, however, is risk-free. I know that the people we may call upon in uniform are ready. The American people have to be ready as well.
Dealing with Saddam Hussein requires constant vigilance. We have seen that constant vigilance pays off. But it requires constant vigilance. Since the gulf war, we have pushed back every time Saddam has posed a threat.
When Baghdad plotted to assassinate former President Bush, we struck hard at Iraq's intelligence headquarters.
When Saddam threatened another invasion by amassing his troops in Kuwait along the Kuwaiti border in 1994, we immediately deployed our troops, our ships, our planes, and Saddam backed down.
When Saddam forcefully occupied Irbil in northern Iraq, we broadened our control over Iraq's skies by extending the no-fly zone.
But there is no better example, again I say, than the U.N. weapons inspection system itself. Yes, he has tried to thwart it in every conceivable way, but the discipline, determination, year-in-year-out effort of these weapons inspectors is doing the job. And we seek to finish the job. Let there be no doubt, we are prepared to act.
But Saddam Hussein could end this crisis tomorrow simply by letting the weapons inspectors complete their mission. He made a solemn commitment to the international community to do that and to give up his weapons of mass destruction a long time ago now. One way or the other, we are determined to see that he makes good on his own promise.
Saddam Hussein's Iraq reminds us of what we learned in the 20th century and warns us of what we must know about the 21st. In this century, we learned through harsh experience that the only answer to aggression and illegal behavior is firmness, determination, and -- when necessary -- action.
In the next century, the community of nations may see more and more the very kind of threat Iraq poses now -- a rogue state with weapons of mass destruction ready to use them or provide them to terrorists, drug traffickers or organized criminals who travel the world among us unnoticed.
If we fail to respond today, Saddam and all those who would follow in his footsteps will be emboldened tomorrow by the knowledge that they can act with impunity, even in the face of a clear message from the United Nations Security Council and clear evidence of a weapons of mass destruction program.
But if we act as one, we can safeguard our interests and send a clear message to every would-be tyrant and terrorist that the international community does have the wisdom and the will and the way to protect peace and security in a new era. That is the future I ask you all to imagine. That is the future I ask our allies to imagine.
If we look at the past and imagine that future, we will act as one together. And we still have, God willing, a chance to find a diplomatic resolution to this, and if not, God willing, the chance to do the right thing for our children and grandchildren.

Suffering for Saddam

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
It is very difficult to grasp the immensity of the suffering of the Iraqi people. They are led by a madman who lurches from one ruinous war to another, who builds palaces while his people die by the tens of thousands in hospitals that barely have electricity let alone adequate medicine and functioning equipment, who indulges his fetish for poison gases and other fiendish weapons even as depressed and hungry Iraqi children take to the streets to beg for a few pathetic mouthfuls of food.
The economic sanctions that were supposed to bring Saddam Hussein to his knees have helped put enormous numbers of Iraqi children in their graves, while Saddam remains as defiant as ever. So now we are going to bomb again. To what end is not at all clear. We are told that we cannot deliberately kill Saddam, that would be illegal. And hardly anyone believes the bombing will drive him from power. But there is a feeling in Washington that something must be done. So some Americans are going to have to perish, and many more Iraqis. And when the smoke clears Saddam will still be standing. Probably laughing. 
 This is madness on a grand scale.
Iraq over the last couple of decades has been a land of unending nightmares: the catastrophic eight-year war with Iran in which Saddam displayed his willingness to use poison gases both on his enemies and his own people; the invasion of Kuwait and the war that followed; the barbaric treatment of anyone who rose up in revolt against Saddam, including the wholesale slaughter of Kurds and Shiites; and the devastation wrought by seven years of U.N.-imposed economic sanctions.
Much of Iraq's infrastructure has been wrecked. Much of the drinking water is contaminated. The once-formidable middle class has collapsed into humiliating poverty. Food is rationed and infectious diseases are rampant.
A growing phenomenon in Iraq is the unwillingness of young children to play -- because they are ill, or weak from hunger, or because playing reminds them of playmates who have died.
A survey released last year by the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef) found that nearly a million Iraqi children under the age of 5 were chronically malnourished. The survey noted: "Chronic malnutrition (or stunting) results in poor physical child growth, often accompanied by substandard capacity for development and education. . . . Chronic malnutrition is difficult to reverse after the child reaches 2-3 years of age."
A Unicef official described the situation as "quite frightening in terms of the children's future health and future lives."
There is a logical breakdown here. No one with any credibility denies that Saddam Hussein is a menace -- a mass murderer and a perpetual threat to peace and stability. But the punishment for his sins is being visited tragically and overwhelmingly on the innocent. Our strategy for dealing with his defiance is to say that if he doesn't behave we will wreck more of his country and kill more of his people, as if he pays that any mind.
President Clinton said on Tuesday that if Saddam continued his refusal to permit full inspections by chemical and biological weapons experts, "He and he alone will be to blame for the consequences."
But it is not Saddam who will suffer the consequences. It will be Iraqi civilians and to some extent American G.I.'s. To continue the devastating economic sanctions and the periodic massive air attacks against Iraq without formulating an exit strategy for Saddam Hussein is to engage in an intolerable disregard for the value of human lives, Iraqi and American.
The stench of death, but never his own, is Saddam's constant companion. It won't be long before his next atrocity. But we haven't the will to force him from power, and so our response to his murderous challenge is incoherent. We will bomb and if necessary bomb again. And we will ignore the collateral damage, which is the euphemism for dead Iraqi civilians, including children. And since Saddam is most likely to remain in place, so will the sanctions, which means the wholesale suffering and dying will continue.
Humanitarian concerns? Be serious. This is war.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Move Lower as Report Shows Strength in Economy

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities were lower yesterday, driven higher early by data showing an absence of inflation but hurt by selling after a report on housing indicated that there was still plenty of strength in the economy.
The 30-year bond fell 9/16, to a price of 104 1/8, and its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 5.83 percent, from 5.79 percent on Tuesday. 
 "The name of the game is the same: solid economic growth with no inflationary pressures," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
That was demonstrated by yesterday's economic reports. Home building, whose ups and downs often precede changes in the broader economy, remained strong in January, with housing starts falling only a minuscule three-tenths of 1 percent from an upwardly revised December level, to an annual rate of 1.53 million units. That was the fifth consecutive month in which starts have exceeded the 1.5 million rate, probably lifted by the unseasonably warm winter weather in the Northeast.
There were no signs of inflation in yesterday's report on the Producer Price Index, which fell seven-tenths of 1 percent in January. Though the decline was led by food and energy prices, which are volatile, the lack of inflation was evident throughout the report, Mr. Fine said. "Indeed, inflation in the goods sector is hard to find, and the price-restraining impact from the Asian crisis has yet to be felt," he said.
After an initially favorable reaction to the drop in the Producer Price Index, bond prices fell as investors took profits after the gains of the last week.
"But if inflation news over the course of the year continues to be as calm and soothing as the recent trend, bond yields at the end of the year will be considerably lower than current levels, and that is indeed the most likely scenario," Mr. Fine said.
With little additional significant news expected this week, the bond market is gearing up for next week's calendar of events. Most important of these, said Kim Rupert, an economist with Standard & Poor's MMS, a market research and analysis firm in San Francisco, would be several public appearances by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan. These will include his testimony before the House Banking Committee on Tuesday and Wednesday. When Mr. Greenspan speaks, "the market typically hears what it wants to," Ms. Rupert said, "and could thus be subject to whipsaw conditions, given the number of opportunities he will have to get the message across."
Also coming up next week will be an infusion of new supply, as the Treasury sells $26 billion in new two- and five-year notes at auction. But Ms. Rupert said that the market "has managed to come through last week's quarterly refunding relatively unscathed, so supply in the form of 2's and 5's should not be much of a problem."
In when-issued trading yesterday, the two-year note set for sale next week was being offered at a price to yield 5.34 percent, and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.42 percent.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS: Did You Hear One About . . . ?;
Once a Laughingstock, Trabant's Maker Is Back

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: ZWICKAU, Germany

 BODY:
Of all the failures under Communist rule in East Germany, none received as much ridicule as the smoke-belching little box of a car known as the Trabant.
Even today, seven years after the last "Trabi" rolled off the assembly line, the jokes are still legion. Why didn't the Trabi move when the light turned green? Because its tire got stuck on a piece of gum. Why do deluxe Trabis have heated rear windows? To keep your hands warm as you push. How do you double a Trabi's value? Fill up the gas tank. 
 But now the jokes have a new twist. The company that made the Trabant, now called Sachsenring Automobiltechnik A.G., has been reborn and is booming. Instead of cars, it makes car parts -- and not for old Trabis.
The company's main customers include Volkswagen, Daimler-Benz and General Motors' Opel subsidiary. Far from being an East German laughingstock, it has become a model for entrepreneurial pluck that is all too rare in the smug world of German business in the west.
Sales have tripled since 1995, to $153 million, and the company is expected to report its first annual profit next month. Assembly lines are running nearly full tilt, with workers routinely putting in 45-hour weeks. In November, it was listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in a $27.5 million public offering.
The company is even edging back into the car business, having designed two concept cars of its own: a hybrid van powered by both gasoline and electricity and an updated version of a London-style taxi cab.
Sachsenring's rebirth is one example of a broader trend that runs through eastern Germany. Though the overall economy here is still a shambles, entrepreneurial start-ups are sprouting like grass between the cracks of a crumbling sidewalk.
The successes have little to do with the hundreds of billions of dollars the Bonn Government has pumped into the east since 1990, an effort that has been an epic failure.
More often than not, successful start-ups break away from western German approaches. They are abandoning the collective wage agreements that are a hallmark of the west's "social consensus" between employers and unions. They are demanding more flexibility from workers. They are experimenting with new kinds of businesses, from the shrewd to the kooky. And they are taking chances.
In the Saxon town of Mittelbach, Bruno Banani Underwear has carved out a name for itself in designer underwear. In Glashutte, the heir to a once-famous watch-making family has built a new company that sells super-luxury watches. In Leuna, a Bulgarian-born engineer named Kiril Mateew took over one tiny part of a dilapidated east German chemical complex. The new company, Leuna-Tenside, is now exporting specialty chemicals to Japan and the United States.
And here in Zwickau, two west German brothers, Ulf and Ernst-Wilhelm Rittinghaus, have created a de facto start-up from the wreckage of the Trabant.
The sprawling complex here was built in 1904 by August Horch, who founded Audi. After World War II, it became a Government factory that produced the hated Trabants.
The Rittinghaus brothers, whose father sold his family company for a substantial profit in the mid-1980's, were looking for investments when, in 1993, a friend encouraged them to look at Sachsenring.
"We flew our own plane and landed on a grassy field nearby the factory," Ulf Rittinghaus recalled. "It was very disturbing. Everything was so destroyed, and smoke was coming out everywhere. The workers looked down and depressed."
The company was in a state of virtual collapse. It had stopped making Trabants in 1991, because no one would buy them, and was getting by as a supplier of Trabi replacement parts and as a parts supplier for Volkswagen. But it was losing about $20 million a year, and its work force had plummeted to 300 from 12,500. One prospective buyer wanted to have the whole complex torn down -- a service provided free by the Government -- and sell the land.
The Rittinghaus brothers, along with a third partner, Jurgen Raab, decided there were better possibilities. "It is much easier to turn an automobile manufacturer into a parts supplier than the other way around," Ulf Rittinghaus said. At least some assembly lines were in working order. And the workers had tremendous experience and a surprising amount of technological expertise and ideas.
Unlike the bailouts of most other east German conglomerates, the project received relatively little in Government subsidies -- about $30 million over several years on a purchase price of roughly $10 million. By contrast, Dow Chemical will receive up to $7 billion to revamp three chemical complexes. Bremer-Vulkan, a shipbuilder taken over by west Germans, received more than $1 billion -- and still went broke amid accusations of fraud.
At Sachsenring, the new owners pumped in about $100 million -- their own money and assorted bank loans -- and kept their goals modest. Most of the old assembly lines were shut down or razed, but those that remained were spruced up to offer both quality and "just in time" delivery. They also rebuilt the research and development areas, looking for new products and technologies.
The company's most startling research project thus far has been the Uni-1, a concept van powered by a hybrid engine that can run on either battery power or gasoline -- or both. Nobody has yet bought the idea, and the company is not planning to build such cars itself. But the project has lifted the company's image and led to other opportunities.
The most visible offshoot is a big contract with Daimler-Benz's specialty truck subsidiary, NAV. Under a contract with NAV, Sachsenring developed a new design for truck cabs. The framework is a lightweight aluminum "space cage," which was originally designed for the Uni-1 and reduces the cab's weight by about 29 percent.
NAV placed an initial 10-year order for 1,200 cabs a year to be used in a line of garbage trucks. Now it expects to use the cabs in other vehicles and has said it may buy as many as 2,000 a year.
"Frankly, at the time, we took a rather high risk," recalled Sepp van Hullen, chief executive of NAV. Sachsenring had no history with trucks, few references and limited finances. It also had to compete against 22 other companies. But Daimler-Benz, which also makes Mercedes automobiles, liked the space cage and was impressed by Sachsenring's determination.
"They were by far the hungriest" company in the competition, Mr. Van Hullen added. "We became convinced that they would do their utmost to make sure our needs were properly met."
Meanwhile, the company worked to drum up more business from Volkswagen and others, promoting itself as a supplier that could switch its production at a moment's notice to meet customers' needs. Besides the truck cabs, Sachsenring builds steering assemblies for Opel and mechanical components for Mannesmann A.G., the engineering conglomerate.
The strategy dovetailed with a trend among car companies to rely more heavily on outside suppliers for design, and it also coincided with a surge in German auto exports that began last year. Sachsenring's sales climbed to $153 million in 1997 from about $40 million in 1994, and the number of employees has increased by about 280, to nearly 800.
"They have established new business and customer relationships," remarked Martin Ziegenbalg, an analyst for Dresdner Kleinwort Benson in Frankfurt, "and that is bearing fruit."
Sachsenring's future is far from assured, though. It is still dependent on Volkswagen for about half its sales, which means its business could drop sharply if the relationship sours. More broadly, the auto-parts industry is brutally competitive and fickle; car makers, under constant pressure from global competitors, are quick to shift suppliers if they can get a better price or better service.
Indeed, the company may soon not be able to keep up. In about a year, at its current growth rate, it will either have to slow its expansion or invest in new assembly lines.
The Rittinghaus brothers have had little patience for standard German labor practices. Workers earn about 10 percent less an hour and are expected to work overtime and on weekends when necessary -- a frightful notion at many west German companies. They do not receive overtime pay until they work more than 45 hours, instead of 39 in the west.
That is a huge departure. Ever since the countries were reunited in 1991, unions and Government officials have pushed hard to bring wages and benefits in the east up to the west's generous levels.
By some estimates, the average hourly wages and benefits paid in the east are higher than in the United States. But because productivity is still only about half that in the west, unemployment has soared.
Sachsenring has already set off alarm bells at I. G. Metall, the giant metalworkers' union. The last contract expired at the end of December, and the union is pushing the company to get its wages and benefits in line with industry norms.
But the Rittinghaus brothers bluntly refuse to have anything to do with the union -- and say their employees support them. "We decided there was no need for all this," Ernst-Wilhelm Rittinghaus said. "There is 20 percent unemployment here -- 40 percent if you count people in Government make-work programs. We will pay a lot, and we will invest. But the other side has to come. You have to trust us first, and you have to work much more than the normal amount."
At least for the moment, workers here seem to agree.
Henryk Nocon, a 30-year veteran who now welds subassemblies for Volkswagen, said workers' spirits had lifted enormously.
"Before, nobody had any desire to work -- there really wasn't any work to do," Mr. Nocon recalled.
Worker productivity has soared. Sick days, once a pervasive drag, are now lower than the average level in the west.
Not content with inheriting the Trabant factory, the Rittinghaus brothers acquired a west German company called Trasco, which specializes in armoring limousines. The $5 million purchase startled more than a few west Germans, because it marked one of the first times anyone could remember an "ossi" company buying up a "wessi."
It may not be the last time. "In the west, workers only talk about how much they have right now," Ulf Rittinghaus said. "In the east, people are more willing to talk about what they could have in the future."

Chart: "Trabants and Tribulations"
The East German company that made the car that was the butt of so many jokes -- the Trabant, above -- is making a comeback. This time the company is not manufacturing cars, but car parts. Here is a chronology of the company and the little car that couldn't.
 
1904 -- August Horch, later the founder of Audi, starts a company in Zwickau to make cars with five-horsepower, two-cylinder engines.
 
1932 -- Under mounting economic pressure, the company merges with parts of Audi and another manufacturer to form Auto-Union A.G., the world's second-largest car maker.
 
1945 -- The new East German Government takes over the company and renames it VEB Sachsenring Zwickau.
 
1952 -- Unable to buy or make enough steel, the company begins testing a plastic automobile body, a forerunner of the Trabant.
 
1968 -- The 500,000th Trabant is sold. Waiting times for delivery are as long as 12 years. The car's design undergoes virtually no further change for the next two decades.
 
1989 -- The Berlin Wall comes down. Thousands of Trabants and their owners clog the border area, heading west.
 
1990 -- East and West Germany are reunified. Demand for Trabants evaporates overnight as East Germans immediately begin buying modern cars.
 
1991 -- The last Trabant rolls off the assembly line on April 30. In all, three million Trabants were built over four decades. Sachsenring becomes a parts supplier for Volkswagen, but continues to lose money. Most assembly lines are shut down and the work force declines to less than 500 from 12,500.
 
1994 -- The company is acquired by Ulf and Ernst-Wilhelm Rittinghaus and Jurgen Raab. New technology and production rules lead to new customers and a revival of sales. Though the Trabant is no longer produced, it still enjoys a cult following. (pg. D1)
