HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up on Strong Demand After Stocks and Bonds Rally

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar surged yesterday after the Labor Department reported a surprisingly benign April inflation rate, setting off exuberant rallies in the stock and bond markets and strong demand for dollars.
"Today was all a dollar story," said Peter Wadkins, vice president at the New York branch of Standard Chartered Bank. "People want the dollar." 
 In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5280 German marks from 1.5200 marks on Thursday. The dollar also rose to 105.45 Japanese yen, from 104.72. The British pound fell to $1.5205 from $1.5231.
Many currency traders had been reluctant to buy or sell the dollar early yesterday pending the release of the April data on producer prices, regarded as an important sign of inflationary pressures.
Recent surges in American grain and fuel costs had raised fears that the United States economy was vulnerable to an acceleration of inflation, which would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive.
But the Labor Department said producer prices rose only four-tenths of 1 percent, smaller than the increase of five-tenths of 1 percent in March. The core inflation rate, which excludes food and energy prices, rose only one-tenth of 1 percent.
The bond market rallied sharply on that news as inflation anxieties dissipated, pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond back below 7 percent. The strength in bonds spilled over into stocks, creating a strong global demand for the dollars needed to purchase American financial assets.
"If equities are going down and the bond market is going down, foreign investors pull out; today we saw a reversal of that," Mr. Wadkins said.
Others attributed the dollar's strength partly to renewed speculation that interest rates in Germany would have to fall for the German economy to grow. Lower rates in Germany reduce demand for marks.
Comments by senior members of Germany's central bank earlier in the week had raised fears that the mark's gradual weakness had run its course, which caused a brief rally in marks and pushed the dollar down.
"Now the dollar has taken a bullish tone of its own," said Liz Goldberg, assistant vice president at the New York branch of Hypo Bank. "Its move down was on the mark's strength, and now the dollar has gotten back on track."

HEADLINE: Treasury Prices Pushed Higher As Inflation Index Is Barely Up

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
A Government report showing an absence of inflation pressures sent Treasury prices surging yesterday.
The bond market, nervous about recent reports that had pointed to a pickup in economic growth -- which could set the stage for a possible jump in inflation -- was considerably relieved yesterday after the Labor Department reported a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in producer prices in April, less than had been expected. The market was further cheered when the data showed that excluding the volatile categories of food and energy, prices edged up only one-tenth of 1 percent. 
 "The data indicate the recent surge in energy prices is not filtering through to general inflation," Marilyn Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities, said.
Market participants were also heartened by a retreat in the Commodity Research Bureau index of 17 commodity prices, which fell 1.2 point, to 259.08.
The weak producer-prices report raised market expectations that next week's consumer price numbers will also be favorable for the market, said Anthony Chan, chief economist for the Banc One Investment Advisers Corporation in Columbus, Ohio.
Still, he warned, "we should not forget that inflation is a lagging indicator, which means that we may have not reached a cease-fire in the inflation battle."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 12/32 , to 8814/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 6.92 percent, from 7.02 percent on Thursday. The price gains meant that bondholders made about $10.63 yesterday for every $1,000 invested in bonds.
The rally was fueled by short-covering as the weaker-than-expected producer-price data took those investors who had bet on a drop in bond prices by surprise.
As long as data continue to show such restraint in prices, the Federal Reserve is unlikely to take any action at its next monetary policy meeting, on May 21, analysts and traders said. The central bank has not adjusted interest rates since Jan. 31, when it lowered the Federal funds target rate on overnight loans between banks to 5.25 percent, from 5.50 percent.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said that with this week's supply of new issues behind the market, there was a temporary window for bonds to rise.
"If we do get a nice pop in the next several days, however, it would be wise for market players to avoid getting mesmerized with optimism," he said. "The Treasury market is a long way from being out of the woods, and any significant price appreciation from these levels should still be viewed as an excellent opportunity to liquidate long positions."
Mr. Chan of Banc One Investment Advisers said: "Right now I'm projecting much more moderate growth during the second half of this year, which means that we will not see a definite decline in inflation until the fourth quarter of 1996. At such time, we are likely to see renewed confidence in the credit markets paving the way toward 6 percent for a 30-year Treasury bond by year's end."

HEADLINE: 200 Vietnamese Refugees Flee Detention Camp in Hong Kong

BYLINE: By EDWARD A. GARGAN 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 10

 BODY:
About 200 Vietnamese boat people, facing a forced return home, fled a detention center in Hong Kong today after battering down the gates.
In the chaos of the uprising, other people in the detention camp set fire to barracks and the administration center and briefly held 15 camp officers hostage. The escapees, who included women and children, fled into the surrounding hills and towns in predawn darkness. 
 Firefighters battled blazes in the camp for most of the day, and guards and policemen in riot gear lobbed hundreds of tear-gas shells in an effort to retake control. By afternoon, a semblance of order had been restored and the hostages had been rescued from the camp, called Whitehead, where 8,600 Vietnamese were being held.
[But the violence flared again on Saturday, Reuters reported, as police officers tried to move 350 refugees from the Whitehead camp to another at High Island.]
More than 18,000 Vietnamese refugees, some of whom have been here for more than eight years, are being held in what amount to prison camps in Hong Kong, waiting to be returned to Vietnam. They are among 35,000 boat people who remain in Southeast Asia among the 800,000 who have fled to these countries from Vietnam, usually in small boats, since the fall of Saigon to the Communists in 1975.
Under an effort that began in 1989 to weed out economic migrants from political refugees, virtually all of the camp residents have been interviewed by the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and have been declared ineligible for asylum in the United States or elsewhere because they would not be expected to face political persecution upon returning home.
With the host countries anxious to close the camps, the United Nations agreed in March to end financing for them by June 30.
Over the years, Hong Kong has tried to persuade refugees to return to Vietnam. The Government says periodic efforts in the United States Congress to reopen the issue of asylum for Vietnamese in the camps have hampered that effort. The government of Hong Kong, a British crown colony, has said that it hopes to send the Vietnamese home before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule on July 1, 1997. China has insisted the Vietnamese be returned.
Recently, Vietnam agreed to cooperate with Hong Kong in speeding up the forced repatriation. But the Government's efforts were stymied last month when a high court ruled that some refugees were illegally detained. The Government quickly moved to close the loophole.
Chief Secretary Anson Chan, the highest ranking civil servant in the territory, described the violence as "deplorable" but said it would not change Government plans. "We remain as determined as ever to repatriate all Vietnamese migrants," she said. "This incident has not lessened our resolve."
As the day wore on, squads of police fanned out across the New Territories, Hong Kong's piece of the Chinese mainland, erecting road blocks, searching housing developments and combing the hills around the camp looking for the escapees.
Local television showed plainclothes police capturing young Vietnamese men as they ran through the grounds of an apartment complex in Shatin, one of Hong Kong's many residential towns. Roadblocks and car searches created traffic jams.
Although the police estimated that 200 Vietnamese may have managed to escape, the torching of the camp's administration building made it difficult to determine the precise number. Sixteen other buildings were destroyed by fire and more than 40 cars were burned.
"We don't know exactly how many have escaped," said Toby Emmet, a senior police officer.
Meanwhile, in clouds of tear gas, the police and guards battled Vietnamese at the camp. Wielding clubs and makeshift spears, the Vietnamese fought squads of officers wearing helmets and protective vests and carrying plastic shields. Inmates clambered onto the roof of the camp's residential barracks.
Balls of fire boiled from camp buildings as helicopters wheeled overhead dropping water from huge tanks. About 22 police, firefighters and camp officers were injured, although none seriously, the police said. No information was provided on any Vietnamese injuries.
By late afternoon, the police said, 61 Vietnamese had been recaptured. They said that some of the camp's residents were being moved to other detention centers because the barracks had burned.
"This is certainly something much more ferocious than anything we've seen before," said Selina Chow, a member of Hong Kong's legislature, in an interview with a local radio station.
A spokesman for China's de facto embassy here, Zhang Junsheng, attributed the breakout and upheaval to British mismanagement.
"I hope in the brief 400 or more days left, the British Government can act responsibly," Mr. Zhang said on local television. "This has created great pressure economically and spiritually since" the Vietnamese "keep on making trouble."

HEADLINE: Attack and Parry: Taxes Set Political Pace

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Energized by Senator Bob Dole's proposal to repeal the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, Republicans are looking for ways to inject tax cuts often into the 1996 campaign. And President Clinton's announcement this week that he would support the temporary repeal of a tax he pushed through Congress illustrates his Administration's determination to keep Mr. Clinton from looking like a big-taxing liberal.
The gasoline-tax repeal has still not been passed by the Senate, and, at best, it would not put much money into consumers' pockets. But for months, despite the failure of Steve Forbes to make headway with one type of tax-cut plan, a flat tax, many Republicans have believed that taxes remain one of the most potent ways to erode Mr. Clinton's lead. 
 "Don't forget what propelled Ronald Reagan into the Presidency: hate communism, cut taxes," said Tom Korologos, a former member of the Nixon and Ford Administrations who is a longtime friend of Mr. Dole. "Boy, that worked so well. This is the Republican mantra: cut taxes, cut taxes."
Mr. Dole's campaign has begun to draft an economic program that will include what a senior aide calls a "pro-growth tax agenda." The ideas under consideration range from targeted tax relief, like a proposal by Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri to allow a deduction for the employees' share of the Social Security tax, all the way to a dramatic Reagan-style, across-the-board reduction of 15 percent in income tax rates.
A Dole adviser said that the across-the-board tax reduction "would be politically attractive because it's the kind of thing that can attract attention and seize the imagination" but that it was only one of several options being examined.
Mr. Clinton and his aides have long expected a Republican assault on the tax front and stand ready to showcase the various proposals for tax relief in the President's budget proposal, which amount to as much as $117 billion in reductions over seven years. The proposals are largely focused on lower taxes for middle-class families with children and for spending on education.
Since autumn, White House officials say, Administration analysts have examined flat taxes, tax credits and tax-simplification ideas so the Administration can discredit or co-opt Republican proposals or come up with proposals of its own, as needed.
As a test case of how the Democrats will respond to tax-cut proposals, the gasoline-tax repeal is probably atypical in many ways. It would last only a short time, through January, and the revenue loss -- estimated at $2.9 billion -- would be small enough for Mr. Dole to explain away and small enough to make it easy for the President to decide to support it.
But the fact that Mr. Clinton was willing to turn around on a tax that was part of his 1993 deficit-reduction program showed the lengths to which the Administration is prepared to go to fight back.
From the moment Mr. Dole wrote to Mr. Clinton on April 26 to propose the gasoline-tax decrease, Mr. Clinton's aides calculated that the measure could be unstoppable.
"We knew when he sprang it that it would be very hard for a lot of the D's on the Hill to resist it," said Michael D. McCurry, the White House press secretary, referring to his fellow Democrats.
Still, the White House initially did what it could to throw up obstacles. Mr. Clinton's campaign aides faxed out copies of newspaper articles showing that Mr. Dole had spoken in favor of gasoline-tax increases totaling about 10 cents in the past decade. Leon E. Panetta, the White House chief of staff, said any tax repeal proposal should be considered only within the context of broader talks about a balanced budget.
And Mr. Clinton used the power of his office to try to counter Mr. Dole, by announcing that he was selling 12 billion barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to stem increases in pump prices.
But the President's aides say they were careful to avoid ruling out the possibility that Mr. Clinton would sign a gasoline-tax repeal because they believed that it would be political folly for him to risk being tagged as a big-taxing Democrat.
At midweek, with the Senate tied into knots by partisan maneuvering over rival pocketbook proposals, Mr. Clinton said he would sign both the gasoline-tax repeal and a minimum-wage increase that Democrats want, if they came to him in separate bills.
"I am offering a way to break the logjam," he said. "I will be glad to sign both bills. They ought to vote them out clean." He and his aides left vague what would happen if only the gasoline-tax repeal came to the President, so as not to undercut the Senate Democrats' efforts to get the minimum-wage increase passed, White House officials said.
Mr. Clinton failed to break the logjam, but his aides said he had done what he wanted politically: making sure that he could share the credit for any gasoline-tax cut for consumers and also speaking out for the minimum-wage increase, which is popular with labor, an important Democratic constituency.
He may also have taken some of the sting out of a television spot, unveiled by the Republicans later Wednesday, that urged Mr. Clinton to support Mr. Dole's gasoline-tax repeal. Its most potent footage features Mr. Clinton at a Houston fund-raising event last fall as he backed away from the tax increases in the 1993 deficit-reduction plan. "People in this room are still mad at me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much,' says Mr. Clinton, filmed in black and white. "It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too much, too."
The White House is now waiting to see whether Mr. Dole, as one Administration official disparagingly put it, will unveil more "summer-rental tax cuts." The official did not rule out the possibility that if that happened, Mr. Clinton would simply co-opt the proposal and go along once again.
But the political dynamics will change if Mr. Dole follows the suggestion of conservative Republican economists like Bruce R. Bartlett, a former member of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, who believes that the Senator should propose a reduction of 15 percent in income tax rates, phased in across several years.
Mr. Bartlett argues that this is more politically appealing than the approach of the Contract with America, with its call for tax credits for children and adoption and reducing the capital-gains tax.
"The taxpayer, in my view, is the core constituent of the Republican Party, and this is the way to appeal to all taxpayers," Mr. Bartlett said.
The plan would also involve big money. Mr. Bartlett estimates that when fully phased in, perhaps over three years, it would reduce Federal tax revenues by $87 billion.
Mr. Clinton's advisers contend that such a proposal would run so counter to Mr. Dole's longtime image as a deficit-cutter that they would be able to wield it against him.
"They have to face a fundamental question: Are they giving up on a balanced budget?" Mr. McCurry said. "We would make that very clear. If the Republican Party no longer worships on the altar of the balanced budget, that's news."
But other Democrats worry that a campaign sharply focused on tax cuts could hurt them. "If the debate transforms into a debate about who wants to cut taxes," one Democratic strategist said, "we're in a much weaker position."

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls for Volunteers In Communities and Schools

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

DATELINE: STATE COLLEGE, Pa., May 10

 BODY:
President Clinton summoned Americans to increased community service today, calling for one million volunteers to join neighborhood anti-crime patrols and promising a $500 Federal grant to match local contributions toward a national-service college scholarship at each of the nation's 20,000 high schools.
In a commencement speech to graduate students at Pennsylvania State University here -- the first of three he is to deliver this spring -- Mr. Clinton returned to many of the themes of his 1992 campaign, emphasizing the shared responsibilities of citizens and Government to address problems like crime, welfare and the breakdown of civil society. 
 "No matter what you do or how busy you are, there is always a way to serve a larger community," Mr. Clinton said. "The story of your generation should be the story of how we restore broken lives and shattered promises through citizen service."
Continuing a pattern he has established in recent months, Mr. Clinton called for only modest new Government spending and legislation. The college scholarship program would cost $10 million a year, for example. It could be financed with the existing budget of the Americorps national-service program, even if Congress does not approve Mr. Clinton's request to increase the program's budget by $143 million, to $546 million, for the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1.
The bulk of Mr. Clinton's effort would rely on volunteers, like the Bush Administration's "1,000 Points of Light" program that Democrats derided as inadequate. The President challenged every middle school and high school in the nation to include community service and to encourage students to participate.
If just 50 more people joined each of the 20,000 neighborhood watch groups in the nation, Mr. Clinton said, "we would have a citizen force of a million new community activists" to work with the 100,000 police officers who the 1994 crime bill is putting to work.
And while repeating his desire for a comprehensive welfare overhaul, Mr. Clinton said: "It doesn't matter what laws we pass or what programs we put in place. We cannot reverse decades of patterns of behavior unless more of our citizens are willing to take some responsibility for other people's kids in the near term."
White House officials have said the President will use his annual series of commencement speeches in this election year to lay out his philosophy for the coming campaign, and Mr. Clinton is apparently taking some pains with them. His press secretary, Michael D. McCurry, said the President stayed up until about 4:30 this morning rewriting today's speech after his state dinner for President Constantinos Stephanopoulos of Greece.
In a speech at the Coast Guard Academy on May 22, Mr. Clinton is to sketch his view of foreign policy in a post-cold-war world, and at Princeton University on June 4, he is to outline his views of economic growth and security. Aides said Mr. Clinton may also add a fourth speech, to a high school or community college in California, to address family issues.
The President has ample family connections to Penn State. His late father-in-law, Hugh E. Rodham, who grew up in Scranton, attended on a football scholarship, lettered in the sport and graduated in 1935. Mr. Clinton's brother-in-law, Hugh E. Rodham Jr., now a talk-show host on a radio station in Florida, earned a bachelor's degree in health and physical education in 1972.
Mr. Clinton said his father-in-law had to play offense and defense on the football team. "That's sort of what I do," Mr. Clinton said, as the audience in the new Bryce Jordan Center basketball arena laughed. "So I understand that."

HEADLINE: Miracle on Madison Avenue

 BODY:
The New York Public Library system springs from a remarkable history of public-private collaboration. Founded through private philanthropy in 1895 but sustained primarily through public funds, the library has nourished generations of New York City residents and ushered countless immigrants into the mainstream. Andrew Carnegie underwrote the branch system in 1901 "to help those who will help themselves."
That same collaborative spirit has now brought forth the Science, Industry and Business Library, which opened recently to great and deserved fanfare. It is a tribute to the city, the state and especially the philanthropic community. 
 The new library, which occupies the former B. Altman department store on Madison Avenue between 34th and 35th Streets, is an electronic marvel. Its intended beneficiaries are the general public and the business community, especially smaller businesses that do not have their own research facilities.
The building is equipped with about 250 computers and 500 workstations outfitted for visiting laptops. The staff members offer free training in the use of the library's resources, including data bases. New Yorkers are already showing up in droves to sample these services. The collection of materials -- books, CD's, videos and so on -- consolidates science, technology, mathematics and business works that were once housed elsewhere.
The new outlet is the library's biggest single undertaking since the main Research Library, at Fifth Avenue and 42d Street, was built. The New York Public Library's president, Paul LeClerc, calls it the largest public-private collaboration of its kind -- not just in New York but anywhere. The project cost $100 million, of which only a fourth came from public sources -- the city, the state (through the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey), the Federal Small Business Administration and the Economic Development Administration. The library financed about $25 million through long-term bonds. The remaining $50 million will come from private donors; $35 million is already pledged and $15 million has yet to be raised.
The financial plan that brought this project to life was conceived by the library's chairman emeritus, Marshall Rose, who has long been a fierce advocate of the library. It was Mr. Rose who oversaw the rehabilitation of the main Research Library, as well as the redevelopment project that turned Bryant Park behind it from a scruffy, forbidding patch of land into a bright and bustling cultural square in midtown.
Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers will pass through the Science, Industry and Business Library's doors on the way to the future. The miracle on Madison Avenue marks a new era for both New York City and its singular library system.

HEADLINE: Wheat Harvest Will Be Poor, U.S. Forecasts

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 10

 BODY:
The nation's wheat harvest this summer will be the worst since 1978, the Department of Agriculture reported today, but it raised its estimates of overseas wheat production and of American corn plantings. The mixed forecast reinforced hopes among economists that the nation could avoid a sharp rise in food prices.
Agriculture experts warned, though, that the new forecasts represented only a marginal improvement in the precarious conditions that in recent days have sent corn and wheat prices to record highs. Grain reserves are still expected to fall to their lowest levels in nearly five decades this summer before the new crops of winter wheat are harvested. Nor are the forecast harvests anywhere near the size needed to rebuild reserves substantially at a time when worldwide demand for grain is strong. 
 "It took us more than a year to get into this situation, and it will take more than a year to get out," said Robert Kohlmeyer, a grain trade specialist at World Perspectives, a Washington-based consulting firm.
The Agriculture Department said that the winter wheat crop, which is the major source of bread flour and accounts for 70 percent of the nation's wheat, would total 1.36 billion bushels when it is harvested this summer, down 12 percent from last year.
The worst drought in a century in Kansas and neighboring wheat-growing regions is expected to force formers to abandon millions of acres of wheat. In other areas, meager wheat stands are being torn up to plant other crops.
But the Agriculture Department said that yields in the surviving fields should be slightly better than many analysts had projected, barring more bad weather. And it sharply increased its estimates of overseas wheat production and supplies. Now, all eyes are on Canada and the Dakotas to see whether current wet and snowy conditions abate in time for spring wheat to be planted by mid-June. If all goes well, wheat prices that recently topped $6 a bushel could tumble.
The department's report today was based on the first actual field survey this spring of the winter wheat crop. The figures indicated that the department believed that the disease and weather problems besetting farmers might not have caused quite as much damage as widely feared.
Overall food prices, which can be volatile from month to month, actually fell at wholesale in April despite record high grain prices, according to a Labor Department report today. Grain itself represents less than 10 percent of the price consumers pay for bread, cereal and most other common grain-based food.
But high grain prices are forcing livestock and poultry farmers to cut production. For the next few months, higher slaughter rates are likely to drive down meat prices at the supermarket and offset increases in pasta and other grain products. That could keep food inflation in general less than 3 percent, according to most economists' projections.
By next year, though, when less meat is available, beef is expected to lead overall food prices higher. Many economists are expecting an increase of 4 percent to 5 percent in 1997.
Traders responded to today's reports and news of rain in the drought-stricken Great Plains by bidding grain and soybean prices down on futures exchanges here and in Kansas City and Minneapolis. Wheat for July delivery fell 17 cents, to $5.80, at the Chicago Board of Trade. July corn fell 1.25 cents, to $4.8225 a bushel, and July soybeans were off 5.25 cents, to $8.14 a bushel. But the December contract for next year's corn crop rose more than 4 cents, to $3.45, on worries that supplies would remain too tight for comfort.
Some wheat land being torn up will be replanted in corn, which contributed to the Agriculture Department's rise in projected corn acreage to 81 million acres from 79.9 million. Assuming normal weather and traditional growth in yields from better hybrids, the Agriculture Department projects a 27 percent increase in the corn crop to 9.4 billion bushels. Between 50 and 60 percent of the crop has been planted, but farmers in the eastern Corn Belt, especially southern Illinois, Indiana and Ohio, are falling behind their ideal schedule because of heavy rains.
"We've probably seen the market high, but it's really important that we get some good weather," said William Biederman, vice president in charge of research at Allendale Inc., a grain brokerage and consulting firm in Crystal Lake, Ill.

HEADLINE: Price Report Eases Worries On Inflation

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
A Government report today eased worries that a reinvigorated economy was pushing up inflation.
Producer prices -- the prices that manufacturers and farmers charge for the products they sell to retailers, distributors or other buyers -- rose four-tenths of 1 percent, slightly less than expected, the Labor Department said. But when the highly publicized -- and presumably temporary -- surge in the price of energy was excluded, there was no inflation at all last month. 
 Today's report "provides little support for the latest inflation scare," said Cheryl Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company. Indeed, the underlying trend of finished-goods prices through the first four months of the year is even lower than in the comparable 1995 period, she noted, a remarkable performance in the sixth year of an economic expansion.
The bond and stock markets responded enthusiastically to the better-than-expected price data. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose more than a point, pushing its yield -- an important benchmark for mortgages and other interest rates -- down to 6.92 percent from 7.02 percent. [Page 40.]
Lower interest rates also encouraged stock buyers, as the Dow Jones industrial average surged 43 points. [Page 35.]
"The inflation fears we've had in the past six or seven weeks is basically inflation that should pass," said Peter Cardillo, research director at Westfalia Investments in New York. "The news is very positive."
Analysts were also heartened by continued subdued price pressure at earlier stages of production. Prices of intermediate goods other than energy and food fell two-tenths of 1 percent, the seventh consecutive decline, while core raw materials dropped for the 10th consecutive month.
As in March, energy was the dominant factor in a hefty overall rise in the Producer Price Index for finished goods -- those ready for sale to the final business user or consumer. The energy category climbed 2.8 percent, with home heating up 13.3 percent and gasoline up 6.1 percent. Gasoline was up an even steeper 6.7 percent before allowing for improved quality resulting from environmental mandates in California.
Before seasonal adjustment, the price of gasoline soared 13.4 percent on top of a 9.1 percent March surge, the Government report showed.
But in contrast to March, when food rose along with energy, food prices fell three-tenths of 1 percent last month as the fresh and dry vegetables category tumbled 15.5 percent, about a third of its March leap.
Not counting food and energy, finished goods prices edged up one-tenth of 1 percent last month, the third consecutive increase of that size and a tenth of a point below expectations. Core prices are now 1.8 percent above those of April 1995, a year-to-year comparison that was 2.7 percent as recently as November.
"Take out the yeast of rising energy prices and overall producer prices are flat as a pancake," said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors, a trade group whose members buy goods from producers and then resell them.
Though higher energy prices are actually paid, analysts tend to disregard them because they often swing sharply from month to month and thereby obscure the underlying price trend. Moreover, depending on circumstances, big increases in energy and other commodities can dissipate without much affecting the production chain.
Currently, the run-up in energy "is showing no sign of fanning out into other costs," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns in Toronto. Companies that seek to raise prices often find themselves unable to do so in the face of fierce competition and buyer resistance, economists say.
Goods at the intermediate stage of production, like plywood, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in April because of increases for energy, foods and feeds and construction materials. But nondurables used in manufacturing fell eight-tenths of 1 percent for the second consecutive month.
Durables used in factories were unchanged as the price of copper declined 3.3 percent after rising 5.3 percent in March while the index for hot-rolled steel bars, plates and structural shapes rose 1.2 percent to nearly erase the March fall.
Among crude goods, which jumped 5.3 percent, the most since October 1990, energy items jumped 10.9 percent. Foods and feeds rose 4 percent, reflecting a 13.8 percent surge in corn prices partly offset by a 23.2 percent drop for fresh vegetables other than potatoes. This vegetable category had soared 69.6 percent in March.

HEADLINE: Producer Price Data Spur Rise In Stocks, With Dow Up 43

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Stocks powered ahead yesterday as a benign wholesale inflation report soothed investors' jangled nerves and sparked a buying spree, capping one of the most volatile trading weeks in recent memory.
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 43.00 points, to 5,518.14. For the week, it rose 40.11 points. 
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered declines, 1,712 to 717, on active trading of more than 428 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.94 points to a new closing high of 1,202.76, surpassing the record of 1,199.66 set on May 1.
The New York Stock Exchange's curbs on index-arbitrage orders went into place 13 minutes after the opening and remained in place until the close.
"We had earth-shattering news on producer prices, so there's plenty of ammunition to move the market on a short basis," said Don Hays, a market strategist at Wheat First Securities, referring to the Producer Price Index's smaller-than-expected rise of four-tenths of 1 percent in April; it was up just one-tenth of 1 percent when the volatile food and energy components were excluded.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 6.65 points, to 652.09. The American Stock Exchange index gained 4.12 points, to 591.33.
In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained slightly more than a full point, cutting its yield, which moves in the opposite direction of its price, to 6.92 percent, from 7.02 percent on Thursday.
James Pizzo, a senior investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company, said: "Short term, the stock market looks like it has the momentum to push higher with the help of bonds. But longer-term concerns have not been alleviated -- inflationary pressures from energy, food and perhaps wages."
Technology stocks were bolstered by a stronger-than-expected earnings report from Cisco Systems, which rose 2 1/4 a share, to 55. Among other gainers in the group, Hewlett-Packard climbed 4 1/4, to 108 1/2, and Computer Associates rose 3 3/8, to 74 7/8.
Bally Entertainment, which has risen 16 percent in three days, climbed 1 1/2 yesterday, to 23 5/8, on rumors the casino company could be a takeover target of Ronald Perelman, the New York financier.
Gold stocks, often a barometer of inflation worries, fell. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for June delivery ended $2.50 lower at $392.00 an ounce.
Among gold shares, Newmont Gold fell 3/4, to 59 3/8; Newmont Mining was off 1/8, to 58 1/2, and Battle Mountain Gold slipped 1/4, to 8 3/4.
Interest-rate-sensitive issues strengthened. Citicorp rose 2 3/8, to 79; Merrill Lynch rose 1 1/2, to 60 7/8; Aetna Life and Casualty added 2, to 69 3/4, and Fannie Mae was up 1 1/2, to 31 5/8.
Several initial public offerings drew strong buying. Excel Communications, a provider of long-distance telecommunications services, topped the New York exchange's most-active list and jumped 14 3/8 from its initial price to 29 3/8.
Designer Holdings, a marketer of Calvin Klein jeans, was the second-most-active issue on the Big Board and soared 7, to 25. Vincam Group, a professional employer organization, rose 11 1/2, to 26 1/2.

HEADLINE: Tread Carefully With China, Business Leaders Urge U.S.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va., May 10

 BODY:
Chief executives in major industries, meeting here with Government officials today, expressed concern that the Administration's looming showdown with China over piracy of American music, movies and software could set off a wider trade conflict and endanger their ability to compete in the vast Chinese market.
Some members of the Business Council, an organization of chief executives from 100 of the country's largest companies, warned the Administration that it should not allow differences with Beijing over specific issues, including piracy, human rights and the spread of nuclear technology, to poison the broader political and economic relationships between the United States and China. 
 "If sanctions are invoked, we very much hope that the governments will work to keep them from escalating into other areas of industry," said Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the chairman of Du Pont and of the Business Council, said today.
In a meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, one of two meetings a year the organization has with Government officials, the executives also said they were pleased that both President Clinton and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the presumed Republican Presidential nominee, have said they support renewal of China's most-favored-nation trade status.
Most American companies see China as one of their most promising foreign markets, but fear that political confrontation will give competitors, especially those from Europe and Japan, a big advantage.
The Administration said this week that it would decide next week whether to impose about $2 billion in sanctions on specific Chinese exports to the United States, to punish China over the piracy issue. China responded Thursday with threats to retaliate with even bigger sanctions.
But, Mr. Rubin said to reporters after the meeting, the Administration "cannot offer an absolute assurance" that sanctions over the piracy issue will not lead to an escalating dispute with China.
The Administration did, however, decide today not to impose sanctions on China for its sale to Pakistan of nuclear equipment.
Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State, who is a consultant on international affairs to a number of leading corporations, told the business leaders that the Administration was wielding the threat of sanctions too clumsily, and that the threat should only be invoked after quieter, more consistent diplomatic efforts had failed.
"I would not have thought that the public threat of sanctions is the way to deal with China," said Mr. Kissinger, who recently returned from a trip to China.
In interviews, some executives said imposing sanctions on China could backfire by making it harder for the United States to use its economic influence to bring about commercial, social and political change in China.
China agreed last year under pressure from the Administration to crack down on the production and sale of counterfeit American videotapes, compact disks and other products. But the Administration said China had made little progress.
The Administration, said Lawrence A. Bossidy, chief executive of Allied Signal, should be "insistent but not militant" on the piracy issue and should look for other, less confrontational solutions.
Alexander J. Trotman, the chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, said the Administration should undertake high-level negotiations with China to find a solution on piracy that would avert sanctions. Ford has extensive investments in China.
"As a guy at the sharp end of this, I'm convinced that confrontational means are unlikely to be constructive from our point of view," Mr. Trotman said.
"I'd start with a plea for non-confrontational discussions between senior people in the governments, and to avoid taking potshots," he said. "It's important for all sorts of reasons way beyond trade for the U.S. and China to have a harmonious relationship."
Some executives said the Administration had little choice but to be tough with China.
"We have to hold up the threat of sanctions and walk to the precipice again and again," said John H. Bryan, the chief executive of the Sara Lee Corporation and an important fund raiser in the business community for Mr. Clinton.

HEADLINE: Medallion Limits Stem From the 30's

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Desperate cabbies competing for fares. Reckless driving. Traffic congestion. Run-down taxis.
A description of New York City's taxi industry in 1996? Yes. And no. 
 Try 1937, when many of the conditions that prevail today prompted the Board of Aldermen, a forerunner of the City Council, to pass the Haas ordinance. That law limited the number of hack licenses -- medallions -- that made it legal for taxis to transport passengers who hailed them on the street.
The number of licensed cabs was roughly 16,900 when the ordinance, named for Lew I. Haas, a Manhattan Democrat, was passed by a 50 to 4 vote on March 1, 1937. But the total dwindled to 11,787 in the anemic economy of the late Depression, when some owners let their hack licenses expire rather than pay the $10 renewal fee. The number remained at 11,787 until yesterday, when the city sold 133 more.
The history leading to that change twines through the gloom of the Great Depression, conjures memories of the jaunty Mayor James J. Walker and the feisty Mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia, emerges into the sunshine of the post-World War II boom and charts a feverish rise in the value of medallions from $10 to upward of $200,000 today.
Bruce Schaller, the director of policy development at the Taxi and Limousine Commission from 1986 to 1994, said that after the stock market crash in 1929, job seekers swelled the ranks of New York City cabdrivers to 30,000 in 1930.
Where too many passengers may be chasing too few cabs today, Mr. Schaller said, too many cabs were chasing too few passengers in the Depression years. Some cabbies worked 20-hour days and were unable to make an adequate living.
"What happens in that situation is that there is not the revenue to support a decent quality of taxi service," said Mr. Schaller, who is now the manager of market research for the Transit Authority. "The Haas Act tried to remedy that problem by stopping the issuance of any new vehicle licenses."
Before the legislation, drivers desperate to win fares cut rates, taxi fleets competed fiercely, and tensions sometimes led to violence.
Edward G. Rogoff, a professor of management at Baruch College who has studied the taxi industry, said a commission appointed by Mayor Walker to study the taxi system in 1930 "recommended that the city sell a single franchise to one company to operate all the cabs."
But around that time, Mayor Walker came under investigation for corruption. "And it turns out he had accepted a gift of securities from the Parmelee Company, which had the largest fleet in New York," Professor Rogoff said.
Mr. Walker resigned in 1932 and went to Europe. In 1934, Mayor LaGuardia appointed a committee that agreed on diversity of ownership.
The Haas ordinance mandated that 60 percent of the medallions go to fleets that could rent them to drivers. In 1947, when post-World War II prosperity increased demand for cabs, medallions began to assume value.
Noting the similarity between the problems that prompted passage of the Haas Act and those of the taxi industry today, Mr. Schaller said: "Whether you have a limit on the number of medallions or you don't, you can still have problems in the quality of service. The overall objective is to make sure the money goes in the right places, the quality of vehicles and the quality of drivers."

HEADLINE: For 53, the Promise of America Fits on a Taxicab

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
Fifty-three cab drivers, nearly all of them born half a world away, became entrepreneurs yesterday as the winning bidders in New York City's first sale of new taxi medallions since the Depression.
To the drivers, the prize was nothing short of the essential promise of America: the chance to go into business for themselves after years of working for others. The successful bidders, most from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, had offered up to $177,000 for the right to work mind-numbing, 70-hour weeks for an income that rarely exceeds $30,000 a year. 
 "It's not really a good job, but it's hard to find another job, and this way, I work for me," said Jaswant Singh Ghota, 34, who has had to lease medallions in his five and a half years as a cabbie. "This is independence."
With a sealed bid of $175,114.99, Mr. Ghota, who grew up in India and lives in the Baychester section of the Bronx, became the proud owner of a newly minted medallion. His brother, Balbir Singh, of Flushing, Queens, bid a dollar more and also left a winner.
The two men, both husbands and fathers, stood side by side, beaming, after the bids were opened, and admitted to no doubts about the wisdom of going deeply into debt and spending a sum that could fetch a house.
"This is much better than a house," Mr. Ghota said. "You can't get money from a house."
Even skeptics conceded that the Taxi and Limousine Commission's sale of 53 medallions for owner-drivers, and 80 others for taxi fleets, was a success. Doubters had said that expanding the number of yellow cabs in the city for the first time since 1937 would lower the value of the medallions. But the sale drew slightly higher prices than the commission had predicted, earning $26 million for the city.
The city plans to hold two more sales over the next two years, selling a total of 400 new medallions. Last year, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed the sale of new medallions after a 59-year lull, it was to help close a city budget deficit. But many drivers saw deeper meaning in what happened yesterday.
"This is America," said Farooq Bhatti, president of the Pak Brothers Yellow Cab Drivers Union, which had many members among the bidders. "This is why you come here. This is how you get ahead.
"It was wonderful to see these foreign-born people bidding and winning, becoming their own bosses."
Over the last two decades, as the price of medallions has soared, many medallion buyers have treated them more as investments to be sold at a profit than as keys to the taxi business. But not the drivers at yesterday's commission meeting.
"I want to drive for me," said Noor Biswas, 39, a native of Bangladesh who bid $175,000. "I buy so I can drive. No more work for someone else."
Taxi drivers who do not own medallions keep the fares they collect, but they have daunting expenses -- at least $30,000 a year for a full-time driver, and often more than $40,000. Most drivers must lease medallions by the day or week, and they must pay for gasoline.
Fleets generally provide drivers both a medallion and a car, but many medallion owners make the drivers supply the cars and insure them. The most recent taxi commission study of the industry's economics, conducted in 1993, before the latest fare increase, estimated that the average driver netted $19,000 a year.
Drivers who buy medallions almost always take out 10-year loans from taxi industry credit unions, using the medallion as collateral. For the lenders, who often double as medallion brokers, there is little risk. They lend money at interest rates of 8.5 percent or more, and if a driver defaults on a loan, they can seize the medallion and sell it to a hungry market, usually at a substantial profit.
Owner-drivers can lease their cabs and medallions to other drivers for up to 12 hours of each day, but many do not because of the wear it puts on the cars.
Trading whispers in a Babel of languages, the drivers at yesterday's session listened as their sealed bids were opened, occasionally oohing in unison at a spectacularly high one or laughing at a low one. As the range of bids slowly became clear, body language told the story, the winners grinning, the losers deflating in their seats and those on the cusp straining forward to see a list of bids projected on a screen.
Sotheby's it was not. The setting was a drab, hot, low-ceilinged city hearing room in SoHo. But it had all the heart-pumping drama of a high-priced art auction.
"I can't breathe," one driver said to another, as the session dragged on and. "I just want to know."
The bidders reflected an industry that has been remade several times by successive waves of immigration, and where five out of six new hack licenses are issued to people born in other countries. All but a handful of those vying for the independent medallions were men from the Indian subcontinent, a group that represents about 40 percent of today's drivers, and has, more than any other recent immigrant group, begun to buy taxis and medallions.
The group bidding for fleet medallions was far more diverse. Many were Russians, a group that in the 1980's played much the same role that Indians do now, and that is now well-represented among medallion owners and brokers. Others were Hispanic, Asian or native New Yorkers, and many were women. And a number of medallions were bought by native New Yorkers who are also long-time fleet owners, like Malcolm Rattner, who paid $2.1 million for 10 medallions.
"When I started in this business, sweeping floors in the 1960's, the garage owner told me the medallion is gold," Mr. Rattner said. "Today shows it's still gold."
The medallion, the metal shield affixed to a yellow cab's hood, represents the right, granted by the city, to operate a taxi. Medallions were available from the city during the Depression for $10 each, but the city stopped issuing them in 1937, freezing the supply at 11,787.
Over the years, those medallions were actively bought and sold, and the steady income taxi driving offered, combined with the relative scarcity of medallions, helped drive the price steeply upward.
One type of medallion can only be owned by a licensed cab driver, who must be the primary driver of the car bearing the shield, while the other kind, often called a fleet medallion, can be owned by anyone, from an investor to a large fleet to a small taxi garage.
A year ago, the going rate for an owner-driver medallion was about $170,000, while the fleet medallions went for about $210,000. But since then, the taxi commission chairman, Christopher R. Lynn, has roiled the industry by tying a fare increase to a requirement that all new cabs be new cars, rather than used cars converted for taxi service, and imposing the first mandatory retirement ages for cabs.
Critics, particularly medallion investors and the taxi industry credit unions they borrow from, predicted that the combination of new medallions and Mr. Lynn's policies would cause the medallion market to crash. Such talk helped drive prices down a bit in recent months, which led the commission to set minimum bids for the new medallions -- $165,000 for owner-drivers and $196,000 for fleets.
But yesterday, the winning bids ranged from $172,000 to $177,000 for the independents, and $210,000 to $221,000 for the fleets, exceeding the market's historic highs.
One of the leading skeptics about the sale was Robert A. Familant, chief executive officer of Progressive Credit Union, a taxi industry lender that he said has $120 million in outstanding loans for medallions.
"We were wrong," Mr. Familant said after the bids were opened yesterday. "This was a successful sale. The industry is strong."

HEADLINE: Hard Landing at Denver;
The S.E.C. Questions Disclosure on Airport Bonds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
Way back in 1990, when the Denver International Airport was, literally, just a hole in the ground, local officials were warned by their own consultants that the baggage system that would later shred luggage and become a national joke was horribly flawed and might not work.
But this critical information was never conveyed to the investors who, in 1991 and 1992, ponied up some $3.5 billion for airport bonds. And now the Securities and Exchange Commission, in one of the most controversial cases in municipal finance, wants to hold some feet to the fire. 
 So, after reviewing more than 120,000 documents, the S.E.C. has sent formal notices of potential enforcement actions to a number of Wall Street firms that underwrote the bonds -- Goldman, Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Artemis Capital Group -- and to two top construction companies, Morrison Knudsen Engineering and Greiner Inc. On notice as well is the City and County of Denver, whose officials have spent more than $2 million to fight back.
This case comes down to a simple issue of who knew what -- and when. The S.E.C. contends that enough red flags were waving that the bankers and lawyers should have alerted investors that the baggage system could cause delays and cost overruns. The airport ultimately opened 16 months behind schedule and $2 billion over budget.
Some in municipal finance say the Denver case could be a blind alley in the drive by the S.E.C.'s chairman, Arthur Levitt Jr., to clean up municipal finance -- a $1.5 trillion market that the agency is trying to rid of political corruption and shoddy financial disclosure. Where's the harm, Mr. Levitt's critics want to know. The airport is open, they note, and its bonds, after first plummeting in value, now trade for increasingly higher prices.
"Arthur Levitt is barking up the wrong tree," said Daniel Muse, the Denver city attorney. "This is an overreaction. The S.E.C. is trying to kill a fly with a howitzer."
Other parties that are targets in the S.E.C. investigation will not comment on the matter, and as a matter of policy, the S.E.C. will not talk about enforcement cases. But Mr. Levitt, in an interview, said, "If someone is lying, cheating or stealing, whether it is in a corporate or a municipal transaction, we will bring an enforcement action."
Should the S.E.C. bring an enforcement action, it will probably cost the targets, in terms of dollars and prestige. But if the agency backs down, it could be left with egg on its face, despite a series of recent successes in the municipal finance arena.
What has upset so many people about this case is that the airport project had long been seen as an example of what is right about municipal finance. It was the decade's biggest deal, with more than $5 billion in bonds sold. There were no shady operators or allegations of financial payoffs.
"Folks in Denver hired top-notch bond and law firms," said Catherine L. Spain, a spokeswoman for the Government Finance Officers Association, a trade group. "Now they are being told that everything might not be right. That leaves many wondering who is next."
To make its case, the S.E.C. faces an uphill battle. It must prove that Denver, its underwriters and engineers defrauded investors by failing to disclose important financial information, and that this was done with "recklessness" -- that they knew, or should have known, that their actions would mislead bond buyers.
Those under scrutiny say they do not know just what evidence the S.E.C. has. But many say that by the questions asked, the agency seems to be focusing on showing that all parties knew full well in 1991 and 1992 that the proposed baggage system, so crucial to the airport's opening, was an unproven technology that would fail and could not be built on time, if ever.
This would mean the October 1993 opening date promised to investors -- the date when the airport would start generating revenues to repay bonds -- was known to be impossible when it appeared in the bonds' prospectus.
In 1990, the city itself commissioned a report from the engineering consulting firm of Breier Neidle Patrone Associates of Danbury, Conn., that warned that the baggage system was unfeasible. Instead, Breier recommended relying on a traditional "tug and cart" system, in which luggage is manually placed into carts and tugged around.
At least two engineering companies refused to bid on the baggage system because of its iffy nature. Finally, in June 1992, BAE Automated Systems of Dallas, the only bidder, got the job and promised to have the system operating in slightly more than a year.
But the proposed system was unlike anything BAE, which specializes in fairly low-technology baggage handling, or anyone else had ever assembled: 4,000 automated carts whizzing 1,400 pieces of luggage a minute on rails at speeds up to 19 miles an hour. BAE had designed a small version of such a system at San Francisco International Airport in 1978. Small prototypes were installed at the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, but had problems and later closed.
"This project was not plausible from the start," Richard deNeufville, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor and an expert on airport systems, said. "No one could believe that it could get done in two years' time. It was a big technological leap -- 10 to 100 times more complex than anything else."
In the bond documents supporting Denver's $500 million bond issue in 1991, investors were never told of potential baggage problems. Investors were warned only that the airport's construction could be hurt by factors like inflation, labor difficulties, bad weather, design errors and the unavailability of building materials. For a $253 million offering in 1992, one sentence was added: "Any significant delay with regard to the automated baggage system could delay the Date of Beneficial Occupancy of the New Airport."
Still, even professional investors say they were left clueless. "Traders and analysts discount generalized risk factors if there are no supporting details," said Gordon Yale, former airport bond analyst with Boettcher Securities in Denver and now an independent forensic accountant. "Risk factors have to be given some muscle."
The baggage system's troubles, Mr. Yale said, "should have been disclosed."
Denver officials, engineers and underwriters argue otherwise. They said they were repeatedly assured by the airport's outside engineers, including the Bechtel Corporation and the Morrison/Greiner joint venture, that the BAE system and its aggressive timetable were realistic. Indeed, they said, in the early days of construction other problems, like the construction of the terminal itself, were more troublesome. And they called the Breier report just one of thousands of bits of information -- often conflicting -- that they received about the project.
"None of our contractors said it couldn't be done," said Ginger Evans, the airport's chief engineer. "BAE always said they could make it and I believed that they believed they could. We gave the underwriters very forthright and detailed information and told them the airport schedule would be tight."
The baggage system was critical because it was the lure to get United Airlines, Denver's main carrier, to use the new airport as a hub. United agreed to do so in June 1991. But alone among all the airport's airlines, United insisted on having a system fast enough to accommodate a turnaround -- unloading a plane and then loading up for a new flight -- of 35 minutes, something only an automated system could do.
Even as they deny wrongdoing, those under fire are doing plenty of finger-pointing. Wall Street underwriters say they relied on information from Denver officials and from the construction concerns in preparing bond documents. City officials say they disclosed every fact to the underwriters. And a lawyer for one construction company who insisted that neither he nor his client be identified said that the engineering concerns and United honestly believed the baggage system could be up and running on schedule.
Besides, the lawyer added, they felt the airport could have opened on time anyway, because a backup tug-and-cart system was in place. Even today, the automated baggage system is only partly operational, though it has met United's 35-minute turnaround requirement.
In spite of the disclaimer in the 1992 bond documents, "we never considered that a baggage system not operating would prevent the airport from opening," said George Doughty, Denver's former director of aviation and now head of the airport in Allentown, Pa.
Besides the S.E.C. investigation, some investors have taken their disgruntlement to court. A class action has been filed against Denver and the underwriters, seeking unspecified damages. "Our clients paid too much for their bonds," said Sherrie Savett, a Philadelphia lawyer handling the case. "They were initially sold as double- and triple-A quality. Had the truth been told, investors would have paid a lower price."
John M. Gardner, now Denver's bond counsel, contends that neither the S.E.C. nor the bondholders have a case, that all red flags were fully visible even if every fact never made it into the documents.
"We had lots of discussions and decided that some things weren't material," he said. "We didn't move forward with the idea that 'Gee, we know this baggage system won't work.' "
Mr. Gardner is galled because he worked with the S.E.C. and the Government Finance Officers Association to write new disclosure guidelines for municipalities. Now he feels betrayed. "This case is sort of silly, and could embarrass the S.E.C.," he said.
In fact, lots of friends of the S.E.C. are turning into its foes. The Public Securities Association, a trade group, sent a blistering letter to Mr. Levitt. So has the National League of Cities. "Innocent victims are being slammed at a cost to local taxpayers," said Frank Shafroth, a league spokesman.
In spite of the flak, Mr. Levitt says he will hang tough: "Whenever you call for change, there is going to be resistance."

HEADLINE: U.S. WON'T PUNISH CHINA OVER SALE OF NUCLEAR GEAR

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
After three months of highly politicized debate, the Administration decided today not to punish China for the sale of equipment used for the production of weapons-grade enriched uranium to Pakistan.
The Chinese Government said it was unaware of any transfers of such equipment, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, acting for the Administration, decided that he had no hard evidence to contradict Beijing. American officials do say they know the Chinese company that sold the equipment to Pakistan. 
 The Administration decided not to impose sanctions, officials said, because the Chinese promised not to transfer nuclear-related items in the future, reconfirmed their commitment to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and agreed to consult with Washington on export control policies and other proliferation issues.
The shipment in question was small -- $70,000 worth of devices called ring magnets costing $14 apiece, sold beginning in June 1994 -- but the decision not to impose sanctions for the sale was politically charged.
It capped a week in which China policy was the major point in the Presidential campaign. Senator Bob Dole, who has supported Mr. Clinton's broader policy of unrestricted trade with China, immediately criticized today's decision.
As recently as three weeks ago, senior Administration officials were convinced that the Administration would impose some form of sanction on China for the transfer of the magnets. They are being used to make enriched uranium in a Pakistani installation that is subject neither to inspection nor to normal international safeguards. At that time an official said the Administration would have to impose sanctions at least on the Chinese company involved because American "credibility" depended on China's understanding that "actions have consequences, and that we mean what we say."
At the same time, the Administration is considering imposing about $2 billion in economic sanctions on certain Chinese exports to the United States unless China fulfills promises made last year to stop producing pirated copies of copyrighted American software, music compact disks and videos.
While officials say they are concerned about the deterioration of Washington's relationship with Beijing, they were at a loss to explain how announcing drastic sanctions on a trade issue one day and choosing to forgo sanctions on a nuclear proliferation issue the next could be seen as a consistent policy toward an emerging superpower.
Senior officials said today that the two decisions were entirely separate. They added that the timing of the announcements had nothing to do with Mr. Dole's statement on Thursday, in a speech on Asia policy, that he supported Mr. Clinton's decision to separate the issue of renewing China's "most favored nation" trading status from other issues like its human rights performance.
In a statement today, Mr. Dole called the timing "hardly coincidental," pointing out that it came a day "after I spoke on the shortcomings of the Clinton Administration in Asia."
The White House dismissed that speech today as "kerfuffle" after deploying Vice President Al Gore on Thursday to send the same message.
Mr. Dole said the Administration "was too slow to address proliferation concerns and too quick to reject targeted sanctions, for example on firms controlled by the Chinese People's Liberation Army involved in proliferation activities."
Mr. Dole said China's promises "must be matched by performance." What he found most troubling, he said, was that today's announcement exempted China's nuclear cooperation with Iran, which has been another area of concern.
There is a separate, ongoing investigation of reports that China sold missiles and missile parts to Iran, items that may violate China's 1994 promise to adhere to a missile technology control system, officials said. But there is no evidence so far that the reports are true, they added. That issue would not be considered one of nuclear cooperation, however.
Administration officials said that while Teheran accepts international oversight of nuclear development, Washington tries to discourage anyone from cooperating with Iran on nuclear issues, however legal.
Other Congressional reaction, with most legislators gone for the weekend, was mixed, with support for the decision coming from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. She said China's agreement to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons or unsafeguarded nuclear installations "is the keystone for non-proliferation throughout Asia."
China has made other promises and not kept them: not to pirate American software and music, for instance, or not to use prison labor to produce exports.
Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, said in a statement: "We have seen the Chinese Government repeatedly promise to halt the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and repeatedly break those promises. Now, the Administration seems to have settled yet again for an empty promise."
But American officials said today that China was moving toward an acceptable international standard of nuclear controls and that its adherence would be carefully monitored.
Officials today emphasized what they described as their success in getting China to promise specifically that it would not transfer ring magnets or provide any other "assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities," a position the Chinese will confirm in their own statement.
All together, the Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said, "What we got is what we would have sought from the Chinese to remove sanctions had they been imposed."
State Department officials said Mr. Dole's speech did not delay today's announcement or the separate trade-sanction decision. They said agreement with the Chinese was reached only this morning after nearly day-to-day exchanges since Mr. Christopher met the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, on April 19 in the Netherlands.
Mr. Christopher nearly concluded a deal late that night with Mr. Qian, senior officials said today, but did not complete if before he had to depart on a weeklong Middle East shuttle mission. Until that meeting, the officials said, they fully expected to impose sanctions against at least the Chinese company involved, the Chinese Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Government-owned China National Nuclear Corporation.
Asked about charges that the decision was delayed for Mr. Dole's speech or the piracy decision, Mr. Burns said: "Unfortunately, we were not so artful. We almost had this agreement April 19, and we would have liked to announce it then."
But when Mr. Christopher decided that "senior level" officials in the Government were not aware of the magnet transfer, it meant that a 1994 nuclear non-proliferation act, which calls for harsh Export-Import Bank sanctions if proliferation is "willful," were not fulfilled.

Dow Increases 43 Points On Calming Inflation Report
Capping one of the most volatile trading weeks in recent memory, stocks drove ahead as a benign wholesale inflation report calmed investors' nerves. Producer prices in April posted a smaller-than-expected rise of four-tenths of 1 percent. The Dow jumped 43 points, to 5,518.14. [Page 35.]
 
Treasury prices surged in part on the Government report indicating the absence of inflationary pressures. The 30-year Treasury bond jumped 1 2/32 , to 88 14/32 , and its yield fell to 6.92 percent from 7.02 percent. [40.]
 
Asbestos Settlement Thrown Out
A Federal appeals court in Philadelphia threw out a landmark $1.3 billion class-action settlement that would have limited future health claims of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families against 20 big asbestos producers. An industry group vowed to appeal the ruling. [1.]
 
Dissident Shareholders Warn Mesa
A group of dissident shareholders who have been trying for several months to wrest control of Mesa, the oil and gas production company, from its chief executive, T. Boone Pickens, plan to nominate seven candidates for election to the company's board. [33.]
 
Fidelity Loads Up on Energy Stocks
The nation's largest mutual fund bet more on energy stocks and less on technology stocks in March. But the Fidelity Magellan Fund left in place its big bet on bonds, which have fallen in price as interest rates have risen. [35.]
 
Comparator Discloses Faults
Under pressure from the Nasdaq Stock Market, Comparator Systems disclosed that some of its largest assets were of dubious value and added that it had not arranged the funding needed to market its latest product. Comparator had zoomed from 3 cents to $1.75 a share, a peak price that valued the company at more than $1 billion. It makes equipment to recognize fingerprints, but has had limited sales and no earnings. [43.]
 
Indictments in Culbro Billing Case
In the latest troubles for the beleaguered Culbro Corporation, three men have been indicted on charges that they used a false- billing scheme to cheat a Culbro cigar plant in Dothan, Ala., out of nearly $1 million. [44.]
 
U.S. Decides Not to Punish China
The Clinton Administration decided not to punish China for the sale to Pakistan of equipment used to make weapons-grade enriched uranium. China maintained it was unaware of any nuclear equipment transfers, and Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided he lacked evidence to contradict the Chinese. [1.]
 
Business executives voiced concern that Washington's row with China over piracy of software, videos, music and similar products could lead to a wider trade conflict, endangering their ability to compete in the vast Chinese market. [5.]
 
Japan's New Budget Widens Deficit
After months of wrangling, the Japanese Parliament approved a $715 billion budget for this fiscal year, which began on April 1. The budget, which reflects a rise of 5.8 percent over the previous year's, widens the Government's financial deficit. [32.]
 
Compuserve Inquiry Criticized
The Justice Department came under fire from a Federal judge at closing arguments on the Communications Decency Act, after it was disclosed that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had reviewed complaints of indecent material on Compuserve. [20.]
 
Transocean Board Likes Sonat
The board of Transocean, a Norwegian oil-drilling company, said that it continued to support a merger with Sonat Offshore Drilling and urged shareholders to rebuff an increased bid from Reading & Bates. Either offer would create the world's second-largest operator of offshore drilling rigs. [32.]
 
Offer by Lloyd's of London
Lloyd's of London made an offer to disgruntled members today to lower their share of the cost of saving the world's oldest insurance market from bankruptcy and increase the settlement offered to those members who have sued Lloyd's. Lloyd's said the offer was final. The members will vote on it in July. [32.]

HEADLINE: Michael L. Glassman, 56, Economist in Sports Antitrust Lawsuits

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Michael L. Glassman, an economist who helped pioneer the application of economic analysis to antitrust sports litigation, died of a heart attack on May 2 on a business flight to St. Louis. He was 56 and lived in Bethesda, Md.
Mr. Glassman testified on a variety of matters, including the effects of mergers, price-fixing and other anti-competitive practices, but the cases for which he was best-known were those in which he testified on behalf of professional athletes. 
 In the mid-1980's, he testified for the Major League Baseball Players Association in an arbitration involving salary conspiracies by club owners; it resulted in a $280 million settlement.
"He was instrumental in demonstrating not only that the collusion existed, but also its dimensions," said Gene Orza, assistant general counsel of the association. Until his death, Mr. Orza added, Mr. Glassman was the association's chief economic adviser.
In 1992, Mr. Glassman testified on behalf of eight professional football players, including Joe Montana, then the quarterback for the San Francisco 49'ers, and Freeman McNeil, a running back for the New York Jets, who contended that they had lost money because the National Football League would not allow them to negotiate with other teams.
Mr. Glassman estimated the players' total losses at $4 million, and in three days of testimony he explained how he analyzed wage data by looking at salaries from 1984, when the United States Football League was competing for players with the N.F.L., and by looking at salary differences between players who had become free agents and those who had not.
The N.F.L. agreed to pay a $200 million settlement to all the players in the league, including about $2 million for the plaintiffs.
Mr. Glassman was born in Kansas City, Mo., on Nov. 17, 1939, and received his bachelor's and master's degrees from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale. He was enrolled in the Ph.D. economics program at the University of Chicago from 1962 to 1966.
He taught economics at MacMurray College in Jacksonville, Ill., from 1966 to 1971, when he joined the Federal Trade Commission. He was chief of the division of economic evidence in the commission's bureau of economics from 1972 to 1976, when he left to become a co-founder of the Glassman-Oliver Economic Consultants firm in Washington.
He is survived by his wife, Nancy, of Bethesda; two sons, David, of Cocoa Beach, Fla., and Ted, of New Orleans; his mother, Lillian Glassman of Kansas City, and two sisters, Susan Boston of Leawood, Kan., and Jane Cohen of Boulder, Colo.

HEADLINE: Without a Strong State University, New York Can't Compete;
Questions for CUNY

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re your May 7 front-page article on a study of the City University of New York's open-admissions policy: 
 I favor education as a goal, particularly as a way out of the ghetto, poverty or the lower-middle class. I do not favor the expenditure of unlimited taxpayer funds to correct ills that society is unable or unwilling to prevent (in this case, by improving primary education).
You describe this new study that finds that "more than half" of open-admissions students receive bachelor's degrees "sometimes more than a decade later," notwithstanding earlier studies having found that "only about one-third" and "less than 25 percent of minority students" received degrees.
What was the economic cost of admitting and working with that portion of the population that would not have qualified under earlier standards? What was the social cost in terms of quality of education to the many students who would have qualified anyway but were subjected to more crowded, lower-quality classes as a result?
What is the basis for David E. Lavin, one of the researchers, saying that making it more difficult for students to stay in college "diminished their earning power"? Is it not possible that many semi-skilled occupations would have provided more income than many white-collar jobs of college graduates (particularly considering presumably lower earnings during the college years)?
How does the fact that "more than 40 percent of the open-admissions students never earned bachelor's degrees" demonstrate that City University is not a "diploma mill"? How do we know that the total would not have been 80 percent with proper standards?

HEADLINE: Blue Sky, California

BYLINE: By David Beers; David Beers is a freelance writer living in Vancouver. "Blue Sky Dream: A Memoir of America's Fall From Grace," from which this was adapted, will be published by Doubleday in September.

 BODY:
My father and I are together in the sky. I am 8 and he has taken me up in the Piper Cherokee, a four-seat, single-prop, family sedan of an airplane he rents once in a while. My father's idea is that we will fly over our house and get a look at it from a new vantage point, from high above the Santa Clara Valley on a clear summer morning. We will fly over at an agreed-upon time and my mother will stand in our backyard and wave.
"Won't be long till we get there. Five, ten minutes. Have a look." My father's voice in my headphones cuts through the vibrating thrum of the airplane's engine. He smiles and traces a circle on the window with the tip of his index finger, as if marking an intersection on a road map. I follow his finger, look down and suddenly, vaguely, I am terrified. 
 My fear has nothing to do with any lack of faith in my father's piloting. I know, from snapshots and dinner-table stories, that my father was once a special sort of pilot who flew a Navy jet fighter. And this morning -- one of his happy, whistling days -- I have been reassured by his exchanges with the man in the control tower. Cherokee victor bravo niner over. That is the way men must speak to each other when they know exactly what they are doing.
No, the queasy doubt rushing over me comes from what is there below, staring up -- a labyrinth of freshly scraped earth and cedar-shingled roofs and severe little lawns and blacktop ribbons bent with such precise consideration that I feel I'm looking at some immense, far-too-complicated board game. Down there, we could be anywhere.
I search out the familiar shape of our cul-de-sac, but what I see, like berries growing on trellised vines, are many, many cul-de-sacs. How could one of these tiny, repeated shapes be our very own? From up here one could never see the brand-new lemon yellow Naugahyde couch just installed with such momentous pleasure in front of our television set. From here one could not see my sister, Marybeth, 4 years old, or my baby brother, Dan, or the melon stomach of my mother, pregnant with my sister-to-be, Maggie. From here one could not see the baby food jars filled with nuts and bolts on my father's workbench, or, hanging above it by a nylon thread, the dusty model of his Navy jet fighter. From here there is no way to see the sky blue walls of my bedroom.
"Got your bearings yet?" My father is helping me orient myself as we fly on toward our neighborhood, our house, my mother who will be down there waving. "Those big structures there, recognize them? They're the hangars at Moffett Field. And in there somewhere is your dad's place of work. That's Lockheed."
This holds great interest for me, given that I have never been inside Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. I have only seen, once from the company parking lot, the barbed wire and chain-link and sentry kiosks that my father passes through each day. As I follow my father's eyes down, I see a large, white radar dish pointed toward the heavens, and around it many tight-lidded shoe boxes, windowless, gray, some with smaller dishes and antennae twisting off their roofs. In there, somewhere. "See the freeway? Going in over there," he says, pointing to a great trench of flattened dirt. I know there is a great trench of flattened dirt not far from our house, but I also know it is but one of many. Wherever my family drives I see the yellow graders and dump trucks and bulldozers making their endless gouges in the ground. And so I wonder, is that great trench down there ours?
"Eighty-five, and over there two-eighty."
Yes, those sound like the ones the adults talk about eagerly as they stand in front of their new tract homes on these warm summer evenings, their cigarettes glowing, their laughter drifting over to us kids as we chase each other yard to yard. Eighty-five will connect to 280, with its signs naming it "The World's Most Beautiful Freeway." They are the freeways that will connect to the expressways that connect to our cul-de-sac and house and yard, where -- there, I see her now -- my mother is waving to us, in the sky.
My mother taught us words for getting the attention of St. Anthony, who, she said, would guide us to whatever we were looking for but had not yet found:
Tony, Tony, listen, listen.
Hurry, hurry, something's missin'.
Hers was a perfect prayer for a blue-sky family in the early 1960's, as colorfully casual as a tiki lantern, resistant to any doubt that we in our suburban frontier held the interest of heaven.
A crisis would develop. Mutterings, hard soles stepping hard in the back of the house, my father moving with those quickened, long strides that sent us children edging into corners, onto chairs, anywhere that might have been, as he would say to us, "out of the WAY!" His keys were missing again. He was yanking open drawers and shoving hands between seat cushions. He was muttering: "For cripes' sake." He was late for Lockheed.
Tony, Tony, look around.
Something's lost and must be found.
"It's worked before," my mother would say, upbeat. "You just have to believe." She would move her lips in prayer just beyond my father's vortex.
Someone would be drawn to some unlikely spot, and there would be the keys, waiting for my father's exasperated swipe at them. After he and his keys had disappeared in a puff of exhaust around the corner, headed for Lockheed, we children would move out of the corners of the house, reclaim the empty spaces, and the best possibilities for the day would be there for us, as if by some small miracle.
Some evenings my father would bring me publicity photographs of Lockheed products to hang in my bedroom. There were stubby-winged jets and fire-swathed rockets, satellites that hung in space like tinfoil dragonflies. And my favorite, the submarine-launched, nuclear-tipped Polaris missile. To a boy who thumb-tacked its picture on his wall, the Polaris was a perfectly pure and universal shape, white and smooth, frozen above the convulsed ocean surface through which it had just burst. Lockheed photographed its missiles headed up, never killing end down. As a child, I didn't wonder what the Polaris was for. Perhaps once launched it just stuck there in the firmament like a dart in the ceiling. That the Polaris was so obviously the future exploding out of the sea seemed reason enough to create it.
"We never looked at a used house," my father remembers of those days in the early 1960's when he and my mother went shopping for a home of their own in the Santa Clara Valley. "A used house simply did not interest us." Instead they roved in search of the many billboards advertising Low Interest! No Money Down! to military veterans like my father. "We shopped for a new house," my father says, "the way you shopped for a car."
On warm evenings in the spring of 1962, after dinner, my parents would place my baby sister in her stroller and the four of us would set out from the too small, used house they were renting in a subdivision named Strawberry Park, walk six blocks and pick up a wide trail cut into the adobe ground, a winding roadbed awaiting asphalt. We would make our way across muddy clay that was crosshatched by tractor treads, riven by pipe trenches. We would breathe in the sap scent of 2-by-4's stacked around us, the smell of plans ready to go forward. Finally we would arrive at Lot 242 of Unit 6 of Tract 3113, 14,500 square feet of emptiness that now belonged to us. All around the outline were piles of cherry and plum and apricot trees, their roots ripped from the ground, the spring blossoms still clinging to their tangled up branches.
My father would go from stake to yellow-ribboned stake, telling us where the kitchen would be, which windows would be getting the most sun. Later, after the skeletons of walls were up, we would wander through the materializing form of our home, already inhabiting with our imaginations its perfect potentiality.
I learned early to study my father's face as he came through the door after his Lockheed workday. If his eyebrows were where they should be -- at rest on a line-free forehead -- there was every chance of the usual Dad, the loving and fun Dad who would want to know all about "life around here" that day. If he gathered up my pretty, dark-haired mother in a languorous kiss and called her one of his nicknames, if he said, "What's new, Scrappy?" as he pulled from the cupboard the glass bubble for mixing martinis, if he filled it with ice and liquor and stirred with the glass wand, if he lifted a child into one arm while he loosened his tie with the other and then took a lip-smacking sip of his drink, if he did such things, then prospects for the night ahead were excellent. He might even be coaxed after dinner to transform himself into the Hairy Umgawa, the monster who wrestled all comers on the shag carpet of the living room until, inevitably, he lay panting and defeated under a pile of children.
But what if, when my father came through the door, the eyebrows were not where they should be? What if a critical mass of lines had gathered on his forehead and pressed the eyebrows together and down? What if he stepped through the door to the everyday sound of a pot clattering or a baby crying and those eyebrows darted low even as the eyes widened and showed too much white? These were indicators that he was this night, at some point, likely to erupt in rage. I remember many dinners that went from happy chatter to grim conflagration in the instant it took a child to knock over a small glass of milk.
Whenever his impatient anger would find a target in me my day would disintegrate. The touch-off might be the skid mark I left on the driveway with my bike, or the screwdriver I had forgotten to return to its hook on the wall, some bit of disorder that hadn't much bothered him the day before. But this day I hadn't taken proper precautions and now he was standing over me, his eyes with far too much white in them, his face inches from my own. Useless ninny! he was shouting. Giiiyaaad! -- a yell that trailed off into a gagging sound. You're useless! Useless! Have you a brain in your skull?! I would find it impossible not to cower, not to cry, so I would cry and that only redoubled the onslaught -- Stop your pathetic blubbering! -- until my head ached and the world was red-tinged by tears and everyone within range was utterly miserable.
To prevent any such scene, I fine-tuned my powers of surveillance. I studied the forehead, the eyes, the corners of the mouth that might tighten and dip. If his legs were all I could see, sticking out from beneath an automobile in the garage, I listened to the tone of his grunts as he grappled with the repair job. Some grunts, the favorable ones, were rounded, open uhhhs resonating with satisfaction at progress made. As often, though, they were bitten-off growls of frustration, the surest sign that I should not say whatever I had come to say, that I should not let my father know I had ever been there.
Sometimes, that option was denied me. "Dave! I need your help here!" my father would call out. Perhaps he had fearlessly winched the car's guts straight out of its engine compartment, or, having opened the back of a television set, was probing that inscrutable landscape with yet another strange new tool. My father who could do anything would tell me to stand by him and hold a flashlight beam on the exact spot where he was performing his mysterious manipulations. "Dammit Dave, put the light right here," he would say as my attention inevitably atrophied and my aim relaxed. I could have learned by asking questions, but I knew that if I asked one too many his impatience might jump like electricity from the task that frustrated him over to me. And so I asked little, my father offering little, father and son collaborating on the day's project, operating strictly on a need-to-know basis.
The system of compartmentalized secrecy at Lockheed was self-regulating. Workers were expected to turn in any colleague who spoke too freely or handled secret documents improperly. "If you found yourself flunking polygraph tests your clearances were rescinded," my father explains. "Your ticket was pulled, which made you an unemployable engineer at Lockheed. You'd go to NASA, where the work was completely unclassified and deadly dull. The money and promotions were in the highly classified jobs. Security clearances were merit badges that opened all kinds of doors for you."
My father, naturally, would submit willingly to polygraph tests, having nothing to hide and everything to gain. Had he revealed details of his work to anyone outside the proper compartments? No, he could always answer truthfully.
At the dinner table, his young son would also ask him questions.
"What are you working on, Dad?"
"Welllll. . . . " A question like that always invited a long pause. "Let's just say that I'm helping to troubleshoot a very complicated piece of equipment for the government."
"Is it something that goes into space, Dad?"
He would chuckle and cock an eye at the ceiling, weighing just what he could tell his 9-year-old son that might not show up later as a damning twitch of the polygraph's needle. At our dinner table, Lockheed was always listening in.
I soon learned to stop asking.
In the late 60's, when Vietnam and Neil Armstrong came to inhabit our living room via the television, my father's work for Lockheed in all likelihood had more connection with war-making than with moon-walking. Those were years when he grew more pensive and grouchy, as if shaken from a dream he could never get back to. As his volatility increased he required all the more surveillance. One afternoon, during an argument with my mother, my father did an uncharacteristic thing. He punched the wall in the entry way of our home, making a hole in the dry wall. The next morning, he came to it with his tool box and carefully made a patch, but there was a faint outline if you knew where to look.
My father tried to solve his gloom by building in our garage a Thorpe T-18, a "home built" airplane. When that project proved too expensive and time-consuming, he turned, in the quiet hours of evenings, to reading. A Lockheed friend had piqued his interest in books that tried to make sense of society, human nature and where the country was headed. My father became a student of John Kenneth Galbraith's critique of corporate culture as the misplaced pursuit of money over life's more fulfilling rewards. He soaked up Eric Hoffer's ideas about adults gripped by "juvenile" restlessness, which, in turn, is produced by economic dislocation due to technology. He read Desmond Morris's theories about humans as "naked apes" gone neurotic in the too-crowded cages of the cities. This was a brooder's bibliography, books by thinkers suspicious of group-think and the pronouncements of officialdom. The serious grown-up, these books seemed to say, questions every premise of blue-sky optimism.
If I was beside him holding the flashlight for a fix-it job, he might lay out a book's thesis, making connections to his own experience. He would speak of an insight he'd gleaned about Lockheed: "The primary purpose of any bureaucratic institution is to continually justify its own existence." He would be excited by a semanticist's version of why a husband and wife talk past each other: "Words are useless unless two people agree on their meanings. The map must agree with the territory!" I grasped little of this, but found it exhilarating that he seemed to be asking me, as a potential equal, to accompany him on an intellectual journey just begun.
In his books my father found schematic diagrams that might offer solutions to a malfunctioning America or, perhaps, to the uneasiness in his soul. He was the troubled troubleshooter, a systems engineer in search of systems underlying the human condition.
In the summer of 1972, as I turned 15, Nixon operatives were caught bugging the Democratic headquarters in the Watergate complex. In August, on the day after the U.S. withdrew its last combat unit from Vietnam, B-52's pounded that land with the most intensive 24-hour bombing raid of the war. I floated through that summer on glints of sunlight and whiffs of chlorine, an impossibly skinny kid yearning for sex with the beautiful girls on my swim team. My father bought a Ping-Pong table for our backyard deck, where my brother and I slapped the plastic ball back and forth endlessly. At the beginning of the summer my father had been able to defeat me handily, but as the season wore on I improved.
There came a hot evening late in August, with a sky still light and grasshoppers chirping madly, when my mother was off at a church function and my father was doing the dinner dishes. I cajoled him into coming outside for a game that turned out to be the first I'd ever won against him. It started with my father's cheers for me when my put-aways skittered off the corners of the table or bounced against his chest. By the end, when I beat him with a backhanded slam, my father had withdrawn into one of his sulks. He went back into the kitchen and muttered as he loaded the dishwasher.
I felt responsible for his sulk, so when my brother took his place at the other end of the Ping-Pong table I loudly said to him, "You know, if Dad got to practice as much as we do, I never would have won against him."
My father's shout came from the kitchen, through the sliding screen door. "The last thing I need, Dave, is for you to patronize me!"
He was onto me. He would not, after all, be fooled by my methods of emotional management. He was turning my words against me as evidence of something even worse, bad faith. That panicked me some, angered me, too. "You may think I was patronizing you, Dad," I shouted back, "but I wasn't!"
I saw him then striding quickly from the kitchen, his face red and hard, one of his arms (the arm of a six-foot-two man who was not skinny) throwing open the sliding screen door as I backed away. I saw his clenched fist before my eyes and then blackness and sparks on the backs of my eyelids as another fist and then another crashed into my cheeks and eyes. I tumbled back and found myself sitting, ridiculously it seemed, on the soft plastic cushion of a chaise longue. Through hands I'd thrown over my face too late, I watched the back of my father as he disappeared without a word through the screen door, into the house. I heard my brother whimpering from beneath the picnic table. I felt my face not hurting so much as pulsating. Except for the whimpering of my brother and the running of my father's dishwater and the singing of the grasshoppers, all in our backyard was quiet and warm and removed from the world as usual.
I walked then, barefoot, in cut-off jeans and a T-shirt, out of our yard, our cul-de-sac, past Queen of Apostles church and school, past the softball field by the freeway, under the overpass where Interstate 280 intersected Lawrence Expressway, down a strip of burger stands and car dealerships to the Futurama bowling lanes. I went into the bathroom to examine my throbbing face, and in the mirror were blackened eyes and blood-rimmed nostrils. I knew it would only look worse tomorrow, when the blue-sky summer was expected to resume as normal.
When the Futurama closed down at midnight, there was nothing to do but to return home, to open the front door my father had left unlocked, to move through the dark house to my bedroom, to ease myself under the sheets. I lay there a few minutes and my father came into my room without turning on the light. He sat on the edge of my bed and whispered an apology. There was "no excuse" for what he had done, he said. I was silent. He whispered a theory about the rivalry that occurs between two males in confined space, a theory I knew he'd drawn from one of his books. I was in no mood to accept his apology, much less to theorize with him. I remained silent as he said again, "But for all that, there's no excuse for my actions," and left the room.
The next morning my mother cried: "Oh no! What did he do?" when she saw my face. When next they were alone together, I would guess that he told her what he told me, and that she forgave him, having reached an understanding that he would never do it again. My father never did hit me again. I told the kids on my swim team that I had lunged for a Ping-Pong shot and run my face into the pole that held up the bamboo roof over our deck. My father once heard me telling this story, took me aside and told me never to lie on his behalf. "What I did was wrong. You go ahead and tell anyone you like exactly what I did. Just tell the truth and let me suffer the consequences." I listened silently, staring away without forgiveness as my father said this in a voice that was tired, even gentle.
My father maneuvers the Cessna 172 out of a slow, banking turn, the silver blue of the Monterey Bay slipping behind the mountains at our backs, Silicon Valley's labyrinth of lanes and cul-de-sacs presenting itself before us. He is 62 and retired, and has time to fly again. I am 37 and visiting, happy to be sharing stories through our headsets.
He tells me that when he was a young aviator just out of the Navy, he had expectations of joining the exciting and select society of engineering test pilots. But certain events overtook him: marriage, me, the job offer from Lockheed, three more children. He confides that there was one instance when claustrophobia finally drove him to leave his desk and make inquiries outside of Lockheed about how a man like him might become a working aviator again. But by then neither the world of test-flying nor airline piloting had any use for my father because somehow, without his marking the time closely enough, he had become 37 years old.
This story of a foiled, last-ditch escape attempt is surprising to me, and it prompts me later, as we drive along the World's Most Beautiful Freeway in my father's brand-new silver and streamlined Camry, to ask him for another revelation. I have never, in the 20 years after my father beat my face black and blue on a summer evening, summoned that memory from him. I have long since forgiven him for it; we are old friends now, he and I. His edgy impatience has softened over the years; he seems to carry more peace within himself. But I am wanting to know the answer to this remaining mystery in my father. So cataclysmic an episode must hold a key to the puzzle he was then. The car is quiet and warm and my father and I have had a good day in the sky and so I ask him, "Do you remember it?"
"Yes," he says. "I hit you, didn't I?" He wears the expression of one asked to recall the plot of an obscure movie. By the look on his face, I presume he would prefer to forget. I feel bad for bringing it up, and I do not expect any more revelations today. Then my father says: "I have been abusive to every one of you in the family. There are so many bad times I've lived to regret."
My father tells me then about how, after raging at his wife or child, he would arrive at Lockheed sick with a remorse that ached like an alcoholic's hangover. He would sit, then, at his desk writing what co-workers assumed was documentation related to the latest secret technology project. In truth, he spent hour upon hour writing long essays to himself, recording feelings observed within, working his way painstakingly toward some diagnosis of the irrational at his core. Whatever came to mind he wrote down, blame heaped not only on himself for becoming a "paper pusher," but also on his wife and children for blocking his way out. What he wrote was often raw and ugly and he never meant it for other eyes, my father tells me. But he kept every page in a folder by his desk, a folder that grew thick over the course of 15 years, and at times when the hangover of contrition had lifted, he would pull old essays from his file to see where he had been and whether he might now know enough to troubleshoot the problem.
What my father concluded is this. "Puzzling over why I was such a bizarre personality, I resolved it was the difference between myself as reality displayed itself to me, and the inflated self-image I carried around." My father's task, the task that Lockheed Missiles and Space Company had in a sense assigned him, was to sit at his desk and write memos to himself until the expectations of a hot young fighter pilot had been reduced to fit the space that America's cold-war economy had in fact allotted him. He wrote his last letter to himself when his career was about two-thirds over. Just before retiring a few years ago, he passed the entire file through the shredding machine Lockheed provides for classified documents of no further use.

HEADLINE: Plain Beautiful

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER is the author of the "Heartland" volume of the Smithsonian Guides to Natural America, to be published next year.

 BODY:
THE most beautiful place I've been in recently is Cimarron National Grassland. It is 108,175 acres of flatness, short grasses and ghost-gray sages on the high plains near the town of Elkhart, Kan.
Many people have written about the plains and the sublime feelings that come from standing on a flat place. In "Prairy Erth: A Deep Map," William Least Heat-Moon, in addition to his own musings on the subject, has compiled an impressive collection of observations from other writers about prairies and plains. 
 The tendency is to overreach, to pile on the adjectives and torque the metaphors, in ways more appropriate for describing rococo landscapes, like mountains. I think this happens because the natural response to an overwhelming experience is to get frothed up. Taken by surprise by the potency of flatness, the overwhelmed writer is then convinced nobody else is going to believe level ground could really be so powerful unless he or she hammers the experience.
So far I've found no one who writes so steadily and convincingly about the plains as Willa Cather, because she is as simple and direct as the places she describes.
My favorite single quotation is from the artist Thomas Hart Benton: "For me the Great Plains have a releasing effect. They make me want to run and shout at the top of my voice. I like their endlessness. I like the way they make human beings appear as the little bugs they really are."
I spent a sunset at Cimarron National Grassland, and returned the next morning for sunrise. Watching the passage of the sun, especially as it nests on the horizon, is one of the stellar attractions of flat places. There are, after all, not a lot of other visual distractions. I think I will never tire of watching the sun come up and go down on the plains.
I stood on the rim of Point of Rocks. It is a bluff of ancient Jurassic shales higher by 110 feet than everything else in the vicinity. This promontory projects from the surrounding landscape like the prow of an ocean liner.
Point of Rocks demonstrates a point that flatlanders such as I constantly make when defending the terrain we love. The plains are not really flat. To the contrary, they are full of contour and undulation, an endless variation of dunes, swales, coulees, potholes, moraines, gullies, rimrocks and buttes. In their rumpledness, the plains remind me of the bed I never make.
Point of Rocks was a natural vantage for Plains Indians looking for bison and interlopers, and for the interlopers -- such as people traveling on the Cimarron cutoff of the Santa Fe Trail -- to look for Plains Indians. From this perch, the view is long and the earth a dish. I would have described the sun that evening and morning, as it pulsed and puckered on the horizon, except I would get all frothed up.
The high plains, consisting of most of Nebraska, western Kansas, western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle, all of which parallel the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains, is essentially the Rockies reconstituted. This flat, high country is composed of vast fans of sands and gravels carried off the Rockies over the last 30 or so million years by wind, water and gravity.
I was born on the high plains in West Texas and I now live on their fringe in Omaha. Although I've had happy times in Boulder, Durango, San Cristobal de las Casas, Huehuetanago, Cuzco and other cities perched in high places, I've had no strong desire to live in any of them. This suggests that I imprinted on flatness at an early age. I do not deny that precipitous landscapes are gorgeous in their own way, but I have come to realize a simple thing about myself. I like my mountains lying down.
I am now lobbying with friends about a trip we're planning in the summer. We initially talked about going to the Black Hills of South Dakota, but the more I consider the prospect of all that verticality, the more I'm pressing for Crescent Lake National Wildlife Refuge, in the empty, undulating sandhills of western Nebraska. I've been there once, so I know the terrain is flat enough, with enough topographic relief in the form of magnificent sand dunes, to make me happy, even ecstatic.

 BESIDES the unfurled eastern skirts of the Rockies, the other places eroded to near flatness that I love are the glacier-shaped farmlands that once were prairie in western Minnesota, Iowa and Illinois. I am so especially enamored of Iowa that I have become something of a liability for my husband at cocktail parties.
I have brought numerous animated clutches of people to puzzled silence with talk of, for example, my raptures at Wearin Prairie in the utterly flat bottomlands of the Nishnabotna River (in southwestern Iowa) or at Rochester Cemetery Prairie on the rolling sandy banks of the Cedar River (near Iowa City).
Iowa, I tell them, is a voluptuous body in repose.
This observation embarrasses or disconcerts most people, who wish to think of Iowa as a prim, flat and featureless landscape. Virtually the whole surface of Iowa is the product of glacial activity over the last two million years. Glaciers are the primal sculptors, doing for landscapes what Rodin, Brancusi, Moore and Lachaise have done for the human form.
The human body, like the prairie, is flat in some places and curvaceous in others. It is these incremental topographic variations that make both forms so appealing. I nonetheless have difficulty convincing people of the commonality between, say, "The Kiss" by Rodin and Sheeder Prairie, which lies on the bosomy glacial plain just west of Des Moines.
The great lament among those of us who love glacial landscapes is that their cloak of prairies is all but gone. Much of the disrobing took place a hundred or more years ago, but even that passage of time has not assuaged the feelings or frustrations of people in quest of prairies.
I have become accustomed to long drives between virgin prairies. And I am settling into the reality of corn, soybeans, wheat, alfalfa, milo, beets, sunflowers, feed lots, pig parlors and vast warehouses full of chickens and turkeys. This is where our food comes from (so we are all implicated in what has changed the landscape), and the food is raised by people, who, like any other socio-economic subset, are by and large sweet, industrious, complicated and slippery of stereotype.
At least the shape of the land remains pretty much intact -- the oceanic swells of southern Iowa, the shocking flatness of the Platte Valley in Nebraska, the equally impressive levelness of western Minnesota, the serpentine curves around Chicago, the sleeping-giant shapes of the Flint Hills in Kansas, the incline of the high plains as they end in the Pine Ridge of northwestern Nebraska. I cannot say which piece of sculptured earth I love more.
One of my favorite memories of flatness harks back to a trip I made in Illinois in October 1994. I had spent the day out on the Grand Prairie, a huge swath of black soils in east-central Illinois that supported what is said to have been the tallest of the tall-grass prairie in North America. The Grand Prairie, 80 miles wide and 100 miles long, lies south of Chicago and east of the Illinois River. The 13 million acres of tall-grass prairie are all but gone. It is prime farmland and nearly flat.
I ended up late in the day at Weston Cemetery Prairie, about 25 miles north of Bloomington-Normal.
The cemetery is a tiny vestige of the Grand Prairie, a five-acre plot of wild, woolly grasses and wildflowers amid a lonesomeness of cornfields.
There was the flat earth, the horizon unobstructed by mountains or structures, and the sky. An autumn front was moving in from the west, and the sun set against a wall of bruised blue-black clouds. I stood out in the dark all by myself, happy in the knowledge of the little bug I really am.

HEADLINE: Watching Berlin Take Shape

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KINZER; STEPHEN KINZER is the Berlin bureau chief of The Times.

 BODY:
FORGET the Brandenburg Gate, the Pergamon Museum and the remnants of Nazi and Communist dictatorships. Berlin's hot new tourist attractions these days are huge empty pits and fields piled high with rubble.
Five years after unification, this city is engaged in one of the most frantic construction booms in history. By one count, construction is under way at about 2,000 sites, many of them in the downtown boroughs of Tiergarten and Mitte. The skyline is a jungle of 1,200 towering yellow cranes.
When the building boom began a couple of years ago, construction sites were simply nuisances, as they are in every big city. But lately they have become a magnet for visitors who want to watch a metropolis taking shape. Every day, hundreds of people poke around the places that will, in a few years, become the heart of Germany's political and economic power.
Finding the building sites is no problem. On the contrary, it is all but impossible to avoid them. A ride on the elevated train from Zoo Station to Friedrichstrasse provides a good view of some of the major ones, and a walk almost anywhere in the central part of the city turns complicated as streets are blocked off for the noisy crews (most of which which mercifully fall silent at dusk and on weekends).
Some visitors to the sites, both Berliners and tourists, come alone or in small groups, gaping at the sites from makeshift sidewalks. Many others, among them school classes, business and private clubs, and groups of architects and city planners, come as part of organized tours. Some hire guides who can explain the past and future of what are now bustling but still shapeless wastelands.
An agency called art:berlin is offering walking tours of four of the most interesting sites. One tour is along historic Friedrichstrasse, which until World War II was the heart of Berlin's business district. Today, several retail and office complexes are under construction there. One is already open, the glittering Galeries Lafayette, now easily the most elegant shopping complex in the former East Berlin. It has become an attraction in itself, daring to challenge the famous Ka De We department store in the western part of the city.
Walking along Friedrichstrasse today conveys a sense of Berlin's construction boom. Elegant boutiques and cafes do good business although they are surrounded by muddy contruction sites. The shining glass facades of modern palaces like Galeries Lafayette contrast with sturdy stone edifices from past eras, some of them still bearing bullet holes from street fighting between Nazi and Red Army troops half a century ago.
Another tour centers on the area where Checkpoint Charlie, formerly the most famous crossing point between East and West Berlin, once stood. An American-led consortium directed by the former U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, Mark Palmer, is building a $1 billion business center there. On May 13, a Berlin-based American artist, John Powers, will unveil a 45-foot-tall steel-and-plaster model of the Statue of Liberty on the site. The work is to remain in place until the end of summer.
A third tour covers the area around a bend in the Spree River where the Reichstag now stands alone, surrounded by acres of empty space. The federal government is scheduled to move into a newly built neighborhood there by 1999, and nearby the storied Adlon Hotel is being rebuilt. Posters outside recall famous guests like Greta Garbo, Charlie Chaplin, Albert Einstein and Enrico Caruso.
The most awe-inspiring tour is through Potsdamer Platz. In the early decades of the 20th century, with Berlin a main stop on principal east-west and north-south routes in Europe, Potsdamer Platz was the continent's busiest traffic crossroads. It was heavily damaged by Allied bombing, and then bulldozed to become part of the infamous "death strip" that separated East and West Berlin. Now it is slated to become a city-within-a-city built around giant Sony and Daimler-Benz corporate headquarters.
Contractors have erected a bright red three-story building here called the Info Box, where computer graphics help convey the scope of one of the most complex building projects ever attempted. It has become a highly popular attraction. Thousands of visitors each week view models of the planned buildings, as well as displays that explain how the vast amounts of soil moved from the site are being disposed of; what kind of water, power and communications networks are being laid underground; and what roles big-name architects like Renzo Piano, Arata Isozaki and Helmut Jahn are playing in designing a new downtown for Berlin. With the press of a button a visitor is on a Potsdamer Platz street, at a table in the space-age casino or inside the Transrapid magnetic levitation train, none of which yet exist.
Great feats of engineering are being accomplished regularly at the ultra-high-tech Potsdamer Platz site. Recently an entire turn-of-the-century grand ballroom, all that remained of the bombed-out Esplanade Hotel, was moved 75 yards along a specially built track to make room for a new road.
Divers are working under the water table at the bottom of a pit, laying a foundation for the $2.7 billion Daimler-Benz headquarters; the area is as big as three football fields, making it reportedly the world's largest underwater construction site.
Berlin's main construction projects are scheduled for completion around the end of the decade. Some Berliners fear that they will feed the "Manhattanization" of their city, with massive buildings robbing it of its human scale. But planners insist that nothing of historical value is being destroyed, and that the new buildings will form a collection of ensembles that will not only provide a motor for economic growth but also grace the city.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Elaine Summers;
Prime Advocate for Tourism in the State

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AS thoughts of tourism intensify with the season, Elaine Summers is front and center. Ms. Summers was named last summer the executive director of the Connecticut Lodgings and Attractions Association (formerly the Hotel and Motel Association), with almost 300 members. From lobbying the legislature to reduce the special 12 percent sales tax on hotel rooms to promoting the industry to the general public, she is the advocate for the state's hospitality business.
A New Jersey native, Ms. Summers graduated from the University of Hartford and earned a degree from Western New England Law School. As a lawyer she handled personal injury, product liability and negligence cases before becoming general counsel for the Hartford Police Department. 
 Ms. Summers discussed the association and some of its objectives during a recent interview at her office in the Farmington Marriott Hotel. Following are some excerpts from that conversation.
Q. How large is the tourism industry in Connecticut?
A. It's over $4 billion a year, and for the last four years we've been growing faster than the rate of inflation, about 2 percentage points a year. People tend to think our tourism is all in the summer, and it's families going along the coast. But that's really not true. A little bit over 50 percent of our guests are actually business travelers.
Q. How much growth are you predicting for tourism?
A. Nationwide, there's more than 40 percent growth predicted for the industry by the year 2005. It's definitely the fastest-growing industry in the United States. Tourism is the No. 2 industry in Connecticut, second only to manufacturing.
Q. Do you want to see it ahead of manufacturing?
A. I think it can get there. It depends on having cooperation between private and public entities. There's still a strong anti-tourism sentiment throughout Connecticut, and New England.
But I think that any economy that is stable and sound has got to have a base of manufacturing. So I think we need to accentuate the benefits of having a very large core of industry.
Q. Isn't it easy to see your members as a nuisance because of the traffic they generate?
A. People are forgetting about the tremendous ripple effect. We're not just talking about wages, although that is very important because we have more than 40,000 people employed in the state, but we're talking about the things our members buy at the local stores, and over $140 million a year that we pay in local taxes.
There are all kinds of businesses that depend on our members -- the companies that print hotel and attraction brochures, snow plowing companies, laundry services, housekeeping supplies, plumbers, electricians.
There are more dollars spent by tourists in stores and in restaurants than in hotels, motels and bed and breakfasts. That's why a local city or town can be so impacted when one of our properties closes.
I don't think even a lot of our elected officials understand the positive impact of tourism.
Q. When it comes to jobs, though, doesn't tourism typically generate low-pay positions?
A. The tourism industry, and I include restaurants in that category, is able to provide jobs and training to people who are trying to enter the marketplace with no prior experience, and no particular skills.
We have young people who are getting their first jobs, who develop a work ethic and skills that they can put in a resume, and we give them references that they can cite when they transfer to another industry.
But we also have jobs in accounting, and computers, security, engineering, carpentry, electrical, plumbing, clerical and administrative -- we run the entire gamut.
Q. Do you see any disadvantages to promoting tourism?
A. No. None at all. It's a clean industry. It creates employment opportunities. We add to the tax base. In fact, it allows us to bring in dollars from out of state.
Q. But don't you need a year-round hospitable climate to build tourism?
A. That depends what you mean by hospitable. If you use the word hospitable in terms of "friendly," that we have. But I think what draws a lot of people to Connecticut really is the change in the seasons, and that's something that Orlando and Palm Beach will never have. Our peak season, actually, is in the fall.
Q. What kind of things can you do to promote tourism more?
A. Marketing Connecticut outside of the state. I sit on a committee that works with the departments of economic development from the southern New England states and tries to market them to Europe in an attempt to bring international dollars to New England.
We also need to look at how to market Connecticut within the state. I would venture a guess that a majority of people living in Connecticut have not even been to a third of our attractions. People who are disturbed that groups they are involved in are going out of state for conferences. Some of them are even funded, at least in part, by the state.
Q. Why did the association decide to change its name?
A. Because they decided to expand the membership. We came to realize is that Connecticut was not being viewed as a destination, it was being viewed as a pass-through state. So the board of directors decided to provide a reason for people to stay longer.
Even if people are here on a business trip, if we can show them what else we have here they might either extend their business trip, or come back sometime with their family.
The same is true for attractions. If they are viewed only as a day trip, they're not going to get the same kind of draw as if people were staying because they think there are enough things to do in the area.
Q. Have we broken the state into too many subdivisions for tourism promotion purposes?
A. I think it's important to keep in perspective the size of our state. After I came home from a meeting of the national association, I bought a kid's puzzle map that allowed me to take Connecticut out and compare it to other states, and you can drop it into a corner of most other states. You can get from one side of our state to the other in two or three hours.
We have 11 tourism districts right now. I think it's essential that there be one unified marketing plan that markets the state as a whole. I think right now there is some competition between the districts. I don't see all the districts showing up at the same trade shows, for instance.
Q. Should the state be building on the fame of Mystic, which is known around the world, or promoting lesser-known areas?
A. The theme that the Connecticut Tourism Department has adopted is that Connecticut is "Full of Surprises," which is promoting the entire state to some extent, but it's not a focused approach.
I think what would perhaps be more beneficial would be to choose different attractions from different areas and promote them as a loop you can drive -- start along the shore, then go up into the Quiet Corner in northeastern Connecticut, through Hartford and the Farmington Valley, and the Litchfield Hills, and back to the starting point.
We've found that most of our traffic is originating in New York and New Jersey, so I think that would be really doable.
Q. What made you decide to get out of law and into tourism?
A. I've always enjoyed organizing, since I was in high school. When a really close friend of mine died -- he and a few of his friends had gone to New York to drink because the age was lower there, and all four of them died in an automobile accident -- I organized a scholarship fund.
I spent a lot of time organizing for the Greater Hartford Jaycees. As an attorney, I ended up doing a lot of work for nonprofits, pro bono. I was spending most of my time doing work for different associations and groups, and I was enjoying it.
And there's a lot about law that I really don't like, although I think it's the best system in the world. It's become so adversarial, and I don't think there's any guarantee of justice. Many of the times justice does prevail it's a product of how much money you have and how good your attorney is, who the judge and jury were.
I think there's a certain amount of tumbles you take in life that you can't have any recourse for. That's just part of life -- you don't just turn around and sue for everything.
Over three or four years I came to realize law was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life.
There's not enough time left at the end of the day, if you're really working at a career, to do what you like. So you have to choose something that you really like, where you will be able to use your God-given skills.

HEADLINE: The Man Who Freed the Banks

BYLINE: By Nicholas Lemann; Nicholas Lemann is the national correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly.

 BODY:

Wriston
 Walter Wriston, Citibank, and
 the Rise and Fall of American
 Financial Supremacy.
 By Phillip L. Zweig.
 952 pp. New York:
 Crown Publishers. $40. 
 Banking is one of the handful of subjects that have generated intense controversy almost continuously through American history. It's tempting to think of all the many fights over it as having been ideological, pitting labor against capital, government against business, the little people against the rich. Judging from Phillip L. Zweig's new book, that's what Walter Wriston, an ardent conservative Republican, might think.
A more accurate model is of never-ending internecine warfare among conservative business interests that would divide much more cleanly into aggressive and traditional camps than into right- and left-wing ones. Mr. Wriston joined National City Bank, as it was then called, in 1946 and became its chief executive officer in 1967. During the early years of his career, banking was still operating in the shadow of 1929, its buccaneering element thoroughly disgraced and disabled by regulation. What big banks did was acquire money cheaply in the form of deposits and then lend it out at a modest profit to corporations. The sociology of banking was as unadventurous as the function: National City Bank's chairman and president were both scions of families long connected with the institution.
What Walter Wriston did in his 17-year reign was to make Citicorp the nation's leading banking company while transforming what it did. He represents the triumph of the aggressive tendency. A wide range of banking innovations -- as familiar as automatic teller machines, credit cards and money-market checking and as exotic (to nonbankers) as the Eurodollar market, swaps, holding companies and cross-border loans -- became standard procedure while he was running the company. Longstanding government bars to interstate banking, investment banking by commercial banks and high interest rates on deposits deteriorated under relentless pressure from Citicorp, among others. The big losers from this have been not so much ordinary people as the many second-tier big shots, like local bank presidents, who had been the main beneficiaries of the slow, careful system that Mr. Wriston helped destroy. Citicorp's effect on banking was a part of the larger trend toward increasing ruthless marketplace efficiency in American society.
The notion that Mr. Wriston was the exemplary figure and Citicorp the exemplary institution in a banking revolution is indisputable. The problem in Mr. Zweig's book is with the literary use of Mr. Wriston as subject of a biography.
Words like tough, cold, withdrawn and controlled come to people's minds as they describe Walter Wriston to Mr. Zweig. One Citi executive calls him "a dill pickle." Like many very successful people, he seems to have focused entirely on the one thing he does extremely well. Although he had very little free time, he would spend hours of what there was of it, according to Mr. Zweig, arguing "arcane accounting rules" with his wife. Citicorp has been involved in every conceivable world crisis, but Mr. Wriston's own life has been relatively unadventurous: he had one employer, the bank, and one home, Manhattan. When his biggest loan customer during the years of his rise, Aristotle Onassis, offered him a much higher-paying job, he turned it down to climb the company ladder. He had the chance to be Secretary of the Treasury in 1968 and again in 1974, but both times said no because the President hadn't asked him personally. His views, as described here, are strongly held but not so complicated or subtle as to reward detailed exploration: he believes the free market is good and government interference in it is bad.
And Mr. Zweig is resolutely uninterested in psychological speculation. The first words Walter Wriston ever spoke to his first wife were a proposal of marriage; then, Mr. Zweig says, it took her five years to get him to speak to her at breakfast. Nuggets like this appear regularly in "Wriston," but are let pass with no comment.
As a result, the book is at its heart less a biography than a company history, a genre in which it is far more difficult to engage readers without some relation to the company (or one of its competitors). Mr. Zweig, an editor at Business Week and the author of "Belly-Up: The Collapse of the Penn Square Bank," is an enormously energetic and careful reporter who must surely know more about Citicorp than any journalist has ever known about any bank. He has poured heart and soul into this book, spending seven years on it and turning in (he says in the acknowledgments) a 2,000-page manuscript. What he hasn't done is master the biographer's craft of shaping a narrative by pruning the inessential and presenting the subject's life as a series of dramatic incidents that are first set up and then resolved. Shorter than "War and Peace" but longer than "Anna Karenina," "Wriston" covers too much ground, has too many characters and adopts its hero's perspective without getting inside his head.
Walter Wriston's view is that he modernized Citicorp, transforming it from a conclave of preppies lolling in the shade of government regulation into a dynamic, democratic institution. This is partly true, but Mr. Zweig accepts it at face value, although, on his own evidence, even in the Wriston era Citicorp wasn't exactly Stuyvesant High School. Mr. Wriston's father, Henry Wriston, the president of Brown University, was a friend of the chairman of the bank's executive committee; his handpicked successor, John Reed, was the son of an executive of an important bank customer, the Armour meat company. Most Citi executives who appear in "Wriston" seem to be white male Protestants who live in Greenwich. (One of the few exceptions, Lawrence Small, is "a Jewish kid from the Bronx who could have passed for a WASP.")
Whenever the bank comes under political attack, Mr. Zweig tends to portray the attackers in the way that Mr. Wriston saw them -- as self-interested or impractical or ideological. Representative Wright Patman, the venerable Texas populist, "contributed . . . to the weakening of the American banking system." "Six of the most frightening words in the English language" are "Ralph Nader is on the line." Unionization, a horror the bank has always successfully beaten back, is to Mr. Zweig the same thing as "union rule." On the other hand, Mr. Wriston dislikes Wall Street and regards investment bankers as morally suspect: where he stands, it seems, is where he sits, in commercial banking. But Mr. Zweig elevates the automatic prejudices of someone in Mr. Wriston's position to the status of a philosophy.
As long as Mr. Wriston gets to be the great reformer of banking, whose enemies are the enemies of progress, the most telling criticism of him remains a little obscure, though the evidence for it is amply present in Mr. Zweig's prodigiously detailed reporting. Mr. Wriston wanted Citicorp to behave less like a quasi-public utility and more like a corporation; therefore he was more focused on earnings than on the traditional key statistic in banking, total assets. Mr. Zweig reports that Mr. Wriston's goal was for profit increases of 15 percent a year. What this inevitably did was to push the bank's culture toward excesses. Mr. Zweig provides us with many of these, from bribes of foreign officials, to large sums of money simply disappearing, to the booking of transactions in offices other than where they took place, to Asian drug running.
But the overriding excess was bad loans. All over the world, booms have attracted Citi bankers in search of heavy loan volume and high yields. Chief among the crunches that Citi got caught in was the debt crisis in Latin America, which Mr. Wriston, by encouraging headlong lending there, did much to create. The savings-and-loan crisis, which he personally had nothing to do with, is another notorious example of what can happen when his view that financial institutions should be unshackled obtains. Three years after Mr. Wriston's retirement, John Reed set aside $3 billion to cover loan losses in Latin America -- "the total of the bank's earnings for the last four years of Wriston's watch," as Mr. Zweig notes -- and the company failed to pay a quarterly dividend for the first time since 1813. Four years later, another enormous loan portfolio went sour, this time in commercial real estate. The bank almost went under.
There was a time, before the New Deal, when banks in such straits would lose their deposits in a great stampede of withdrawals, then collapse. Today, at least if the bank is as big as Citicorp, that doesn't happen; governments, our own and those of debtor nations, step in, and if there's a bill it is footed by taxpayers. The paradox of the bold and daring banking industry that Walter Wriston built is that it is so essentially incautious that it has to perform over a net.

HEADLINE: The View From: North Guilford;
A Farm Unchanged Since the 19th Century

BYLINE: By LAUREN BROWN 

 BODY:
NORTH of Route 80 in Guilford, hay fields still envelop hills and stretch across valleys. Cows graze and gnarly sugar maples line the roads. The Congregational and Episcopal Churches sit side by side on a hilltop. In spite of an occasional satellite disk or split-level house, one can still imagine oneself in another century.
It was in this part of town that Nathan and Amy Dudley had a son, David, in 1909. Nathan was a direct descendant of William Dudley, one of the founders of Guilford in 1639, and lived on land that had been passed from Dudley father to son since North Guilford was settled in the early 18th century. David Dudley grew up on the farm, served in World War II and returned. A bachelor, he lived on the farm with his parents until they died in the 1960's and on his own until he died in 1991. 
 Though he had a small circle of friends, he was often described as a loner, someone you wouldn't go to call on. His frugality was everywhere: His mattress was stuffed with corn husks. He had no central heat and anyone could see that he spent no money on exterior paint. "Nobody younger than me remembers driving by at night and ever seeing lights on in the house," says OliverScranton, a neighbor.
It came as quite a surprise when Mr. Dudley left an estate worth more than $500,000. Even more surprised were the beneficiaries: the North Guilford Congregational Church and the North Guilford Volunteer Fire Department.
"He was never a member of the Fire Company," said a company member, Henry Tichy, "and he never showed any intention of his inclinations." Since childhood, Mr. Dudley had belonged to the church, and contributed when asked, but he rarely, if ever, attended services.
His will specified that the 10-acre farm and his bank accounts be left as one entity, the proceeds from the sale of the property to be joined with the cash, and the total divided equally between the two organizations. This seemed straightforward enough, but the fire company began to have second thoughts.
Fire company members began to see the property, with its barn, 1844 farmhouse, and open fields, as a link to Guilford's almost-vanished agricultural past. They started toying with the idea of keeping the property and making it into a museum.
"I advised them against it," said Martin Wright, then a board member of the Guilford Preservation Alliance. "I said they'd never find the money, they'd never be able to run a museum; I was full of negatives. They didn't take my advice and I'm glad."
The Fire Company decided it wanted the house rather than the cash and worked out a distribution with the church. Then the work -- and the discovery -- began.
The inside of the house was a testament to strong personalities on the part of the owners, though what these traits might be called is open to question. Some would say frugality, some might say laziness, but the house certainly bespoke a world view that did not encompass change or active use.
The interior walls had one coat of paint. Floors were painted up to where the rugs would have been. Newspapers from 1961 covered some of the furniture. In the barn was a thriving colony of about 6,000 bats.
But beneath these manifestations of a singular life style, one fact came out loud and clear: the house was virtually unchanged since its original construction. A wing added in the early 20th century was equally intact. It was a textbook of past building techniques.
In spite of the marvel of the house's historical integrity, some changes had to be made. A $25,000 loan from the Preservation Alliance provided necessary cash for bringing the electrical system up to code, installing a caretaker apartment in the newer wing, and putting in a septic system. The exterior was painted for the first time since the 1940's. All the labor was volunteered.
Doug Williamson, an architect who has moved into the apartment and taken on many administrative tasks, inquired at the High School about joint projects. A history teacher, Jim Powers, and technology teacher, Tom Leddy, responded with gusto, organizing an elective course simply entitled "The Dudley Farm."
With the study of 19th-century life styles and economy as the umbrella theme, students have gained skills while undertaking useful tasks for the farm. Through primary research in the land records and probate court, they have put together a genealogy and history of farm ownership.
Through archeological research, they have started to reconstruct past configurations of the farm, and of the long-defunct mid-19th-century tannery across the street, from which David Dudley's forebears made a substantial income. In converting a shed for use as a workshop, they have learned the techniques of post-and-beam construction with hand tools.
With power tools, they have made new turnings for an early 20th-century front porch that had fallen into disrepair. An unexpected side benefit of the course has been a mixing of students from different groups within the school.
"We've got kids in this course who could go to any college in the country," said Mr. Powers, "working side by side with students who'll probably never go to college. They get to know each other and come to recognize each others' strengths and weaknesses."
Community reaction has been positive. An open house held in 1993 drew 400 people; one in 1995 drew 800. The farm, having outgrown its fire company connection, has been organized as a foundation and its goal made clear: to recreate a 19th-century working environment as a living museum.
Next Sunday, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., another open house will be held. (For more information, or directions, call 457-0770.)

HEADLINE: A Bright Patch in the Economic Gloom

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
SPRING fever. It's that time of year when thoughts go to vacation plans. And whether it's because of the success of the UConn Huskies basketball teams or a global rediscovery of New England, more and more people are being attracted to Connecticut.
In a decade when very little economic news has been worth cheering about, government officials and analysts alike get excited when discussing the $4 billion business, now accounting for nearly 5 percent of the gross state product. A three-year-old marketing campaign announcing that "We're Full of Surprises" apparently hit a bullseye with its main target: New York. Now, tourism officials will unleash the same message in places like Philadelphia and Albany, and also tailor a few vacation packages for travelers looking specifically for a little R.&R., adventure, culture or recreation. 
 "Three years ago, nobody knew much about us at all," said Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the Tourism Division of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development. "We were a real drive-through state. Our goal first was to provide general information and we've been successful. For every $1 we spend in advertising, we're seeing a return of $20."
From the results of surveys in target markets, screening of callers to the 800-CTBOUND travel information number and inflight questionaires filled out by travelers to Bradley International Airport, state tourism officials feel confident about future growth.
The tourism division expects to contract soon with a private firm to conduct an economic impact study, the first in a few years. While economists agree tourism is on the rise, except hotel occupancy rates and lodging taxes, any real numbers to measure tourism are described as "slippery." (Lodging tax revenues grew almost 15 percent in the past two years, to $32 million annually. One quarter of this is turned back to 11 tourism districts for more localized marketing of events, Mr. Dombroskas said.)
"Tourism has been identified as a potential engine of growth," said Peter Gioia, economist for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association.
"We were in the back seat and now we're in the front seat of this engine of growth," added Larry McHugh, vice chairman of the Connecticut Tourism Council and president of the 1,800-member Middlesex Chamber of Commerce, the largest in the state.
According to the tourism division, visitors to Welcome Centers around Connecticut increased by 36 percent in 1995 over 1994, to 538,535. And Connecticut has moved from seventh place to fifth place as a likely short vacation destination for its metropolitan New York target market. Inquiries to the toll-free travel number increased by 10 percent last year alone.
An estimated 40 percent to 60 percent of the people who seek information from the toll-free service actually visit the state, compared to the national conversion rate of 30 percent, said Mr. Dombroskas. That, he said, is because few other states have such a concentrated population center on which to draw. The convenience of getting here and the range of different experiences available keep people visiting, he explained.
"We see ourselves as the kind of vacation where you come for two or three nights, go back home, but come back again," Mr. Dombroskas said.
Tourism officials are realists; they know a Connecticut vacation does not excite every traveler. It is not as exotic as, say, the West, nor does it have an automatic appeal farther north. Surveys of Massachusetts residents have shown they don't think Connecticut offers anything different, closer, better or bigger than the attractions in their own state, said Mr. Dombroskas, and Connecticut doesn't have enough money to spend on a campaign to change their minds.
"But New England is being rediscovered as a destination," he said, attracting tourists from other parts of the United States and from abroad. "New England lost ground in the 1980's when people discovered North Carolina, South Carolina and California and air fares were lower. International travel here fell off, but now its recovering nicely. We're very different from the rest of the country. It's easy to get around, it's relaxed and full of culture and heritage."
Also, more airlines now are flying into Bradley, as well as the New York and Philadelphia airports. In the past, most flew into Boston and went north, skipping Connecticut, Mr. Dombroskas said. "It gives us the opportunity to catch them for a segment of their vacations," he added.
The Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard, the state's No. 1 tourist destination, attracts crowds not only from locations to the south but also in a major way, from northern New England and Canada. The tourism division is in the early stages of working out joint advertising with Foxwoods to encourage casino visitors to take in other sights as well.
"Most of Foxwoods' visitors are day trippers; they're only going there," said Mr. Dombroskas. "On the other hand, those visiting the area add Foxwoods to their itinerary. Foxwoods' growth is in the add-on visitors. We will be cross-promoting our properties."
In the state's $1.8 million media and marketing campaign, last year's major attraction was the Maritime Center of Norwalk, which had a record 501,000 visitors, followed by the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium and Mystic Seaport Museum.
Marcia Bittner, the marketing director of the Maritime Center, said it had a 70 percent rate of repeat visitors last year and attributed this partly to a big local audience for its Imax movies. About 75 percent of the visitors are from Connecticut and 15 percent from New York, she said. "The state has mentioned us in their New York ads and, no doubt, everything works together," Ms. Bittner said.
The Mystic Seaport Museum did not fare as well. Tricia Wood, a Seaport Museum spokeswoman, said the outdoor seaport expects to tally a drop of at least 5 percent in visitors for the fiscal year that ended April 30. She speculated that last summer's hot weather, hotel room shortages in Mystic and a perceived traffic scare because of the Special Olympics in New Haven may have kept some travelers away.
However, the seaport staff is pleased to be in the state's marketing materials.
"Who knows where we'd be without the state's campaign," said Ms. Wood. "We cooperate with it and believe in it. In the past three years, I've seen more unity. The hotels and attractions talk to each other more and work together. They've rallied different people and make it easier for the smaller institutions to cooperate with advertising."
While the numbers of visitors to the state's largest attractions did drop by 4 percent last year, visitors to smaller places, like art museums and the Valley Railroad in Essex, rose 9 percent, creating an overall increase of 2 percent, Mr. Dombroskas said. About 10,000 visitors followed the Connecticut Impressionist Art Trail, visiting 10 sites from Greenwich to Hartford housing the largest collection anywhere of Impressionist art, he said.
Three years ago, when the marketing campaign began, Connecticut was 49th out of the 50 states in dollars spent in promotion, said the tourism director. Today, it is 30th. Nearly $3.8 million of the $5.2 million department budget comes from the three-year-old Tourism Promotion Fund that collects $1 a day on every car rented in Connecticut.
Nationally, tourism represents 7 percent of the Gross National Product and Mr. Dombroskas wants to see Connecticut's figure equal that. How will the state accomplish this? With more target marketing, development of new attractions and improvements at existing tourist sites, he said.
Advertising dollars will be focused on four specific types of tourists: those looking for family-related activities, those seeking rest and relaxation, those who prefer active recreation and those focused on the arts, culture and heritage. Inserts in magazines began in March, and television and newspapers, in late April.
The campaign is meant to hit areas three hours away by car, including the Philadelphia market for the first time.
The tourism division continues to work with state educational institutions and the Connecticut Economic Resource Center, which tries to attract businesses to the state, to promote attractions and the state's quality of life. National attention to the Huskies has certainly raised the state's image, the tourism director said. "Thank goodness we have them. People are thinking about where UConn is and will come out and see it," Mr. Dombroskas said. The Huskies coach. Jim Calhoun, is a "real tourism fan," said Mr. Dombroskas. "He made a video for the state the year before last and has offered to help again."
Last summer, the tourism division gave out 30,000 copies of its Vacation Guide magazine to those at the Special Olympics and added the state's First Lady, Patricia Rowland, as a tourism ambassador. Mrs. Rowland has made television commercials and travels the state speaking of tourism. This spring, she and Gov. John G. Rowland will make a new commercial. One pitch will be to state residents themselves, since 20 percent of all leisure visitors to the state are friends and relatives of residents. Residents may not know about all the different attractions available, Mr. Dombroskas said. That, he feels, will change.

HEADLINE: State Puts Out Welcome Mat

BYLINE: By DIANE SIERPINA 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT is looking for your vacation dollars . . . and, for that matter, those of everyone else within reasonable driving distance.
It's obvious in the message of the brochures at the Welcome Centers in major highway rest stops. And it'll be even clearer as the state starts hawking its attributes on television, in publications and in several railroad stations -- pointing to beautiful natural scenery, rustic inns and cultural attractions . 
 "We'll be offering a Whitman Sampler box kind of packaging," said Edward Dombroskas, executive director of the Connecticut Department of Economic and Community Development's tourism division in Rocky Hill, that will encourage travelers to combine such action adventures as rafting and hiking with shopping trips, visits to art museums and stays at quaint inns.
And it won't matter if visitors arrive by automobile, train, bus or plane.
Last year, a small campaign in cooperation with the Metro-North Commuter Railroad called "Deals on Wheels" successfully attracted New York visitors by offering rail passengers discounts on car rentals and hotels in Connecticut. This year, the campaign will be expanded to promote regional tours and tourist attractions, the idea being to make these visitors stay and spend money.
"The first campaign didn't move them to other sites," said Mr. Dombroskas. "We want to change the mindset so they will use trains for leisure travel and not just commuting."
In one promotion to be kicked off later this spring, visitors from three Metro-North stations in New York State will be taken to New Haven, where they can connect to a bus going to the Mystic Marinelife Aquarium and Mystic Seaport or the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Ledyard. Both trips offer discount coupons for such things as factory outlet stores, hotels and restaurants -- and even gambling credits.
The state also has an arrangement with Getaway Tours Inc., of Terryville, which is promoting train and bus trips from Brewster North Station, in Putnam County, to Litchfield. One package offers a culinary event and visit to the downtown area and another includes a visit to Haight Vineyard, the oldest in the state; the White Flower Farm, with its eight acres of gardens and 20 acres of growing fields, and the New England Carousel Museum in Bristol.
Other trips are planned to Gillette Castle in Hadlyme, which includes a ride on the Essex steam train and riverboat, to the Quinnehutkut Rendezvous and Native American Festival in Haddam Meadows State Park in August and to the Durham Fair in September.
Tourism officials also point to new programs and renovations this year at the Mark Twain House in Hartford and the Mystic Seaport Museum. For the first time this summer, the Mark Twain Musical -- which was performed in previous years in Elmira, N.Y., where Mark Twain is buried -- will be held in Hartford.
The Mystic Seaport Museum is renovating a large building across from its main property that will become the American Maritime Education and Research Center, said Tricia Wood, a spokeswoman. Sections of the building will house a large watercraft collection open to the public.
The International Festival of Arts and Ideas will take place in New Haven this summer and will be an annual event, Mr. Dombroskas said. And an undersea camp called Project Oceanology, similar to the astronaut camp in Alabama, will open in New London later this year, instructing participants in submarine procedures, he added.
And that is just the beginning. A comprehensive strategic plan is expected to be completed by the end of the year, Mr. Dombroskas said.
Connecticut and Utah are the only states nationwide conducting such strategic plans, Mr. Dombroskas said. The report will even let managers of existing attractions know if visitors find their sites dirty, inaccessible, expensive or boring -- and how they might solve the problems, the tourism director said. And it will be a tool for investors and financial institutions to judge the merit of new projects, he added.
Tourism is the only industry in Connecticut that has grown each economic quarter of the last three years, Mr. Dombroskas said. "A decision was made that tourism had the potential to be an economic base for Connecticut," he said. "All we needed to do was promote it as a destination."

HEADLINE: ART;
Overrun, SoHo's Art World Shifts Ground

BYLINE: By AMEI WALLACH; Amei Wallach is the author of "Ilya Kabakov: The Man Who Never Threw Anything Away," published this month by Abrams.

 BODY:
LAST WEEKEND, WHEN MARY Boone abandoned SoHo and reopened her gallery in the triangle between Bergdorf's and the Warner Brothers store on 57th Street, the move could have been interpreted as the belated logical conclusion to the 80's, the profligate decade she and her artists have come to represent. When Paula Cooper sent out a newsletter announcing that her gallery, too, would be migrating north, it seemed the symbolic end not only of a time but of a place. Ms. Cooper had homesteaded the SoHo neighborhood in 1968, when it consisted largely of commercial lofts and struggling manufacturers, when virtually the only place to eat lunch was Fanelli's and trucks with logos like Pinking Shears Corporation owned the streets.
There's more. The longtime SoHo veterans Annina Nosei and Pat Hearn moved to "gallery row" on West 22d Street in Chelsea last year. Barbara Gladstone and Metro Pictures will open nearby in the fall in a building they have just purchased with Matthew Marks, who moved there two and a half years ago. Max Protetch is tempted to sell the lucrative lease on his space above Dean & DeLuca on Broadway and Prince and join the parade to the far-West 20's. 
 Yet while SoHo as we know it may be on the endangered list, rumors of the section's imminent death as an art center are exaggerated. SoHo is going through changes that are generational, economic, geographical and art historical, and the exodus is not likely to undermine it in the near future.
"If one night all the galleries in SoHo moved out in unison and just disappeared, most of the people who come to SoHo now would not even know they had gone," said Ronald Feldman, who has been in SoHo since 1981. "That's not to say SoHo doesn't still have the largest audience for contemporary art in the world. We're poised at a moment when the neighborhood is still viable for the arts."
This time the ebb and flow, which has long been a feature of SoHo's art scene, has a lot to do with what arrived during the last two years: national retail chains like Williams-Sonoma, Banana Republic, Eddie Bauer and the Nature Company, and the shoppers and rising real estate prices that accompanied them. In addition, a growing multimedia industry is bringing new technologies to the area as well as attracting new audiences for art and commerce.
SoHo, the area south of Houston Street to Canal Street between the Avenue of the Americas on the west and Lafayette Street on the east, is also reinventing itself by subdividing: northern SoHo, north of Broome Street, where the larger galleries have established themselves, is now retail country with fewer and fewer blue-chip galleries like Sonnabend and Castelli. But new, young, experimental or Euro-chic galleries are moving into small, less expensive spaces in the less commercial part of SoHo south of Broome. "SoSoHo, we call it," said the dealer Stephano Basilico.
A great deal of the new energy is centered in southern SoHo. Jeffrey Deitch, who has advised collectors on what's next for two decades, pronounces southern SoHo "the place now for emerging art."
"This is the first time since the East Village that there is this convergence of all these young people in one location," added Mr. Deitch, who has opened a gallery three days a week on Grand Street.
Other participants also see virtues in the changing times. "SoHo has 100,000 tourists on the weekend; the place is clean; the real estate values have gone up; a lot of galleries are leaving the ground floor because rents are going up," said Henry Buhl, founder of SoHo Partnership, a privately financed pilot project that among other things publishes The SoHo Guide and pays the homeless to sweep the streets. "But there are new galleries too," he said, referring to the smaller galleries that are opening as some of the large, established ones leave.
No one agrees on the exact number of galleries in SoHo. In February 1987, at the height of the 80's boom, Art Now Gallery Guide listed 169 galleries and nonprofit spaces. The guide charges a fee for a listing, so the actual number of galleries was probably higher. In the depths of the art-world recession in February 1993, the list had shrunk to 117. By this February, it had nearly doubled, to 232.
The Art in America Annual Guide to Galleries, Museums, Artists lists 295 galleries on its computer this season, up from 207 in 1993. The guide is free to listers and defines the area by the 10012 and 10013 ZIP codes (an area slightly larger than official SoHo). Steven Anzovin, the manager of the directory, says there has also been an explosion in the number of ad hoc private dealers and studio galleries that are not listed.
Mr. Buhl estimates that there has been a "net increase" of 45 galleries in SoHo between 1994 and 1995. He includes in the number a new species of mass-market gallery, one that is open on Sunday, when, as Marion Cajori, a film maker and SoHo resident puts it, "there's a certain innocence to the people who come to shop and say, 'Let's look at art.' "
"They can't tell the difference between a gallery of fake Impressionist paintings and Mary Boone," she said.
Northern SoHo in 1996 is a couple overheard among the painted chests at the Pottery Barn on Broadway: "Since we have a corner for plants, can we have a corner for tchotchkes?" It's two students from Sophia University in Tokyo perched on stools at the Dean & DeLuca cafe studying a Japanese tour guide for directions to Agnes B.
Southern SoHo in 1996 is Friedrich Petzel, 32, wandering through his gallery, which is bare but for two molded-plywood tables and six chairs made by the 35-year-old Cuban-born artist Jorge Pardo, who treads the thin line between modernist sculpture and modernist furniture. It is Mr. Basilico, 33, in his Wooster Street space with a debut installation by 32-year-old Brian Tolle of a large-scale, generic New England Colonial room that addresses the political, social and esthetic ways in which American history is recast and reused.
In southern SoHo, the concentration of galleries is reaching critical mass: 48 so far from TZ'Art to Lombard-Freid, and more are on the way. Boesky & Callery opened in March on Greene Street, and Lauren Wittels will move there in September from a 400-square-foot shoe box at 580 Broadway. In her new space, she'll split 5,000 square feet with the dealer Casey Kaplan. "In the future there will be two places for art, lower SoHo and Chelsea," Ms. Wittels said, conveying more attitude than a young Mary Boone. "The big-shot galleries will be going to 57th Street. That doesn't affect me."
Ms. Wittels is 28, and like many of the other young gallery owners populating southern SoHo, she served an apprenticeship elsewhere, as director of the Luhring Augustine Gallery on Prince Street.
Mr. Basilico was still working at Sonnabend Gallery in 1993 when he opened his first show in 600 square feet of space that rented for $600. He continued at Sonnabend for 18 months while mounting occasional exhibitions in a series of spaces left vacant by galleries that had failed during the recession. Finally, he said, "like a hermit crab I grew out of my shell."
"Essentially this is the way SoHo was at the end of the 70's," he added.
Even in the 70's, there were worries about commercialization. In 1979, in Alexandra Anderson and B. J. Archer's "SoHo: The Essential Guide to Art and Life in Lower Manhattan," Stephen Koch wrote: "Ever since there has been a SoHo, people have been grimly pronouncing it to be 'over.' It isn't 'over.' But it has become too expensive, too fancy, too tyrannical in its elegances."
In 1979, good restaurants were still so sparse that artists and dancers took turns cleaning and cooking at the co-op Food. Mary Boone's first tiny gallery at 420 West Broadway had been open for only two years. "Galleries and retail have been integrated for a longer period of time uptown; downtown is still trying to work out the dichotomy," Ms. Boone said. "The way, specifically, it works is that most galleries are not at street level uptown. In SoHo, what was once an asset, to be on the ground floor, is now a liability. With hordes of people coming through the streets, they go in every door. Ten very serious people coming in and really enjoying the show is better than 10,000 hecklers."
Ground-floor space in most of northern SoHo has become too expensive for galleries to hang onto. Annina Nosei rented to Miu Miu, a Prada store, and moved to Chelsea in part because her SoHo space had become so "financially rewarding," she said, that it would have been "a waste of money not to make a considerable income from it."
Mary Boone's lease was up, and she was in a rent dispute with her landlords. As for Paula Cooper, she owns the space she is leaving on Wooster Street near Houston, an area she calls the Gold Coast of SoHo.' And though she promised in her newsletter that she would not rent to the Gap, she expects that her new tenant will be a retailer. "I hadn't even thought that a gallery could take it," Ms. Cooper said.
Retail rents along Broadway and West Broadway are approaching $100 a square foot, according to Caroline Banker, a SoHo specialist at New Spectrum Realty in midtown Manhattan. This gives her pause. Rents reached $100 a square foot on West Broadway in 1989; that year there were 11 empty stores, and rents plummeted.
As Gold Coast rents in SoHo again approach a late-80's high, Ms. Banker is concerned that "this is what happened to Columbus Avenue just before the bust."
"SoHo is a wonderful market," she said, "but 80 percent of sales are still made on weekends, so if you have a lousy weekend weatherwise, your sales are shot."
When the rents for upstairs spaces, which galleries prefer, plummeted in the early 90's, many new, young galleries were able to gain a toehold. Landlords were so frantically stalking deals that the experimental space Exit Art discovered it could rent 17,000 square feet on the second floor at 548 Broadway for less than it had been paying for 10,000 square feet a block north. Exit Art moved and reinvented itself by adding a cafe, a shop and a performance space. And that, in different ways, is what galleries like Paula Cooper, Mary Boone and Barbara Gladstone are doing as they move north.
I THINK DEALERS, LIKE artists, have a responsibility to reinvent themselves," said Ms. Boone. Ms. Gladstone wants to own her space. "Personally, I want a different kind of space," she said. "I want to be able to drive a truck into a space."
Antonio Homem, director of the Sonnabend Gallery, which plans to stay in SoHo, said: "When times are difficult, artists change galleries and galleries change location. In both situations, it is a desperate attempt to change your situation." Upstairs at 420 West Broadway, the epicenter of SoHo, 8,000 square feet of gallery space has been virtually empty for two years.
The dealers who are moving to Chelsea sing its praises as "quieter, more fun, more focused, more serious," Ms. Cooper said. "It's a little harder to get to, so people will go there specifically."
This enrages the artist Chuck Close, who has had a studio in SoHo since 1967. "I'm quite offended by the notion that street traffic is bad," he said. "Just because somebody walks by with an ice cream cone in hand doesn't mean they're an idiot. Is art just this elitist thing?"
For his part, Mr. Close said he prefers showing at the SoHo branch of the blue-chip uptown PaceWildenstein Gallery. "I had show after show at the 57th Street gallery," he said. "No one ever mentions seeing those show compared to these."
As for Chelsea, Mr. Close points out that in 1985, when "Larry Gagosian did some really important shows there, no one saw them." In 1989, Mr. Gagosian moved his gallery to Madison Avenue and in 1991 opened his Wooster Street branch in SoHo.
"To me, restaurants and stores are not dirty words," Mr. Gagosian said. "But you're talking to a property owner. If Chanel wanted to pay me $20 million for my building, welcome, Chanel! Right now I think SoHo is a great place to have a gallery. And artists live there. Also, I have a Damien Hirst show on," he said, referring to the controversial British artist's cows and pigs in formaldehyde. "How could you show that uptown?"
Not that Chelsea couldn't one day go the way of SoHo. Like SoHo, Chelsea is zoned for manufacturing but with none of the retail or restaurant restrictions that had been imposed to impede galloping commercialism downtown. At the moment, however, spaces are raw in Chelsea; it takes capital to improve them, and it takes a loyal following of collectors to make an area successful. Large galleries can afford to take the gamble on real estate, which could boom with the expansion of the Chelsea Piers, the sports complex on the Hudson River.
The new galleries in southern SoHo understand that their situation, too, is precarious. The Broadway Panhandler kitchen equipment store has relocated to their neighborhood; a new hotel will open soon. Their $20-a-square-foot storefront rents could soon be a thing of the past.
"It will change, but, you know, everything changes," said the gallery owner Friedrich Petzel, whose budget allows for rent but not capital investment. "If I were Metro Pictures, I'd go to Chelsea too."

I've been in this space since 1973, and I'm a little bored, frankly. I love changing spaces and building spaces. I'm bored with this space, and I don't like the area anymore." Paula Cooper; "Initially when I opened in SoHo, it was because it was an area largely attached to art and artists. Now the large proportion of the activity here is linked to retail, and I just feel if I'm going to be in the midst of retail, I'd rather be in the midst of retail I like."

HEADLINE: FILM;
Hollywood's Newest Boys of Summer

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CHUCK RUSSELL WAS nervous. The 42-year-old director of "Eraser," a mega-expensive Arnold Schwarzenegger action film opening on June 21, had heard all the stories about the movie's turbulent shooting schedule, the extra weeks of filming, the script revisions even as cameras rolled. "There's nothing economical or particularly cheap about doing this kind of film," he said, taking a deep breath. "The studio knew what was going on." Another deep breath. "Every movie is a tough movie," he said, smiling at the understatement.
A mile or so away from Mr. Russell's spare office at Warner Brothers, Jan De Bont was completing work on a sound stage at Universal Studios in advance of his big film about tornado chasers, "Twister." He labored seven days a week, well into the night, with an exhausted staff, to finish the movie, whose opening began the summer movie season on Friday. "We had seven producers and almost three studios involved in this picture," said the 52-year-old Mr. De Bont. "A very expensive movie." 
 With "almost" three studios involved, was there much hands-on interference?
He laughed. The movie was shot in Oklahoma and Iowa. "No hotels, no restaurants," he said. "So nobody from Hollywood showed up. Had it been Paris, well, it would have been a nightmare."
And across town at 20th Century Fox, Roland Emmerich, the 40-year-old director and co-creator of "Independence Day," an epic about an alien invasion, slumped in a chair, unshaven, in tattered jeans and loose sweatshirt. He did not expect to complete the film until several days before it opens on July 3. A visitor wished him good luck. "I need it," he said, rolling his eyes. "I really need it."
Welcome to the summer of '96. Has there been such a season, in which studios handed the keys to the bank to so many relatively untested film makers whose modest efforts proved successful two years ago?
Mr. Russell's comedy "The Mask," starring Jim Carrey, took in more than $100 million in the United States alone. Mr. De Bont, formerly a director of photography on "Black Rain," and "Lethal Weapon 3," established himself as a top action director with his first film, "Speed." And Mr. Emmerich's films, the 1992 adventure "Universal Soldier," starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and, two years ago, "Stargate," set the stage for "Independence Day." These directors' new films cost at least $100 million each, including marketing costs of $20 to $30 million.
There are other potential summer movie blockbusters coming, including most prominently "Mission: Impossible," starring Tom Cruise and directed by Brian De Palma. There's "The Rock," directed by Michael Bay, a former video director, whose first successful film, "Bad Boys," led to this prison drama starring Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage. Also on tap is "The Cable Guy," starring Jim Carrey and directed by Ben Stiller, whose first film was "Reality Bites," and the 10th-century adventure "Dragonheart," directed by Rob Cohen, whose previous films include "Dragon: The Bruce Lee Story."
But except for "Mission: Impossible," which is, after all, the work of a veteran film maker, none of the other summer movies are as spectacular and expensive as "Twister," "Eraser" and "Independence Day."
Summer is the season of fear and panic in Hollywood, even more than other times of the year. Half the annual box office is taken in over this year's 17-week summer season, and studios roll out their big guns in this period. This summer seems especially nerve-racking because of the Olympics in Atlanta; the heavy television coverage of the games will probably reduce moviegoing for two weeks or so.
All this put special pressures on the directors of "Eraser," "Twister" and "Independence Day."
 
For 'Eraser,' Problems At the Starting Gate
With "Eraser," which is about a Government agent who eliminates the backgrounds of people in the witness protection program, there were problems almost at the outset, partly because of Mr. Russell's inexperience, partly because of the complicated visual and special effects. The film went over budget, and there were reports of turmoil on the set. At least four writers contributed to the script, and the romantic ending was filmed and refilmed until the bitter end.
"We were constantly making changes in the script, but that's nothing new," said Arnold Kopelson, the producer who has made such movies as "Seven," "The Fugitive" and "Outbreak," often working with his wife, Anne. "On 'The Fugitive,' I had nine writers, and one stayed until the last day of filming. On 'Outbreak' we had four. It's the process."
Privately, people connected to the film said Mr. Russell's indecisiveness, as well as routine overscheduling, contributed to some of the turmoil. But a recent research screening of the film reportedly brought positive responses.
Although Mr. Russell seems especially under siege at the moment, he remains self-possessed and surprisingly confident. He rose through the ranks of Hollywood under the tutelage of such film makers as Roger Corman. Mr. Russell directed "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors" in 1987, the best of that series.
His directorial breakthrough came when he cast the then relatively unknown Jim Carrey in "The Mask," initially intended as a horror film but transformed by the director into a bizarre 1994 comedy with splendid computer graphics, a Russell specialty.
Following "The Mask," Mr. Russell was offered numerous comedy and fantasy projects but yearned to make a big-budget action drama based on Rafael Sabatini's swashbuckling novel "Captain Blood." His collaborator was a close friend, Frank Darabont, who later wrote and directed "The Shawshank Redemption." They worked on the project with Mr. Schwarzenegger, but it fell apart when studios decided that too many sword-and-pirate movies were under way.
"Arnold said, 'Let's look for something more contemporary,' " recalled Mr. Russell. "And then we came across this script by Tony Puryear." Mr. Puryear, a former advertising and music-video director, had written a script about a Federal marshal who unmasks a conspiracy.
"I really do respond to the fantasy of a hero and a crucible, and Schwarzenegger can pull it off like no one else," Mr. Russell said. The film's cast includes Vanessa Williams, James Caan and James Coburn.
Mr. Kopelson, for his part, speaks with restrained enthusiasm about Mr. Russell.
"Chuck really convinced us that he was the guy to direct the movie," Mr. Kopelson said, adding that it was Mr. Schwarzenegger's idea to consider Mr. Russell for director. "Chuck will have a lot more experience the next time, and he'll be one of the great action directors. This was on-the-job training of such a high magnitude because of the size of the movie. And action sequences, even for a highly experienced director, are sometimes very difficult to plan. On a big action movie, you always go over budget."
Mr. Russell seems bewildered about reports of confusion on the set, reports he termed overstated. "The truth is, it comes with the territory, especially when you're doing a film with Arnold Schwarzenegger," he said. "I don't want to pretend I'm not concerned. I am. I had my eyes open when I took this job. And there are people who avoid big films for this very reason." He shrugged. "Whatever the judgment may be, the audience has the final word. That's what's so, so scary, and great, about it."
 
'Twister,' a Film With Many Parents
Unlike the beleaguered Mr. Russell, Jan De Bont exudes brashness, a brashness he insists was crucial to his survival as the director of "Twister."
The film's pedigree seemed awesome and would have intimidated most directors. Warner Brothers and Universal are producing the film jointly, an unusual venture undertaken to limit the financial risks. Amblin, which is owned by Steven Spielberg, was also a producer. The screenplay was by Michael Crichton and his wife, Anne-Marie Martin.
Leading the cast is Helen Hunt of the hit television series "Mad About You" as a woman who heads a team of scientists who patrol Oklahoma trying to uncover the mysteries of tornadoes. Also featured is Bill Paxton, as her former husband, Billy, who is about to remarry, and needs a signed copy of the divorce papers from her. (Billy, you see, is about to give up tornado-chasing to become a stay-at-home weatherman.)
But the real stars, of course, are the computer-generated tornadoes that swirl onto the screen every few minutes like unpredictable monsters. Mr. De Bont said the technical effects were far more difficult to bring off than those in "Jurassic Park."
"It was majorly complicated," he said. He had also warned the actors that the filming would be "wet, muddy and uncomfortable."
It was. By the end of filming, Mr. De Bont was exhausted.
"It was like nothing that I've encountered in my life," he said. "We were filming in the middle of nowhere with a crew of 350 people. We had major rainstorms, and we were shooting with tornadoes all around us. We had the worst flooding last year in Oklahoma. We kept getting stuck in mud. The whole thing was like moving a circus around dirt roads."
By some accounts Mr. De Bont was hardly an easy person to work with, but then few directors of action films are known for their delicate sensibilities. Crew members were dismissed. The studios strongly resisted his efforts to hire Ms. Hunt, because they were afraid that she would be unable to complete the film in time to return to her television series. Mr. De Bont prevailed, overcoming both studio executives and the producers.
"It happens all the time; it's nothing new," said Mr. De Bont, who has already begun work on his next film, "Speed 2."
"I had to fight very hard to keep my view intact, especially having to deal with that many people. You spend two years of your life on a movie, day and night, and that's why it's so important to stand up and fight for what you believe in."
Kathleen Kennedy, one of the producers, said there was little worry about Mr. De Bont's relative lack of directorial experience. "Had he not done 'Speed,' it would have been a cause of concern," she said. "Jan has a tremendous eye for energy and composition in his shooting.
"Look at 'Speed,' she continued. "There's really a unique feeling about it. What Jan's about is putting you in the experience. And that's a very important aspect to 'Twister.' "
 
'Independence Day': Favored at the Start
If there's one summer film that has caught the attention of the movie industry, it's "Independence Day," Mr. Emmerich's updated war-of-the-worlds fantasy whose cast includes Bill Pullman as the Clintonesque President and Will Smith as a Marine fighter pilot. Also in the film are Jeff Goldblum, Mary McDonnell, Judd Hirsch, Randy Quaid and Harvey Fierstein. But as with "Eraser" and "Twister," the cast is secondary to the special effects.
A trailer for "Independence Day" was shown back in January during the Super Bowl with the intent of scaring away other big movies on its opening weekend. It worked, and the film is opening with no major competitors on Wednesday, July 3.
A longer trailer was also shown last month at a convention of several thousand movie-theater owners in Las Vegas, and it became the talk of the town, further discouraging most rival studios. (Paramount has decided to open a children's film that day, "Harriet the Spy," and Disney's Touchstone division will offer "Phenomenon," a science fiction fantasy starring John Travolta.) The trailer for "Independence Day" depicts the arrival of a deadly alien force and, subsequently, New York's skyline crumbling and the White House exploding.
The German-born Mr. Emmerich, whose career has been marked by futuristic action and special effects films, got the idea for "Independence Day" two years ago when he was promoting "Stargate." "Stargate," which took in more than $200 million worldwide, was an unexpectedly successful film about a space captain (Kurt Russell) and an archeologist (James Spader) exploring a planet that resembled ancient Egypt.
While meeting journalists in Los Angeles, Mr. Emmerich remarked that he did not believe in space aliens. As Dean Devlin, his writing partner and producer, remembers it, journalists asked, "How can you make a movie like 'Stargate' and not believe in aliens?"
Mr. Emmerich replied: "I believe in fantasy. I believe in the great 'What if?' What if aliens showed up? Wouldn't that be the most exciting thing that could happen?"
Mr. Devlin said, "He then walked over to me and said, 'I think we've got our next movie.' "
The two promptly rented a house in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, and worked for nearly three weeks to finish a rough script. They continued writing for two more weeks in London and Paris while they promoted "Stargate." They then gave the finished screenplay to their agent, Michael Wimer at Creative Artists Agency.
"We wanted to go immediately into production," said Mr. Emmerich. Hours after the script was sent around to studios, bids began coming in. One studio, 20th Century Fox, led the way.
"We read it overnight," said Peter Chernin, the chairman of 20th Century Fox, "and got them in the next morning and said, 'We're not letting you leave the office until we make a deal on this.' We closed the deal that afternoon." Pre-production began almost immediately.
It was, of course, a major gamble to hand over at least $70 million to a film maker with a somewhat quirky sensibility and give him virtually total control over the project. "It was a somewhat unique situation," said Mr. Chernin. "I was impressed with what he did in 'Stargate,' particularly the look, the scope, the spectacle of it. Actually, I started chasing him at that point."
For his part, Mr. Emmerich said he was astonished by the studio's hands-off approach. Except for concern about the film's length -- it has been trimmed to about 2 hours and 15 minutes -- there were few issues raised by Fox executives. "They were amazing, actually," Mr. Emmerich said.
Paradoxically, Mr. Emmerich's next film, a remake of "Godzilla," is one that Mr. De Bont had been in pre-production on for nine months before he dropped out over budget issues to begin work on "Twister."
Despite the hopes riding on "Twister" and the other big summer movies, Mr. Emmerich says he is not intimidated by the scale of his undertaking. "You have to keep in mind not to take the movie or yourself too seriously," he said. "These movies are what they are. Nothing more. Nothing less."

HEADLINE: Mt. Vernon Library Marks Its 100th Year

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON

 BODY:
ON any day, Sundays included, the Mount Vernon Public Library here is filled with people.
Upstairs in the Adult Department are high school students, older people and law students reading, researching, book browsing or surfing the Internet. Downstairs in the Children's Department are children and parents listening to African folk tales told with "friendship" dolls or playing games on a computer. 
 The library has proudly served this changing city for 100 years, having received its charter on March 19, 1896. The document, housed in an oak-paneled closet in the administrative offices, is signed by Melvil Dewey, State Librarian/Secretary to the Board of Regents and a founder of the American Library Association, who is best remembered for developing the Dewey Decimal System for book classification.
With more than 450,000 books in its collection, the Mount Vernon Public Library is the sixth largest public library in the state and the second largest in the New York City region, second only to the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue. This Federal Depository library started with the purchase of a novel, "Jealousy; or Teverino" by George Sand (published by T. B. Peterson and Brothers of Philadelphia). In 1898 the library was at Mount Vernon Public High School in the old Sophie J. Mee Administration Building.
At that time it was also under the auspices of the Board of Education. In 1904 the present neo-classical structure on South First Avenue was erected.
The entrance to the library features columned wood panels, an arched vaulted ceiling and stained-glass skylights. Known as a Carnegie Library, the Mount Vernon Public Library was built with a grant from the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Between 1897 and 1917 the steel magnate Andrew Carnegie gave millions of dollars to build more than 2,800 libraries nationwide.
Mary A. Brown, director of the Mount Vernon Public Library, said:
"In 1937 this was a state-of-the-art library. People came from all over the world and visited this library. The consulting work and the design were done by the leading library-building specialist and architect of the time." The library's architect and technical consultant, Alfred Morton Githens and Joseph L. Wheeler, wrote "The American Public Library Building" (Charles Scribner's Sons), of which Ms. Brown said: "This book was then and remains in its later edition, the major textbook for library administration, which is used in library schools all over the country."
During the Carnegie era, the concept of the public library was revolutionized. Libraries for the first time in America became educational and cultural centers, open to all citizens. The Mount Vernon Public Library has operated for a century with the same philosophy, which is that libraries should stimulate everyone through the use of good books. In addition, they should stimulate intellectual and cultural progress, enjoyment and satisfaction of the community, a philosophy propounded by Githens and Wheeler.
"The importance of the anniversary lies in the future of the library," Ms. Brown said. "The fact that by coincidence the anniversary and the arrival of public availability of the Internet came to us at about the same time is a very important bellwether for the next century." She continued: "There was a time when only the very wealthy people owned books. One of the things that the public library movement has done worldwide is make books available to everyone. And I think now libraries are doing that for computers and electronic resources like the Internet." In March a computer terminal with color monitor was installed to help library users surf the Internet. Three more are expected later this spring.
Andrew Warshaw, a 24-year-old Bronx resident who comes to the Mount Vernon Public Library once a week because his local library is closed on Sundays, uses the new Internet terminal to search for a job. As he perused a corporate website, he said of the Mount Vernon library: "They have a very good career-resource reference center. I do a lot of career searches on the Internet." Wearing a gray sweatshirt with the legend "Miami University of Ohio," Mr. Warshaw stood at the computer and explained that he was a 1994 graduate who studied business and finance.
The Mount Vernon Library is the central library of the 37-member Westchester Library System. As the main library of the county, it serves not only residents of Mount Vernon but also all of the system's member libraries. The library receives $300,000 a year from the state because of its dual role as local resource center and regional information repository.
Ms. Brown said, "All of the stuff that is delivered electronically and indexed electronically has to come from somewhere, and where it comes from is from large libraries like this one." The library responds to more than 20,000 item requests a year, she said.
The documents and delivery department has two toll-free phone numbers (for Westchester library use only), and there is a computer information center devoted to outside-item requests. Library-item requests are fulfilled by fax or next-day delivery service.
Mayor Ernest D. Davis of Mount Vernon said: "It is a library that is well used. It occupies a special niche in the county. This lofty position signifies a lot about our city, and that is why we want to have more functions there. We have to give respect to learning and to institutions of learning."
Although the library is a well-used resource, with notable collections in children's literature, film and video and in law -- the Mills Law Collection is the only one of its kind in the county -- it has to cope with a shrinking budget and a staff that has declined to 65 now from in 84 as recently as 1991. The stately building, with a frescoed exhibition rotunda, is 92 years old and not aging as well as the institution's stature.
Ms. Brown, Mayor Davis and the library's trustees say they hope to improve the physical plant in the next year. They attribute the library's fiscal shortcomings to the city's restrained economic condition.
The library has close ties to the city's Recreation Department and the Mount Vernon public school system. It was the first in the country to initiate a voluntary adult literacy program. It houses 33 foreign-language collections on a variety of subjects.
Ms. Brown said: "Mount Vernon is a city that values its library. I have worked in a few communities. I've been in Rye, in Armonk and in a variety of communities in the city, and Mount Vernon values its library in a unique way. I don't have to make the case for the library in Mount Vernon. The people make the case for the library. In this city of 65,000, people support this large library. And they do it because they know it's important."
This spring the circulation desk will be centralized and redesigned. The library has received a small community block grant to install doors for disabled users, and there will be some improvements in landscaping. The library's administration is also considering installing air-conditioning.
Ms. Brown said: "This is a very interesting time to be a librarian because the entire base of the profession is changing from print-based to electronic-based information. Libraries used to be warehouses, and now I think we are seeing libraries as much more interactive."

HEADLINE: Single Mothers, by Choice, On the Increase

BYLINE: By RAHEL MUSLEAH 

 BODY:
SHEILA MORRISSEY had always assumed that she would be married and have a family. But by her mid-30's, when she realized that marriage was not in her immediate future, she decided to become a mother.
Her son, Daniel, whom she conceived through artificial insemination, is now 4. 
 "I've always been the kind of person who tried to follow societal norms," Ms. Morrissey said. "But I couldn't face the future happily without a child. I didn't tell my parents until after I got pregnant. My mother wanted me to terminate the pregnancy. Eventually she became my labor coach."
Although the typical single mother on Long Island is
divorced, single mothers like Ms. Morrissey are growing
in number, authorities in the field say.
Single Mothers by Choice, a network of support groups, has a Long Island branch with 50 members, according to Ms. Morrissey, who heads the four-year-old chapter. Most of the members are professional women with college educations or graduate degrees who earn $40,000 a year or more, the group says. About 40 percent conceived through donor insemination and 50 percent through relationships or known donors.
Ten percent are considering single motherhood or have adopted, Ms. Morrissey said.
"Women feel childbearing is very important, and there's an increased awareness of how hard it is to find a stable relationship," said Jane Mattes, founder of the 2,000-member network, which has its headquarters in Manhattan.
Women are joining in their early 30's, instead of their middle to late 30's, Ms. Mattes said, adding, "Women are starting to think about motherhood earlier, because fertility drops dramatically after age 36, and some want two children."
The biggest misunderstanding, she said, is that the women are not interested in marriage. In a sampling of 150 members, 147 said they would rather be married to a loving spouse. But when asked whether they would rather be married to just anyone, they answered no.
Dr. Leah Klungness, a psychologist in Locust Valley and co-author of a new book, "The Complete Single Mother" (Adams), said there were nearly 11 million single mothers in the United States. In 1994, Dr. Klungness said, 28 percent of all births, totaling more than a million, were to single mothers.
The steepest increase was among white educated professional women. By the year 2000, she added, more than half the work force will consist of single parents with children under 5.
"The stereotype of the single mother is that of a teen-ager, often a woman of color who has become a mother through self-indulgence, who deliberately made poor choices, and is an inadequate parent on public assistance," Dr. Klungness said. "That's as far from the truth as possible."
Dr. Klungness attributed the increase in single mothers to economic and cultural factors. "It wasn't so long ago that women couldn't get mortgages," she said. "As women are successfully challenging economic barriers, they are also challenging the idea that they cannot have a child unless they are married.
For five years before her decision, said Ms. Morrissey, who lives in Manhasset, "there wasn't a day that I didn't have a black cloud over my life. I wanted children more than anything I could imagine. I threw myself into my nieces and nephews. But I kept coming up empty because they really weren't mine. I thought about donor insemination for a year. But I never told anyone because I thought I was absolutely crazy."
Ms. Morrissey, who is in the market-research business, conceived on her second attempt through the Idant sperm bank in Manhattan. She spent $500. "Since I've had my son," she said, "there's a purpose to my life."
Dr. Klungness's book, "The Complete Single Mother," not only addresses single mothers by choice but also those who have become single through divorce or widowhood. The book, based on more than 500 studies, is also a product of Dr. Klungness's experience. In 1983, she, her husband and two children planned to move from Syracuse to South Carolina, where she was to enroll in a doctoral program. As she watched the moving van pull out of the driveway, her husband, who had already relocated and begun a new job, called.
He informed her that he did not think that they should be married any more and that she should take the children and move in with her mother. He hung up.
"I was in shock," she recalled. "There went most of my life, my bed, my furniture, every towel, plate and cooking utensil, every toy and book my children had ever had."
She gathered up what she had left -- her children, Sarah, 3, and Andrew, 8, two suitcases and $500 -- and moved in with her mother. In 1986 she earned her Ph.D. and later moved to the Island, where her practice includes many single mothers.
Dr. Klungness's co-author, Andrea Engber, is founder and director of the National Organization of Single Mothers and the single mother of a 10-year-old son. Ms. Engber's live-in partner left her for a woman 25 years his junior when she was four months' pregnant at the age of 36.
The organization, which has 5,000 members, has helped more than 20,000 women since it began five years ago, said Ms. Engber, who grew up in Queens and lives in North Carolina.
Although single motherhood may continue to bear some stigmas, some mothers say that is not insurmountable. "Social acceptance is not a problem," said a 39-year-old who adopted a child from Peru five years ago and is looking for a second. When she arranges play dates, said the woman, who insisted on anonymity, "I don't advertise my circumstances, and other parents don't ask."
The woman, who owned a successful beauty parlor and is now a letter carrier, said she had tried donor insemination for over a year before deciding to adopt, at a cost of $11,000.
Adoption is a difficult road for single mothers, Ms. Morrissey said, because of the expense and the competition with two-parent families.
Although single mothers by choice face singular challenges, they also share common concerns with divorced and widowed mothers.
The biggest difficulty on Long Island is economic, Dr. Klungness said, adding: "Single mothers have to be more creative and resourceful because of the high cost of living. Twenty years ago I might have said, 'Get in with a good company, work hard, and the company will take care of you.' That's not good advice any more."
She now counsels women to work toward financial independence by mastering realistic goals like computer literacy and encourages them to pool resources and responsibilities.
Home sharing is one strategy. Ms. Morrissey, who shares a home with her brother, said many women in Single Mothers by Choice moved back with their families.
"It's not necessarily a financial need, because almost all the women have well-established careers," she said. "But it's good to have support and provide children with a broader family."
Barbara Ernst, 41, a single mother of a 3-year-old, Michael, and a controller at a toiletry company, lives upstairs in her parents' home in Oceanside.
"I haven't lived at home since I was 22," Ms. Ernst said. "I thought it would only be for a little while, but the emotional support is nice.
"My parents are in their 70's. I never ask them to care for my son, not even to run to the store for 15 minutes. I don't want to burden them. You become so strong and independent you think you can handle it all."
Ms. Ernst became pregnant while in a relationship but left because her partner abused her, she said, adding that she is saving to buy a home.
Homelessness, while not typical, is a real fear for single mothers, Dr. Klungness said, most often resulting from uncollected child support.
"It's not an irrational or groundless fear," the psychologist said. "But most women find ways to survive. Single mothers, rather than being lazy or ineffective, often work several jobs to support their children. Most are something of heroines, juggling multiple roles and responsibilities with few resources and little support."
Maureen Corbett, 50, whose husband of 20 years died four years ago, has changed her life to pay college tuition for her three children, 19, 20 and 23. She left a flexible teaching job close to her home in Seaford to commute to the city, where she works at an insurance company.
"I feel like I'm wishing my life away," Ms. Corbett said. "I can't wait for my kids to be out of college, so I don't have to pay tuition."
Lori Brogan of Halesite, a mother of 2-year-old twins, separated from her husband six months ago. She said she had moved twice in the last six months and was relying heavily on credit. Although she has a good job as benefits coordinator for the South Huntington School District and her husband contributes to child support, she said her expenses for rent, car and day care left her with $400 a month for clothes and groceries.
For divorced mothers, trying to obtain uncollected child support can be frustrating, expensive and time-consuming, Dr. Klungness said. Long Island is home to four of the 10 "deadbeat dads" in the United States, fathers who have failed to pay court-ordered child support, she said, but "the court system won't necessarily do what's fair or right to protect children."
A Long Island organization, For Our Children and Us, or Focus, provides free paralegal services to men and women in cases of child support, custody, visits and maintenance. The group also helps single mothers establish paternity.
Most single mothers do not know that unless the father signs papers at the hospital or agrees in family court that he is the parent, the child is not considered his legal heir and receives no financial benefits, said the director of the group, Susan Kolomer Rothman.
When paternity is established, the court orders that the child receive 17 percent of the father's income, less any Social Security payments that the child may be collecting. Focus has offices in Hicksville and Central Islip and says it helps 200 single mothers a year.
Single mothers are not only vulnerable financially, Dr. Klungness said, but they are also often victims of isolation, stress, guilt and lack of self-esteem. She advises single mothers to build a support network of friends and others in similar circumstances.
"I torture myself by asking why I didn't deal with things in a different way than leaving," said Ms. Brogan, whose marital problems grew after her twins were born. "I feel guilty that I hurt my husband and children."
She said that Dr. Klungness's monthly workshops for single mothers at the South Huntington Parent-Teacher Center had helped her to understand that "I did what I did and I have to go on."
Single mothers often try to overcompensate, for the lack of a father and guilt over leaving their children to make a living, Ms. Ernst said. "We never just relax at home and play with toys," she said. "I'm always taking him somewhere, to the circus, to a museum, to a play. I have no contact with the father, so there's no release or relief. I haven't had a night off in three and a half years."
The "daddy issue" is one of the toughest for Ms. Morrissey, she said, adding: "Daniel has been asking about Daddy since he was 2. He used to run up to strangers in the park, asking if they were his daddy. He's referred to my brother as his daddy. He views him as someone who fits the role of father. My mother is a widow. Daniel thinks the man she's dating is his grandfather.
"I'm honest with my son about how he was conceived. I tell him that his father was a good man who wanted to help a woman have a baby."
Dr. Klungness said children could emulate other men. "They become like patchwork quilts," she said. "They take little pieces of all the men they come in contact with instead of making a blanket that looks just like Dad. My son Andrew learned to tie a tie from his eighth-grade band teacher. His sportsmanship comes from his coaches. As he was growing up, when I would see a man doing something particularly kind or helpful, I always pointed that out to him. I do the same thing with my daughter Sarah. A male influence is just as important for girls."
Although child rearing can be especially challenging for single mothers who have to be both mother and father, Dr. Klungness said children raised by single mothers were not much different from children raised in two-parent homes.
"Whether you're married or single," Ms. Mattes said, "it's whether you're a good parent or not that will determine whether the child will turn out well, not the number of people in the house."

HEADLINE: Calling It Quits at Age 75

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
THE Fairfield Store is such a prominent part of the Fairfield Center business district that people have a habit of using it to give directions to visitors. "You turn right at the Fairfield Store," demonstrated Gary Levine, executive vice president of the town's Chamber of Commerce.
More than just another place to shop, the Fairfield Store has long been the fulcrum of the center's Post Road retail strip. So it was more than a little disorienting when the store's owners, the Manasevit family, announced in late March that the store was going out of business after 75 years. The news was received with sorrow by the department store's loyal customers. The Manasevit manner of doing business was personal, a link to a time
of old-fashioned
values. Along the Post Road, "There's trepidation," said Mr. Levine, "because a lot of the businesses here relied on the Fairfield Store as an anchor store." 
 But he and other businesspeople prefer to look at it positively. They said the Fairfield Center business district was already headed toward a period of transition, and the passing of the Fairfield Store has sparked it into action. And the Manasevit family says it intends to be an important player in shaping the future in the business district, both to protect their investment as property owners and to preserve the character of the Fairfield Center.
The Town of Fairfield's economic development staff had been working on a revitalization plan for the center area -- about a three-quarter-mile stretch of Route 1 including the Metro-North station, the Police Station and the Fairfield Public Library -- when the store owners made their decision to close. Before making the announcement on March 27, Stanley Manasevit, chairman of Manasevit Brothers, broke the news to First Selectman Paul Audley and said he wanted to work closely with the town to determine how best to use the building.
Mr. Audley says it is important to preserve the character the town has sought for Fairfield Center. "We don't want to be Main Street, Westport, or anyone else's Main Street. We want to be Fairfield's Main Street," he said.
Recently, outdoor cafes and art galleries have opened there. Mr. Audley said the next occupants of the Fairfield Store building must be attractive enough to draw more shoppers for other businesses.
A majority of the business leases in the center will expire in the next three years, the biggest turnover in 20 years, which Mr. Levine said augers a period of change. The town has begun preparing for this with a project to increase parking for shoppers and store employees as well as providing money for beautification of the streetscape, he said.
Many property owners and merchants had been paying little attention until the Fairfield Store announcement. "The center has been caught snoozing, and this is a real wake-up call," Mr. Levine said.
Mr. Manasevit added, "We hope to integrate the future use of the building into what the town administration intends to do. We've always had a sense of responsibility to what I call the historic business district, and always felt what we did affected the whole town."
Stanley Manasevit, his son Bruce (president of the company) and Deren Manasevit (daughter of Stanley's cousin and partner Frank Manasevit and executive vice president), are weighing offers that they say began coming in almost immediately from real estate brokers. They say they have not yet made a decision. Stanley Manasevit said he would not replace the Fairfield Store with a garish discount business. He said he favors an upscale establishment that would be "appropriate for the character of the center." Store owners and shoppers, some of whom have been writing letters to local officials, seem to agree on that point.
The store's going-out-of-business permit, issued by the state, expires on July 3; at that time the store must be closed for good. Large signs announce the final sale. Inside, shoppers have been browsing through the discounted merchandise. But the atmosphere is funereal. The Day-Glo signs have drawn complaints of garishness, perhaps the only sour note in what otherwise seems like a wake.
One long-time customer in the women's clothing department, Helen Bushko of Milford, said she wasn't looking for anything in particular, just looking.
"It was a store you could go to and find anything you were looking for," said Mrs. Bushko, already referring to the store in the past tense. "You don't find too many of this kind of store left. Personal."
Intimacy with the customer is what the Fairfield Store has been known for. The clothing and gift items are traditional and conservative, though not dowdy, upscale but not elitist. Mr. Manasevit said the store's reflection of the casually upper middle class style that the town of Fairfield affects is no accident. He and his cousin, Frank, who died in 1994, spent much of their time on the floor listening to their customers.
"We tried to meet the needs our customers said they had, rather than try to be all things to all people as a department store would," he said. The word "department" was removed from the store's name in 1966.
"We never carried leisure suits," Mr. Manasevit said. "They were very popular but our customers didn't want them."
Samuel Manasevit, Stanley Manasevit's father, was born in Russia, and immigrated to the United States in 1905, followed by his brother, Isadore, Frank Manasevit's father, two years later. The brothers settled in Bridgeport where they started Manasevit Brothers, wholesalers of dry goods and men's clothing, in 1915.
"They came here with nothing and they accomplished what I guess you would call the American dream," Stanley Manasevit said.
They opened the store in Fairfield in 1921, followed by other retail outlets in Stratford, East Haven, Westport and Norwalk.
The original Fairfield operation was tiny, just 30 feet by 60 feet, situated where the men's department is now. By 1958, the family had closed the other stores, while expanding in Fairfield as adjoining property became available. The store they are closing has 40,000 square feet of sales space.
Mr. Manasevit said the company never closed even for one day during all its expansion. All the construction was done by two local contractors, Ed Henry and Art Bilyard, on handshakes, with no written contracts.
"It's a very old-fashioned way, but a very satisfying way to do business, a way that's probably long gone forever," Mr. Manasevit observed.
During the Depression, he said, when customers couldn't pay, their credit accounts were kept in a spiral notebook. Occasionally, he still meets people who recall being helped by his father and uncle.
He and his cousin Frank served in the army during World War II, then returned home to attend college on the G.I. Bill. They both moved to Fairfield in the 1950's, and took over the company after their fathers died.
"We always had a very harmonious relationship, although in personality we were very different people," Mr. Manasevit said. Frank, the more gregarious of the partners, was responsible for women's and children's clothing, shoes and domestics, while Stanley ran the men's wear department and took care of administration, credit and advertising.
The store is still profitable, Mr. Manasevit said, but the business they are in has changed. Deren Manasevit pointed out that the giant, high-volume chain stores can sell merchandise at prices smaller stores can't match. Retailing also has become very complex; she said the Fairfield Store could not afford to hire managers in human resources, personnel, and in-store display.
"It's become very difficult for stores of this size, which have all the overhead costs of the big stores but can't do the sales volume," said Ms. Manasevit. "The independents are being squeezed out."
Some wholesalers won't even do business with stores the size of the Fairfield Store, she said. "Either you're a tremendous giant or a Mom and Pop."
The whole family met and agreed that the time was right to close the store.
"We've had a run of 75 years, and so that's not bad," Mr. Manasevit said. "Many businesses have life cycles, and this business has had a life cycle which is now coming to an end."

In-Flight Gambling, But No Sky-High Bets

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
British Airways and Singapore Airlines will start testing an in-flight electronic gambling system within the next year that allows passengers to use their credit cards to play poker, blackjack, roulette and slot games at their seats.
The new feature is unlikely to make paupers of travelers, however. The airlines plan to set low limits so that first-class passengers, for example, can lose no more than a few hundred dollars during a single flight. The limits, which have not been made definite, will be even lower for economy and business-class travelers. 
 The notion of in-flight gambling is controversial. The United States Government prohibits the practice on flights into and out of the country. In a recent study on in-flight gambling, the Department of Transportation estimated that United States airlines could earn up to $300 million a year if the ban were lifted. Union leaders of the Association of Flight Attendants have expressed concern, saying that gambling on board could lead to unruly behavior among passengers.
To comply with United States rules, British Airways and Singapore Airlines plan to block use of the gaming systems on flights in and out of the United States.
Virgin Atlantic Airways has offered games like blackjack and roulette on its electronic in-flight entertainment systems for about two years, but passengers cannot place bets. ADAM BRYANT

To the Editor:
 Anthony Gottlieb is, of course, entitled to his various (and mostly negative) opinions of Lester C. Thurow's book "The Future of Capitalism" (April 14). But his idea that the high rates of growth sustained in the United States during the post-World War II period were the result of an undirected economy is simply uninformed. 
 America's unique economic success in the almost three decades leading up to the OPEC price shocks of the early 1970's was in large measure the result of specific governmental manipulations of economic structures, incentives and opportunities. One need only consider the financial mechanisms created at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, the enormous expenditures on public goods during the various cold-war (and hot-war) offensives of the 50's and 60's, and such dramatic domestic consumption stimulants as the G.I. Bill and the National Defense Education Act as cases in point.
 Whether one agrees with his particular prognostications or proposals, one must concede that Mr. Thurow's notion that American economic success in the past has been premised on the pursuit of specific (and "directed") policy objectives is historically accurate. By contrast, Mr. Gottlieb's invocation of a kind of golden age of "free-market capitalism" (which he claims Mr. Thurow overlooks) is an empirically groundless and, therefore, analytically useless abstraction.

MADHOUSE
 The Private Turmoil of
 Working for the President.
 By Jeffrey H. Birnbaum.
 Illustrated. 261 pp. New York:
 Times Books/Random House. $25. 
 A truism about the White House is that the staff reflects the views, the quirks and the working habits of the boss, regardless of who's President. So when President Clinton, on one of his first days in office, confessed that he loathed the news media, Jeffrey H. Birnbaum writes, his aides instantly understood that they were free to "disdain" the Washington press corps. When Mr. Clinton soon became keener on winning political victories than on preserving the essence of domestic programs, his top policy experts willingly transformed themselves into hucksters and lobbyists. And because Mr. Clinton is restless and often unable to keep his attention on one big issue at a time, his aides have been forced to live with what Mr. Birnbaum calls a "willy-nilly management style."
 Now, all White Houses operate haphazardly from time to time. The pressure of decision making, plus relentless scrutiny from the press and the constant need to make the President look good, produced occasional chaos even in the tightly organized Presidency of Ronald Reagan (for instance, in the weeks after the Iran-contra scandal broke in November 1986). George Bush's inability to decide on economic policy themes in 1991 and 1992 left his advisers in perpetual tumult.
 But the point of "Madhouse: The Private Turmoil of Working for the President" is that the level of disorder and confusion at the Clinton White House was of a different magnitude, at least in the first two years of Mr. Clinton's term, which are the focus of Mr. Birnbaum's book.
 It's a valid point. And who was to blame? Mr. Birnbaum suggests Mr. Clinton and his first chief of staff, Thomas F. (Mack) McLarty 3d, were at fault for failing to take charge. "In the Clinton White House, it was sometimes hard to tell who was in charge of the asylum," according to Mr. Birnbaum.
 In any case, the effect was to make life miserable for Clinton staffers. Mr. Birnbaum, the author of "The Lobbyists" and now a senior correspondent for Time, chronicles the agony of six senior aides, four of whom wound up resigning. The Congressional liaison Howard Paster, a veteran labor lobbyist in Washington, had doubts from the first week of the Clinton Presidency about whether he should have joined the White House staff. Within five months, he had a pain in his stomach when he left home in the morning. He quit after 10 months. "The disorganization of the place, over all, he concluded, made it hard for anyone to work," Mr. Birnbaum writes.
 Dee Dee Myers, the press secretary, wasn't kept informed of major decisions. She was among the last to learn, for example, of Mr. McLarty's plan to have Leon Panetta replace him as chief of staff. Ms. Myers "had to become more like the people she served -- reporters -- and check with a range of sources to make sure she was not missing things," Mr. Birnbaum writes. "It was an odd state of affairs."
 Ms. Myers felt the source of her trouble was the "masculine cabal" headed by the President. Despite Mr. Clinton's rhetoric about diversity, she and other women believed, as Mr. Birnbaum puts it, that the White House "was a boys' club of the most awful kind." Ms. Myers left after two years.
 Jeff Eller, the director of media affairs, departed from the White House after 19 months, frustrated that Mr. Clinton's agenda was too cluttered and hard to sell to the American people. Paul Begala, the likable Democratic political consultant, worked as an unpaid adviser and speechwriter, but balked at dealing with bureaucrats. "He became nauseated at the thought of having to clear even the most minor new piece of rhetoric with some assistant secretary for soybeans," Mr. Birnbaum writes. Mr. Begala moved back to Austin, Tex. Bruce Reed and Gene Sperling, two policy advisers, stayed, but only after learning the cynical lesson that "the policies they had loved so dearly when they arrived at the White House were no longer cherished goals but merely another set of plays on the political field."
 These tales of torment in the Clinton White House are gripping, but Mr. Birnbaum's claim that most officials "leave their posts weary, diminished, sometimes even broken" is an exaggeration. So is his notion that "many staffers' reputations, and their personal lives, end in shambles." That happens infrequently.
 STILL, Mr. Birnbaum's analysis of what caused staff trauma at the Clinton White House is persuasive. The President declined to pare his agenda, then, Mr. Birnbaum says, instituted a " 'jump ball' management style" that let everyone sound off on every issue. This worked in the 1992 campaign, but led to chronic indecision at the White House.
 The good news for Mr. Clinton and his partisans is that things improved in his third year. Mr. Panetta, the new chief of staff, gradually imposed order, even cajoling Mr. Clinton into narrowing his agenda.
 True, the President paid a price for this. No longer a policy initiator, he had to accept the lesser role of political counterpuncher. Without his input, Republicans framed sweeping changes -- a balanced budget, welfare reform, entitlement cuts, a revamped farm program. All Mr. Clinton could do was respond. But at least his popularity rose, and working conditions at the White House got a whole lot better.

HEADLINE: Mothers Dream of a Better Life In America

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
TODAY Lillian Rivera, a Puerto Rican, will spend Mother's Day in My Sister's Place, a shelter for battered women -- her hopes and dreams for her own life in the United States shattered but her aspirations for her two daughters, Leeane, 7, and Anelee, 8, firmly intact.
Ms. Rivera, 39, has few skills and is unemployed, and she has been fleeing her husband, who she said burned her arm over a stove, for several years now. An emotionally weary woman who is fearful most of the time, she puts aside her own concerns when she speaks of her daughters, who attend public school near the shelter. Like many mothers who are born outside the continental United States, Ms. Rivera, who came from the island as a teen-ager, believes an American education "will take my children far." 
 "I am struggling to raise them, to teach them right from wrong," she said. "I want them to have the advantages I never had."
Jucely Diederichs, 34, is a psychologist from Rio de Janiero who works in a bakery in White Plains. Not licensed to practice in the United States, Ms. Diederichs said she left behind her career and moved to this country to give her son, Henrique, 9, "the best education and the opportunities other Americans have -- a profession, a house, the good life and money."
Like the other immigrant mothers, Bridget Riegger, 66, also left her native land so her children, who are now grown, could share in the American dream. "We believed in hard work and a strong faith," said Mrs. Riegger, a clerk in Westchester's Office for Women who came from County Longford in Ireland and settled in Yonkers. "My husband and I were not wealthy, but we gave our daughters a rich childhood in this country."
Sonia Alcantara, who left Lima, Peru, a decade ago, lives in a bustling immigrant neighborhood in Harrison with her husband, Gustavo, and her son, Gustavo Jr., 10. Although she holds an advanced degree in business administration from a Peruvian college, she works as a waitress at a hotel, and her husband, who was trained as an accountant in Peru, is a data entry clerk at a hospital. The pair came here on their honeymoon and decided to stay, and on May 22, they will be sworn in as American citizens.
"My son, Gustavo, wants to be a hockey player," Mrs. Alcantara said. "Here in this country, he will have a chance to be whatever he wants to be. Peru is small, not poor, but the opportunities are not there the way they are here."
Today, on Mother's Day, each of these women will spend time with their children, but in distinctly different ways. Mrs. Alcantara, who flew to Lima last weekend to celebrate her 40th birthday, will spend the day with her mother and son.
Ms. Rivera plans to spend the day quietly with her daughters in the stark room they share at the shelter for abused women. Ms. Diederichs and Henrique may visit a park if weather permits. And Mrs. Riegger plans to dine out with one of her daughters in Hopewell Junction.
However different their lives are in most respects, these immigrant women have much in common -- especially in terms of the aspirations they share for their offspring. Like many mothers born in other countries, they are raising or, in the case of Mrs. Riegger, have raised their children to believe that hard work and an American education are the key to success.
"These are people who are living the American dream," said Constance G. Post, Commissioner of Planning and Community Development in Mount Vernon, a city that is home to more than 90 different nationalities. "They've taken up the cause. They're buying houses, businesses, really and truly becoming part of what we call the American way."
It is estimated that 6,000 immigrants arrive yearly in Westchester -- often bypassing New York City, which had traditionally been the first stop on the East Coast for newcomers. Instead, they are settling in the large immigrant communities that have been established in the suburbs.
"They are going directly to hubs like New Rochelle, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, White Plains, Port Chester and Peekskill," said Joseph J. Salvo, chief demographer for New York City and director of the population division of the Department of City Planning. "The trend is testimony to the existing immigrant populations already there.
"Traditionally, immigrants moved out from the city when they moved up the socioeconomic ladder, or the second generation left for the suburbs. Now a higher and higher percentage go directly to places like Westchester to begin with, especially since the jobs are there for them."
In New Rochelle, City Manager Charlene M. Indelicato described the many old Italian immigrant neighborhoods in her city that are now being settled by people from Central and and South America and who are working as masons and landscapers, jobs first held by Italian immigrants.
"And the same as the generations before them, their children are going on to become doctors and lawyers and cops and firemen," Ms. Indelicato said. "It's part of the assimilation process, only now instead of pane de casa and olive oil in the local grocery stores we're seeing jalapeno peppers and rice and papayas."
Ms. Indelicato is a second-generation Sicilian whose family settled on the Lower East Side of New York. She later migrated to the suburbs.
Dr. Gregory M. Holtz, director of research at the Michaelian Institute of Pace University, described the county's most recent wave of immigrants as "well aware of Westchester's assets."
Dr. Holtz continued: "They moved here because they know this is a rich county. They came to mow yards, lay bricks, do odd jobs. They're a great labor market filling a real need."
At the same time, though, the immigrants are increasingly placing demands on public services, including school systems, Dr. Holtz said, explaining that many are coming into the United States from rural areas with children who have "minimal or even nonexistent educations."
Dr. Holtz added: "Not only do the children not know English but often they are not even schooled in reading and writing their own language. It's a tremendous literacy problem."
The recent wave of foreigners is also arriving at a time of growing anti-immigrant sentiment in the country. On May 2, the United States Senate overwhelmingly approved a bill that would tighten the United States borders and clamp down on illegal immigrants.
More than 70 percent of the country's legal and illegal immigrants live in California, New York, New Jersey, Texas, Florida and Illinois, and voters and officials in those states are worried about the burden that immigrants place on schools and other services.
The Senate proposal would make illegal immigrants ineligible for most Federal, state and local benefits except things like emergency medical care and nutrition programs. It also restricts public benefits for legal immigrants, mainly by toughening the obligation of sponsors to help support them. Also, many immigrants who receive welfare benefits for 12 or more months in their first 5 years could be deported.
Ms. Post said that in Mount Vernon "the undocumented are around but mostly on the fringe." She also said that immigrants in general were not "disproportionately part of the welfare system."
But Dr. Holtz said that despite the reality, the country was "riding a wave of xenophobia" not seen since the 1920's.
"There was a similar situation on the floor of the House and the Senate back then," he said. "And the negative sentiments about immigrants from southern and middle Europe, the Russian Jews and the Polish, would embarrass even the present legislators who are sponsoring these new bills. They used phrases like the mongrelization of the race and inferior gene pools."
According to the County Department of Planning, the 10 countries most heavily represented now among the immigrant populations in Westchester are, in descending order, Jamaica, Ireland, the Dominican Republic, India, the Philippines, Colombia, Peru, Mexico, Ecuador and Britain.
According to figures from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, immigrants are settling -- also in descending order -- in the following places in the county: Yonkers, Mount Vernon, White Plains, New Rochelle, Port Chester, the Scarsdale area, the Tarrytowns, the village of Ossining, the Peekskill area and Mount Kisco.

A Mother Who's One in a Million

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
IT was the second week of May, so the weather should have been glorious. But it was so cold and wet last Monday that a lot of people stayed home. By 11 A.M., a crowd of only 2,000 -- about a quarter of the turnout that had been expected -- waited in the chilly mist outside St Paul's A.M.E. Zion Church in Trenton for the march to the State House to begin.
Four hours later, after the last amplified speech had echoed off the granite government buildings, as a steady rain washed over the peeling gold dome, most of the crowd was still there. 
 "What's a little rain?" said Debra Martin, of Union City. "As a mother, it was important for me to be here today. I intend to take something back to my children. Not preaching, but practical information about organizing and restoring a community."
Nearby, Anne White, 73 years old, the mother of four, grandmother of eight and great-grandmother of three, was watching with quiet approval as a little girl in her Sunday school dress toddled past, her tiny hand raised high in her father's grip. "It's good to see the men here with the children, very good," Mrs. White said. "But the mothers, they've always been there."
The New Jersey Million Man March in Trenton was organized by a coalition of African-American churches from cities like Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Orange, Elizabeth and Camden -- cities that have to be counted among the smoking guns in any indictment of America's pitifully failed national urban policies. The organizers had borrowed the name from last October's Million Man March in Washington. But in Washington, women were discouraged from marching. In Trenton last Monday, there seemed to be nearly as many women in attendance as men.
On a platform outside the State House, speakers talked for hours about moral responsibility, community cooperation, economic potential, political organization, self-esteem and a commitment to education, hard work, ethics and charity.
"Things you heard a million times from your mother," said Geneva Johnson, 43, of Asbury Park.
Mrs. Johnson has five children, ages 26, 24, 18, 15 and 3, and five grandchildren, one of whom she is raising herself. She also works for the Asbury Park school district as a community coordinator.
"Community organizing really has to start within the family," she said. "Children have to grow up looking at a future outside the home with hope -- and the only way they get that is from within the home. As a mother, my main job is to convey hope to my family, the way my mother conveyed it to me.
"But hope is empty without practical goals and a moral structure that stresses the difference between right and wrong," said said. "In my home, there are rules and regulations. If my children deviate from the guidelines, they've got a problem, believe me. I tell them: 'You know how bad it can be out there? You know how easy it is for a girl to fall victim to the welfare system? A boy to fall victim to the criminal system?'
"But at the same time," she continued, "you have to encourage hope outside the front door, in the community. Take Asbury Park, a city that some people thought was was dead. But it isn't dead. It has a pulse! There is a new surge of individuals, lots of us, who are starting to hold leadership accountable and demand real change. We want a viable school system, in a nice, safe city. Who says we can't achieve that?
"It all starts in the home. Just like my mother always said," Mrs. Johnson said, raising her voice to be heard above the roar of a motorcycle passing by.
"Not that everything was always smooth between my mother and me," she recalled. "My mother set standards, and when I deviated from them, I had a problem. For example, I was a teen-age mother, had my first child when I was 16. For a little while, I went off the wrong way, but I came back."
She shook her head and laughed. "Now, my kids tell me I'm turning into my mother! I listen to myself and you know, I sound just like her: 'Don't do drugs! Stay away from premarital sex! Don't make moral compromises! Know the difference between right and wrong!' "
Mrs. Johnson's mother is also a community organizer. "My mother is still very much a part of my life and my children's lives," she said. "And she still works all the time on neighborhood projects. Every morning, that woman is out the door before 8."
Suddenly, Mrs. Johnson said, "I'm glad to be turning into her!" and laughed with delight at the image in her mind of her mother, whose name is Louise Woods, of East Orange, and who would be proud this Mother's Day to know that her daughter Geneva grew up regarding her as not just one in a million, but one of a million, too.

HEADLINE: PERSPECTIVES;
A Y.M.C.A., Rebuilt as Rental, Still Attracts the 'Y'

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER 

 BODY:
YOUNG and single and coming to New York City with a job. Where to live?
"Most of my friends who wanted to live alone had to go to Hoboken," said Michael Van DeLoo, a 23-year-old who is being transferred to New York City from Albany by his employer, Arthur Andersen & Company, the accounting and financial consulting firm. Other friends, insistent on living in Manhattan, are sharing apartments, usually each paying $700 or $750 in rent, he said. 
 He himself has signed a lease for a 400-square-foot, seventh-floor studio apartment for $950 a month, including utilities, on West 34th Street near Ninth Avenue. The building is the former Y.M.C.A. known as the William Sloane House. Two developers acquired it in December 1994 and have rebuilt it into a rental called 360 West 34th Street.
The project has provided an unusual example of the creation of market-rate apartments without tax abatements or rent subsidies, using conventional financing from Fleet Bank. And it offers rental housing affordable to people earning starter salaries in professional fields in New York City.
"We designed the building for the young people who want to live in Manhattan, and also for people who are moving along," said Joseph H. Gardner, one of the developers. "There's a tremendous demand for smaller apartments from people making about $40,000 and up,"
Some of the new tenants earn as much as $100,000, he said. But there are also many with two starter incomes, for whom two-bedroom apartments are affordable.
What has made the prices possible was the developers' ability to buy the property at a reasonable price -- about $20 a square foot. The old elevators have been upgraded but everything else is new, and construction costs have been held to about $75 a square foot, compared with $110 to $120 a square foot in standard new construction, Mr. Gardner said.
None of this has fulfilled the original hopes of the Young Men's Christian Association of Greater New York, which brokers say was led to expect that it might realize $15 million or more in a sale when the property went on the market in 1991.
There were no takers. So in January 1994 the Y.M.C.A. held a sealed-bid auction through Edward S. Gordon & Company and Sheldon Good & Company, producing a high bid of $4.2 million. But months passed and the high bidder failed to close. Mr. Gardner and his partner, Henry Kibel, eventually acquired the sales contract for $4.9 million and completed the purchase for all cash in December 1994.
The property consists of the 14-story Y.M.C.A., with 220,000 gross square feet of space, and a connected two-story commercial building that runs the length of Ninth Avenue from 34th Street to 33d Street. It has 55,000 square feet of store space above street level and 25,000 square feet of basement space.
On the roof of this structure the developers are building 12 maisonettes -- two-story, 850-square-foot apartments with separate entrances along a paved courtyard, or mews. The courtyard is entered through a door on the third floor in the main building. The courtyard will be open to the elements, but will have a snow-melting system buried within it. The apartments are expected to rent for an average of $2,250 a month.
The main building will have 265 apartments on the third through the 14th floors. The corridors once had rooms on either side -- the inside rooms receiving light and air from a large open area left open above the third floor. Now the corridor has been shifted to the interior perimeter of the floors to create larger apartments overlooking the street. Natural light from the central open space penetrates the halls.
At average rents of $28 a square foot a year, the apartments turn out to be affordable housing for many younger professionals. "They came up with the perfect product for the area -- small, efficient, two-bedrooms with one bath," said Steven G. Rockmore, a principal in Residential Realty Advisers, a housing consulting firm.
Nearby, the Rockrose Development Corporation built an 86-unit rental at 444 West 35th Street in 1991, and gets average rents of $28 a square foot a year also. A typical studio apartment there would rent for $1,005 a month, the management said.
T HE Rockrose building is almost on top of the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, along Dyer Avenue. "The neighborhood never really took off," said Thomas Elghanayan, a principal in Rockrose. "In the 80's we thought the area would be transformed by the Javits Convention Center, but it never really happened."
Accordingly, rent levels are lower than they are in new rentals in more established lower West Side locations. Rockrose has begun taking applications, for example, for apartments in its new 148-unit building at 100 Jane Street, in the West Village, where occupancy starts in mid-June. There the rents will average $31 a square foot a year. A typical 700-square-foot one-bedroom apartment would rent for $1,800 a month.
On Jane Street, Rockrose is using "80-20" financing -- tax-exempt state bonds, with 20 percent of the apartments reserved for lower-income tenants. The mixed-income occupancy also makes the building eligible for 20 years of tax abatement under the 421a program, thereby lowering expenses to achieve economic feasibility. Mixed-income occupancy and bond financing with 421a tax abatement has become the pattern for almost all new multifamily housing in Manhattan in recent years.
The architect of the Y.M.C.A. reconstruction project is the firm of Kibel Levenson Jagger, in which Mr. Kibel, 77, is the senior partner. He is the son of the late Charles Kibel, founder of the Kibel Company, which has developed 16 buildings with more than 3,000 apartments since 1950. The company still owns 8 of them, with 1,600 apartments, including 300 East 34th Street and 351 East 84th Street.
Mr. Gardner, 68, was the Kibel Company's accountant before he started his own business, P & J Realty, in 1968. It is a management and development company that has has developed 14 buildings, most of them gut renovations of Chelsea loft buildings into residential space.
"Joe called me about it and I said it sounds like a good deal -- the price is right," Mr. Kibel said. The price worked out to about $17,000 per buildable apartment.
Organized as Charlil 34th LLC, a limited-liabilty partnership, the partners already have found a tenant for most of the commercial space. B & H Photo Video, a mail-order and retail business, will move to Ninth Avenue from its space in one of Mr. Gardner's buildings at 113 West 17th Street. The store has leased 48,000 square feet of space on two levels, plus 25,000 square feet in the basement.
As for the apartments, there are 61 studios of about 400 square feet; 158 one-bedrooms of 600 square feet; 12 750-square-foot one-bedrooms with terraces; 15 two-bedrooms of 850 square feet and five larger penthouses, plus the maisonettes.
Only 140 of the apartments have gone on the market, with occupancy scheduled to start next month. The studios are renting for $800 to $1,100 a month, the one-bedrooms at $1,350 to $1,750 and the two-bedrooms at $1,900 to $2,200. The building will have laundry rooms on every floor and a small exercise room but no pool or other common facilities. There will 24-hour concierge service.
T HERE are already 45 executed leases, said David Becker, who is handling leasing for the owners. Among the lessees, 27 are single-person households, and six of those are renting for the first time in Manhattan. All of them have incomes in a moderate-income range -- $27,000 to $55,000 a year, Mr. Becker said. Eighteen are two-person, two-income households.
One of the new lessees, Kevin Dew, a 34-year-old lawyer, will become part of a two-person household after he marries Lynda Anderer, 32, a legal secretary, in June. He has been living in a first-floor apartment in Chelsea, "where I've grown accustomed to the roar of engines and the howl of alarms."
He has also grown accustomed to Mr. Gardner as a landlord, having been living in one of his buildings. So he liked the idea of moving to 360 West 34th Street when he was ready for more space. The couple have rented a sixth-floor, two-bedroom for $1,900.
"I think the rent was reasonable," Mr. Dew said. "I like to think of the area as Upper Chelsea."

Another Step in Addressing State's Housing Needs

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
AN ongoing and increasingly difficult challenge to this state is how to bolster the supply of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income families.
The latest effort to resolve the problem is a measure now before the Assembly's Appropriations Committee calling for a referendum this November on a $290 million bond issue for affordable housing. 
 Some major steps in the effort are already in place. For one thing, the state's Mount Laurel doctrines require all 567 municipalities to provide zoning for their share of affordable units. And last year Gov. Christine Todd Whitman released the state's first comprehensive housing plan to filter $700 million by the end of the decade into the production of such houses and thereby promote home ownership.
But housing advocates say those steps meet only a portion of the state's need, particularly for affordable rentals. The state estimates that by 1999 it will need 86,308 low- amd moderate-income units for families earning no more than 80 percent of an area's median income. State data show that more than 900,000 of the state's households, or one-third of the total, live in housing they cannot realistically afford, or in overcrowded or substandard housing.
Those problems are intensified by dwindling Federal housing funds and New Jersey's high residential prices, which business leaders say make it difficult to recruit and hold on to a work force. In the first quarter, the median home price in the state was $150,100 in the nation it was $114,700.
Proponents of the bond-issue referendum now before the Legislature say it would not only address the housing problem, but would also aid the state's economy, improve its image as a place to do business and help its sagging construction industry.
Known as the Jobs From Housing and Economic Development Bond Act, the bill calling for the referendum says that the bond issue would finance a housing program to, among other things, create up to 8,000 new and renovated rental and for-sale residences; help first-time buyers with no-interest mortgages and provide loans to start businesses in urban areas.
"The bond issue is a starting point from which to develop a permanent funding source," said Diane Sterner, executive director of the Affordable Housing Network, a group based in Trenton that represents nonprofit builders. "But it will help fill the gaps in existing programs and provide a compre- hensive way to address the state's housing and jobs needs."
Her group is part of a coalition with some 200 members, including developers, unions, churches businesses and housing advocates, supporting the legislation. Ms. Sterner said that an Eagleton Poll commissioned by the Housing Network last year showed that 82 percent of the state's residents consider affordable housing a serious problem and that 70 percent would support the bond issue.
T HE bill, which has bipartisan backing, now awaits action in the Assembly Appropriations Committee -- a crucial juncture, observers say, given the fiscal conservatism now in Trenton.
"The threshold question is how much debt can the state afford," said Robert W. Friant, spokesman for the Department of Community Affairs. The agency oversees housing issues and is charged with implementing the Governor's housing plan, known as H-EASY 2000. The acronym stands for Housing and Economic Assistance Strategy.
Thomas A. Bracken, president of Core States/New Jersey National Bank in Pennington, said the measure is "at worst expense neutral and at best a jobs and revenue generator."
A study by the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University in New Brunswick echoed those points. It said the initiative would create up to 12,000 jobs, generating millions of dollars a year in new income tax revenue to the state and in property-tax revenue to local governments. Moreover, the study said, the initiative's ripple effect would add some $600 million to the economy.
"Producing more affordable housing will also help attract new businesses to the state," said Mr. Bracken.
In 1989, a referendum for a $135 million housing bond issue was narrowly defeated -- many say by the antispending sentiment brought on by then Gov. Jim Florio's unpopular $2.8 billion tax and school financing package.
With the state's residential market still struggling "the need for affordable housing is amplified," said Senator John A. Lynch, a New Brunswick Democrat who was a sponsor of the defeated referendum and is a sponsor of the Senate version of the current housing bill. "Given there is no state or Federal money," he said, "the only hope to stimulate production lies in this bond issue."
Ms. Sterner of the Affordable Housing Network added that without the bond issue the 5,550 affordable units under way or planned by builders that the Network alone represents may not be realized.
Although most affordable-housing builders agree that the bond issue is no panacea, talk of additional money is nonetheless sweet news. "As the competition for scarce funds grows the bond issue will keep money in the pipeline," said Reginald Dryzga, executive director of Homes For All Inc., a nonprofit developer in Dover Township in Ocean County.
Last year the group, piecing together financing from five different sources, built Hopes Crossing, a 125-unit, $10 million rental in the township.
It is now fully rented to families making no more than 60 percent of the county's median income of $55,000 for a family of four. Forty units also have Federal Section 8 rent subsidies, which means tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their income in rent.
Some municipalities have taken on the role of developer as a way to meet their Mount Laurel requirements. That is the case in the affulent Bergen County borough of Upper Saddle River, which after nearly a decade of litigation is nearing completion on its first affordable-housing project.
Crescent Village, a condominium with 24 units, is being developed by the nonprofit Upper Saddle River Housing Corporation on a former church site. Financing for the $2.28 million project came from the sale of bonds. Town & Country Developers of New Jersey, a division of Whiteweld, Barrister & Brown, a real estate investment concern based in Manhattan, is the builder.
"It was the most cost-effective way to develop the project with little downside risk to the community," said Robert Regan, attorney for the borough and the nonprofit housing group, referring to the bond sale. The one- to three-bedroom units, two cobbled within the old church, are priced from $35,600 to $113,400 and are affordable to households of four making no more than 80 percent of the median income in the area, or up to $58,740.
B UT such projects are limited. Advocates say the state needs to provide additional subsidies because in today's slow housing market developers can no longer rely on market-rate units to underwrite the affordable ones.
The largest share of the funds from the bond issue now before the Legislature, $160 million, would provide subsidies to builders to construct or renovate up to 8,000 residences -- half as rentals -- and at least half of the total for low-income families. An additional $50 million would be used for rental assistance to families earning less than 30 percent of the area's median income. And $6 million in grants would go to nonprofit groups to expand production.
A total of $30 million would extend low-interest mortgages, to help cover down payments and closing costs on a house for first-time buyers with low, moderate and middle incomes.
An additional $41 million would be used to assist in the development of small businesses, commercial space and job training programs in urban areas. The final $3 million would go to grants to community economic development corporations to spur the creation and expansion of small businesses.
Ms. Sterner, like most supporters, feels optimistic about the bond issue's being placed on the November ballot. But given the difficult budget climate she conceded that the amount might be lowered. "It cannot be too low," she added, "or it will not have enough of an impact to deal with the problem."

Housing Grants Help Cut Blight in North Bellport

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

DATELINE: NORTH BELLPORT

 BODY:
CATHY SANTILLO became a resident of this unincorporated area of the Town of Brookhaven exactly a year ago, moving into a new three-bedroom, two-bath colonial on Taylor Avenue that she had bought for $47,000 from the Long Island Housing Partnership.
She is among 14 purchasers of houses the nonprofit group has built in the community since a two-square mile area covering most of North Bellport was designated an Economic Development Zone, or E.D.Z., in July 1994. 
 The zone makes new homes and new businesses eligible for tax incentives and offers businesses incentives for creating jobs.
The Partnership houses and a handful of others built or renovated by different nonprofit entities, as well as existing houses that owners are struggling to maintain, are a stark contrast to the many dilapidated homes in the one-square-mile residential section of the zone, which extends from Donegan Avenue between the Sunrise and Montauk Highways to New Jersey and Bellport Avenues on the east.
The one-square-mile industrial section extends from Sunrise Highway to just south of the Long Island Expressway, with Station and Sills Road on the west and Walker and Manor Roads -- on the map, but not yet built -- on the east.
Rebuilding roads and parks and establishing a federally-financed Suffolk County Police substation at the intersection of Montauk Highway and Station Road have helped restore some stability to one of the most economically depressed communities on Long Island.
Under a program called Operation Firestone, which was initiated by Town Supervisor Felix J. Grucci Jr. when he was on the Brookhaven Town Council, 16 houses whose owners refused to remove serious code violations have been condemned and demolished.
A committee consisting of community leaders and civic groups was formed in 1990 to implement proposals for revitalization outlined in a 1990 Enterprise Foundation study. This led to the creation of the E.D.Z.
The North Bellport Implementation Committee co-chairmen are Joseph Sanseverino, director of the county's Community Development Agency, and Robert J. Reutzel, the Brookhaven housing commissioner.
Town and county officials now say the real key to rebuilding the community's residential section lies in providing more homeownership opportunities for people like Ms. Santillo.
U NDER a plan now being considered by the County Legislature, which could be voted on as early as this month, vacant county-owned lots within the E.D.Z. would be turned over to the Town of Brookhaven, which in turn would build housing on the sites for low- and moderate-income people. (The Housing Partnership homes were also built on land once owned by the county.)
Up to 232 houses would be built on the total of 51 acres that the county owns -- in clusters to retain open space.
According to 1990 census figures, the E.D.Z. in North Bellport has a population of 2,158 and 596 households. About 60 percent of the housing belongs to absentee landlords who "care little about their tenants, and less about the neighborhood," said Jim Morgo, president of the Housing Partnership, which is based in Hauppauge.
But Ms. Santillo, who has two adult daughters, bubbles with pride over her home, which has become a center for extended family gatherings.
"If you give people the opportunity to buy a house they wanted all their lives and couldn't afford, they're going to take good care of it because it would be pretty silly to wreck your own dream," she said.
Until two years ago, county-owned properties seized for nonpayment of taxes were usually sold at auction. But in 1994 county officials ended its auction on properties here because of the E.D.Z. designation.
Tax abatements within that zone allow for a 10-year tax break starting in 1994 and ending in 2004. Land taxes continue to be paid, but improvements, such as a new house or industrial building, are not taxed until the year 2001. Taxes on improvements are then phased in over a three-year period at 25 percent a year. The owner of a new $50,000 house that, without grants, would cost $100,000 might therefore pay $500 annually in taxes for seven years, instead of $3,500 annually.
"Tax abatements provided by the designation made it attractive to take a comprehensive approach to affordable housing," said Stephen M. Jones, the Suffolk County planning director.
Since counties are barred by state law from developing housing themselves, said Mr. Jones, "we felt that the best way to insure that the tax abatements would end up with the new homeowner is to turn the property over to the Town of Brookhaven."
The town would pay the county $3,000 for each building lot no matter what the size. The lots would be turned over for development to nonprofit groups, which would use state and Federal grants to reduce prices of the new homes by as much as $50,000 each. To qualify for both grants, a family of four must have an income of no more than $47,300, a household of two no more than $37,850.
Another goal, Mr. Jones said, was to develop a good land-use plan. Some of the county-owned lots are undersized; some are oversized and on streets that are mapped but not built, or on dirt roads.
By transferring development rights from one vacant lot to another, almost 11 of the 51 acres can be turned over to Brookhaven to be used for park purposes and a greenbelt along Station Road, said Mr. Jones, who devised the open-space plan.
Some of the very small parcels next to existing houses could, at the town's discretion, be deeded to adjoining homeowners, he said.
The plan for North Bellport follows a similar one developed in 1990 by the Town of Islip for the Carleton Park area of Central Islip. Poorly maintained rental houses there had also caused a major blight. The now thriving community, where 406 houses were built under an affordable housing program, has been renamed College Woods.
I N North Bellport, only about 10 percent of both developed and vacant lots are county-owned, in contrast to Central Islip, where 75 percent were town-owned. Thus the battle will take longer and will have to be fought harder. But the goal is the same -- stabilization through homeownership, Mr. Jones said.
The county's plan to combine lots for the new housing will have a much stronger impact than building houses on scattered sites, said Mr. Morgo of the Long Island Housing Partnership. "Clustering is community building," he said.
The Partnership expects to build a second phase of up to 20 additional houses, once the county's lots become available, he said.
A housing corporation formed in 1993 by the Victory Church of God has so far purchased 16 houses in North Bellport from absentee landlords, has fixed them up and rerented them. And the Bellport, Hagerman, East Patchogue Alliance has renovated or built 29 rental houses.
The Victory Church group also owns 10 vacant lots on Louise Avenue that it intends to develop for new housing. The property borders county-owned land that the group hopes to be allocated if the county plan is approved. The additional property would allow it to build 16 detached houses on a cul-de-sac that would sell in the $50,000 range, said Fran Suk, the housing group's executive director.
Under the affordable-housing program, the town would phase in allocation of sites in concert with the creation of jobs in the industrial portion of the E.D.Z., Supervisor Grucci said.
"As new jobs are created," he said, "demand for new housing will emerge, and with the low-cost land we can make the houses affordable so that people can become buyers, not renters, and have much more of a sense of pride."
The E.D.Z. designation already has made the area "one of the most active for new development on Long Island," said Anthony J. Aloisio, director of economic development for Brookhaven.
Arrow Electronics, a distributor of electronic products, is adding 50 jobs; LIR-USA International, a cosmetics packager, is adding as many as 75 jobs, and four new companies planning to go into business there are adding a total of another 100 jobs. Discussions are under way with a 300,000-square-foot user that Mr. Aloisio said was premature to name.

Setting Standards That Say, 'The Arts Are Not Just a Frill'

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Dance and drama classes in New Jersey's public schools? Only if the district is wealthy, or lucky enough to find volunteers willing to lend their expertise. Music instruction more than once a week? Not in the dozens of schools that have eliminated band and orchestra teachers in budget crises. Arts education has been languishing for years, but there is suddenly cause for hope.
This month, the State Board of Education approved a new set of curriculum standards that describe what schoolchildren should learn in seven academic subjects. Of the 56 standards, 6 are devoted to visual and performing arts. If the standards are followed, children in kindergarten through 12th grade will study art, music, drama and dance more intensively than ever before. 
 "The state has taken a bold step to say the arts are not just a frill," said Judy Conk, Superintendent of Schools in Oradell and president of the Alliance for Arts Education, a statewide advocacy group. "For the first time, we have recognized that the arts are essential to developing skills."
By including the arts in New Jersey's curriculum standards, education officials are putting stock in the philosophy that children who study the arts are better team players, problem-solvers and creative thinkers. The standards bolster the increasingly popular theory that children learn and think in many different ways.
Instead of spelling out how the arts should be taught, the standards suggest which concepts children will be tested on. By fourth grade, for example, they must "use their senses, imagination and memory to express ideas and feelings in dance, music, theater and visual arts." And by eighth grade, they must "identify significant artists representing various historical periods, world cultures, and social and political influences."
New Jersey's standards are based on guidelines released in 1994 by the United States Department of Education. Those voluntary standards were the Federal Government's first attempt to prescribe learning in the arts. They devoted separate categories to each art form and detailed exactly what students should master.
Only eight states have adopted those standards, but in a 1995 survey conducted by the National Art Education Association, 49 states said they were using them as a guide. New Jersey is among eight states making arts instruction mandatory.
Roberta Carol, an arts specialist with the State Department of Education, said New Jersey already required students to take one year of arts. But since the category includes computer instruction, home economics and vocational subjects, some students graduate without any courses in fine or performing arts. Most elementary schools offer weekly art classes or "art on a cart," when the art teacher visits classrooms with supplies. Middle school students take a series of introductory arts courses, but the mix includes vocational subjects.
New Jersey chose an interdisciplinary approach because most schools cannot afford instruction in art, music, drama and dance, Ms. Carol said. "This way, a school can tailor the standards to their resources," she said.
Although the standards have been praised by parents, teachers and arts organizations, many doubt that school districts can afford to meet them. The success of all the curriculum standards depends in large part on how they will be financed, a question that Governor Whitman has promised to answer this month. her administration is under a State Supreme Court order to develop a formula to equalize financing among all districts by September.
But school officials worry that the state will never provide enough money to make the standards work and districts will have to make up the difference through property taxes. Wealthy districts could go further toward meeting the standards than poor ones.
But Ms. Conk, the Oradell superintendent, said creative districts would be able to meet the standards. Schools can form partnerships with museums or arts groups, for example. Art teachers can act as consultants, teaming up with classroom teachers for science and history projects.
A kindergarten class in Oradell studied dinosaurs as part of its science curriculum this spring. For the final project, the pupils wrote and performed a play called "The Great Dinosaur Mystery." Math, science, language arts, music, dance and drama were all part of the project, she said.
"Classroom teachers will never take the place of arts specialists," she said. "But teachers who recognize their role to educate the whole child will seek opportunities to use the arts in every subject."

In Asian Forests, Find a Family Tree

BYLINE: By MURRAY WEIDENBAUM; Murray Weidenbaum, head of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Ronald Reagan from 1981 to 1982, is chairman of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis. This article is adapted from the book "The Bamboo Network" by Mr. Weidenbaum and Samuel Hughes (Free Press, New York, 1996).

 BODY:
AMERICANS need to revise their tripolar view of the global marketplace. True, the United States, Japan, and the European Union represent the heart of the international economy. But Southeast Asia, including the coastal zone of China, has become the world's major area of growth and development. This region is growing about three times as rapidly as the "Big Three" and the trend is likely to continue.
The key to understanding Southeast Asian business is the "bamboo network" of expatriate Chinese family-oriented enterprises. They dominate much of the economics of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and Taiwan and account for 80 percent of "foreign" investment in China. They are the consummate dealmakers and middlemen. 
 For Americans considering doing business in Southeast Asia, the bamboo network can be a vital ally or staunch competitor, making the difference between success and failure. Many American businesses -- including Motorola, Coca-Cola, K.F.C., Lockheed, Chrysler, Procter & Gamble and Wal-Mart -- have successfully teamed up with overseas Chinese enterprises. Other American companies, trying to operate on their own, especially in China, have run afoul of cultural and institutional barriers they could not overcome.
These companies, perhaps, did not understand that enterprises in the bamboo network are very different from the typical American business. They may be family-owned but do not resemble Wal-Mart or Ford or other family-originated American concerns. A bamboo network enterprise may consist of 100 or more modest-sized family-run operations, each of which has some ownership in the other family businesses.
The Chinese-born founders of these businesses typically started with little wealth, but they worked and saved at prodigious rates. A former student of mine tells of his grandfather who came to the United States from China. After years of modest earnings from ironing shirts in a hand laundry, he had saved a large sum. He moved to Hong Kong, where he invested $50,000 (Hong Kong) in the rice business. This gutsy move started the family fortune, now diversified across Southeast Asia and into Australia.
Tales of frugality are legendary among the first generation of overseas Chinese entrepreneurs. Y. C. Wang of Taiwan, leader of Formosa Plastics, is reluctant to buy new clothes. His wife reportedly has to sneak an old suit out of the house while he is away so she can commission a replacement and get it into his closet before he returns.
Today, many of these family businesses have become enormous conglomerates. The total assets of the public companies in Asia controlled by overseas Chinese exceed $500 billion. The combined economic output of the overseas Chinese is close to $600 billion -- equal to a good-sized country. In Indonesia, the businesses of Liem Sioe Liong, who arrived penniless in Java from China in 1938, account for 5 percent of the country's gross domestic product. In Hong Kong, the billionaire businessman Li Ka-shing owns 12 percent of all the listed stocks.
Mr. Li, in fact, is among the world's 10 richest people. He came to Hong Kong as a refugee from China and began working at age 12. He soon started a plastics company, which now owns Hutchison Whampoa, the conglomerate.
The businesses of Liem Sioe Liong exemplify the transnational nature of the bamboo network. He has major holdings in Hong Kong and Singapore, as well as his operations in Indonesia -- where he controls more than 60 enterprises, including many blue-chip companies.

MOST overseas Chinese take a low profile in the commercial world. No widely known consumer products have a Chinese brand name. The members of the bamboo network manufacture for others, doing sub-assembly work, wholesaling, financing and providing transportation.
Centralized family control minimizes company bureaucracy. The informality and speed of decision-making are big pluses. Key information is obtained in conversation and retained in the heads of senior managers. The ethnic Chinese billionaire Henry Sy of the Philippines typically coordinates social and business activities with his six children, all managers in the family enterprises, over a Sunday lunch that he cooks for their families.
Clearly, there are serious disadvantages associated with the family-run business. Keeping control within the family restricts the size, or at least the complexity, to which the business can grow. That can be a serious problem for high-technology companies and those serving broad-based consumer markets.
Still, partnerships with a Western corporation can be mutually beneficial if the players appreciate the differences in each other's operating methods. The ethnic Chinese business can offer important entree to leading growth sectors of Asia. But trying to transform an informal Chinese enterprise into a more bureaucratic, Western-style corporation is bound to fail. Western companies doing business in Southeast Asia must come to terms with the fact that the overseas Chinese are a force to be reckoned with.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RED HOOK;
On the Waterfront, a Snug Harbor for Artists (For Now)

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA 

 BODY:
"When I come here," Kim Faiella says, looking out across the Red Hook harbor, "I feel like I'm in Edward Hopper-land."
Ms. Faiella, a painter, is talking about the light -- broad and even, bouncing off the waves and across the low-lying buildings of Red Hook, creating a mood reminiscent of the landscapes of Hopper, the American realist painter. 
 Artists have been talking about the light in Red Hook for years. It is among the many esthetic and economic considerations that have drawn them to this enclave of warehouses and housing projects.
Red Hook is one of several communities along Brooklyn's waterfront that have drawn artists in search of space and inspiration. Rents in the sprawling old warehouses and spacious railroad apartments are relatively affordable. The sunsets are gorgeous.
And the sound of the Staten Island ferry horns, notes Jim Dahl, a muralist and painter who lives in Red Hook, makes his neighborhood seem far away from the rat race of the big city.
"Not to romanticize it, but it's really romantic," Mr. Dahl said, looking out from his sunny railroad apartment, which is cluttered with canvases and cacti, and toys for his 15-month-old baby.
"Not that everybody's doing waterfront paintings," he said, "but it's a compelling place to live."
Mr. Dahl, the president of the Brooklyn Waterfront Artists Coalition, an organization of 300 artists, has been making that case for Red Hook for the last several years, trying to needle Manhattan art aficionados and critics to venture across the water for the coalition's annual spring exhibition of 250 Brooklyn artists at the Beard Street Piers. Greg O'Connell, a former New York City police detective turned developer, has donated a 7,500-square-foot warehouse there for the last four years as an exhibition space.
The show, which began last month and continues through May 27, has already drawn more than 2,000 visitors, a boon for Mr. O'Connell, who is converting the piers into a commercial and industrial strip that will include two breweries and light manufacturing.
Therein lies the paradox. The artists were drawn to Red Hook as space became scarce in other enclaves like Williamsburg, and the area known as Dumbo, for Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass. They do not expect Red Hook to become gentrified overnight, but the prospect that the nearby neighborhood could become a hot commercial area worries them.
In Red Hook, the Artists Coalition depends on Mr. O'Connell's munificence from year to year, which is why the group is looking for a permanent exhibition space. Although the coalition has remained neutral on some hotly contested plans to develop Red Hook, it would like to use the pier -- a set of warehouses with stone walls, oak beams and windows that look out on the water -- for its annual show. Mr. O'Connell said that he is considering setting aside 5,000 square feet of the pier for use by arts groups.
The coalition also wants to preserve public access to the waterfront, littered with industrial debris, treasures for foraging artists. Ms. Faiella, for instance, recently found a road sign, used it to cover a pit for a summer pig roast, then painted on it. She calls it "Post Roast," and it now hangs near a window as part of the exhibition at the Beard Street Pier. SOMINI SENGUPTA

Five Oaks Faces Swan Song

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
For several generations of would-be crooners, the Five Oaks piano bar has been a conservatory of sorts, where even the melodically challenged can grab the microphone and shamelessly belt out an Ethel Merman show tune. In a city that thrives on change, the smoke-filled subterranean cafe on Grove and Bleecker Streets has stood its ground for five decades, greeting an unlikely mix of drag queens, first-date couples and Broadway luminaries mingling and singing without timidity.
But since April 16, Five Oaks has been shuttered, as its owner for 20 years, Ginger Regan, scrambles to find an investor who can help bring its baby grand back to life. "There's got to be someone out there who appreciates the place," said Ms. Regan, who fell several months behind in rent payments this winter, prompting the landlord, JayGrace, to lock her out and start eviction proceedings. Ms. Regan said she owed $50,000 in back rent, real-estate taxes and city water fees. A JayGrace employee, Lou Capuano, said that although the company is leaving the door open for Five Oaks to start up again, "we can't wait forever." 
 Like many Village nightspots, Five Oaks has suffered from a laggard economy, changing tastes and AIDS, which has thinned the ranks of gay men weaned on Broadway standards. Fear of crime has also pinched business. Early on July 30, 1993, Michael J. Sakara, a regular, was last seen alive at Five Oaks. His dismembered body turned up in a garbage can the following day. He was one of six gay men the police suspect were killed by the same unidentified person from 1991 to 1993
But the toughest blow came in December 1993, when Marie Blake, the gravel-voiced jazz singer who was the club's most cherished act, died at 74. Miss Blake, a Grove Street landmark for 40 years, charmed patrons five nights a week with wry one-liners and rough-hewn renditions of songs like "Miss Otis Regrets," "A-Flat Boogie Woogie" or whatever suited her mood.
Lisa Hall has worked off and on at the Five Oaks since 1976, when she fled a dairy farm in western New Jersey to chase down stardom on Broadway. "We'd take off for summer stock," said Ms. Hall, a waitress renowned for mixing gin slings and Gershwin show tunes with equal aplomb, "and afterward, Ginger would let us come back to work. Five Oaks has always been my womb."
On most nights, the bar hit its stride well after midnight, as theater professionals and musicians gathered after curtain calls uptown. Performers like Judy Garland, Carol Channing and Kathleen Battle were known to duck in, and it wasn't unusual to find Billy Stritch or Ann Hampton Calloway at the keyboard at 3 A.M. "The Five Oaks is what Greenwich Village was like 50 years ago," said John Hoglund, a cabaret reviewer for Backstage. "A staple in the theater world but also a place where people who should never get near a mike are allowed to blow the roof off. I can't imagine New York without it." ANDREW JACOBS

Foes Readying A New Attack On Helicopters

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ 

 BODY:
The air war between helicopter operators and Manhattan residents is likely to heat up as the city gets set to pick a new operator for Manhattan's busiest heliport, at 34th Street and the East River.
The antinoise forces see an opportunity to build on the gains they won last year, reducing the number of hours and number of takeoffs and landings that will be allowed for the new 34th Street operator. This year, the altitude of flights and the traffic volume at all four Manhattan heliports are at issue. Helicopter operators say they are willing to negotiate on most issues, but there is suspicion on both sides. 
 The current lease on 34th Street expires on July 31, and under the new one operations will be reduced to 12-hour days from 16, and takeoffs and landings will be nearly cut in half, to 27,886 a year from 53,973. The Economic Development Corporation, the heliport's landlord, put out a request for proposal from potential operators last week.
Efforts also continue to replace the outmoded West 30th Street Heliport. It may shift to Pier 76, at 36th Street, where the capacity may be close to the current heliport's 47,000 annual takeoffs and landings.
Last year, there were nearly 141,000 takeoffs and landings at Manhattan's four principal heliports, averaging nearly 400 a day, according to a study by the Economic Development Corporation. Three of the four heliports handle mainly sightseeing traffic, with trips available for $44 and up.
Activists like Marnie Mueller contend that operators violate their agreements with the Federal Aviation Administration by flying low over Central Park.
Helicopters are allowed to fly over theCentral Park Lake, near 72d Street, but Ms. Mueller contends that they fly as far north as 106th Street, on the West and East Sides, and as far south as 59th Street. She also contends that they fly as low as 500 feet and even north to south along Fifth Avenue.
Liberty Helicopters is one of two operators allowed to fly over Central Park (the other is Island Helicopter). Peter Wendt, Liberty's director of operations, said it is "very unlikely" that his copters fly as far north as 106th Street but "possible" that they fly across 59th.
The activists have an uphill battle to change the rules further. Jurisdictions for heliports overlap, with the Mayor, City Council, Manhattan Borough President, Community Boards 8 and 6, Planning Commission, Economic Development Corporation, F.A.A., Port Authority and State Department of Transportation playing roles.

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
High Cost of Plugging The Gaps in Medicare

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
FOR Harold Melson, the crunch started to hit home two years ago.
That was when Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York sent a letter announcing an 11 percent premium increase for the insurance he had bought to pay medical bills not covered by Medicare. A year ago, it sent another letter, this time raising rates 10 percent on his so-called Medigap policy. 
 For Mr. Melson, a 73-year-old retired Manhattan executive, that meant a jump to $1,649 a year, not to mention a probable rise in his blood pressure.
"I just couldn't believe it," said Mr. Melson, who works part time as an accountant. "Who's going to be able to afford these policies if the premiums keep rising at this rate? I'm lucky -- I still work and have money. A person who is on a fixed income would really be hurting."
Many apparently are.
The good news is that there are a number of ways to end the pain. The bad news is that it can take a lot of hard work to figure out which one -- if any -- applies to you.
Medigap coverage is increasingly seen as a necessity by those over 65 who are enrolled in Medicare. Depending on the particular plan, a Medigap policy can fill in many of the gaping holes in the Government's health care program for senior citizens -- paying for everything from hospital and doctor co-insurance charges and deductibles to prescription drugs and some home care. Those expenses can easily run into many thousands of dollars a year. The policies themselves cost a few hundred dollars a year to $3,000 and up.
About half of the 38 million Americans covered by Medicare have Medigap insurance, and most have suffered a double-digit hike in premiums within the last year, mainly a result, insurers say, of a rush of claims and the increased use of outpatient services like X-rays and lab tests. In New York, the average premium of the five largest Medigap insurers soared 11 percent, a rate that was equaled or topped in Connecticut and New Jersey and in popular retirement states like Arizona and Florida, among others. By contrast, the overall inflation rate was just 2.5 percent in 1995.
Among those feeling the pinch the worst are the 3.2 million people who bought coverage through the American Association of Retired Persons. Those policies, which were coveted because they were sold by the Prudential Insurance Company of America without regard to an applicant's health problems, are expected to cost an average of 26 percent more this year.
Stunned by the large increases, many people are simply gritting their teeth and paying, unable or unwilling to find out if they can do better in what has traditionally been a baffling and sometimes bruising marketplace for older consumers.
Even worse, many others have panicked, jumping at the first thing they find that is cheaper. If they are not careful, that can leave them with less protection than they need, and thus prove far more expensive or even ruinous. Insurers may not allow them to switch back unless they are required to do so by state law.
"What's happening to a lot of seniors is that they're acting on their fear," said Diane Bartholomew, program director at Action for Older Persons, a nonprofit counseling service in Binghamton, N.Y.
What they should be doing instead, experts say, is exploring their options, which have been increasing.
They can shop around for another carrier selling the same policy at a lower rate. (The policies come in 10 standard varieties.) They can keep the existing carrier, but trade down to a less comprehensive policy, if they conclude that the bells and whistles they will be giving up are of negligible consequence. They can even apply for free coverage under state and Federal programs, if their assets and income are low enough. Or they can join the growing crowd leaving the traditional Medigap field and signing up instead with a health maintenance organization specifically tailored to Medicare beneficiaries -- theoretically the most comprehensive yet least expensive option for most people.
The problem is that not all of these choices are available to everyone. While Connecticut, New Jersey and New York allow all 10 varieties of Medigap policies to be sold, for example, Vermont permits only 7 and Delaware just 6. Some states permit insurers to severely restrict the movement from carrier to carrier or from one type of policy to another, particularly for people with pre-existing health conditions. In some states, only a handful of Medigap insurers do business and the first Medicare H.M.O. may not arrive until late this year at the earliest, when a new program backed by the A.A.R.P. kicks off.
All of which means that someone living in, say, Mississippi, which has no Medicare H.M.O. and which severely restricts movement from one Medigap policy to another, has fewer choices than Mr. Melson does in New York, which provides as many options as any state. Indeed, Mr. Melson can switch to any of the 10 Medigap plans or to an H.M.O. and back again. He can also switch companies, because New York has a so-called continuous open enrollment law that virtually bars carriers from rejecting any senior citizen. (Mr. Melson is still thinking about what to do.)
But that geographic disparity is just one of Medigap's wrinkles. Personal circumstances are another.
Each insurance choice comes with trade-offs in coverage and service that have to be assessed both in terms of present health needs and possible needs in the future. Is it prudent to give up coverage for prescription drugs to save hundreds of dollars or more in premiums if that feature may not be available down the line, when a heart problem or diabetes could be part of the picture?
Indeed, for some people who go to the doctor often, it may pay to spend even more on premiums to upgrade to a better policy.
Consider the case of Mary Boddie, a retired 79-year-old seamstress in Rochester who was unhappy with her old Medigap plan. That plan left her with hefty deductibles and co-insurance payments, which, she said, "were really killing me." When the premiums went up last year, that was the last straw. She switched to a better plan that costs a bit more. She figures she is ahead about $100 a year, with more savings to come -- unless, of course, new premium increases overtake her.
IN short, the millions of people getting premium notices these days face a devilishly confusing task trying to decide their next move.
Some will seek help from friends, family members or outside experts. Each state -- and many large cities, including New York -- has an agency that handles the problems of the elderly. Typically, these offices can provide lists of insurers doing business in their areas as well as information about how they stack up on price, service and consumer complaints. And self-help books are available that walk the reader as gently as possible through all the twists and turns of the Medicare insurance maze.
Increasingly, the biggest decision is whether to stay with a Medigap policy or jump ship and take the H.M.O. route. For those who opt to stay with Medigap, the key decisions then become which of the 10 policies to buy -- and from which insurer.
Medicare H.M.O.'s have two powerful lures: savings and simplicity.
The H.M.O.'s take the place of Medigap insurance, in some cases offering even more comprehensive coverage than the best Medigap plan on the market. They are similar to traditional health maintenance organizations. Patients receive treatment from a network of doctors, who make referrals to specialists and hospitals that are also within the network.
For those who stay in the network, Medicare H.M.O.'s eliminate the use of claim forms, because there are no deductibles or co-insurance. Best of all, they frequently cost nothing. The Federal Government pays most or all of the freight, hoping the discipline of managed care will rein in the nation's runaway Medicare expenses. (Small fees are sometimes charged when there are not enough members in an H.M.O. to cover overhead costs, usually during the start-up period.)
To join, an applicant must be fully enrolled in Medicare. Medicare comes in two forms. Part A, which covers hospital care, carries no charge for most people. Part B, which is normally optional and covers basic medical care, costs $42.50 a month. Members of H.M.O.'s must pay that premium, which most elderly people are already doing anyway.
Many people are deciding they can't afford to pass up H.M.O.'s, especially since they must take applicants regardless of medical condition, except for those in a hospice or suffering from permanent kidney failure. Last year, enrollment jumped 25 percent nationwide, to 3.9 million.
But there is no free lunch, even for the elderly. Depending on where they live and how extensive their H.M.O. network is, new members may find that they have to use unfamiliar physicians, travel farther for care and perhaps wait longer for appointments, counselors for the elderly say.
Until recently, members of Medicare H.M.O.'s would not be covered if they went to doctors outside their network except for emergency or so-called urgent care, according to the Health Care Financing Administration, the Federal agency that regulates Medicare H.M.O.'s. That changed on Jan. 1. Now, H.M.O.'s can provide an out-of-network option, which is subject to certain conditions, although how many are offering the choice is not clear.
What about just trying an H.M.O. to see how good it is? That could be a bumpy trip in some places. In New York, for example, you can try out an H.M.O. and jump back to a Medigap policy if you change your mind, without penalty. Try to make the return trip in Connecticut or New Jersey and you could be denied coverage by the Medigap insurer, except for the A.A.R.P. plan that admits all applicants regardless of their medical histories. The reason: Connecticut and New Jersey do not have continuous open enrollment laws.
Some help is on the way, at least in terms of more choices. The A.A.R.P., which has 33 million members, is picking an insurer to endorse for an H.M.O. that it hopes will be in business late this year in 18 metropolitan areas. By 1998, the managed care plan should be available in all 50 states, A.A.R.P., which is based in Washington, says.
The group's current five-year contract with Prudential to supply Medigap insurance to its members ends next year. As it has usually done at renewal time during its 15-year relationship with Prudential, it is soliciting bids from other carriers.
"We're not getting rid of our Medigap coverage," said Susanne C. Bowman, who heads the association's insurance services department. "People who have Medigap policies with Prudential through us will still be able to use them. We've taken a look at the market and we want to be able to compete with what's out there. That's why we're offering the managed care plan. It gives people one more choice of coverage, especially if their Medigap premiums have gone beyond their reach."
What is especially painful about the sudden upward spiral in Medigap premiums is that most elderly people had no clue it was coming.
The Federal Government overhauled the Medigap insurance program less than four years ago, in July 1992, by creating a system of 10 standardized plans, labeled A through J. That ended a scandalous period marked by a hodgepodge of densely written plans whose features were virtually impossible to understand. Unscrupulous agents capitalized on this confusion, persuading many elderly people that they needed two or three policies to be safe. But even after paying for policies that overlapped in places, people could be left with large gaps in their coverage.

THE new system makes it much easier to comparison-shop, with the level of benefits increasing as policies go up the alphabet. Policies labeled A and B, for example, pay Medicare's basic gaps -- the deductible and daily co-insurance for hospital care. Plans H, I and J -- known as the Cadillacs of the system -- cover far more, including drugs and routine physicals. The premiums rise accordingly: in New York, for example, they now range from $474 annually for an A plan to $2,832 for a J.
The oil in the Federal machine is that the benefits in each category must be the same from one carrier to the next. Plan B policies at Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and at Mutual of Omaha must offer identical coverage, for example.
"If you want to talk about Federal legislation that worked, the Medigap standardization did," said Geraldine Dallek, director of health policy for Families USA, a health care consumer advocacy group in Washington. "Medicare beneficiaries can look at a Medigap policy and know what they're buying. Before, seniors were throwing money down the drain on policies that offered benefits they already had or didn't need."
The elderly still have choices to make, though, because reliability and service can differ markedly from insurer to insurer. And so can prices: in New York City, for instance, the B plan offered by Empire Blue Cross costs $1,093.20 a year, while Mutual of Omaha's is $819.84, or $273.36 less.
The common denominator on prices is that they are going up, for a variety of reasons. Some carriers decided early on to offer premiums far below their competitors', thereby bolstering revenues and market share but guaranteeing sharp price increases down the line. As a group, the insurers have been hit with a rash of claims in the last two years. And Medicare H.M.O.'s have been siphoning off healthier and younger Medicare beneficiaries, leaving many Medigap carriers with a bounty of older members with more health problems.
The American Association of Retired Persons' program with Prudential has felt the pressure more than most because it, unlike other Medigap carriers, will always take applicants over age 65, regardless of their medical histories.
"A.A.R.P. was the last resort for Medicare beneficiaries who couldn't get Medigap policies anywhere else," said Bonnie Burns, a health care consultant for the elderly in Scotts Valley, Calif. "It's admirable of the A.A.R.P. for maintaining that position, but they wind up getting a lot of unhealthy members who made claims on their coverage."
(Besides covering everyone over 65, Medicare is available to anyone younger who has permanent kidney failure or who receives Social Security disability insurance. But those under 65 find it very hard to obtain Medigap insurance because insurers, including the A.A.R.P.'s Prudential program, typically disqualify them on health grounds.)

TO get the most for their money, the elderly need to understand their options as thoroughly as possible. That understanding is particularly important when they first become eligible for Medicare.
Under Federal rules, for six months after getting Medicare's Part B medical coverage, an elderly person cannot be denied a Medigap policy for any medical reason, although pre-existing conditions may not be covered for up to half a year. Miss that enrollment window and one's options could be narrowed considerably. In most places, but not in New York State, Medigap coverage could be denied outright by insurers on medical grounds. That could leave a person with just two choices: signing up with the carrier of last resort, the A.A.R.P. program with Prudential, or going to a Medicare H.M.O.
While some Medicare beneficiaries miss enrollment windows, others make the mistake of looking only at current premium levels when comparing prices. Policies are priced in different ways, which not only affect current charges but also where premiums will go in the future.
Carriers use one of three methods to fix premiums: issue age, attained age and community rating. The issue-age method pegs the premium to an applicant's age when signing up, so that someone who gets a policy at 65, say, will always pay the rate that is in effect for a healthy 65-year-old, even when the beneficiary reaches 80 or 90. Premiums on attained-age policies increase as the beneficiary gets older. Carriers that sell community-rating policies charge all beneficiaries in a particular area the same amount, a rate that is based on the demographics and health experience of the group.
How the policy is priced can mean either savings or heartache. "Attained-age policies are still being pushed today," said Diane Archer, executive director of the Medicare Rights Center, a New York organization that advises consumers about Medicare. "People must understand that if they have an attained-age policy, their premiums are going to rise sharply over the life of the policy."
Premiums on the two other pricing methods don't increase as rapidly. Community-rated policies tend to be the least expensive when beneficiaries are older and they tend to have less income.
Even if a Medicare beneficiary navigates Medigap's structural land mines, decisions must be made about which of the 10 types of policies fits best.
 "Some people are in policies with high premiums now because they didn't make the best coverage choice from the outset," Mrs. Dallek of Families USA said. "They should take a serious look at Medicare benefits and decide what sort of further coverage they need."
Medicare has all kinds of gaps to fill. Hospital coverage comes with a $736 deductible plus a daily charge that runs as high as $368 for stays longer than three months.
Nursing home coverage is even skimpier. Providing that the facility is Medicare-certified -- you pay everything if it's not -- Medicare will pick up the tab for the first 20 days, with certain conditions. The next 80 days come with a $92 daily charge. After that, the bill is all yours.
Then there are the holes in Part B medical coverage. On top of the $42.50 monthly premium, the elderly pay a $100 annual deductible and 20 percent of most doctor and outpatient hospital bills.
And they cannot look to Medicare to pay for prescription drugs, dentures, routine physicals, eye exams, glasses, hearing aids, foot care, charges for the first three pints of blood or any medical care received outside the United States or its territories.
"The deductibles alone are enough to tax an elderly person on a fixed income," said Ann R. Krull, director of benefits and entitlements at the New York State Office for the Aging. "Most people need some form of supplemental coverage unless, of course, they're rich."

BUT which Medigap policy to get? Some states narrow the choices for you. Plan A, which pays for hospital co-insurance, must be available in all states. Beyond that, it's pot luck. In Delaware, for example, plans C, F, G and H are not available. In Vermont, you can't buy plans F, G and I. But in Connecticut, New Jersey and New York, all 10 plans can be had.
Assuming you have choices, how much coverage should you buy? At a minimum, skip A and B, consumer advocates say, and go to C, which covers the hospital and medical deductibles plus the $92 daily nursing home co-insurance. (Full coverage for nursing home care is beyond the scope of even Medigap insurance. For that, a separate policy for long-term care is needed.)
Those who visit doctors a lot should consider plan F, the most popular package in many states. Not only does the plan cover hospital and medical deductibles, it picks up doctor charges that exceed Medicare limits.
The Cadillac plans -- H, I and J -- are the only ones to offer reimbursements for prescription drugs. J, the top of the line, pays up to $3,000 a year for drugs, after a $250 deductible and 50 percent co-insurance.
"What a lot of Medicare beneficiaries do Continued on Next Page

when they look at these plans is say, 'Well, I don't spend a lot on prescription drugs now, so I don't need one of these plans,' " Mrs. Dallek said. "But that can change and they may have trouble getting it later."
Indeed, those who don't enroll in a drug plan during the six-month open window are often rejected later. That is true even of the Prudential A.A.R.P. program, which allows unfettered movement to lesser plans but reserves the right to reject a bid to upgrade to a drug plan, according to A.A.R.P.
That is what happened to John Ryan, a retired construction executive who lives in Southbury, Conn. Mr. Ryan thought he had plenty of coverage when he bought the A.A.R.P.'s G plan through Prudential three years ago. Within two years, however, his heart condition worsened, sending his bills for drugs to $1,200 a year. When he tried to buy a J plan last year, Prudential turned him down, noting that his heart condition was pre-existing and thus disqualified him.
That said, it still might not make sense to get J coverage, given its higher premium and the $3,000 cap and other restrictions on drug reimbursement. You must do the math to see whether it pays, or makes more sense to have a lesser plan. (Plan J does offer a few more perks than most plans, like flu shots, and these also have to be factored into the math.)
Trading up would prove costly even for Mr. Ryan, unless his drug bills increased sharply. That is because his premium would go up $633 a year while the drug reimbursement would amount to just $475, after the $250 deductible and $475 in co-insurance on the rest.
"Seniors who can afford it should self-insure the drug benefit," said Joe Baker, associate director of the Medicare Rights Center. "It works best to put money aside unless you have a lot of bills for prescription drugs. Then, one of the plans may pay off."
WHAT about those who can't handle the premiums they are already paying? Again, by proceeding carefully, it may be possible to save money without exposing yourself to an undue amount of additional risk.
Switching from an F plan, for example, down to a C would cut premiums as much as $826 a year in New York City. What is lost is one benefit -- paying doctors' charges that exceed Medicare limits.
Others may decide to save by switching carriers. With its most recent hike in premiums, Prudential's A.A.R.P. program is no longer the cheapest in many areas. Of the 17 carriers that provide Plan F coverage in Connecticut, for example, 12 have lower premiums than the A.A.R.P. policy. A policy from Nationwide Insurance, the least expensive from a leading carrier, is $174 less.
The savings can be even more substantial in other places. New York City residents who have a plan F policy with American Family Life pay $1,830 a year. But by switching to Mutual of Omaha or New York Life, they would pay just $1,094, or $736 less.
Lucy and Paul Catalano, a retired couple in Rochester, replaced their older Medigap policy a few years ago with a similar one from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Rochester. That switch now saves them $384 a year in premiums, Mrs. Catalano said. "My husband is 72 and I'm 73, and he wasn't bringing in as much money as before," she said. "We had to do something. Switching over has really helped us out. We didn't give up any benefits and we're saving money at the same time."
Changing policies or carriers is not always easy, however. In Maine, for example, switches can be made in only one month, which changes from year to year. In Massachusetts, the window is in February and March. And some states do not require insurers to provide open-enrollment periods.
Many people, frustrated by the Medigap system, are making the biggest switch of all -- to Medicare H.M.O.'s.
"This is definitely the way coverage will go in the future," said Craig Schub, president of Secure Horizons, a Medicare H.M.O. based in Cypress, Calif. Older people, he added, "need the extensive care that only we can provide."
Despite all the hoopla, the plans have not always been easy to find. Most are located on the West Coast and in Florida. Nine states -- including Idaho, Maine, Montana and New Hampshire -- still have none. That is also true in some parts of New York; in Connecticut, four Medicare H.M.O.'s serve the entire state. By contrast, 12 H.M.O.'s vie for patients in some parts of California.
In that state, "the competition between the Medicare H.M.O.'s is unbelievable," said Ms. Burns, the health care consultant in Scotts Valley, Calif. "It starts out slow in one state and then a lot of H.M.O.'s come in. For the system to work, the H.M.O.'s have to keep admitting healthy people to pay for the claims of the people who get sick."
Those who have enrolled tend to swear by their coverage. But many have yet to file extensive claims because they have been members for such a short time.
One very pleased customer is Barbara Mosera, a child-care worker in Huntington Station, L.I., who dropped her husband's Medigap policy with U.S. Healthcare last year to join a Medicare H.M.O. with Oxford Health Plans.
"It's absolutely wonderful," Mrs. Mosera said. "When we enrolled, they were so nice and professional. They had meetings at the diner where we could get doughnuts and coffee. And then we had a lady come over and she outlined everything. I tell all my friends that we don't pay a premium, and they don't believe me."
Still, the plans have yet to be fully tested on the East Coast, particularly when it comes to availability of service.
"We have concerns that Medicare H.M.O.'s don't work as well on the East Coast as they do on the West Coast," said Herb Stupp, commissioner of the Department for the Aging in New York City. "They've had more time to iron out the problems. It will take some time for that to happen here."

AS H.M.O.'s attract more people to their plans, many counselors for the elderly are critical of some of their marketing methods. One of their biggest complaints is over promotional literature that shows elderly people living only active lives. Flip through a Secure Horizons brochure and you not only see an elderly woman drying herself off after a swim, but a gray-haired couple playing soccer with a young boy.
"You'd never know it from looking at their marketing materials but Medicare H.M.O.'s have to take everyone, unless they're in a hospice or have end-stage kidney failure," Ms. Burns said. "If you've got a pre-existing condition, the H.M.O. can't stop you from enrolling. But they don't want everybody; they only want the younger, healthy crowd."
And the H.M.O.'s go out of their way to make sure they get them, some critics said. According to several counselors for the aging, it is common for a Medicare H.M.O. to hold an introductory seminar on the second floor of a building. That way, the critics said, people who easily handle the stairs can be singled out for direct sales pitches.
"Another thing that you'll see are Medicare H.M.O.'s having seminars in a site that's away from public transportation," Ms. Burns said. "That way they only get the people who are healthy enough to drive there."
Asked about his company's recruiting practices, Mr. Schub of Secure Horizons denied any subterfuge. "Over the long run, it balances out and we have our share of ailing people," he said. "Most of the people who enroll in our plan do it through the mail, so we have no control over that. To suggest otherwise is silly."
Still, no one says that Medicare H.M.O.'s are free of problems. Many of the ills that haunt traditional H.M.O.'s are also prevalent with their Medicare counterparts. The main complication: care received outside the network.
Three years ago, Joan Charles, an accounting clerk with the Sun Oil Company, moved her ailing father into her house in Huntington Valley, Pa., from New York City, so that she could take better care of him. But her father's Medicare H.M.O., operated by the Health Insurance Plan of Greater New York, did not extend coverage to Pennsylvania. All of his claims were rejected, leaving Ms. Charles with more than $20,000 in unpaid bills.
"The entire situation really makes me angry," Ms. Charles said. "You know, I could have put him in a nursing home in New York and made them pay for it. The bills were cheaper because he was staying with me. But they didn't even want to hear it. They were totally inflexible."
H.I.P. executives say Ms. Charles was told early on about the problem of moving her father out of state. "We always made it clear that there were geography limits to our coverage," said Kevin Davitt, vice president of communications. "When Ms. Charles moved her father out of the New York area, we told her that we wouldn't pay claims, and she acknowledged that."
FOR those struggling to pay for any type of coverage, there are still some cards to play, those who advise the elderly say.
 Several Federal programs are available to low-income people that relieve them of some of the burden. For example, those who earn less than $665 a month, or $883 if married, can sign up for the Qualified Medicare Beneficiary Program, which pays Medicare premiums, deductibles and co-insurance. The Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary Program, for those with monthly income of $794 or less, or $1,056 if married, pays Part B premiums. And Medicaid, available to New Yorkers making $579 or less, or $829 if married, pays for Medicare premiums, deductibles, co-insurance and a few extras like prescription drugs and eyeglasses. (Asset limits also apply for qualification to all these programs.)
Most states also have programs that pay for some form of Medigap coverage. In New York, those who earn less than $17,500 a year, or $23,000 if married, can qualify for Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage, which pays about 60 percent of drug costs with no limit.
"The key is to consider the options and not panic," Ms. Bartholomew said. "When elderly people get in a crunch, they sometimes want to just give up. What we don't want is for someone to feel trapped. They're not."

The cost of Medigap insurance for the elderly is rising rapidly, even though increases in inflation and health care insurance have been subdued in recent years. The policies are used to cover things like deductibles and prescriptions drugs that are not covered by the Government's Medicare health-care program.

HEADLINE: In Sweden, a Shy Dynasty Steps Out

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: STOCKHOLM

 BODY:
IT is one of the most powerful business families in the world, Sweden's answer to the Rockefellers. Yet outside select circles in Europe, the name Wallenberg is likely to ring bells only for those who have heard the tale of Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat who disappeared mysteriously in Russia at the end of World War II after rescuing thousands of Jews.
But Raoul was only a distant cousin of the reigning patriarch, Peter Wallenberg, and was never involved in the family business, which began when their great-grandfather, Andre Oscar Wallenberg, opened a bank in Stockholm in 1856. The empire has since expanded to control companies representing some 40 percent of the Swedish stock market. 
 And the world may soon learn its name. Peter Wallenberg, 69, is preparing to loosen his iron grip and make way for the fifth generation, headed by his son Jacob; his nephew, Marcus, and his longtime lieutenant, Claes Dahlback, all of whom have their sights firmly set on making the empire a global one.
That empire is already sizable. At the end of last year, Investor A. B., the holding company for the Wallenbergs, had a market value of $6.4 billion.
Now the holding company, which is traded on the London and Stockholm exchanges, is changing gears, gradually pulling money out of solid Swedish industrial companies -- long the bedrock of Wallenberg power -- and moving it into nimble, fast-growth businesses in telecommunications, media, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Those still unidentified ventures may be based as nearby as Helsinki, Finland, or as far away as Florida.
And, most dramatic, the family is likely to throw open its coming-out party to the common folk, listing American depository receipts in Investor on Nasdaq. Meetings with analysts and potential investors are already planned for this fall. "A diversity of shareholders is very important for a well-functioning market," Mr. Dahlback said in a recent letter to shareholders.
The invitation would not, of course, be a purely magnanimous gesture. The Wallenbergs need to tap into deeper pockets than they can find in Sweden if they want their empire to be one that can last well into the next century.
"The real issue for them has been getting out of Sweden," said an investment banker who helped the family get out from under a crushing debt load in the early 1990's. "They need greater access to global capital markets."
They have already tested the waters. Last month, in one of the world's biggest initial public offerings ever -- in London and Stockholm, as well as on the New York Stock Exchange -- Investor sold half of its truck-manufacturing powerhouse, Scania. It raised $2.7 billion, establishing a market value for its biggest holding well above its own estimates of about $2 billion. "We were delighted," Mr. Dahlback said.
Investor also received permission late last year from the American Securities and Exchange Commission to market itself as an industrial holding company, not a financial holding company, which would have limited the number of investors it could have.
One investor who didn't wait for an American listing was Michael Price, the money manager whose demands for better shareholder value have, among other things, helped send Chase Manhattan Bank running into the arms of Chemical Bank. At the end of last year, Mr. Price's Mutual Series Fund Inc. held a 7.1 percent stake -- and 4.9 percent of the voting power -- making it Investor's third-largest shareholder. (Like most Scandinavian companies, Investor has two classes of stock, with A shares having 10 times the voting rights of B shares.)

BECAUSE Investor's shares typically trade at a 20 percent discount to its net asset value despite annual returns averaging around 20 percent, Mr. Price's interest could seem ominous -- threatening, say, to put pressure on to sell assets.
Mr. Dahlback and Peter Wallenberg don't see it that way. "I welcome him in," Mr. Wallenberg said, jesting that Mr. Price might even become an ally against the Swedish investment funds that have kicked up a fuss over his $1.1 million pay last year, since that is peanuts by American standards.
The prospect of dealing with new, perhaps more meddlesome, investors leaves the two men unfazed, perhaps because under Mr. Wallenberg's leadership, the empire has thrived largely on consensus. Of Investor's 16 companies, only two, the Saab Group, the aerospace and defense technology company, and Electrolux, the vacuum cleaner maker, are controlled by voting rights alone.
In another, Saab Automobile, Investor splits the voting power with General Motors. All the rest are in the Wallenbergs' grip, thanks to the dual-share system and an incestuous Swedish business climate that fosters behind-the-scenes decisions.
"It isn't control so much as the aura of control," said Pehr Gyllenhammar, the former head of Volvo and a longtime nemesis of Peter Wallenberg. At the telecommunications giant Ericsson, for instance, "they share control with Handelsbanken, but you'd never know it," he said. "Everyone regards Ericsson as a Wallenberg company, and in many ways it is -- simply because of that perception."
It was Peter Wallenberg's father, Marcus Wallenberg Jr., who created that perception. The Swedish equivalent of Harold Geneen, the fabled former chief of ITT, Marcus Wallenberg Jr. ruled the empire -- and the Swedish business world -- for three decades through the 1970's by sheer force of personality. He brooked no dissent, not even from his brother, Jacob, who was chairman of the family bank, Stockholms Enskilda Bank, until he objected to Marcus Jr.'s plan to merge it with Skandinaviska Bank in the early 1970's.
Marcus Jr. engineered his brother's ouster from the bank's board and his own appointment as chairman, not to mention the merger. But he paid a high price. Although the official version has it that his favorite son and chosen successor, Marc Wallenberg, then president of Stockholms Enskilda, was working with his father on the merger, many believe he had sided with his uncle. Marc committed suicide on Nov. 16, 1971, just weeks before the merger was complete, perhaps despairing that he would ever emerge from his father's shadow.
It was a harsh comeuppance for Marcus Wallenberg Jr., who for years had said his youngest son, Peter, had neither the intelligence nor the vision to head the family enterprise. Like so many of Marcus Wallenberg Jr.'s opinions, that one was regarded as gospel in Sweden for years. "Nobody would have thought Peter would take on the role and be successful," said P. O. Edin, chief economist of the Swedish trade union group, a trace of surprise in his voice. "Although he isn't regarded as a strong industrial leader, he is the leader of the group without question."
Inheriting the mantle under such circumstances meant Peter Wallenberg, who had not been trained to take over the empire, had no choice but to seek advice and counsel from those around him. The Swedish media and his business rivals here like to portray him as a tyrant, and he does use an informal veto to shoot down plans not to his liking.
But if he is a dictator, he is a benevolent one. In his 14 years at the helm, he has attracted some of the world's most admired business leaders to operate and guide the family companies.
Among them is Percy Barnevik, under whose leadership ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd., the electrical engineering giant that is controlled 50-50 by the Wallenbergs and Swiss Brown Boveri, was voted the most respected company in the world for two years running in a poll of top executives by The Financial Times.
And bankers say Mr. Dahlback, the 49-year-old president of Investor, has emerged as a strong leader, spearheading the family's global ambitions through an enviable collection of carefully cultivated contacts.
"The smartest thing Peter Wallenberg ever did was to understand that to preserve the family's power, he had to open it up," said Ken Costa, global head of mergers and acquisitions at SBC Warburg, which has a small stake in Investor.
The consensus he has achieved will no doubt come in handy as the family courts new allies outside the close-knit circle of banks, unions and businesses that run Sweden Inc. Investor has begun tapping Mr. Dahlback's contacts in search of global partners.
Mr. Dahlback recently played golf with John Mack, president of Morgan Stanley & Company, taking time to discuss how Investor and one of the firm's private equity funds might link up. Peter D. Sutherland, chairman of Goldman Sachs International and an Investor director, provides an entree to the billions in private equity managed by Goldman, Sachs & Company. And Investor has already joined forces with AEA Investors Inc., which manages money for the likes of Henry Kissinger and the Nordstrom family, to form a private equity fund dedicated to investing in Scandinavian companies.

ALL this would seem to collide with the Wallenberg family motto, "Esse non vidare" (Latin for, "To be, not to be seen"). And the growth businesses the family will be pursuing are inherently high-profile.
To be sure, the family is no stranger to the headaches of high-profile companies. In spite of its pristine reputation, ABB is currently the target of an investigation by the European Commission into price-fixing, while Astra, a pharmaceuticals maker that was slated to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange later this month, has been thrown under a cloud because of accusations of rampant sexual harassment in its United States operations.
And the Wallenbergs are convinced they have no other choice. "Sure, it's deeper water than we're used to, and uncharted," Mr. Dahlback said. "But we have to move into it because what is Sweden? In a few years, just another province of Europe."
Similar remarks have landed Mr. Dahlback in hot water at home. He worked in Investor's New York office for two years in the 1970's and expresses much affinity for things American. Recently, he said he would rather invest in a company in, say, California, than one in Sweden, which heightened long-standing fears here that the Wallenbergs were aiming to abandon Sweden altogether.
Peter Wallenberg, though, prefers to paint all the changes as rather dull and Darwinian, not the sort of stuff, really, that should furrow brows. Going global, he contends, is not glamorous; it's what the Wallenbergs have been doing for more than a century.
"Sweden is a small country, and our companies have had to reach outside to expand their markets," he said. "Quite a few of them have as little as 5 percent of their market here in Sweden."
Then, with a smile that suggests that what he is about to say will only increase the hoopla, he adds, "So you might say Investor is not a domestic company already. In some cases, we are as American as we are Swedish -- or as British, French or German."
It is classic Peter Wallenberg, audacious and provocative. A rumpled man, whose appetite is evident in the belly that defiantly refuses to stay tucked under his belt, he looks not at all like the patriarch of a vast and majestic realm.
Indeed, he was not trained to be one. While his older brother, Marc, was being groomed at the family bank, Peter was relegated to the equivalent of the mail room, a mine shaft at Atlas Copco, a mining, construction and engineering concern. He went on to become a salesman in what was then Rhodesia and then in the United States. "Effectively, he was exiled," one banker said.
So certain was Marcus Wallenberg Jr. that his youngest son was unfit for the throne that sometime around 1982, near the end of his life, he took steps to tie the Wallenberg empire to another great Swedish business group, Volvo, and position its chairman, Mr. Gyllenhammar, to assume leadership of both.
The plans involved selling Volvo 25 percent of Atlas Copco. Mr. Gyllenhammar then surprised Peter Wallenberg, who by then, at 56, had taken his father's place, with the news that Marcus Wallenberg had also agreed to sell Volvo 25 percent of Stora Kopparberg, a forest products company. Having big positions in two large Wallenberg holdings gave Mr. Gyllenhammar a powerful and potentially meddlesome platform.
But despite his legendary attention to detail -- he was known for keeping bankers up into the wee hours, haggling over the last eighth of a percentage point on a loan deal -- Marcus Jr. didn't know his youngest son well enough.
"Let's put it this way: I rather like a fight, and he gave me an opening," Peter Wallenberg said when asked whether his father's doubts had anything to do with his success.
Volvo clearly did not intend to be a passive Investor. Mr. Gyllenhammar sought to install his own managers at Stora and made other moves to participate in governing the company.
Quietly, however, Investor was buying shares of Volvo on the open market. To this day, Peter Wallenberg contends that Investor bought the shares at Mr. Gyllenhammar's request, "to give him some stockholder protection," but it amassed a large-enough position to cause discomfort in the Volvo camp. In early 1984, the two companies reached a truce: the Wallenbergs bought Volvo's shares in Atlas Copco and Stora, and Volvo bought its shares from Investor.
While Investor was criticized for paying a premium to buy back the shares, the victory over Mr. Gyllenhammar was well worth the price to the family, proving that Peter Wallenberg could defend the family turf.
But his victory apparently did not satisfy him. Peter Wallenberg and Pehr Gyllenhammar collided again in 1994, when Volvo proposed merging with the French car maker Renault. The deal was blocked by shareholders, particularly a fund managed by the Wallenberg bank, and some in Sweden suggest that the Wallenbergs themselves were instrumental in the deal's demise because they did not want Volvo to upstage their own plans to become the world's pre-eminent Swedish enterprise.

PETER WALLENBERG denies having anything to do with the failure of the Renault deal, which led to Mr. Gyllenhammar's resignation. "The French couldn't understand why the deal didn't go through," he said, "so they put out the word that the Wallenberg group torpedoed the deal."
For his part, Mr. Gyllenhammar, now a senior adviser at Lazard Brothers in London, has no hard feelings. "This was a battle of conviction," he said. "I lost, and I decided to leave."
The 64-thousand-kronor question in Stockholm these days is whether Peter Wallenberg will really let go of the power he has worked so hard to attain. He has been busily disengaging himself from the family businesses, relinquishing the chairman's seat at Atlas Copco, Asea and ABB Asea Brown Boveri and the vice chairman's seat at Ericsson and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken.
But he will remain chairman of Investor and of the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation, a charitable trust founded by a great-uncle in 1917 that now exercises control over Investor. Investor owns shares in the companies, and family foundations control 40 percent of the voting rights in Investor and have enough allies to command a majority.
Even he acknowledges some ambivalence. Asked how he feels about taking a less prominent role, he says: "I'll tell you that in six months. Right now, I keep on debating the matter myself."
He harbors none of the doubts about his son and nephew that his father so openly expressed about him. "They are prepared," he said, though he reiterated that "they must prove themselves."
Not surprisingly, they have come up through the family power bases. Jacob Wallenberg, 40, is executive vice president of the family bank and head of its securities unit, while Marcus Wallenberg, 39, nicknamed Husky, earned his spurs at the family's huge forest-products concern, Stora, and is now executive vice president of Investor.
Bankers who know them say they have talents that mesh well, with Marcus knowing more about the day-to-day requirements of operating big companies and Jacob having a deeper understanding of financial engineering.
Outside that, the cousins keep a low profile. Sniping abounds in Sweden on why it has taken them so long to rise to the top, with the business media frequently quoting their grandfather, a noted insomniac, who used to say that a corporate vice president was at his best at 35 because he was young enough to "lie awake at night worrying about his responsibilities."
But the Wallenberg empire today is vastly more complex and unwieldy. "The world is a different place," said Mr. Edin, the union economist. "Family members are accepted as moderators among the group, but perhaps the strongest members of the group are not within the family."
Mr. Dahlback has clearly emerged as the point man in recent years, and many wonder how the family will manage to keep him happy while slotting its own members into leading roles. He owns convertible debentures in Investor that, exchanged for stock and added to his existing holdings, would give him a 6.5 percent stake, which would be the largest stake held by an individual after Peter Wallenberg.
"I've never thought about it, actually," said Mr. Dahlback, who was clearly taken aback when asked how he felt about serving, rather than leading, the next generation of Wallenbergs. "I have great loyalty to them; we've never had any differences. I've been president of Investor for 18 years. If I wasn't happy I would have left years ago."
In fact, Mr. Dahlback has been one of the biggest advocates of putting the family name on a shingle, afraid that Investor is too anonymous to attract individual investors. "We've been thinking about something with Wallenberg in it," he said, "but Peter Wallenberg doesn't like that so much because he says, which is true, that it would imply the family owns the company, which it doesn't."
"Esse non vidare," as they say.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
As Retail Rebounds, Investors Snap Up Loehmann's

BYLINE: By DOREEN HEMLOCK 

 BODY:
WHEN Loehmann's Inc. went public Tuesday, the scene had all the energy associated with the fabled women's clothing store. Investors snapped up the stock as if they were bargain designer dresses, pushing prices from an anticipated $14 a share to $22.25 at day's end. By the weekend, the stock had risen still more, closing Friday at $27.375. Even the most bullish retail analysts were surprised.
"I think people like their story," said Steven Tuen, a retail analyst at IPO Value Monitor, an investment newsletter. He likes the Loehmann's story too, so much that he gave the 75-year-old chain a "hot" rating on his firm's scale for new offerings. 
 But a long subway ride from Wall Street, in the still-communal dressing room of Loehmann's flagship store in the Bronx, Marietta Tanner was unimpressed. "I wouldn't buy the stock," said Ms. Tanner, a retired school administrator and longtime Loehmann's shopper, as she tried on a polka-dot summer dress and white linen blazer last week. "Loehmann's is not what it used to be, and I won't buy into apparel. I buy technology and pharmaceuticals."
Ms. Tanner may be in the minority, but she may not be wrong.
True, after three years in the doghouse, retail is rebounding on Wall Street. Indeed, with its offering, which was underwritten by Montgomery Securities, Loehmann's was cashing in on the upbeat attitude about the sector that will soon bring initial offerings from Saks Fifth Avenue, Donna Karan and the licensee for Calvin Klein products.
And the company, which has a market capitalization of $227 million, has grand plans. Its gross margins are up, from 26.4 percent to 31.1 percent over the last three years. And after closing 11 small, underperforming stores last year, Loehmann's intends to open 7 stores this year and 7 to 10 more in each of the next two years. The plans also call for larger and higher-margin outlets, some in downtown centers, including a 60,000-square-foot flagship store in space formerly occupied by a Barney's store on 16th Street in Manhattan.
Mr. Tuen, among other analysts, says that Loehmann's management is seasoned enough to carry out these aggressive moves toward big new stores and to succeed in its efforts to contain costs and to focus on higher-margin products, like shoes and accessories.
Bullish analysts also see value in the brand name and folklore of the store, where savvy shoppers have long tussled in the dressing room for one-of-a-kind bargains. Frieda Loehmann, who dangled cigarettes from her lips and stashed her cash in her black-silk stockings and calf-length boots, founded the chain in Brooklyn in 1921. She bought designer samples and sold them without labels and followed a strict no-returns, no-exchange policy.
But big plans and a colorful past may not make up for Loehmann's weaknesses. Size is one. With just 71 outlets and $392 million in annual sales, Loehmann's commands less than 4 percent of the very competitive off-price apparel market. Red ink is another. For the last five years, the company has lost money. Then there is debt. On Tuesday, besides going public, Loehmann's sold $100 million in 11.875 percent junk bonds. The notes will replace higher-priced debt and will reduce the company's interest payments, but they saddle the company with a debt burden at a still-high rate of interest.
The store -- which went public in 1964, private in 1981 and changed hands four times in the last eight years -- may also find its customer base squeezed. Its value-conscious buyers are being courted both by upscale department stores, which are offering more bargains, and by Sears and other mass merchandisers, which are selling more high-priced clothes. And all those rivals offer something that Loehmann's cannot: the convenience of one-stop shopping for the whole household.
Mannish Shah, editor and publisher of IPO Maven, a research service in New York, says Loehmann's has lost its niche already by reducing sales of designer and "bridge" merchandise -- the apparel category just below designer -- to just a third of its overall business. He also plays down customer loyalty, noting that today's price-conscious buyers seek bargains everywhere -- in outlet malls, department store clearances, catalogues and elsewhere.
Management has also made Loehmann's less like Loehmann's by jettisoning the no-return and no-credit-card policy that made the store famous and kept its costs down.
Indeed, if bullish analysts like Mr. Tuen -- who hasn't been to a Loehmann's recently -- had checked out Ms. Tanner and her fellow shoppers last week, they might have been surprised. Although the women said they would shop there again in hopes of finding a good deal, they complained that quality had declined and reminisced about the days when Loehmann's offered better value, more tailored styling and alterations.
But even if Loehmann's wants to keep its niche, it faces a big problem: its traditional business is ill-suited to growth. That's a major reason that the managers are reducing the designer-label presence in the company's stores; the decrease can help them achieve the expansion they want.
In any event, profits do not come easily in Loehmann's chosen field. "The retail business today requires extreme focus on the bottom line, fiscal and inventory control and innovative management," said Mr. Shah. "If you don't have all that, basically you're just an average player." He rates Loehmann's as five, or worst, on his one-to-five scale for initial offerings.
Of course, Loehmann's fate hinges in good part on the outlook for the retail and apparel sector and for the off-price business itself, a segment estimated at about 1,800 stores and $10 billion to $14 billion in annual sales. But while these businesses have rebounded so far this year, with the help of a strong economy and pent-up demand, there is a big question for investors about how long the revival will last. And that uncertainty is over and above their specific doubts about Loehmann's as a player in this tough sector.
The late Erma Bombeck, who captured the spirit of the habitual shopper in a 1995 book, "Everything I Know About Animal Behavior, I Learned at Loehmann's Dressing Room," probably knew about the store's back room. That's the place where the canniest shoppers find the very best deals. But if Wall Street has such a room, there seem to be many reasons why the company's stock won't be found there.

HEADLINE: Not Making It;
We're Leaner, Meaner and Going Nowhere Faster

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
FOR years, Americans have been told to place their hopes for a better standard of living in the huge investments in automation and computers and in the tens of millions of layoffs intended to make the nation more efficient and productive. And now there is a growing acknowledgment among economists and others that this strategy has not worked.
What this means, if that conclusion in fact solidifies as a broad consensus, is that many of the layoffs might have been in vain. After nearly 25 years of only minor increases in what economists call productivity, the great hope of an economy vigorous enough to raise just about everyone's income level is still just a hope. 
 Without rising productivity, an economy cannot really boom. Productivity is the amount, valued in dollars, that a worker produces in a given hour, using computers, or complicated machinery, or a telephone, or a hammer and wrench, or simply one's head and hands, working alone or in teams or on an assembly line. From the late 19th century until the early 1970's, productivity rose smartly most of the time, helped along by technological innovations. That made possible annual raises that, in effect, allowed millions of Americans to pocket ever-growing shares of their own rising output.
But since the early '70's, the improvements have been small: 1 percent annually compared with nearly 2 percent or more in many earlier years. As a result, incomes for most people have stagnated. Achieving a breakthrough in productivity has become a national obsession. How-to books proliferate on the subject. Chief executives proclaim that at their own companies productivity is rising, and that is often true. But the nation as a whole has not made the leap, although both Bob Dole and Bill Clinton promise that their policies will do the trick.
"The hype about productivity has been much greater than the performance," said Robert M. Solow, a Nobel laureate in economics, reflecting a view widely held in his profession. "Maybe we have gotten so good at hype that the information revolution seems bigger to us than the electric motor seemed when it was invented. But the electric motor had a big impact on how many shirts you could sew in a day."
 
 
 
Industrial Winners
 Many individual companies, of course, have become more productive. The formula of cutting staff and investing heavily in computerized equipment has paid off particularly in manufacturing, which enjoys a much greater productivity growth rate -- more than 3 percent a year on average in the 1990's -- than business as a whole. General Electric is a winner. So is the Chrysler Corporation. But what has happened at Chrysler sheds light on why innovative technology and downsizing, now or in the past, is probably not enough to make productivity rise for the entire nation.
Chrysler last year made 1.72 million cars in the United States, the same as in 1988, but with 9,000 fewer workers. The departure of those workers meant that the remaining 93,700 produced more cars per hour than in 1988. The rub is in what happened to the departed workers. Many apparently shifted to less productive jobs -- in restaurants, perhaps, or offices or small companies now doing tasks as subcontractors that Chrysler no longer wants to bother with. Preparing the payroll is an example.
 
 
 
Cancel the New Car
 These new, less productive jobs drag down the nation's productivity rate as a whole. And the workers draw lower wages, which makes them less likely to buy new Chrysler cars. Chrysler, for that reason, will be less likely to increase production. But if it could somehow sell 300,000 more cars, it might rehire the laid-off workers to staff a new factory or two.
That would put pressure on, say, restaurants that had been employing some of them. Rather than pay more to get enough workers, the restaurants might automate so that they, too, could function with smaller staffs. A modern-day version might emerge of Horn & Hardart, where customers inserted coins and small glass doors popped open, allowing the customers to withdraw hot baked beans or pie or a meat dish.
That was a form of automation dreamed up earlier in the century when rising wages for restaurant workers encouraged early fast-food restaurants to rely on labor-saving devices. Horn & Hardart needed only a handful of people to resupply the cubbyholes behind the glass doors, not the hordes at fast-food counters today.
But that raises a question. Was rising demand in this rapidly expanding nation the mother of innovations like the nationwide railroad system, the electric motor, the internal combustion engine, jet engines or plastics -- innovations needed to help production keep pace with what people wanted to buy? Or does innovation come first, creating in supply-side fashion a demand for the things that some new invention like the computer can make possible?
Economists say they don't really know, although Alan Blinder of Princeton University notes that America's greatest period of productivity growth, from the mid-1940's through the 1960's, came after two decades in which consumer demand had been deferred, first by the Depression and then World War II. Invention, however, didn't slow during those years, Mr. Blinder says, and when demand was unleashed, the technology was there to help meet it.
What is certain is that productivity improvements have been minuscule for nearly 25 years, the longest such plateau since 1870. Many explanations are surfacing, with mass layoffs rising toward the top of the list, the explanation being that they destroy loyalty, job stability and continuity, increasingly recognized as ingredients of productivity. The American Management Association, in its surveys, finds that a majority of companies that cut staff have failed to increase productivity a year or two later.
Others, like Stephen D. Oliner, a Federal Reserve economist, note that despite the national love affair with computers, they represent only 2 percent of the net investment by business, and an even smaller percentage of all the machinery, equipment and buildings business owns. That is too small a percentage to make a difference in productivity. By comparison, early in the century railroads represented 18 percent of the capital stock.
Global competition and imports play a role, of course, in suppressing production by a company like Chrysler. More broadly, argues Jeffrey Madrick, an economics writer, in the recent book "The End of Affluence," America's great skill at mass production gave it an edge over other industrial nations, an edge now lost in an era of smaller production runs and open markets.
Such talk raises the possibility that the era of rapidly rising productivity may be over, not only here but in other major industrial nations. Mr. Dole and Mr. Clinton reject that proposition, insisting instead that their particular prescriptions will restore the patient; Mr. Dole urges lower taxes and less regulation, Mr. Clinton training, education and public investment.
Most economists are similarly unwilling to throw in the towel. Some argue that demand would rise, and with it productivity, if only the Federal Reserve would lower interest rates to stimulate the economy. Others call for more public investment. And Paul David, a Stanford economist, believes that in time, computers will be as much a source of rising productivity as the electric motor in its day, and patience is in order until computers begin to pay off.
After all, Mr. David notes, a quarter century elapsed before the electric motor transformed the workplace. Perhaps something like that will be the case for computers. And perhaps not.

HEADLINE: The World;
When the Gun Play Kills the Kids' Play

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia

 BODY:
WHENEVER the gun battles for control of the downtown streets of this capital grow particularly fierce, the leaders of Liberia's warring militias, like commanders anywhere, decide that the fighting is just too intense to risk the lives of their most experienced men.
The leaders do not pull back and regroup, however. Instead, the battle for Monrovia, which has raged on and off for weeks now, becomes a bloody all-kid affair, as do similar battles in a growing number of conflicts around the world. Indeed, in certain places children are becoming as prominent in war as their parents. 
 In one of many such firefights last month, the adults took cover in the ruins of buildings or behind wrecked vehicles, sniping with their automatic rifles at anything that moved.
Meanwhile, boys, some no older than seven or eight, were sent out to dash through the streets, making obscene gestures and dancing, with the express purpose of drawing enemy fire.
Some of these children wielded AK-47's and rocket-propelled grenades with all of the fearsome skill of their elders. Others, seemingly content to merely play the decoy, ran about through the hail of bullets with putty guns and other harmless props, eager to prove their mettle and perhaps win a chance to belong.
Organizations like Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International say that no one knows when the practice of employing child combatants first emerged. Throughout history, they say, children have been used in wars in roles as varied as pack mules, water-boys and industrial laborers. The boy drummers of the American Revolution come immediately to mind.
 
 Liberia Stands Out
Today, international human rights organizations are monitoring reports of the use of child combatants in countries as far flung as Burma, Sudan, Guatemala, Cambodia and Peru. "There are about 30 countries in which kids either are child soldiers now or have been in recent years," said Lois Whitman, director of the children's rights project at Human Rights Watch. "It has become a phenomenon mostly of civil conflicts, and typically it is the rebel forces who employ child soldiers."
But Liberia stands out even in this company, the human rights groups say, in the predominant role child fighters play in many battles.
In the relative calm that prevails at the end of each day of fighting here, the streets serve up evidence of the toll of this ghastly child abuse. Corpses, small and often frail, pile up only to be picked at by carrion birds and eventually burned by residents to rid the air of the stench.
The country's warlords, starting with Charles Taylor, who ignited the conflict here with an invasion in 1989, have used every imaginable tactic to obtain child fighters, from kidnapping children to feeding them drugs in order to still their fear and trap them in addiction. But it is also true that as for boys everywhere, guns and gunplay exercise a powerful attraction.
Near the Johnson Street Bridge in downtown Monrovia the other day, a boy soldier from Mr. Taylor's National Patriotic Front, a kid not yet five feet tall who had been seen throwing himself fearlessly into battle all week, sobbed uncontrollably as an older boy disciplined him. The punishment was to have his rifle taken away.
Watching this scene in the nihilistic environment of Liberia, where those who pack the most firepower and grab the most booty are considered leaders, it was easy to imagine that for a rootless youth, no sanction short of death could be worse.
In this topsy-turvy society, the seductive power of the gun shows up in other ways too. Near Mr. Taylor's residence in the Congotown suburb of Monrovia, a journalist struck up a conversation with a bony 14-year-old who sat shyly on a wall watching with seeming envy as fighter friends chatted up teen-age girls passing by.
After a few moments, when extracting words from this withdrawn youth seemed like it was more trouble than it was worth, a terrifying transformation came over him as he called his friends and said "watch me interrogate this foreigner."
For the next five minutes or so, occasionally leveling his gun for emphasis, the kid who had been too shy to talk much was both boastful and commanding as, with a smile playing on his face, he demanded of me: "What is your business?"
At moments like these, the powerful sense of authority and belonging that the war provides these children, many of them orphaned by the conflict, is readily apparent. But from time to time, a young fighter lets his guard down enough to let the steep costs of his mercenary life shine through too.
One such fighter, Lawrence Moore, had spent almost all of his teen-age years with the National Patriotic Front before fleeing Liberia for neighboring Ivory Coast last fall. Lawrence's story, which resembles countless others, make it painfully obvious that getting out of a militia is infinitely more difficult than getting into one.
After being discovered talking with me, a foreign journalist, in the streets of Monrovia last fall, Lawrence, now 20, was abducted by fellow N.P.F.L. fighters and taken to a bush prison near Mr. Taylor's longtime headquarters in the north-central town of Gbarnga. There, he was beaten daily during interrogations and told that he would be killed.
 
 
 
An Escape
 Lawrence managed to escape with the help of a sympathetic N.P.F.L. commander who smuggled him to the Ivory Coast border town of Danane in the trunk of his personal car.
From there, Lawrence called me to say he had made his way to safety. But he had another message as well: "You've got to help me find my mother in the States," he said, choking back tears as he spoke on the telephone in his broken English of a long-lost mother who is herself a refugee in New Jersey. "If I ever go back to Liberia, those people will certainly kill me."
A few weeks later, Lawrence and his sympathetic commander, also 20 years old, made their first visit to Abidjan, the rich economic capital of Ivory Coast for their first glimpse at a modern city.
"Now I know why there is no war here," the wide-eyed commander said over his first restaurant meal. "The people have built so much they are afraid to destroy it."
Still bearing the welts from his torture, and complaining of some untreated genital infection, Lawrence spoke only of the isolation of being cut off from the camaraderie of the militia and of being no closer to his real family.
Lawrence called again early last month from Danane when fighting broke out anew in Liberia. On the telephone, he cried again as he recounted N.P.F.L. attempts to kidnap him, perhaps to bring him back into the fold and perhaps to kill him.
"This war has taken away my life," he said pitifully. "I can't trust anyone. I have no home, and it seems I have no future either."

HEADLINE: The State of Welfare in Italy;
Where Every Day is Mother's Day

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ROME

 BODY:
OVER the last five years, a high school teacher here, 38 years old, has been on the job for only a year and a half, but has drawn a salary for all but a few months. Why? The answer to this riddle, laughably simple for any Italian employer, is: The woman is a mother with two babies who has taken full advantage of every last clause in one of Europe's most generous maternity leave packages.
"In both cases, I suppose I should have returned to work earlier than I did," said Carla Starita, a teacher of literature and philosophy and mother of Gaia, 4, and Elisa, 1, "but I think it isn't right to leave one's children after a few months. Many of my colleagues went back to work early and their children didn't die, but this was my time to have children, and I believe during those occasions, it is right to use all the opportunities that are offered to you." 
 Having babies is a serious business everywhere. But in Italy, working women are given the time to treat it almost like a job. Long paid leaves, combined with free medical care, are considered part of an Italian mother's birthright -- one element of the safety net that middle-class taxpayers across Europe have both enjoyed and supported with very steep taxes for many decades now, in contrast to their middle-class counterparts in America, who by and large see social spending as money only for the poor.
Now, however, as European governments feel the need to make their economies more efficient, as they try to unify their currencies and draw ever closer economically, Germany, France, Spain and Italy are finding that they must trim some of this web of social benefits. Just last month, France announced cuts in its health-care programs and Germany put forward a plan for cuts that could reduce its budget deficit by $33 billion.
For Americans, the details of Italy's maternity policies offer a good example of the style of benefits Europeans have grown so attached to -- worth a look not because they are in jeopardy, but because they are so sacred.
In France, maternity benefits have come under the gun. But in Italy, a country that feels particularly protective about motherhood, especially now in a period of declining birth rates, it is a different matter. In Italy, challenging maternity benefits is still regarded as political death -- even though the Italian state bears more of a direct burden than most other countries do.
According to a law adopted in 1971 and amended many times since, pregnant women here are obligated to take off the last two months of pregnancy and the first three months following the birth -- for a total of five months during which they receive full salary, 80 percent of it paid by the state.
And that bundle -- which is about par for the course in continental Europe -- is not all. Where Italy breaks ahead of the pack is with its options: Once the baby is three months old, a working mother (father too, in certain cases) can choose to stay out for another six months at 30 percent salary, courtesy of the state.
Altogether, mothers can stay off the job for a year after their child's birth, with only the last three months without salary. Last year, the Italian state paid 1.425 trillion lire -- $900 million -- in maternity leaves.
There are also benefits that are not written in legislation, but simply sanctioned by tradition. For instance, women with risky pregnancies are entitled, with the appropriate doctor's certificate, to take all nine months of pregnancy off. Likewise, mothers suffering from depression, or mothers whose babies require special care can get other doctors' certificates, entitling them to stay away from work for up to three years. (In these cases, salaries are not automatically guaranteed.)
With loopholes like these, it follows that they are exploited, particularly by women working in the Italian state bureaucracy, where employee rights are as sacred as motherhood itself. Dr. Cristina Damiani, a gynecologist/obstetrician in Rome, notes that at least half of her patients have claimed so-called risky pregnancies right from the first trimester. "Many women take advantage of this extended leave," she said, "and doctors find it difficult to deny it to them, because they could spontaneously abort tomorrow and then it's nothing but trouble."
Extensive leaves have also become trouble for women themselves, though. Smaller companies have been known to make young women sign blank resignation forms upon hiring. One journalist noticed that a bank in her home town recently refused to accept women candidates for a job opening, and Italian trade union representatives say they have seen an increase in part-time, contractual work that effectively puts young employees in their child-bearing years at greater risk.
But attempts to amend, even criticize, Italy's maternity laws are politically dangerous, as the newspaper Il Giornale, the journalistic mouthpiece of the Italian right, found out when it dared criticize the system. "In the end, so much coddling can turn against the same women who now lament both the negative effects that a long maternity leave can have on their career as well as the diffidence with which all those who wear a skirt are seen," the paper said in an editorial.
Il Giornale's offensive against the maternity leave system was taken as just that by a wide swath of society, from die-hard Communists on the left, to Alexandra Mussolini, a legislator who is also the granddaughter of the dictator, on the far right.
"Do we want to throw the social state away," asked Ms. Mussolini, a member of the National Alliance, and a new mother herself. "It's true, social consciousness has some costs. But it is unthinkable that the cuts must begin with maternity benefits."
Like virtually all European countries, Italy has free medical care -- which in the case of pregnant women and new mothers, covers everything from ultrasound screening to breast pumping machines. The drawback of the public health care system for some mothers is that it doesn't allow a choice -- of either gynecologist, obstetrician, hospital or pediatrician -- which is why many who can afford to do so have their babies in private clinics, at extremely high costs.
But given the range of free benefits, the marvel is that more Italian women aren't having more babies. In fact, the reverse is true. Italy's birth rate has been in decline for several years and many women note that while the Italian state is diligent about encouraging working women to have babies, it is inadequate in helping mothers take care of them and work at the same time.
"This is really an historic problem," said Franca Fossati, a former editor of the women's magazine Noi Donne, and a consultant to a government Equal Opportunity Commission. "Italy is primarily a Catholic country -- a Catholic and a Communist community, where the policy on maternity has been protectionist. As a result, there is a strong policy on maternity leave, but other things don't follow."
For instance, public day care or nursery schools for children up to 3 years old are rare and access is limited only to the most needy -- except in some regions, like Emilia Romagna, where local government has been under the control of the Communists or their successors for decades. By the time a child is 3, the public education system kicks in: An estimated 90 percent of children between 3 and 6 are in "scuola materna," the state-supported kindergartens.
According to Patrizia Ghedini, the Italian representative on the European Union Commission Network on Infancy, only 5 to 6 percent of Italian children under 3 years old are in nursery schools, compared to the 20 percent who attend "creches" in France.
"It is an indication that there continues to be a perception of women as being the caretakers of young children," said Ms. Ghedini. "Even with the greater number of women entering the work force, there is no parallel development of child care structure because the society at large still thinks that women should take on the burden of raising children themselves."

National policies for maternal leave vary widely in length and salary provisions
 
ITALY -- 22 weeks*
Mothers are entitled to take off two months before and three months after childbirth. In the case of risky pregnancies, they can take off the entire period of pregnancy. During maternity leave, women usually receive full salaries: 80% paid by social security and 20% paid by employers.
 
BRITAIN -- 18 weeks
Women are entitled to 14 weeks, which can begin any time between the 11th week before the expected week of childbirth and the week the baby is due. During maternity leave, women are entitled to all normal terms of employment except for salary. Most working women are entitled to weekly benefits from their employers of up to 90% of their average earnings for 6 weeks and 54.55, or $83, for 8 weeks. For most other women, social security provides weekly payments of up to 54.55 for 18 weeks.
 
FRANCE -- 16 weeks
Mothers get 6 weeks before childbirth and 10 weeks after birth for their first and second children. After that, they get 8 weeks before and 18 weeks after delivery. They may take another six weeks in the event of health complications.
During maternity leave, womenothers receive full pay: 95% is paid by social security and 5% is by employers in most cases.
 
 GERMANY -- 14 weeks
Women get 6 weeks before and 8 weeks after childbirth for a first child. After that, they get a total of 12 weeks. During maternity leave, women receive full pay: unemployment insurance pays 25 marks a day, or $16.50, for 30 days and the employer pays the rest.
 
UNITED STATES -- 12 weeks
Under the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, which covers workers at companies with 50 or more employees, new mothers -- and new fathers, too -- are entitled to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new baby, biological or adopted. But perhaps more than in most other countries, actual maternity benefits vary widely. At most large companies, women get paid maternity leave of six to eight weeks, and most women take a total of 10 to 12 weeks away from their jobs.
The maternity benefits, though, arise not from any national family policy, but rather as part of disability insurance programs designed to replace a portion of the lost from temporary disabilities.The Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 requires employers to treat maternity-related disability the same as any other temporary disability.
 
*May vary slightly because policy is stated as five months instead of in weeks. (pg. 5)

HEADLINE: Split Between Aristide and His Successor Imperils Haiti's Governing Party

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
For years, they were so close that people here routinely referred to them as twin brothers. But now that Rene Preval has succeeded Jean-Bertrand Aristide as President, a sudden eruption of sibling rivalry appears to be eroding their relationship and threatening the unity of their party.
Three months after Mr. Preval was sworn in, the Lavalas movement, under whose banner both men were elected, is splintering, with the dominant group supporting Mr. Preval but others sticking by Mr. Aristide. Allies of the new President accuse Mr. Aristide of seeking to maintain control of "the Lavalas family" as a base to mount a campaign to return to office four years from now. 
 At stake in the struggle is control and direction of the movement. Though critics of the coalition have portrayed Lavalas as a seamless entity that would lead to a one-party dictatorship, supporters of Mr. Aristide and Mr. Preval are now offering two very different and competing visions of the future of Lavalas.
In interviews here, backers of Mr. Preval say Mr. Aristide has been quietly leading efforts to prevent the privatization of nine state companies, a divisive issue here. In office, Mr. Aristide initially pledged, but then failed, to carry out that program, the successful completion of which is still demanded by the United States and other aid donors as a condition for economic help.
"Aristide doesn't want to support Preval on this, both for personal reasons and to prepare for his own return in 2000," said a former Cabinet minister, speaking on the condition of anonymity. "He's not ready to accept this because of his followers, even though he knows the Government has to go through with it."
Mr. Aristide remains highly popular and is Haiti's dominant political personality, drawing wide support among the country's many peasants, urban poor and left-wing figures. Yvon Neptune, Mr. Aristide's press secretary, did not respond to phone calls requesting comment about the former President's activities and his relations with Mr. Preval and Lavalas.
The focus of much tension is the Aristide Foundation for Democracy, a nonprofit group recently set up by the former President and registered in the United States. In late March, the group sponsored a widely publicized forum here on privatization in which one speaker after another attacked the proposed sale of Haiti's state-owned companies in harsh terms.
Mr. Aristide did not attend the conference, but the meeting was held at the foundation's sleek new auditorium, opposite the former President's residence.
[On May 10, Mr. Aristide broke a three-month public silence and criticized the privatization plan, saying such a move "has never improved the lot of citizens of any country."]
Ira Kurzban, an American lawyer who represents the Haitian Government and is on the board of the foundation, said the purpose of the foundation was to offer "a place where those people who are voiceless can express their views on democracy."
But foreign diplomats and several Lavalas officials who are sympathetic to Mr. Preval said they regarded the foundation as a potential rival to government patronage and food programs that is also intended to allow Mr. Aristide to raise a campaign chest.
A further sign of the increasing frictions is the abundance of graffiti critical of the new Government that have begun appearing on the walls of the capital.
The conflict appears to have engendered an anti-Aristide backlash in the Haitian Parliament, where Lavalas legislators sympathetic to both men hold the majority of seats in both houses. The Senate, for instance, recently eviscerated a bill that would have provided, at the state's expense, a permanent security, public relations and personal staff to the former President.
In addition, some legislators are demanding that Mr. Aristide submit a statement of his personal wealth. Haitian law, often ignored in the past, requires Presidents to list all of their holdings upon entering office and again when they leave, and Mr. Aristide has yet to comply with the second part, several Lavalas lawmakers said.
The Preval Government has subtly raised doubts about a $20 million loan that two of Mr. Aristide's closest economic advisers obtained on g a trip to Taiwan late last year. The money was expected to be used for road repair and improvement, but construction has lagged, and the Transport Ministry announced in April that only $7 million was available.
Mr. Aristide and former members of his Cabinet have not publicly offered to explain the discrepancy.
One business leader who is on good terms with both factions said nervousness at the split was growing, and predicted that things would get worse before they get better.
"Aristide has been at center stage for the past five years, and it's hard for him to step aside," he said. "But now things are getting to a level of roughness which is unnecessary and detrimental to Haiti's future."

HEADLINE: The Annual China Brawl

 BODY:
Every year about this time, a donnybrook erupts in Washington over America's relations with China. The fight was shaping up as particularly intense this election year, but thanks to an unexpected congruence of views between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, this year's action may help produce a sensible China policy.
The immediate subject of debate is whether normal trade privileges should be extended to China for another year. But the broader issue is how Washington ought to manage the full range of relations with Beijing. China, already the world's most populous nation, is rapidly developing into a commercial and military power. Washington urgently needs a more coherent and consistent policy to encourage responsible behavior by China and to check reckless conduct like the recent Chinese effort to intimidate Taiwan. 
 President Clinton and Senator Dole seem to agree that the denial of normal trade privileges is not the way to influence Chinese behavior on a host of diplomatic, arms control, human rights and commercial issues. They are right. Though many Republicans and Democrats in Congress believe a wholesale spike in tariffs would moderate China's conduct, a more nuanced and productive approach now seems workable. It would match specific Chinese misconduct with strong, targeted sanctions.
The Clinton Administration has been moving in this direction after a long period of accepting in near silence China's misdeeds and violations of international agreements. The trade representative's office is now preparing a list of $3 billion in tariff penalties that will be imposed unless China honors its commitment to stop the piracy of computer software, music and movies.
Regrettably, the State Department on Friday sidestepped Beijing's sale of nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan. Instead of imposing penalties against the Chinese companies that made the sale, the Administration accepted assurances from the Chinese Government that it was unaware of the transaction and would more rigorously enforce restrictions on the export of nuclear technology.
Mr. Dole, while caustically dismissive of Mr. Clinton's handling of international affairs, outlined a China strategy of his own last week that was not a great deal different from the Administration's. Mr. Dole would renew normal trade relations, while penalizing Beijing for specific misconduct.
It is essential to find the right balance between advancing American economic interests and using trade sanctions to influence Chinese behavior.
Trade with China earns handsome profits for American companies and sustains jobs in better-paid export industries. But it also strengthens a regime that abuses the rights of its people, bullies its neighbors and undermines America's arms control policies by selling missile and nuclear weapons components to other states. While China's trade with the United States undoubtedly encourages its economic development and the growth of private industries, there is little evidence that trade is fostering political liberalization there.
Though America has the world's largest economy and provides most of China's hard-currency trading surplus, Washington's leverage is limited when it acts by itself. It should not have to do so.
Containing nuclear weapons, protecting intellectual property and defending human rights are international interests. America alone should not have to bear the costs. But when international action is not possible, Washington has no choice but to apply tough but selective American sanctions.

HEADLINE: A Hands-Off Agenda in Hartford

BYLINE: By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 11

 BODY:
Last year, his first in office, Gov. John G. Rowland left his mark on the Legislature, pushing through an income tax cut, an easier-to-enforce death penalty and the nation's shortest time limit on welfare benefits.
Mr. Rowland, a Republican, brought some bold proposals to this year's legislative session, but it ended much differently. When the General Assembly adjourned for the year early Thursday, Mr. Rowland had no major trophies to show. 
 Indeed, on a host of issues on which Mr. Rowland had once staked out strong positions, he appeared to retreat and simply avoid any conflict that might tar his popularity, which one prominent poll shows to be at a record high.
"He didn't do anything this session," said Representative David B. Pudlin, a Democrat of New Britain, adding sarcastically, "He's so high in the polls, why should he bother?"
Not surprisingly, Mr. Rowland disputed that assessment, noting that he had won deeper spending cuts this session and had worked to protect the $200 million income tax cut that was enacted last year and will take effect in 1997.
"We accomplished so much in the first session that there wasn't a lot left on our agenda," he said in an interview on Friday. "The first session is the important one."
Because Connecticut has a two-year budget, the second year of the budget cycle involves adjusting the spending plan, as opposed to drafting a new one. In those years, the regular session of the Legislature lasts only three months.
If Mr. Rowland had always planned to take a hands-off approach to this year's session, it was not apparent at the start of the year.
In January, he proposed almost a complete shift in the way the state protects children at risk of abuse, calling for measures to make it easier for the state to end parental rights and put the children up for adoption. A month later, in his speech opening the session, he talked about withholding welfare checks from parents whose children skip school and about the importance of revitalizing the state's ailing cities.
In February, Mr. Rowland also touted a plan to sell a share of the state lottery to private investors, a step no other state has taken and one he said was vital if the lottery were truly to act like a private business.
By this week, many of these initiatives had fallen by the wayside. The child protection legislation no longer included most of the provisions that would expand the state's power to dissolve a family. No bill was even introduced to withhold welfare checks from parents of truant children, as Mr. Rowland recently conceded that the state could not now run such a program successfully.
Mr. Rowland's urban agenda is still taking shape, though there was not much discussion of it in the Legislature. The main action so far has been to approve about $90 million in bond money for city projects, a small amount when divided among a number of cities and in the context of a $10 billion state budget.
In March, more than a month after Mr. Rowland told the Legislature he would be pursuing an urban agenda, Hartford's Mayor, Mike Peters, said, "I still don't know what it is."
The proposal to sell a stake in the lottery was rejected by a legislative committee in April, and a few weeks later, Mr. Rowland said without explanation that he was "very happy" the idea was dead and that he had no intention of reviving it.
All of these setbacks may well be irrelevant to Mr. Rowland's political standing. Mr. Pudlin, a Democratic leader in the House, noted that Connecticut's economy appeared to be improving and that if the trend continued, Mr. Rowland's popularity was likely to remain high.
In this session, several lawmakers said, the Governor needed only to avoid controversy, staying clear of issues that could generate opposition or reflect badly on him. So, they added, his low-key approach made some sense.
"His absence in this session is related to what happened in the last," said Senator William A. Aniskovich, a Republican of Branford. "He accomplished a lot in 1995, and politically speaking there wasn't much left for him to do."
With legislative elections coming in November, Mr. Rowland hopes to hold on to the Republican majority in the Senate, where Republicans outnumber Democrats 19 to 17. He also would like to pick up members in the House of Representatives, where Democrats control 91 of the 151 seats.
Already, Republicans have begun to sound campaign themes invoking the successes of last year: a welfare overhaul, tax cuts, anti-crime measures and shrinking government.
To be sure, Mr. Rowland did see some new legislation along these lines pass this year. The Legislature stopped requiring cities and towns to provide a costly heart and hypertension disability program for police officers and firefighters, starting with employees hired after July 1. Along with additional cuts in state spending, the Legislature enacted tax credits for manufacturers and insurance companies that Mr. Rowland touted as creating a more business-friendly environment.
But Representative Carl Schiessl, a Democrat of Windsor Locks, noted that most of the initiatives came from legislators of both parties. "The administration was virtually absent from negotiations on major issues," Mr. Schiessl said, with one exception: the Governor's rejection of a plan to use a special fund intended to cover end-of-the-year deficits to balance next year's budget.
When asked about what the Governor did this session, Mr. Schiessl said, "He went to Arizona," referring to a six-day vacation Mr. Rowland took in April as budget negotiations between Democratic and Republican lawmakers foundered.
Mr. Rowland brushed aside the criticism. "They weren't doing anything that week or many of the others," he said. "Nothing happened while I was away."

HEADLINE: Women's Rights Gaining Attention Within Islam

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
In Iran, Azar Nafisi, a professor of English, writes about the strong and clever women in Persian classical literature and the pallid female characters in contemporary Iranian fiction. In Bangladesh, Yasmeen Murshed, chairwoman of an Asia-Pacific network for women in politics, teaches women how to run for office and write legislation enhancing their rights. In Malaysia, Norani Othman, an anthropolgist, leads a movement to reinterpret Muslim law and strip it of centuries of accretions that discriminate against women.
Throughout the Islamic world, from North Africa and the Middle East to Southeast Asia, a diverse assortment of individuals and women's rights groups, different in cultures but sharing a powerful faith, are creating a momentum for change that few would have predicted only a few years ago. 
 While the status of women can vary widely from country to country in the Islamic world, advocates of Muslim women's rights share a core group of demands.
They want the right to education, both secular and religious, which is often denied to girls. They seek changes in economic practices to allow them to own and inherit property, enjoy the freedom to start businesses and share in decisions on the distribution of family income.
They also want reform in Muslim family laws that often leave them at the mercy of men who can divorce them without warning, take away their children, deny them the right to travel and bequeath them as chattel to the next male relative.
"It's actually a much stronger movement than people realize," said Roslyn Hees, a Canadian who is the World Bank's division chief for human resources operations in the Middle East and North Africa.
As part of a wider move toward more open societies in some Islamic countries, she said, "women's issues have started to take on a greater prominence."
This weekend in Washington, these issues are being discussed at an international conference on Muslim women, with speakers from more than 20 countries. The conference is being sponsored by the Sisterhood Is Global Institute, a private international organization in Bethesda, Md., that was founded in 1984 to promote women's rights.
Women in the Islamic world say they draw on universal concepts of human rights -- and often on Western educations -- while insisting that they are Muslims first and that this will always affect their thinking and methods. Many, including women who might consider themselves secularists, defend others who chose to veil themselves and adopt a conservative theology.
Ms. Murshed of Bangladesh, who was denied a Saudi visa to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca because she planned to travel alone and not with a man, says she and others want more than equality under secular law; they want a more active role in Islamic religious life.
"We have to claim our rights as Muslim women," she said. "We have to claim our Muslimhood. We cannot be set aside. We cannot be ignored. We cannot be outside that system or its religious observences."
Some see themselves as the best line of defense against Islamic fundamentalism. Others believe that they and the fundamentalists must become partners in building more democratic societies. Either way, these women do not have the luxury of ignoring Islamic militancy.
"One of the things the fundamentalist movement has done -- whether they wanted to do it or not -- was to bring these debates about women to the forefront," said Mahnaz Af khami, an Iranian who directs the Sisterhood Is Global Institute.
In some countries, like Algeria or Afghanistan, women who assert themselves may be in physical danger. In other countries, like Iran or Saudi Arabia, women may be quietly active though hidden. In an age of mass communications, few educated women are unaware of or unconnected to the movement, said Ms. Af khami, who was a minister for women's affairs in Iran before the Islamic revolution of 1979.
At the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year in Beijing, where women from around the world gathered and shared experiences, Ms. Afkhami met women from the official Iranian delegation. She said she had been surprised by their forthrightness.
"The Iranian women were under enormous constraint," she said. "They had all been picked by the Government, both the official delegates and N.G.O.'s," or non-governmental organizations. "They may have had to wear the chador, but they didn't have the conservative line at all, especially not on women. They were active and energetic and outgoing in participation. That kind of interaction is very important."
The movement for Islamic women's rights is being widely recognized as one of the most interesting phenomena to emerge from the Beijing conference. The Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for Democracy and the Council on Foreign Relations all support programs on this issue.
"The Beijing process and all the excitement that flowed from it encouraged us to give some attention to this subject first," said James Piscatori, a Middle East scholar who directs a new Muslim Politics Project at the Council on Foreign Relations. "We were immensely impressed by the number of very articulate women across the Muslim world who had important things to say."
While there are disagreements among leaders of women's movements about their approaches to fundamentalism, he said, "many if not most of the women are irritated at the patriarchal control of Islamic tradition -- that is to say that men control the texts."
Access to the education in the basic religious writings and laws of Islam is a major aim of the Muslim women's movement. They want to argue their case from within the Sharia, the Islamic legal code that governs their lives, not just from a secular perspective.
"At Beijing, for the first time, the right to religious higher education became a demand," said Boutheina Cheriet of the University of Algiers, who is now at the Brookings Institution in Washington writing a book on comparative fundamentalism. "That would then give us credibility in interpreting the texts."
Ms. Cheriet is among many leaders of Islamic women who believe that their place in Islamic life has eroded over the years and that women and men must re-examine the great writings to restore the balance.
"There is an intrinsic interest in women in the Islamic legacy," she said. "It started with the first Islamic discourses -- that is, the Koran, the Hadith and the Sunna -- the behavior of the Prophet himself. You cannot find any chapter in Islamic history that has not brought up the question of women in one way or another -- in literature, in politics, in pleasure, in art, what have you."
The Islamic women's movements face uncertain futures, many scholars agree. Governments battling fundamentalism may be ready to accept women as allies but may not be prepared to give them a greater role in public life should the threat subside.
Although Islamic women have largely avoided demonstrations and public protests, they could easily become targets of militant mobs if they ventured into places they are supposed to avoid, like behind the wheel of a car in Saudi Arabia or, lately, in a park for bicycling in Teheran.
"A problem is going to arise where women's rights are concerned as decision-makers in the family," said Ms. Cheriet. "This is why we are all dealing with how to interpret the Sharia, because the Sharia does make family law the main topic."
Ann Elizabeth Mayer, an associate professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, who has studied women living under Muslim law, says, "There is no question that there is a very rough road ahead" for the Islamic women's movement.
"I do believe they will meet obstacles," she said. "But at the same time, they have very clear perceptions of what their problems are. And they are actually more militant and better organized than American feminists seem to be these days.
"The United States is the only country in the Western world, except for a few Roman Catholic statelets, that has not ratified the United Nations convention on discrimination against women."

12 Games, 12 Victories, 1 Snub

BYLINE: By FRANK LITSKY 

 BODY:
It was a great day for lacrosse practice in Lewisburg, Pa., not too warm, not too sunny. For Bucknell's lacrosse team, the only problem was that the season was over.
Never mind that the Bisons, with a 12-0 record, were the only undefeated team among the 54 Division I colleges that play lacrosse. Never mind that no unbeaten team had ever been left out of the National Collegiate Athletic Association's championship tournament. 
 When this year's tournament started yesterday, Bucknell was not there, a victim of what the N.C.A.A.'s lacrosse selection committee called a weak schedule. But Bucknell's players say they are victims of a system.
"When you start playing lacrosse," Hugh Donovan, a senior from Ivoryton, Conn., said last week, "the highest thing you aspire to is playing in the N.C.A.A. tournament. You go through 6 A.M. practices in the winter, and then this happens. It's a travesty, a nightmare."
For Allan Donnelly of Warren, N.J., a senior and the team's leading scorer, the selectors made the wrong decisions.
"Instead of rewarding a team for having an excellent season," he said, "they're rewarding some teams for mediocrity. Besides, a good team like North Carolina has nothing to gain by playing us. If they beat us, they're supposed to. If they lose, it's horrible for them."
Andrew Trietley, a senior from Baltimore, analyzed the situation with the mind of an honor student in civil engineering, which he is.
"It's a question of politics and economics," he said. "In the first round, they matched Towson State and Loyola, two teams that maybe shouldn't have made it. But they're crosstown rivals in Baltimore, and the committee knows they'll draw a huge crowd and get a lot of press."
In addition to Towson State (8-4) and Loyola (7-5), the 12-team tournament includes Army (10-4), which finished second to Bucknell in the Patriot League and lost to Bucknell during the regular season. The selectors also picked such traditional powers as North Carolina (12-4), Virginia (10-3), Maryland (10-2) and Syracuse (9-3). They took Princeton (11-1), ranked No. 1 in the nation. And they took teams with lesser records, such as Johns Hopkins (6-5).
Bucknell contends that the tournament has become an old boys' network, with the same teams year after year, although one exception this year is Hofstra, which was picked for the second time in 18 seasons. The selectors contend that Bucknell is a big fish in a small pond, building its regular-season record against weaker teams.
Like the other Patriot League teams, Bucknell offers no athletic scholarships. In football, it plays in Division I-AA, one level below the national powers in I-A. In lacrosse, however, there is no Division I-AA, so Bucknell must contend with the powerhouses for a post-season bid.
But it's exactly those powerhouses that Bucknell, a central Pennsylvania school known for its engineering and business schools, does not want to play during the regular season. Sid Jamieson, who has coached Bucknell lacrosse since it started 29 years ago, said to do so would mean subjecting his players to unfavorable playing conditions.
"It's unfair for our athletes to compete against athletic-scholarship programs," he said. "I've been burned. About 15 years ago, we played a scholarship team, and they were leading, 27-5, with five minutes left. Then they called timeout to put one player back in so he could score another goal to attain some Division I honor. That moment I decided that the integrity of this institution was being compromised."
Jamieson later said that team was Syracuse. They have not met since.
"Do we have a weak schedule?" Jamieson said. "Do I have to call Army and Navy and Hobart and Villanova and tell them they're too weak to play us?"
The N.C.A.A. selection committee consists of four coaches and four administrators. The chairman is John Parry, the athletic director at Butler University in Indianapolis. He said the committee had spent 10 hours choosing its 12 teams.
"I won't say if Bucknell was the last team out," Parry said, "but they were right in the discussions to the end. We started with 19 schools in a core group, and Bucknell stood 19th in strength-of-schedule rating.
"The committee has been sending a message for several years that you've got to play a strong schedule to get into the tournament. If Bucknell was selected, it would have sent a message to other schools to intentionally play nonquality teams."
Jamieson was unmoved by the argument.
"This is supposed to be a sport of competition," he said, "a sport of let's line up and see who's the best. But it's become like a championship boxing match when the underdog fights better than the champion and should win. But the judges say, 'Well, that was a good performance, but not good enough. You won the fight, but not the decision.' "
Jamieson is 55 years old and a full-blooded Mohawk Indian.
"Perhaps because of my ethnic background," he said, "I may understand things about this game more than others do. What has been done here is a real personal injury. It's a dishonor to the game. They've disgraced it. That bothers me more than not being invited to the tournament."

HEADLINE: Perspective;
Sad Refrain of Schott's Rhythm and Blues

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
Imagine a big old drum left out in the rain, wood warping, skin cracking, its booming timbre reduced to nagging thuds. Every so often, someone who is bored or mischievous, someone who wants to raise a ruckus or get attention, wanders by, picks up a drumstick and pounds the drum. Nobody thinks it's music, but it always gets a laugh or a growl to shut up.
Imagine Marge Schott. 
 Every so often, someone pounds on her for a sound bite and she predictably obliges with a few thuds that will upset or offend someone who will then beat on her, if the original drummer hasn't begun the tattoo already.
Schott never seems to learn. Maybe she is just so lonely out there in the rain or mentally fogged or plain ornery that she needs to make some noise. We laugh, growl at her to shut up and generally feel smarter and better for not sounding off like her, no matter how we really feel. And you can be sure plenty of people really feel the way she sounds.
It's too much to ask this free society for a moratorium on Marge Schott sound bites or Marge Schott reactions (including this one), but it does seem worthwhile exploring other ways to deal with her need for noise. Whether or not Marge Schott is really a racist, an anti-Semite or the unclass clown may be irrelevant; her feelings are not as important as the effect of her expressing them.
Does she influence others by her words? Does she follow her views with economic or social actions? Does she hire Jews, treat them as she treats non-Jews? After she used a racial epithet to describe her ballplayers, did she raise or lower her payroll in any race-weighted way? When a grossly overweight umpire (and why was he allowed on the field?) dropped dead, causing officials to postpone the game, were her fans given rainchecks that she had to honor?
And what about the impact on her? She keeps dumping her toxic wastes and she keeps apologizing for it, which leads us grandstand shrinks to wonder if the old drum just has this need to be pounded. Is this her way of being sure she's still out here, is she keeping faith with a constituency of bigots or does she just like the media company her words summon?
Is her public dumping a cry for help, the owner's equivalent of testing positive for drugs?
It was, after all, way back in November 1992, that Schott first described her Nazi armband as "memorabilia" and declared that "Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far."
So why do we have to beat that drum again? And didn't she remember the reaction then?
I have not talked to Schott in perhaps 10 years, when I spent a few days with her in Cincinnati, for a television piece. I liked her blunt friendliness, and I was touched by her neediness. My plane was late, and by the time I reached the gray, gloomy Rhinish castle on 70 acres she lived in, the mood was tense; she was pacing her big, bare, unused kitchen, trailed by her dogs and my producer and crew. When she saw me, she cranked up her rant, and threatened to throw us all out. The compromise was that we would only get a half-hour for the interview.
Eight hours later, exhausted and out of video tape, we had to make excuses to leave. The night ahead was long and lonely, and she wanted us to stay. I had the feeling we could all have moved in for the season. I wondered if she drank too much or had mood swings.
The bones of her story are well known; she was raised a German-American princess, although her father would have preferred a boy -- he called her Butch. She was married in a merging of leading German-American families. She was disappointed -- and felt she had disappointed her father and her husband -- by not having children. Her many dogs took on added emotional importance. When her husband died young, she took over his car dealership after a protracted battle with the automobile manufacturer, which didn't want a female dealer. But she hung on, and made it a success. She became a local hero in 1984 for keeping the Reds in Cincinnati by buying the team.
Sports in general and baseball in particular have never been good at taking care of its neediest. Lawrence Taylor had a drug problem when he was the great L. T., but so long as he was knocking down quarterbacks and offering hot copy, no one wanted to tamper with his chemistry. Darryl and Doc were brought up too early by the Mets and then blamed for acting like adolescents.
It seems as though athletes get caught using and owners talking.
Schott has a problem. If she were running for President, like Pat Buchanan, we would excuse her -- she was bashing Jews, Japanese, African-Americans, you pick 'em, for tactical political reasons. But Schott, unless, of course, her demographers think that bigots are her best customers, seems to be replaying her worst hits for sick, personal reasons. We can't take it personally. And baseball needs to help her.
This poor old drum has been left out in the rain too long. Let's bring her inside and stop beating on her. If demeaning ethnic groups were an ownership crime, George Steinbrenner, who bombed the entire Bronx, would be out in left field forever.
Commissioner-in-fact Bud Selig needs to hop on a commuter airplane and talk to Schott, car dealer to car dealer, small-market owner to small-market owner, and persuade her to get some help, for the good of the game, if not her own.
She is a smart, tough, useful woman; maybe she needs to dry out, she certainly needs to dry up.
Before she gets drummed out of the game.

HEADLINE: Minimum-Pay Rise Could Have Vast Effects on the Northeast

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
If Congress approves the new minimum wage proposed by President Clinton, the increase to $5.15 an hour will have powerful effects on the New York region: a mixed bag of consequences reaching far beyond a simple 90-cent raise for workers.
While owners of supermarkets and fast-food restaurants, which hire many low-wage workers, assert that an increase would mean scaling back hiring, many economists say a higher minimum wage would have a generally positive economic effect on the region. It is expected that the exodus of manufacturing jobs to low-wage Sunbelt states would be slowed and that employers would fatten the paychecks of most low-wage workers, even those already earning between $5.15 and $6. That, the economists say, would give a boost to the region's shopping districts, especially in poor areas. 
 A higher minimum wage would also cause major ripples in the region's sprawling underground economy, a netherworld of illegal immigrants, seven-day work weeks and sweatshops in which employers pay less than the current $4.25-an-hour minimum. On the one hand, it could give unscrupulous employers incentive to hire illegal immigrants, but economists say it would also pull up their pay scale slightly.
At a time when many Americans are concerned about the growing gap between rich and poor, Democrats have pushed hard to raise the wage. So far, the Republicans have blocked a vote in the House and Senate, but two dozen Republican lawmakers, most from the Midwest and North, have now indicated they would support an increase, and Democrats have expressed confidence that an increase will pass.
Many economists say that because wages in the tristate area are higher than those nationwide, such an increase would bring wages in other states closer to New York's levels, making the region more competitive.
The region has been hit especially hard by the flight of jobs in industries like textiles and electrical machinery to the Sunbelt, where living costs are lower and low-wage jobs more common. For example, 19.9 percent of the workers in Louisiana earn less than the proposed $5.15 minimum, while the figure is 17 percent in Mississippi and 16.4 percent in Arkansas. That compares with 8.7 percent in New York, 6.1 percent in Connecticut, 5.2 percent in New Jersey and 11 percent nationwide.
A higher minimum would make it harder for the Sunbelt to woo jobs with rock-bottom wages. "New York will do better because the low-wage states of the South are no longer going to be as attractive," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
Political analysts say it is no coincidence that half the two dozen House Republicans who have broken ranks with their party to support a higher minimum come from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican, said that one reason he and so many other Republicans from the area are backing the increase is that it would help the region's competitiveness.
State officials estimate that 200,000 New Yorkers and 45,000 Connecticut residents work for $4.25 an hour. In New Jersey, only workers in the underground economy earn that amount because that state's minimum wage is $5.05.
Donald Scarry, an economic adviser to Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, said that when New Jersey raised its minimum in 1992, it made the state less competitive. He agreed that raising the Federal minimum would help New Jersey by bringing the wages in other states to its level.
"From that selfish and state-o-centric view, we would be better off," said Mr. Scarry.
Although advocates point to studies showing that past increases did not result in job loss, employers in the tristate area, as elsewhere, insist that a higher wage would mean hiring fewer low-wage workers.
"If the minimum is raised, a rational employer may eliminate positions after concluding it isn't worth paying $5.15 or $5.25 an hour to someone who has no skills or is poorly educated," said Mark Alesse, New York State director of the National Federation of Independent Business.
At White Castle Systems, which has 63 hamburger restaurants in the metropolitan area, executives said they would be forced to slow hiring.
"A higher minimum wage will eat into our bottom line," said Nicholas Zuk, White Castle's corporate counsel, "and when there are less profits to go around, that means less profits to expand, build new restaurants and create new jobs."
James Ladota, vice president of human resources for the Riese Organization, which runs several dozen Dunkin' Donuts, Roy Rogers and Pizza Hut restaurants in New York, predicted staff cuts at his company, saying, "If you raise the minimum wage by 90 cents or a dollar an hour, that's a lot of dollars if you have a store open 12 hours a day. We have to be careful about cutting service, so maybe we'll end up cutting out parts of shifts, instead of whole people."
Economists predict that some employers who pay the minimum wage will dive into the underground economy rather than fork over 90 cents more an hour. And since documented workers would demand $5.15, a higher minimum might encourage some companies to search all the more for undocumented workers.
"A higher minimum wage could exacerbate the difference between undocumented and native or documented poor people," said Robert Smith, a Barnard College specialist on the underground economy. "That makes the undocumented more desirable for unscrupulous employers. It makes them more manipulable and even more vulnerable."
But economists assert that it would encourage many workers who now receive subminimum pay to climb into the above-ground economy. That might cause employers who violate minimum-wage laws to raise their pay somewhat to keep workers from fleeing.
"A raise in the minimum wage should result in an increase in wages in the underground," said Jennifer Gordon, president of the Workplace Project, a group that seeks to expose wage-law violations. "With the minimum wage at $5.15, it will give underground workers a bargaining tool: maybe it will give them leverage to make, say, $4.50."
Y. Wang, a Chinese immigrant who earns $3.75 an hour stitching blouses in a Brooklyn sweatshop, said she doubted her boss would increase her pay to the new minimum.
"It should help," said Mrs. Wang, whose big worry is that she and her husband, both full-time workers, will not be able to afford to send their 19-year-old daughter to New York University. "The problem is, can the Government enforce the law to make sure we get the new minimum?"
The 90-cent increase would push annual pay for a full-time minimum-wage worker from $8,500 a year to $10,300 and, taken with the earned income tax credit, lift a breadwinner with a family of four above the $15,600 poverty line, officials say.
"You're giving these workers essentially a 20 percent pay increase," said Irwin Garfinkel, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work. "That's not a bad raise for anybody. It still leaves them in bad shape, although feeling a little better."
Yet for minimum-wage workers on welfare, benefits may fall. According to the Fiscal Policy Institute, a full-time sole breadwinner in New York who has two children would lose about $1,200 in welfare benefits, offsetting much of the $1,800 increase in income.
Everyone agrees it is harder to support a family in high-rent New York than in low-cost areas like Louisiana and Arkansas.
"Really, truly, $5.15 or $4.25, it's not enough; you're still underpaid," said Pandora Holt, who is struggling to support herself and her two daughters through a $4.25-an-hour clerical job with the New York City Human Resources Administration. "But don't get me wrong; I'd appreciate the extra 90 cents." Ms. Holt's take-home pay is $137 for a 35-hour workweek. She also receives $240 a month in food stamps as well as $159 in public assistance to help pay the $285 monthly rent for a bedroom in her sister's apartment in Harlem.
Domingo Ayala recently lost his $4.25-an-hour job at a Manhattan supermarket after he tried to organize a union. "The $6 or $7 more you'd get a day from a higher minimum is better than nothing," he said. "But let's face it, to survive with your family in this city you need at least $500 a week."
The minimum-wage workers in New York are as varied as the area's economy. There is Milagros Brea, a 47-year-old Dominican immigrant who is struggling to support herself and her disabled husband, a stroke victim, with her part-time job at the Wendy's near Lincoln Center. There is 33-year-old Aramis Moran, who earns $4.25 at a Bronx button factory and has difficulty making child support payments. And there is Jodie Signall, 20, a high-school dropout who works at a Dunkin' Donuts and acknowledges that unless she returns to school she is destined to a life of scraping by on minimum-wage jobs.
Minimum-wage workers show contempt for the argument that a higher minimum will hurt them.
"The talk that $5.15 an hour will hurt, hmmpphh," Ms. Holt said. "If there's a chance that $5.15 will cause me to lose my job, that's a chance I'm willing to take."

HEADLINE: Beef Prices for Ranchers Are at a 10-Year Low

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: SIMLA, Colo.

 BODY:
As the barbecue season unfolds across America, the low-priced steaks sizzling on backyard grills are the despair of producers at the opposite end of the food chain, the nation's ranchers.
"We cut costs down to the point where isn't anything left to cut," said Glenn Benjamin, whose broad-brimmed cowboy hat failed to conceal a furrowed brow. 
 While his younger brother, Lee, weighed yearling heifers and steers before hauling them to summer grazing land, the rancher listed the cost-cutting measures taken at his family's 7,700-acre ranch here: no summer hired help, no tagging of calves and no anti-fever shots for calves before they are shipped to feedlots this fall.
With prices paid to ranchers at a 10-year low, "prices are lower than costs of production for 95 percent of cow-calf producers," estimated Chuck Lambert, economist for the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a Denver-based group that represents 250,000 cattle ranchers.
Nationwide, beef sales are the largest revenue source for agriculture. Here, in the wide open spaces of America's cattle country, rock-bottom beef prices are rippling through local economies: ranchers are postponing bank payments and purchases of tractors, pickup trucks and fencing lumber.
"Bankers are starting to sweat," said Jim Taylor, a ranch real-estate broker in Billings, Mont.
In the Southwest -- Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas -- drought has compounded the effect of low prices. There, farmers are selling off their herds, keeping prices low through the summer and eroding the tax base of ranching counties.
"In some rural counties, livestock taxes account for half of the taxes," said Al Schneberger, executive director of the New Mexico Cattlegrowers Association, a private group. "Herd liquidations hurt schools, roads, libraries, ambulance services."
"I've been talking to people who remember the 1930's -- the Government coming out paying $8 a head, digging a hole and shooting the cow," said Mr. Schneberger, a rancher from Albuquerque. "I wonder if we are not so far away from that now."
Historically, beef prices have followed 10-year cycles of price dips and rises.
Overproduction, the past culprit for collapsing prices, is at work today. Beef production through the third week in April was 24 percent higher than during the same period in 1993, a recent peak price year, according to the beef association.
At the same time, Americans are grilling far fewer steaks than 20 years ago.
In 1976 annual per capita beef consumption peaked at 94.5 pounds. In the 1990's, it has stagnated at around 66 pounds. It is unclear whether Britain's mad cow disease will have any effect on the consumption of American beef.
Ranchers like to attribute today's plunging beef prices to floods of cattle from Mexico and Canada, price gouging by supermarkets and monopolistic prices by meatpacking companies.
But last year, imports accounted for just 2.2 percent of the 104 million cattle in the nation's herds. In the first quarter of this year, imports were 19 percent lower than in the same period of 1993.
Ranchers complain that while they face foreclosures, IBP Inc., the world's largest meatpacker, has nearly tripled its profits since 1993, reaching $256 million in 1995. Next month, a committee appointed by Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman is to report on the meatpacking industry, where IBP and three other companies hold 82 percent of the market.
But defenders of the meatpackers -- and they are few in barbed-wire country -- note that the big four slaughterhouse companies enjoyed the same market share in 1993, when prices were at a peak. A large part of the profits, those defenders add, stem from record beef production levels, which keep processing plants operating near capacity.
As for grocery stores, retail prices have gradually been bumped downward and are expected to stay low during the summer, the nation's peak beef-eating season.
In tribute to the barbecue culture, beef sales during Memorial Day weekend are 25 percent higher than daily averages for the rest of the year.
But low cattle prices are not the only cloud over the Benjamin ranch, an 80-year-old homestead in bare, mustard-colored plains 60 miles southeast of Denver.
"Feedcake went up 50 percent in six months, from $150 a ton in October to $220 a ton now," Ileta Benjamin, the ranch owner, said, as her two sons, Glenn and Lee, herded the balky yearlings into a weighing stall.
The nation's cattle business is the largest single user of grain, largely corn in the shape of cakes or pellets for winter feed. But last year's drought created a corn shortage, pushing corn prices up to a 20-year high this spring.
This year's corn crop is expected to bounce back to normal, swelling by 27 percent over last year's level, to 9.4 billion bushels, according to the Department of Agriculture.
To ease the squeeze in an election year, President Clinton announced measures on April 30 to allow ranchers this summer to graze cattle and to cut hay on land previously set aside under a Federal soil conservation program. With more grass available, ranchers will be able to reduce corn purchases.
As money from the ranch has dwindled, Lee Benjamin now gets most income from a job appraising farmland and a part-time job his wife has started in Denver.
"The only way for a person to get into ranching today is to inherit it or marry it," Lee Benjamin said glumly from the dusty cab of a battered pickup.
In a business affected by dozens of variables, economists see two bright spots that may speed ranching's recovery from its cyclical trough.
This year's corn crop is expected to be strong. And beef exports are expected to grow.
Once dismissed as negligible, United States beef exports increased sevenfold in value in 15 years. In 1995, they added up to $3.3 billion, about 11 percent of the wholesale value of domestic beef production.
Although sales to Mexico fell by half last year, strong sales to Russia and South Korea helped American beef exports post an overall increase of 18 percent.
Ileta Benjamin is hedging her bets about ranching's recovery.
Five years ago, four men worked full time running this ranch, which averages about 400 head of mixed-breed cattle.
Today, the same operation is run by Mrs. Benjamin and the ranch manager, Bob Blake. Her sons give occasional help.
"Two years ago, I told the hired men that they were taking the gravy off my income," the 67-year-old ranch owner recalled. "Today, I'm doing what the hired men used to do -- branding, fencing, opening the gates."

HEADLINE: Two Budgets, Many Distinctions

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 11

 BODY:
Viewed purely in dollars-and-cents terms, the six-year plans to balance the Federal budget unwrapped by President Clinton in March and by the Republican Congress on Wednesday have edged toward a compromise. The trouble with this is that a compromise has long been unlikely, and is getting more so as the Presidential campaign heats up.
The two budgets are political documents. And in political terms, the gap between them remains yawning: Republicans want to cut taxes, even at the expense of domestic programs, and Democrats want to spend on domestic programs, even at the expense of tax relief. 
 This has been true for decades, of course. But the differences have been submerged in these election-year budgets as each side tries to convince voters that it is relentlessly parsimonious and endlessly generous, all at the same time.
Both sides have experienced fiscal epiphanies since they began battling over the path to a balanced budget. A year ago, Mr. Clinton planned to run $200 billion-a-year deficits indefinitely. His latest budget would give voters a tax cut and still reach balance by the year 2002, even under the more severe yardsticks that the Congressional Budget Office uses to measure spending.
The Republicans caromed into budget-writing a year ago, pledging to cut taxes by $245 billion and slice more than a half trillion dollars from health-care and welfare spending. Their latest budget still reaches balance while the tax cut and the savings in benefit programs have been virtually halved, albeit in six years instead of seven.
But both budgets must be marked with asterisks, for their true differences are greater than they seem.
Tax cuts are the foremost example. As the Congressional Budget Office sees it -- Mr. Clinton's own figures are more generous -- the White House proposes to give families $97 billion in tax breaks for children, education and other causes from fiscal 1997 to 2002. The Republicans have scaled back their cuts to $122 billion, all devoted to a single $500-per-child credit for families making less than $110,000 a year.
Those figures are accurate, but not entirely true. The President cuts taxes less than he redistributes them; more than half the money comes from closing business loopholes, and much of the rest arguably comes from reimposing some excise taxes on the aviation industry and its passengers that expired last December. Even dismissing the aviation taxes, the actual reduction in the tax burden is only about $41 billion.
Nor are the Republican figures the entire story. The $122 billion allotted in the budget for tax cuts is a net figure, and House leaders have said they will eventually cut an additional $60 billion or so in taxes on investors, businesses and individuals, largely by closing loopholes.
That raises the total tax cut to $180 billion, or roughly twice Mr. Clinton's gross figure. The added tax breaks were not plugged into the budget that was made public on Wednesday, in part because there is as yet no clear way to pay them, and in part, no doubt, because the lower figure is a less attractive target for Democrats accusing Republicans of giving tax breaks to the rich.
Spending cuts are another matter. While the President's core budget reaches a balance in six years under the White House's economic assumptions, the Congressional Budget Office has said that Mr. Clinton will have to find another $81 bilion in savings or new money to reach a zero deficit, using its more conservative estimates.
So the President has set aside some budgetary plug-ins in case Congress's projections prove right. They include a sunset provision for the automatic termination of the final two years of his tax cut, worth $32 billion, as well as further cuts in domestic spending and selling off more of the broadcast spectrum.
Robert O. Reischauer, who ran the Congressional Budget Office under a Democratic Congress, calls the sunset provision "the amazing disappearing tax cut," reflecting his skepticism that politicians would ever allow such a thing to happen. He and others doubt that the White House can reap as much from selling pieces of the airwaves as it supposes. The White House says its estimates were actually lower than those of the Federal Communications Commission.
The White House is unapologetic. "From our economic assumptions, we don't believe we need to sunset," a senior White House official said on Friday, adding that Mr. Clinton is "firmly committed" to suspending the tax cuts anyway, in the final year of what would be his second term, should the need arise.
Democrats maintain that the Republican proposal to reduce projected Medicare spending, by $158 billion, is more onerous than the last Congressional offer in January because much more of the savings would come from that part of the program that pays hospital expenses for retirees than before. But Republicans say that is only because they had to sacrifice savings from the other half of Medicare, the insurance program that covers doctors' visits, when Mr. Clinton made a political issue of lowering the premiums earlier this year.
Democrats charge that the Republicans' proposal to cut domestic spending, by some $53 billion less than their last offer in January, masks the fact that the latest cuts are crammed into six years instead of the previous seven. Republicans argue that the Democratic cuts in domestic spending are largely pushed into the last two years of the budget plan, perhaps on the hope that they will never have to be made.
Indeed, most calculations estimate that about 65 percent of the Administration's domestic cuts would take place in the last two years, compared with about 59 percent of the cuts in Congress's plan. The White House reductions in welfare, Medicare and other benefit programs also are more "backloaded" than those of the Republicans, but only by a few percentage points.
None of this means that the budgets are dishonest. It does mean that they have been crafted in ways that make Democrats look more responsible than the big-spender image that Republicans like to pin on them, and that make Republicans look less aristocratic and contemptuous of the poor than Democrats like to imagine.
"That's the amazing thing about the Federal budget," said a ranking Congressional expert who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "You can make it do anything you want."
He was talking about the White House version. But whether it applies to Democrats, Republicans or neither rests on whose assumptions one chooses to believe.

HEADLINE: 5 Presidents Without (Much) Portfolio;
Doubts Are Raised About Largely Ceremonial Borough Chief Post

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Midway through a whirlwind day of conferences, civic appearances and meetings with community groups, Howard Golden, the Brooklyn Borough President, convened a gathering of residents to confront Giuliani administration officials about an unwelcome event.
The Mayor's office wanted to stage a half-marathon along Ocean Parkway through several Brooklyn neighborhoods. Seated among nearly a dozen residents, Mr. Golden told the Mayor's emissaries of their concern that the runners would disrupt traffic. After an hour of discussion, a mayoral aide said he was sorry about the potential for disturbance but made it clear that the race would go on despite Mr. Golden's remonstrances. 
 The meeting, in an ornate chamber in Brooklyn's Federal-style Borough Hall, underscored the powerlessness of the borough president, notwithstanding the commanding title. Just a few years ago, Mr. Golden could probably have kept the footrace out of his borough. Now, however, with all their trappings, the presidencies of the five boroughs have little effect on policy. The position is a shadow of its former self.
As a result, a growing number of present and former city officials are saying the position should be scaled back or abolished. Even the borough presidents' defenders say the office is most useful as a platform for people seeking higher office.
"They are important because the borough presidencies serve as a junior varsity for up-and-coming politicians," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University.
Six years after a new City Charter sapped the job of its most robust powers, it has evolved into a vague hybrid. The borough presidents still speak with strong voices, and mayors still sometimes seek their counsel. They help determine what capital projects will be built, though they have no direct role in making most of those decisions. They make important appointments to the Board of Education and the City Planning Commission.
They gain the greatest public attention in their role with the Board of Education. That was particularly evident last year in the search for a replacement for Schools Chancellor Ramon C. Cortines. During a turbulent series of votes for and against several candidates, borough presidents played high-stakes backroom politics. Several made frequent public pronouncements. "The Board of Education is an area where we have a great deal of impact," said Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx Borough President. "It's an area where borough presidents' weight can be felt."
During their heyday in the first half of the century, borough presidents operating through the now-disbanded Board of Estimate in large measure controlled how land, a city's most valuable commodity, was used. They had the power to promote or block development. They also exerted significant control over the city's budget. As a result, they built grand offices, assembled large, expensive staffs and, for nearly a century, were among the city's power brokers.
Now, the position is like the presidency of Germany or Israel. It has a lofty title and grand offices, but a mostly ceremonial role.
"It's certainly not the job it used to be," said Andrew J. Stein, who was Manhattan Borough President for eight years, until 1985. "Is it worth having now? I think you can make an argument that it's questionable whether these jobs are necessary. Now, it's more of a political platform."
The job serves as a staging ground for its occupants' political aspirations. Robert F. Wagner and David N. Dinkins rose from borough presidencies to Gracie Mansion. Two current Borough Presidents, Fernando Ferrer of the Bronx and Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan, are aggressively seeking to do the same. Perhaps because their aspirations are not in doubt, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has often pointedly criticized both Mr. Ferrer and Ms. Messinger. By contrast, he rarely if ever takes the other borough chiefs to task.
The city's five Borough Presidents each are paid $114,000 a year. Collectively, they employ 466 workers, and their offices have a combined budget of $32.5 million for the current fiscal year. In 1988, just before the new City Charter took away most of the offices' powers, the combined budget for the five chiefs was $28.5 million. Thus, although their duties have diminished, their budgets have risen.
In an age of budgetary shortfalls, when New Yorkers are being told that city government must do more with less, there is increasing discussion among other city politicians about whether the positions -- offices unique to New York City -- are necessary and worth the price.
"In theory," said Richard D. Emery, "the job of borough president surely should not exist." Mr. Emery, a lawyer, brought the suit that led to the end of the Board of Estimate. "But it's useful in a political sense. I don't know where the talent for mayor would surface without it. But that's really the only justification for the job's existence."
The Borough Presidents vigorously disagree. They say they help mediate economic-development and land-use issues, from what to do about Yankee Stadium in the Bronx to planning for Brooklyn's waterfront development to offsetting the decline in military jobs on Staten Island.
"Borough presidents are the ones who fight for the welfare of their respective boroughs," said Guy V. Molinari, who has been Staten Island's Borough President for the last six years. "Here in Staten Island, we have so many initiatives out of this office to try to improve things. It's a critical job."
Mr. Golden concurred. "It's a very important position," he said. "We're not only playing an advisory role with the budget, we're the spokesmen for the boroughs. If they did away with the job of borough president, there would be no one to fight for the borough as a whole. And we work hard to fight for our boroughs."
Mr. Golden, like his counterparts, keeps a fast-paced schedule. On one recent day, he shuttled between a meeting of community board leaders at one end of Borough Hall and a group of Brooklyn assembly members and college presidents at the other.
Later, his chauffeur drove him to Bushwick, where he swore in new officers at a center for the elderly, then to Bedford-Stuyvesant to a fund-raising event for a political ally. On other days, he sends out press releases, cuts ribbons, officiates at dedications, talks to neighborhood groups and listens to their complaints. He is greeted at each stop with enthusiasm, sometimes elation. But even Mr. Golden, who has been in office for two decades, admits that the position has lost much of its power.
There is no question, he said, that the abolition of the Board of Estimate six years ago "took away a lot of our ability to showcase our boroughs' problems."
"And that's made our job somewhat less powerful," he added, "and more difficult."
Arguing for the value of the position, proponents contend that boroughs still have distinct identities -- that the Bronx, for example, is different from Staten Island or Queens.
"The rationale for having these jobs goes back to the fact that the city was formed from these independent jurisdictions," said John H. Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York's Graduate Center. "And many people believe that you would not have anyone to protect the interests of the borough as a whole, if it weren't for these positions."
Until 1989, the presidents' power to help their constituents stemmed primarily from their role as members of the Board of Estimate, which also included the mayor, the City Council president and the comptroller. The board, a powerful arbiter of land use and maker of the city's budget, was described as "the center of gravity in the city's political process" in the 1960 textbook "Governing New York City," by Wallace S. Sayre and Herbert Kaufman.
But the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the board violated the constitutional principle of one person, one vote, because each of the borough leaders had one vote despite the different populations in their boroughs.
Under the City Charter that became effective in 1990, borough presidents no longer helped write city budgets, or voted on them. Instead, the charter gave them the authority to "work with the mayor" in preparing the budget. Their powers became to "advise," to "monitor" and to "recommend." They were no longer allowed to head their boroughs' political organizations, which severely curtailed their ability to dispense political patronage.
But each still makes an appointment to the Board of Education and the City Planning Commission as well as to the city's community boards.
Despite all the changes, said Percy E. Sutton, who served as Manhattan Borough President from 1966 to 1977, the city benefits from the positions. "Boroughs in New York are larger than most cities," he said. And there is a need to have some central person, who is local, to plead the interests of the citizens in that borough."
Mr. Golden, who said he would seek re-election next year, contended that the position, though diminished, remains valuable to Brooklyn.
"The job has changed a lot," he said during a chauffeured drive back to Borough Hall for a meeting with local politicians. "And we have to work twice as hard now to accomplish things. But I wouldn't trade it for anything."

HEADLINE: Liberia War: Nation Adrift

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast, May 11

 BODY:
When an aging cargo vessel crammed with up to 4,000 Liberian refugees limped past this city sometime Friday night on its uncertain route toward neighboring Ghana, much of the history of Liberia's catastrophic six-year civil war traveled with it.
The Nigerian owners of the ship, the Bulk Challenge, charged $75 and more for passage aboard the overcrowded ship to people desperate to flee a month of intense fighting in the Liberian capital, Monrovia. In doing so, the Nigerians seemed to be emulating the approach of their own nation, whose intervention in 1990 was meant to stop the raging civil war but which many Liberians feel has sucked their country dry instead. 
 The authorities of the Ivory Coast, meanwhile, rejected pleas from Washington to allow the Liberian passengers, many of them sick, off the ship, which has taken on six feet of water. They said that with 300,000 refugees already, the country could not accept one more boatload, and they contended that 2,000 of those on the ship were combatants.
There was no mention, of course, from political leaders here that Liberia's civil war had begun with an invasion of rebels based here or that members of the principal armed faction, the National Patriotic Front, had been given easy passage across borders, treated as V.I.P.'s.
[As the ship approached Ghana, it was intercepted by the Ghanaian Navy, Reuters reported. A representative of the United Nations refugee agency in the capital was quoted as saying that only non-Liberians would be allowed ashore.
[A second ship teeming with 1,300 sick and hungry people fleeing Liberia was reported anchored off Freetown, Sierra Leone, about 250 miles northwest of Monrovia, The Associated Press reported. Most of those on the ship, the Victory Reefer, are citizens of Sierra Leone.]
The neighboring countries' reactions to the drama of the Bulk Challenger tell the diplomatic story of a conflict that has been allowed to sputter for so long that it has nearly flared out of control.
Liberians have their own bitter explanation of the name for the Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force, Ecomog, set up in 1990 under the 16-member Economic Community of West African States, or Ecowas. Although the name officially stands for Ecowas Monitoring Group, the more apt gloss for Liberian civil war victims has been Everything That Could Move Is Gone, a reference to the force's longstanding efforts to strip Liberia of everything from its mineral wealth to machinery.
The owners of the Bulk Challenge apparently followed suit. After they had scalped Liberians for a steep fare on a leaky boat and had even turned away many who had paid, some Liberians were angered to find stolen vehicles aboard.
"For the longest time we watched as Ecomog robbed our country and we just accepted it as the price of peace," said George Boley, the deputy chairman of Liberia's ruling Council of State, who was out of the country when the fighting began in Monrovia and has not been able to return. "Well, it turns out they have not been able to keep the peace, and they still want to rob us. Maybe they should just go back home."
If indignation like this, directed primarily at Nigeria, has become common, there is also anger at the Ivory Coast and other French-speaking countries. For many analysts of this region's affairs, the strong sway France holds over its former West African colonies is a key both to the start and the endurance of the Liberian war. According to this view, France, distrustful of Nigeria's emergence as a regional superpower, has discouraged its clients from involvement in peacekeeping.
In his speech this week to a meeting of the Economic Community of West African State, President Jerry John Rawlings of Ghana made a stinging criticism of his French-speaking counterparts who, he said, were "unwilling to contribute troops to a force meant to establish peace in our own subregion."
There is also mounting criticism in this region of United States policy toward Liberia, a country founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
Few would say Washington has a responsibility to take in many of the tens of thousands of fleeing Liberians. But many in West Africa say the United States, long the dominant foreign influence in Liberian politics, has skirted its duty to help end the crisis.
"It is dishonest to pretend that an arms-length approach to this crisis can end the tragedy," said a senior West African official who attended the meetings last week in Ghana. "What this whole disaster has proven is that there is no substitute for a strong American role in a situation like this."

HEADLINE: A GIANT IN MOTION -- Surviving Corporate Reinvention;
As AT&T Reorganizes, Its Employees Regroup

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
The metamorphosis of AT&T has begun.
The 40,000 job cuts that have made the company a symbol of corporate downsizing and the restructuring that is splitting it into three parts have thrown one of the New York region's largest private employers into a state of deep flux. Departments are being split across corporate lines, separating friends who worked together for years. 
 Other pieces of the company are being spun out intact, like new galaxies, to survive or perish on their own. There are people who have left the payroll but remain on the job like ghosts, and others who are busy preparing themselves for the unknown.
Some of the issues now in play in the early months of the transition are grand and cosmic, concerning the evolution of corporate culture and the future of scientific research. Others are as personal and profound as a worker's self-image.
"I felt like I was worthless there for a while," said Ronald B. Taylor, who saw the bottom drop out of his life earlier this year after 33 years with AT&T. Mr. Taylor went from six weeks of vacation a year and plush benefits to one week off and no pension -- and feels grateful to have his new job. "After 30-some years, you figure you're invincible, and then they throw you out with the bath water," he said.
More than one-fifth of the AT&T's 289,000-member work force lives in the New York metropolitan region, almost 50,000 of them in New Jersey alone, where the company is the state's largest private employer. The density of those numbers makes this one company a community of its own, with its own culture and rhythms and traditions -- and especially over the course of the next year of corporate reinvention -- its own deep anxieties.
AT&T's journey also mirrors the forces that are reshaping the economy of the nation and the region. Changes in technology, regulation and management, company officials have said, dictated a voluntary breakup into three parts: communications services, communications equipment and computers. The scale of the downsizing, they say, is a reflection of how rapidly and deeply those transforming pressures have struck home.
This article, the first in a periodic look at the company and its employees over the next year, is a glimpse into the AT&T community's local neighborhoods and precincts, captured in motion, on their way to becoming something else.
 
Changed Outlook
Sense of Urgency At New Concern
The warehouse work in Piscataway, N.J., is still getting done. The same 17 people are there and still friends, probably even closer friends, they say, than they used to be when they were but a tiny, far-flung and benignly neglected outpost living for the greater good of AT&T.
But it is not really the same since everyone there was dismissed, nor will it ever be again. The employees lived for three months, beginning last Nov. 1, on a knife's edge of worry, a period that many there said permanently changed their outlook on life. The company announced on that day that this outpost, the asset recovery unit, a kind of attic and resale operation for AT&T's old office equipment and supplies would be closed in 90 days, or perhaps sold if a buyer could be found. The employees might have jobs or they might not.
As the 90-day clock was winding down with no buyer, and in the dark days of late January after more than a few late-night parties and tear-filled farewells, the members of the asset unit said their goodbyes and began to close down the warehouse.
The Farmstead Telephone Group, a small Connecticut-based company, entered the picture in February as the unit's warehouse lease and the employees' hopes were running out. Farmstead, which has all of 75 employees including those here at its newest acquisition, bought all the assets, hired back almost everyone who had not already left for another job -- including seven people who had been working as long-term temporary employees -- leased a replacement down the street in the same town and breathed life back into what had seemed lifeless.
What changed here is tightly intertwined with what did not change: Lives were altered, racked by stress for months, then put back where they had been, like a twister that hurls you across the sky and returns you to your living room. The changes and scars, the workers here say, are mostly invisible and internal, as is the sense of redemption and resurrection.
"There was torment and torture along the way," said Donna West, a sales representative. "But what you do to yourself is a lot worse than what anyone can do to you."
One thing that changes as a result of such experiences is the measure of time. Working for a vast company like AT&T encouraged a long view, employees say. If a particular quarter was not so profitable, well, there was always next quarter to make up the difference.
"In this environment, you have a sense of urgency -- you realize that you really can't have a bad quarter," said Ted Phillips, the former general manager of the asset unit, now in charge of buying for Farmstead. Mr. Phillips now has a different attitude toward time off. He was entitled to five weeks of vacation at AT&T and took it. Now, he just shakes his head at the idea. All the employees of the warehouse unit, called Farmstead Asset Management Services, will get one week off this first year. And Mr. Phillips said that, with the operation's newness and lean staff, "You take four hours off, you feel guilty."
On the other hand, the downsizing of AT&T is about the best thing that could be happening to Farmstead. The company's 47,000-square-foot warehouse has become a repository of AT&T's downsized dreams. There are 80,000 hand-held video games here from the phone center stores that were closed this year and 4,000 smart card computer memory inserts from a project that got canceled midstream.
There is a whole shipment of new computer equipment that was delivered to a New Jersey office after the employees had already disappeared into layoffs or transfers. The stuff ended up in the warehouse, brand-new, not even out of the box, but surplus all the same.
There is, everyone here repeatedly emphasizes, no ill will borne toward AT&T, their former employer and now largest supplier -- rather, the workers say, a kind of relief, and a shrugging sense of fate's hand at work. Mr. Taylor, Farmstead's director of management information systems, said the last months at the old company were so unhappy and filled with anxiety that he now feels happier and more confident in himself than he has for years.
Some people have found their bad luck and good luck so intermixed that it is hard to tell the difference. Ms. West, for example, worked here as a temporary employee for five years with no AT&T benefits and no paid vacation. Her ship came in last September when the company finally offered her a permanent job. They got the closing notice six weeks later. But because she was a full-time employee by then, she got 40 percent of a year's salary in a severance package, enough to pay off her car loan.
 
A Disembodied Man
Full-Time Job, But Rootless
So far at least, the reshaping of AT&T has occurred without widespread bloodshed. Of the 7,000 people who have left the payroll so far this year, 6,000 were managers who elected to leave under a voluntary package, according to the company. And of the 6,000 people who have received layoff notices since January, about 1,000 have left the company, 1,000 have found new jobs elsewhere in the company, and 1,800 more have had their jobs extended and the rest have not found their next job.
But even voluntary decisions, fueled by generous severance packages of up to a year's salary, mean discarding the comfortable and familiar. And people are finding that the workplace world after AT&T is changing just as rapidly as the one they left.
Vikas Sinha, a 28-year-old computer software developer, left the company and took the buyout after five and a half years, looking for new experiences, he said. He is definitely finding them. In the new corporate world, he has become a kind of disembodied man: a permanent, full-time, rootless corporate temporary. He lives in a hotel in Stamford, Conn., Monday through Thursday, working for an accounting firm but assigned for the foreseeable future to a pharmaceutical company, at least until his next assignment and his next hotel room. Neither the company where he works nor the company that signs his paycheck wished to be identified.
"You do get a little sick of it after a while," he said. "But it's good experience."
Gaspar Fiorino, a former data processing worker, got the word more than a year ago that his office, in Knightsbridge, N.J., would be closed sometime in 1996. That began, he said, a year of self-discovery and job training co-sponsored by the company and his union, the Communications Workers of America, that eventually landed him a job in Morristown, still within the company. He even got a promotion and a raise out of it.
In White Plains, middle managers whose jobs are secure for the moment are being encouraged to go on "informational" pretend job interviews in corners of the company they are not familiar with.
In the cycle of its reinvention, which AT&T officials say is still in the beginning phases, people are preparing in advance, even as they work, for what will yet come. In a traditional, hierarchical organization where job security was assumed and career change and advancement came willed from the top down, the downsizing and reorganization are forcing people to think of their own futures, independent of the company's direction. Employees say that is a change in its own right, with implications that are yet to unfold.
"It cuts against the grain of the culture," said Bob Leslie, a human resources manager in White Plains who has helped create more than 30 informational interviews. He said the effort was not formally started by AT&T but arose spontaneously in different places as people started to look out for themselves. "Maybe we should form our own secret society," he said.
 
Here They Remain
Retirees Putter At the Lab
Ed Gilbert took a voluntary buyout package this spring after 48 years as a mathematician at Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J.. But he is still there. So are Anne Freeny, Peter Linhart, Lawrence A. Shepp and Frank Sinden. They get no salaries, and yet, there they remain, conducting seminars, continuing the research that has absorbed them for decades, puttering in the philosophical garden of their beloved theorems and proofs and playing speed chess.
They inhabited and helped build one of the more celebrated corners of the industrial-scientific community and now they will not go away even as the world they knew has changed around them. They are reminders of what was, and they make the changes around them thus seem all the more stark. Under AT&T's three-part split, Bell Labs becomes part of a new company, Lucent Technologies. The other spinoff is the former NCR Corporation, a computer company that AT&T bought in diversification move a few years earlier.
"Will I get in trouble if I use my zombie metaphor?" said the mathematics center's director, Michael Garey, glancing across his office at a public relations executive. "It's like the movie, 'The Dawn of the Dead,' " Mr. Garey continued, without waiting for approval. "They keep returning to the shopping mall where they lived in life. They like to talk mathematics."
There is a portrait here, in the corridors of the mathematics center, where austere military-style design seems never to have gone out of fashion, of a place and a time and a kind of work that many people say is disappearing from the corporate world. The life of the mind and the life of the corporation coexisted. But now the 67-person math center, after a stress-filled round of picking sides, is being cut in two: about two-thirds of the department is going to Lucent Technologies, which will take possession of the vaunted Bell Labs name, while another third is going to AT&T labs. Through this summer, both sides will share the same space, but the barriers, at least psychologically, are already going up.
"The splitting signaled a greater change," Mr. Garey said. "It wasn't going to be the same company going forward that they were used to."
The mathematics center has never lost this many people at one time, or so much of its institutional memory, perhaps because it has never changed so much at one time. The retirees are probably the last people, for example, who still remember the days when Claude Shannon would ride his unicycle through the corridors, before and after inventing the mathematical framework in the 1940's that made much of the digital communications revolution possible.
But they are also the last who remember the great historic cycles of Bell Labs: How in the 1920's and up until World War II, according to Mr. Gilbert, it was driven by a spirit of open commercialism -- a rivalry over which scientist could get the most patents -- and how it then changed in the Sputnik era of the 1950's and 1960's into a kind of Big Science think tank.
Mr. Gilbert said the irony is that a globalized economy, heightened competition and the end of the cold war -- all pushing the lab to prove its commercial worth -- are also pushing it back toward an earlier rhythm, familiar if you are old enough to remember. But the boundaries themselves are also in motion. The separation between the people going to the new AT&T lab and those staying with Lucent is, for the moment, purely theoretical. The AT&T scientists will not physically leave the building until late this summer, and that also creates a tension about how open you can be in wandering across the corridor to discuss ideas.
Mr. Garey, who has given the retirees an office to work from, said that while he values having them around, they also create some complications. Since they are off the payroll, he cannot really give them any assignments to do and even does not want them to be too involved with current projects. If one of them makes a great breakthrough, questions about patenting rights could be tricky as well, he said, though they have all signed a nonpaying consulting contract that he thinks would probably satisfy the lawyers.
"It's like having your job all over again," Mr. Gilbert said. "Except that you don't get paid and no one complains if you don't produce."

 Times reporters will examine the restructuring of AT&T and its impact on the company, its employees and the metropolitan region in occasional articles over the next years.

HEADLINE: Wisconsin Welfare Plan Is Not a Good Model;
Guaranteed Child Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Harriet Brown (Op-Ed, May 7) is off base. Our Wisconsin Works plan will replace the failed welfare policies of the last 60 years. And it guarantees child care to all low-income working families, not just those being assisted. 
 To meet this need, we are tripling the amount spent on child care. All families who qualify will be required to pay part of their child care expenses based on income. To help families make the transition from welfare to work, we have created a less expensive level of child care.
Our plan addresses what many welfare parents have told us: they want the people they trust -- mothers, grandparents, friends -- caring for their children. All providers must meet health and safety standards and pass criminal background checks.
Wisconsin has a strong tradition of caring for children. Our plan, of which you say (editorial, May 3) "there is much to admire," is a case in point.

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER;
On the Big Island: Hawaii, Naturally

BYLINE: By SUSAN SPANO 

 BODY:
I WASN'T exactly overjoyed by the time I reached Hawaii in late March, partly because the cheapest round-trip air fare I could find (from a consolidator called Cheap Tickets) cost $584. The trip from New York (on T.W.A., with a stopover in St. Louis) took 13 hours, and because I arrived in Honolulu too late to go on to the Big Island that night as planned, I spent the night at the highway-encircled Best Western Plaza Hotel near the airport (for $89), where what I remember most fondly were the free Happy Hour barbecued chicken wings at the bar.
The trip -- which ultimately turned out to be one of the most rewarding I have taken -- really started the next morning when I returned to the airport to board a little Mahalo Air ATR-42 with the endangered Hawaiian goose, the nene, painted on its tail. The flight to Keahole Airport on the Big Island's Kona Coast took about 45 minutes, cost just $49, and provided lovely views of Molokai, Lanai and Maui along the way. 
 When I'd called Mahalo before leaving for Hawaii, the reservations agent offered to reserve a rental car. I took her up on it since she could get me a Geo Metro from Alamo at a weekly rate of $133. Rental companies tell drivers to stay off the Saddle Road that connects Kona to the east coast port town of Hilo. So, dutifully, I took the long route to my destination, following Highway 11 all the way around the southern portion of the Big Island -- at 4,038 square miles the biggest in the Hawaiian chain. It seemed more like a continent than an island until I rounded a hairpin bend on the flank of the great volcano, Mauna Loa, and caught sight of the lava-black Kua Coast, often realigned by earthquakes, eruptions and tsunamis.
About 100 miles later I reached the turnoff for the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where for the last 13 years Kilauea has been spewing red rivers of lava toward the Puna Coast, a district just south of Hilo. As a result, Puna has lost the village of Kalapana, a National Park Visitors Center and a landmark black sand beach.
Puna was my destination. I hoped it was still there.
To be more precise, I was headed to the Kalani Honua Eco-Resort near the former site of Kalapana. In planning this trip, I'd decided to try out alternative resorts -- often nonprofit religious or educational retreat centers that are generally pleasingly priced. I'd tried two such places before, in the Yucatan and on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Both were beautiful, but had drawbacks; in the Yucatan, cliquish New Agers made me feel uncomfortable, and on Mexico's Pacific coast there were scorpions in the bedclothes. Nonetheless, I decided to try again. I booked a $60 room at Kalani Honua, a nonprofit educational center, for three nights and a $30 room for two more at the Wood Valley Buddhist Temple and Retreat Center on the eastern slope of Mauna Loa.
Kalani Honua is about five miles north of the place where lava licked over Highway 130 just a few years ago, closing the only route around the southeastern part of the island. But it isn't just this that gives the resort its end-of-the-road feeling. The closest place for gas, food and lodging is the old sawmill town of Pahoa (about 10 miles north), where Dodge City meets Woodstock along a main street lined by Western-style raised plank sidewalks and false-fronted stores specializing in natural foods, crystals, tarot cards and books with titles like "How to Relax About Money." The road that runs by the turnoff for the resort is one lane most of the way with overarching ohia and monkeypod trees, low stretches that flood during heavy rains and curves hugging high, constantly eroding seacliffs.
THERE were two white Arabian horses grazing at the threshold of Kalani Honua, a field for campers, somewhat moldering tennis courts and a little office where I checked in and noted the activity schedule, which included Kripalu yoga, Hawaiian mythology and hula classes. I also bought tickets for dinner that night ($13) and breakfast the next morning ($7). Driving on, I found a long mowed lawn dotted by pink hibiscus bushes (with blooms as full as carnations) and five rustic brown buildings housing guest rooms, the restaurant and the Wellness Center, which had a 25-foot pool, hot tub and sauna (clothing optional after 7 P.M.). My room was on the second floor of the second to last building and had knotty wood walls, three single beds, one chair and two lamps (yielding light when the generator was on, from 6 A.M. to 10:30 P.M.). On the first floor there were two shared baths with showers and a reasonably well-equipped, kitchen.
I was glad for that kitchen, because, though healthful and plentiful, the food at Kalani Honua was bland for my taste. On the day after I arrived I shopped at Pahoa Natural Groceries, returning to the resort with, among other things, a container of pre-cooked, homemade lasagna, a papaya, a bag of 100 percent Kona coffee, a quart of Vita Soy and some organic maple almond granola (all for about $24). I liked my little self-catered breakfasts best, which I shared with the man occupying the room next to mine, who was taking a rest from working in a Seattle hospice for AIDS patients.
We seemed to be among the few guests at the resort who'd come by ourselves, and not as part of a retreat group. There was no pressure to join in, but every day at least one class or activity was offered to anyone interested -- like the hula class ($5) I attended, led by the resort's founder and executive director, Richard Koob; the class left me mistress of the dance form's basic steps but painfully sore in the region of the waist. On another night, there was a concert in a Quonset hut near the tennis courts given by an accomplished gay a cappella singing group called the Flirtations ($7), composed of two men and a woman. Their specialty was infusing old standards like "Mr. Sandman" with innuendo, to the great delight of the many same-sex couples in the audience.
During the day, I explored Puna, aided by a hand-drawn map from the resort that reminded me of something out of "The Hobbit" and noted all the interesting places in the neighborhood, like a nearby outcropping of volcanic steam vents bordered by ferns and delicate wild orchids; Isaac Hale Beach Park on Highway 137, where a dilapidated pier provides great views of surfers in Pohoiki Bay; Pohoiki and Kumaili Roads, two winding country lanes lined by jerrybuilt houses with corrugated aluminum roofs and orderly papaya groves, and the unmanned lighthouse at bleak Cape Kumukahi.
I'd take a picnic lunch or stop in Pahoa when I got hungry, favoring an endearing little storefront restaurant called Naung Mai Thai Food for its chicken pad Thai ($5.75) and Luquins, a Mexican place across the street, where the taco and enchilada combo cost $5.50.
And I always wore my bathing suit under my clothes, in the vain hope for calm waves on Puna's wild black sand beaches, like lovely Kehena, about a mile south of Kalani Honua. But surely the most remarkable sandy strip in the area is brand new, replacing the famous black sand beach of Kaimu, destroyed by recent lava flows. To reach the new Kaimu, I parked at the end of the road in Kalapana and picked my way across about a half mile of mesmerizingly swirly hardened pahoehoe lava, finally arriving at a blasted-out black sand beach, ripped by dangerous currents -- a spine-chilling spot from which I could see the steamcloud about seven miles down the coast in the national park where fresh, hot lava is sizzling into the sea.
I also spent a day in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park (an hour's drive from Puna, admission $5 a vehicle for seven days), stopping at Akatsuka Orchid Gardens along the way to enjoy the subtle scents of blossoms with names like Red Shadow and Midnight Tears. In the park, I checked the seismographs at the Jaggar Museum, where the displays teach visitors about volcanology, strolled through the Thurston lava tube, hiked the four-mile loop across Kilauea Iki, a crater at the east side of the main caldera that last erupted in 1959 and then drove down Chain of Craters Road.
It was drizzling as I started along the lava path marked with cairns and climbed an old cindercone called Puu Huluhulu. By the time I reached the summit, the east flank of Kilauea was completely socked in, so I couldn't see Puu Oo -- the vent that opened in January 1983, and is the source of current lava flows. So I drowned my disappointment in a scotch and soda (for about $4) at the Volcano Golf and Country Club, watching a nene on the fairway, and then moved on for a dinner splurge at a pretty country inn called Kilauea Lodge in Volcano Village; there the steak teriyaki and prawn tempura entree (for $18.50) came with clam chowder, salad and delicious homemade bread.
All the while during my explorations I kept looking west toward Mauna Loa, but the volcano (60 miles long and 30 miles wide) that last erupted for 21 days in 1984 remained mysteriously veiled in clouds -- not a good portent, I thought, because a green fold on the giant's eastern flank called Wood Valley was my next destination.
To reach it, I drove about 25 miles south from the national park along Highway 11, with the barren, lava-paved Kua Desert to my left, verdant Mauna Loa to my right and a rousing view of the Kua Coast up ahead. At the struggling town of Pahala (home to a big sugar mill that shut down at the end of March), I turned onto a country road winding past overgrown cane fields, boarded-up sugar camps and groves of shapely macadamia trees to Wood Valley.
It was raining when I at last spied the colorful pennants at the entrance to Nechung Dorje Drayang Ling, a brilliant red Buddhist temple built around the turn of the century, nestled in a dense glade of eucalyptus trees. As I soon learned, it almost always rains there -- but the place is so magically pacific and beautiful that I never cared. Occasionally one of the peacocks that preen on the lawn would break the silence with a eery shriek, or the resident Tibetan monk, Tiapala, would sound the temple's reverberant gong.
I stayed in a small, carefully kept room with a single bed, chair and armoire on the first floor of the yellow retreat center just below the temple. During my visit I shared the building (and its four bathrooms) with a yoga retreat group led by a rather bossy woman who clearly didn't want me in her hair at dinnertime. So at about 7 P.M. I cooked my little meals of ramen noodles or a local fish called ono in the communal kitchen, which had screened-in walls, an industrial stove and jumbled shelves. I loved that homey kitchen and all the little nooks around the retreat center, where I'd curl up on a couch to read odds and ends I found in the library, like a booklet published by The Watchtower called "Is This Life All There Is?" and Immanuel Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason."
The Wood Valley Temple and Retreat Center offered only one activity: morning and evening prayers in the temple, with Tiapala chanting in his marvelously sonorous voice. I have no idea what it all meant, but I am sure it did me good. During the day, I explored the wonderfully slow-lane towns of Kua like Waiohinu, with its lovely mission church built in 1841, and Naalehu, home to the Punaluu Bake Shop, renowned for its Hawaiian sweetbread; checked out beaches like Punaluu, which was too rough for swimming or Hawksbill turtle sighting on the day I was there, and drove the 10-mile lane leading to South Point, marking not only the south end of the island, but also the most southerly spit of land in the United States. I passed a windmill farm on the way there, and from the east side of the peninsula hiked to an awesome cindercone called Puu o Mahana that towers above a beach with sand turned green by volcanic stones called olivines.
Back at Wood Valley, enfolded in a dark fog, I'd crack open The Watchtower volume again, thinking that I'd be blessed, indeed, if this life were all there was.
 
The bottom line on a trip to Hawaii
 
Getting There
For five days on the Big Island, I spent an average of $74 a day, with $48 of that going toward accommodations. To get to Honolulu in late March, I contacted Cheap Tickets, (800) 377-1000 or (212) 570-1179, a Hawaii-based consolidator that found me a $584 round-trip fare on T.W.A. At the time, this was at least $100 less than the fares quoted by Continental, Delta and American. However, T.W.A.'s lowest round-trip fare for May departures from New York to Honolulu costs $515, traveling on Tuesday or Wednesday, with a 14-day advance purchase; for information, call (800) 221-2000.
Should you happen to be going to Hawaii from Los Angeles or San Francisco, you might call Sun Trips, a charter company at (800) 786-8747; it has a round-trip L.A.-Honolulu fare of $219 and a San Francisco-Honolulu round-trip fare of $239.
For interisland flights, I did a good deal of comparison shopping and found the best deal with Mahalo, (800) 462-4256 -- $49 for most island-to-island hops. If you've willing to fly very early or late, Hawaiian Air, (800) 367-5320, can better that fare by $6. And if you're planning an extended stay in the islands, look into both airlines' special passes, allowing unlimited travel for a week, two weeks, or a month for very reasonable prices.
 
Getting Around
Mahalo booked me an economy class car for $133 a week ($150 with tax) from Alamo; gas cost $24. The Hawaii Visitors Bureau can be reached at Waikiki Business Plaza, 2270 Kalakaua Avenue, Suite 801, Honolulu, Hawaii 96815, (808) 923-1811, fax (808) 922-8991; there is also an office at 350 Fifth Avenue, Suite 1827, New York, N.Y. 10118, (212) 947-0717, fax (212) 947-0725.
Information on Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is available from park headquarters at Post Office Box 52, Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, Hawaii 96718, (808) 967-7311.
Lodging and Food
 Kalani Honua Eco-Resort, R.R. 2, Box 4500, Kehena Beach, Hawaii 96778, (800) 800-6886 or (808) 965-7828, has a guest house with a kitchen and two baths that rents for $165, seven cottages with private baths from $85 to $95 ($110 to $145 with meals), six lodge rooms with private baths for $75 to $85 ($100 to $135 with meals), and 18 share-bath lodge rooms for $60 to $70 ($85 to $120 with meals); solo travelers can share triples for $45 ($70 with meals). The cost of classes and special events is not included. Breakfast is priced at $7, lunch $9, dinner $13.
The Retreat Center at Wood Valley Temple, Post Office Box 250, Pahala, Hawaii 96777, (808) 928-8539, fax (808) 928-6271, has room for 25 in a dorm room with bunk beds, singles and doubles -- all sharing four baths and a kitchen. Rates range from $18 to $45 with a two-night minimum stay. There are no locks on the doors. I strongly advise that you pack mosquito repellent.
Naung Mai Thai Food, (808) 965-8186, and Luquins Mexican Restaurant, (808) 965-9990, are in Pahoa; Kilauea Lodge, (808) 967-7366, is in Volcano Village, and the Punaluu Bake Shop, (808) 929-7343, is in the center of Naalahu.

HEADLINE: Faint Praise for CUNY

BYLINE: By James Traub; James Traub, a staff writer at the New Yorker, is the author of "City on a Hill: Testing the American Dream at City College."

 BODY:
More than half of the students at the City University of New York graduate, and those graduates go on to make significant contributions to New York's economy, according to a study released last week. These figures, should they stand up to statistical challenge, suggest that CUNY is at least a more successful social-service program than some of its critics have been willing to concede.
That, however, is faint praise. In the evolving information economy, any diploma has market value; and it would be a serious mistake to see the new findings as a vindication of CUNY's dubious academic standards. 
 Defenders of the status quo at CUNY are sure to brandish the new study to ward off desperately needed academic reform. In fact, David Lavin, a professor at the Graduate School and the principal author of the study, has already done so. Recently, he said, "Any policy that makes it more difficult for students to stay in college diminishes their earning power and detracts from the taxes they will pay and the tone of New York City and New York State."
The truth is that most CUNY students are a product of a devastated New York City public school system. Most have failed one or more of three placement tests set at about a 10th-grade level. Many of them, with the help of dedicated teachers, go on to make near-heroic efforts and graduate with a real education.
Yet, the graduation rate at CUNY campuses is ultimately a testimony less to the miracle of college-level remediation than to an acute awareness on the part of their professors that higher education provides social mobility even when it doesn't provide education. Would you deny a student access to the good life because he or she can't construe a paragraph or write one? It's an agonizing question that CUNY professors face all the time; they shouldn't have to.
After years of denial -- or perhaps cowardice -- CUNY under the leadership of Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds has finally begun addressing its academic problems. A quarter-century after the advent of open admissions, the university has begun to require entering students who need profound remedial help to begin in a two-year, rather than a four-year, institution. And CUNY is putting a cap on the number of times that students can take the same remedial course.
These strictures will limit access to the system's senior colleges, at least in the short run, and predictably have led to harsh criticisms of Dr. Reynolds within the university. But CUNY has to stay the course, not only out of an obligation to its students but to keep pressure on the public schools to produce graduates who are ready for college.
What has confused the whole matter -- and turned every criticism into a life-and-death issue -- is that CUNY is also under financial attack. Gov. George Pataki, after proposing deep cuts in the system's financing last year (legislators partly restored it), is hoping to cut $57.6 million from CUNY's budget this year. Even more ominously, he wants to remove $50 million from the money available for tuition assistance.
A combination of tuition increases and cuts in the student loan program have already forced many students out, and compelled others to work so many hours they barely have time to study. Clearly these cuts do nothing to promote reform.
If Mr. Pataki wants to score political points by beating up on symbols of the old faith in public spending and public institutions, he should look elsewhere: New York desperately needs a strong CUNY. But by turning a blind eye to academic problems, CUNY loyalists only guarantee a perpetual crisis.

HEADLINE: Taking in the Sites;
Now, It's Philanthropy Surfing on the Internet

BYLINE: By MIKE ALLEN 

 BODY:
While retailers and publishers sweat for the secret to making a buck on the World Wide Web, nonprofit groups are merrily using their sites to recruit, convert and solicit.
"It's like putting up 10,000 billboards for free," said Elizabeth Rose, the Web page designer for Independent Sector, a Washington group that promotes philanthropy. 
 The Sierra Club offers 10 tips for boycotting an oil company, from the high-minded, "Hold a candlelight vigil," to the practical, "Drive less."
The Dallas-based American Heart Association, to lighten its grim roster of stroke symptoms and warning signs, includes a photo of a potato shaped like a Valentine heart, submitted by the group's Arizona chapter. "But oddly, a real heart looks like an eggplant," the page says.
Young parents raised on McGruff the Crime Dog can tap into the public service messages on the Advertising Council's site to see what Scruff, his 3-year-old nephew, is telling the new generation about drugs, guns and bullies.
Many Web pages promote what's cool, but one of Second Harvest's food banks, in San Jose, Calif., offers "What's Hot" hints for a successful food drive, including a raffle.
Requests for contributions are a staple of nonprofit sites, but Second Harvest says it can take food "on pallets, in totes, in bins, or by the case," and suggests gifts of "cash, stock or estates."
Some officials think groups are overestimating the Web's potential to lure donors.
"It's being far oversold for its state of development," said Kevin J. Ronnie, the field director of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy, a watchdog group based in Washington. "Fund-raising is historically a phenomenon of face-to-face contact."
But considering the low cost of Web appeals, the return can be substantial. The American Red Cross added updates on hurricane damage to its site in September, and found that the page generated 30 percent of that month's calls to the group's toll-free line. Most of those callers offered contributions.
This winter, 600 people answered the Red Cross site's plea for help in setting up home pages for local chapters.
Literacy Volunteers of America, based in Syracuse, which promotes adult literacy, says its Web page prompted one gift of $5,000 and another of a new computer.
The group's page features a pitch for volunteers. "If they're surfing the Web, they obviously have some free time on their hands," said Beverly H. Miller, a vice president.
For those considering giving, the National Charities Information Bureau in New York has a site that rates the practices of 385 charities, and offers reports detailing their finances.
When you visit a site, the sponsor can record your E-mail address and visit you later. Matthew A. Landy, vice president of National Charities, said that most groups had been avoiding such practices because states had not written rules for charitable solicitation on the Internet.
"When those are crystallized, the charities will be much more aggressive," Mr. Landy said.
One nonprofit group, Impact Online, was created to help charities use the Web. The group, in Palo Alto, Calif., uses its site to match what it calls "virtual volunteers" with organizations that need them, and has begun a data base of group logos and missions.
Some groups are seizing the chance to inform new audiences. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a group in Los Angeles dedicated to defending human rights, offers 36 questions about the Holocaust -- in English, Spanish and Swedish.
The site for Amnesty International includes reports on 375 topics, from women in Afghanistan to prisoners in Zaire.
If right-wing politics has cornered the market on talk radio, the left seems to dominate the Web. The site of Progressive Directory, based in San Francisco, has areas called Peacenet, Econet, Conflictnet, Labornet and Womensnet.
The Fund for Animals, has a "Kid's Korner" that urges youngsters to "think like the animal" and sign a pledge to shun hunting.

HEADLINE: Computer Sales Slowdown Falls Short of Indications

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER 

 BODY:
Call it the slump that wasn't or the analysts who cried wolf.
Midway through the first quarter, a consensus emerged on Wall Street and among market analysts that the personal computer industry had entered a slowdown, possibly a protracted one. Now that the data are out, it is clear that sales of personal computers grew by a healthy percentage in the first quarter. 
 Dataquest, the market research firm based in San Jose, Calif., reported last week that shipments of personal computers in the United States reached 5.7 million in the first three months of 1996, up 15 percent from the corresponding period a year ago. Dataquest now predicts that worldwide PC shipments will grow 19.1 percent this year, a modest downward revision from its January forecast of 19.6 percent. Others predict even more robust growth, indicating that the industry is still far from maturity.
"Clearly, the PC market is slowing down from last year's unsustainable growth rate of 25.6 percent, but 19.1 percent growth in a $125 billion market is nothing to be disturbed about," said Kimball Brown, Dataquest's chief PC analyst. "I think we're off to the races in the second half."
In the second half of the year, the Microsoft Corporation will release version 4.0 of its Windows NT operating system, a more powerful alternative to Windows 95, which was introduced last year. Many analysts believe that corporate customers held off on switching to Windows 95 -- and, as a result, new computers -- in anticipation of the new version of NT, contributing to slower-than-expected PC sales. Microsoft insists that Windows 95 is meeting its internal goals, and, by any conventional measure, it has been a record-setting product.
So what happened to the slump? In fairness to the prognosticators, February and March saw the convergence of a number of disturbing events and indicators. The Compaq Computer Corporation, the market leader, cut prices in response to growing competition and warned that its earnings would fall short of estimates. The Digital Equipment Corporation also warned of an earnings disappointment, blaming slow PC sales. And the book-to-bill ratio, which compares orders to shipments and is usually a good proxy for the PC market's overall health, dropped 20 points in a single month, to a nine-year low.
Those events were real and did reflect a real lull in PC sales that was more pronounced in some markets, but many observers read too much into it, said Andrew Neff, an analyst with Bear, Stearns. Sales to the home market did slow in January, as they generally do after the holiday season, and many PC makers had too many memory chips in inventory, prompting a drop in price that reduced the book-to-bill ratio.
Mr. Neff said Compaq's price cuts, which were followed by similar cuts by the International Business Machines Corporation and other major suppliers, also roiled the market. "Whenever you get a major industry repricing, you get a major pause in the corporate market," he said. "Nobody wants to be the last guy who bought high. Lower prices stimulate demand, but they don't do it the next day."
In addition to lower prices, a number of factors will drive growth in the second half of the year, Mr. Neff said. He cited the continuing corporate shift to computers using the Intel Corporation's Pentium processor, the shift to Windows 95 and Windows NT, multimedia enhancements and the spread of Internet applications that require more powerful computers.
"Unit volume won't be a problem this year for the PC industry," Mr. Neff said. It could even be a surprise on the high side, he said, surpassing his current estimate of 20 percent growth.
Seymour Merrin, a PC industry consultant based in Mountain View, Calif., has an even more bullish estimate, which, he is quick to point out, he maintained throughout the first quarter. "Over the next 24 to 36 months, unless the economy absolutely collapses, there is no question we have to have 25 percent growth," he said. "We have an industry that's due for a few years of guaranteed, self-fulfilling growth."
Mr. Merrin said the PC industry had entered a rare period of convergence in which half a dozen or more technological components had entered a new cycle. Pentium processors, Windows 95, applications for Windows 95, fast CD-ROM drives, faster modems, bigger monitors with higher resolution, more memory and disk-drive capacity, sound and telephony: all have become must-haves. "This is the first time I can remember when so many cycles have peaked simultaneously," he said.
In addition, Mr. Merrin said other analysts had misread the negative indicators. Manufacturers and retailers that have turned in disappointing PC sales are simply losing market share to the companies that can execute well in the current environment, he said. He noted that two manufacturers, Compaq and Gateway 2000, and a retailer, CompUSA, continued to report strong results and that Microsoft had reported yet another record quarter.
The Dataquest numbers do show wide disparities among PC makers. Among the six largest, Compaq, the Hewlett-Packard Company and Gateway had substantial gains in market share, while Packard Bell Electronics, Apple Computer Inc. and I.B.M. had losses. In Mr. Merrin's surveys, computer stores have gained retail market share at the expense of the mass marketers of consumer electronics.

HEADLINE: MEDIA: TELEVISION;
A generation gap in news viewership is suddenly wider.

BYLINE: By Lawrie Mifflin 

 BODY:
WE take it as a generational rule of thumb that young people are less interested in news than their elders are. But that gap has grown suddenly wider, according to a new survey that finds the percentage of people under the age of 30 who say they regularly watch network television news has dropped by more than one-third in the last 12 months.
The survey, to be released today by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, found that 42 percent of all Americans say they regularly watch one of the three traditional nightly news broadcasts, on ABC, CBS or NBC, down from 47 percent a year ago. But among those under 30, only 22 percent said they watch network nightly news, down from 36 percent last year. 
 Local news broadcasts attract more viewers over all, but the declines in their audiences were comparably steep. Among all adults, 65 percent said they regularly watched local news (it was 72 percent last year); among those under 30, 51 percent said they watched local news, off from 64 percent a year ago.
"The networks are facing a serious problem, with increased competition within their industry and with a decreased appetite for news, especially among younger people," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, which until this year was the Times-Mirror Center for the People and the Press.
The percentage of adults who said they watched the Cable News Network regularly has dropped to 26 percent from 30 percent a year ago, according to the survey. That falloff might have been expected: the trial of O. J. Simpson was being carried live by CNN a year ago.
Network news executives say that the networks' share of the total audience has been declining steadily as cable channels have taken more and more viewers away, and that news is merely following the pattern. As viewers grow older, these executives say, viewers will watch more news, just as present-day older viewers watch more news than young people do.
Perhaps so, Mr. Kohut said, but he is convinced that they will still be far fewer in number. "They will grow up and watch less news than the previous younger generation that is now middle-aged," he said. "I really think it's not a life-cyclical pattern, it's generational."
One of the best-known spokeswomen for that under-30 generation, Tabitha Soren of MTV News, thinks she knows why.
"Who wants to watch a half-hour news show with no issues that affect you?" she said. "When mainstream news talks about education, it's in terms of tax breaks for baby-boomer parents who are sending their kids to college, not about kids who are graduating with all this debt and can't even find jobs or are terribly underemployed."
Ms. Soren said that MTV surveys had found education and jobs to be the top issues of concern to the under-30 age group.
"Bill Clinton talks about all the jobs he created, and networks report it," she said. "But do you hear them report that the unemployment rate for 18-to-29-year-olds is double the national average? About the 11 percent of young people who are unemployed? Or the 30 percent who don't have any health care coverage?
"It's a Catch-22," she said of the major networks' treatment of the under-30 group. "Why cover them if they don't watch you? But why should they watch you if you don't cover them?"
The Pew survey also found that people who use personal computers at home more than three days a week said they watched television news less often than did those not using computers, indicating that some computer users may be tracking down news on the Internet or through on-line services.
Also, the survey found the number of people who listen to radio news to be relatively constant.
It did not specifically address the time slot of the network evening news programs, which in recent years has been moved earlier, to 6:30 P.M. from 7 P.M. (to 5:30 P.M. from 6 P.M. in the Midwest). The changes were made because local stations could make more money using the hour before prime time for game shows or gossipy tabloid shows like "Hard Copy" and "Entertainment Tonight."
When asked why they watched less news than they used to, respondents to the survey most often answered "no time/too busy." The second-most-frequent reply was "don't have TV/not readily available." Since 99 percent of American homes have at least one television set, that answer may reflect those people who are not home at 5:30 or 6:30 P.M. to watch news.
"It's an interesting question, whether we're doing network news at a time when it's available to folks who want to see it," said Richard Wald, senior vice president at ABC News, who had read an advance copy of the Pew study. "But early-morning news programs are going up in viewership, and I'm guessing that's because more people are home in the morning and want news."
David F. Poltrack, executive vice president for planning and research at CBS, said the Pew survey confirmed a trend that has been going on for a decade, and is tied to overall TV-viewing trends. There is more competition for the networks over all, and there are more outlets for news, with expanded local news programs, CNN and other cable channels. Indeed, ABC, Fox and a partnership of NBC and the Microsoft Corporation are all developing 24-hour cable news channels.
"You're still talking about more than 40 percent of people watching the network news," he said. "And when there is a major news event happening, the number jumps dramatically. I think most people now know generally whether there has been a significant news event. On days there is, they tune in the network news. On days there isn't, they may decide to come home and watch 'Seinfeld.' "
The Pew survey was based on telephone interviews in April with two nationwide samples of adults 18 and older. The overall survey of 1,751 people has a margin for sampling error of plus or minus 2 percentage points. Princeton Survey Research Associates directed the interviews. Survey results are available from the Pew Research Center, 1875 Eye Street N.W., Suite 1110, Washington, D.C. 20006.

Banana Bully

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
The United States, acting on behalf of the multinational Chiquita banana operation, has initiated a proceeding in the World Trade Organization that poses a major -- and wholly unnecessary -- threat to the economies of several banana-producing nations of the Caribbean.
Chiquita Brands International is upset because of a trade agreement that guarantees Caribbean producers access to the banana market in countries of the European Union. The agreement was part of a continuing effort to protect the small Caribbean democracies from serious economic dislocations that might have resulted from formation of the union. 
 Most of the countries affected by the dispute are former European colonies. Continuation of their historic access to the European banana market is crucial to their economic survival. The countries include Jamaica, Suriname and the Windward Islands (Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Grenada).
As important as bananas are to these countries, they cannot be grown cheaply there. The inland terrain is often hilly and the crop is produced, for the most part, on small family-owned farms. Thus, bananas from the Caribbean cost more than the bananas produced for the multinationals on the vast plantations of Central and South America.
Without some sort of protection, the banana industry in the Caribbean would collapse, and that would precipitate an economic, social and political catastrophe. In some of the countries, more than half of the labor force is tied to the banana industry. Bananas account for nearly 60 percent of the total export earnings of the Windward Islands, and nearly all of the agricultural export earnings of Dominica and St. Lucia.
Aware of the importance of banana exports to these small, fragile economies, the European Union agreed a few years ago to reserve a small portion of its market for Caribbean producers. That portion currently amounts to about 8 percent to 10 percent of the total market.
This has not been a major problem for the big companies. A handful of multinational concerns still control 60 percent of the European market, and 70 percent of the world market. But for the multinationals, enough is never enough.
Chiquita produces no bananas in the United States, and the dispute does not involve in any way the sale of bananas in the United States. But Chiquita has enormous political clout. Its headquarters is in Cincinnati and its top executive, Carl Lindner, makes sure that lavish contributions are made to both the Democratic and Republican Parties. Bob Dole has frequently used Mr. Lindner's corporate planes for travel to Presidential campaign appearances.
Chiquita complained to the Clinton Administration that it was being treated unfairly by the European Union. The Administration, egged on by Senator Dole, agreed. Last week the U.S. and four Latin American countries took Chiquita's complaint to the World Trade Organization, a move that has ominous implications for the Caribbean producers.
Chiquita has managed to use the influence it has purchased with the Government of the United States as a cornerstone of its efforts to increase its sales in Europe of a product that is grown, not in the U.S., but in Central and South America.
As for the Caribbean countries involved -- well, too bad.
"These countries have done everything right," said Randall Robinson, executive director of TransAfrica. "They are neighbors and staunch allies of the United States. They are stable both politically and economically. Their literacy rates are in the 90th percentile and political prisoners are unheard of. But all of that would be jeopardized if their economies were allowed to collapse."
An additional threat to the viability of these countries is what the State Department has described as "the lure of drug money" that can accompany the decline of traditional one-crop economies in the Caribbean. It is already a problem in parts of the Caribbean, and an ill-advised attack on the banana industry will only cause the problem to worsen.
A high-ranking State Department official, who asked not to be identified, said, "You don't want to hurt the banana trade or the tourism industry. It destabilizes governments, it kills jobs, it promotes the drug trade, it increases migration -- it's a world-class headache for the United States."

Fight Urged To Preserve SUNY Role

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: STONY BROOK, L.I., May 12

 BODY:
With the State University of New York facing a battle over its future, the president of the university at Stony Brook urged graduating students today to become warriors for public education.
"We need you to fight for the future of SUNY and other public universities so that others can have the opportunities that you have had," said Dr. Shirley Strum Kenny, who took over as Stony Brook's president in 1994 after serving as president of Queens College from 1985 to 1994. 
 "Help us remind our nation and our state that public universities were created for the economic strength of our country -- that all of us profit by the sound education of our young," said Dr. Kenny, who is also the chairwoman of the Association of American Colleges and Universities. "This country seems to have forgotten that. Don't you ever forget it."
Dr. Kenny made the comments as the state wrestles with proposals to decentralize its university system and alter how it finances it, a debate spurred by new members of the university board appointed by Gov. George E. Pataki.
Dr. Kenny was the keynote speaker at the graduation ceremonies, in which nearly 4,700 students received undergraduate, graduate and medical degrees.
 
Syracuse University
Beatrice Huppuch had waited almost 68 years to graduate from college. Yesterday, Syracuse University awarded her one of 17 associate's degrees at its commencement ceremonies, which had a rare visitor: a mid-May snowfall.
Ms. Huppuch had attended Syracuse's School of Education through the fall of 1928, but she dropped out that year to start a family. After an impassioned plea from her niece, Maxine Andreas, last December, Syracuse officials decided to grant her an associate's degree, which she is receiving along with a grand niece, Marcy Hupp, who is graduating from the university's Newhouse School of Public Communications.
The keynote speaker, Steve Kroft, the "60 Minutes" correspondent, urged the graduating students to demand more from society's institutions. "If you see something that's wrong, don't be afraid to try and fix it," Mr. Kroft said. "Demand responsibility from your corporations and hold the news media to a much higher standard than it is being held to today."
The commencement, Syracuse's 142d, started 15 minutes late to accommodate guests held up by the weather. A total of 2,615 bachelor's degrees and 1,716 master's degrees were awarded, as well as 250 doctorates.
Many students took the bad weather in stride. "It's fate," said Kelly Arst, a student getting a dual bachelor's degree in the Newhouse School and the School of Management. "It snowed every day I've been here, so why not now."

HEADLINE: The Crash in the Everglades: THE COMPANY;
Airline, Frequently Praised, Will Now Get New Scrutiny

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Valujet Airlines has led the unexpected growth in the 1990's of low-cost airlines, a role that has earned it widespread praise from consumers, investors and the Federal Government.
But after a Valujet plane crashed on Saturday near Miami, killing 109 people, such praise will inevitably give way to questions not only about the airline. Airline industry experts predicted yesterday that the same ingredients that had made Valujet so financially successful were likely to loom as a concern among travelers, at least for a while. 
 Questions are also likely to arise about the workload of the Federal Aviation Administration as it tries to oversee a rapidly expanding industry.
The F.A.A. said yesterday that it planned to deploy dozens of inspectors over the next 30 days to scrutinize more closely Valujet's operation and the maintenance companies that work on its aircraft.
"We want to reassure ourselves and the public that we are doing all that we can to insure that Valujet is operating at the highest level of safety," said Anthony J. Broderick, Associate Administrator for regulation and certification for the F.A.A. In television interviews yesterday, Transportation Secretary Federico F. Pena said that he considered Valujet safe and that he had been a passenger on some of its flights.
While the airline's safety procedures have come under scrutiny, Valujet's financial success is not in doubt. Many new airlines are trying to copy its noteworthy feat of setting low fares while maintaining unusually high profit margins.
That success was accomplished in large part to tight control on costs, and no cost is too small to be scrutinized. When the airline started out, Lewis H. Jordan, Valujet's president, insisted that employees turn in an empty pen to get a new one, for example. And the top executives, including Mr. Jordan, sit behind $100 desks from Office Depot that they assembled themselves.
Rather than investing in new jet aircraft, Valujet bought used DC-9 aircraft for approximately $2 million to $5 million each, a fraction of the cost of a new jet. That gave it a fleet of 51 aircraft that is one of the industry's oldest, many of them approaching 30 years of age. Yet aviation safety experts generally agree that if a plane is properly maintained, it can fly for decades.
Valujet aircraft have suffered several mishaps before this weekend's crash. An F.A.A. internal memo from March that was described in The Cleveland Plain Dealer said the agency had found a "significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being hired by Valujet as well as other positions, such as mechanics and dispatchers."
A Valujet spokesman said many F.A.A. concerns had been addressed with training programs and airline policies.
Historically, an airline's second accident rather than its first has raised widespread doubts among the traveling public. A Valujet plane had an engine fire that burst into the passenger cabin last year on a runway in Atlanta.
"Travelers are going to be very suspicious," said Steve Lewins, an airline industry analyst at Gruntal & Company.
Gregg Kenyon, a Valujet spokesman, said he was not aware of any drop-off in passenger traffic on the airline yesterday.
Shares in Valujet, a publicly traded company, closed at $17.875, down 25 cents, on Friday.
The more intense scrutiny of Valujet will most likely reflect back on the F.A.A. in coming months. Because of the rise of new airlines and passenger traffic, the F.A.A. faces an expanding workload and its officials acknowledge that their resources have not kept pace with the growth of the industry.
The turnover in the industry has been high -- about 100 airlines have filed for bankruptcy since the industry was deregulated in 1978, some more than once. And since 1990, about 50 new airlines have applied for certification, a pace that the Transportation Department said is accelerating. The Valujet crash on Saturday was a first for any United States airline that started since the industry was deregulated in 1978, the F.A.A. said.
The growth of such carriers represents a sharp turnabout from fears expressed by government economists around 1991 that the industry would be controlled by just a few enormous airlines.
But it is a trend that the F.A.A., whose mission is in part to foster the growth of aviation, applauds. The Transportation Department recently announced that low-cost airlines had helped save consumers $6.3 billion last year.
The F.A.A. has also been criticized in recent weeks for poor management of its inspectors, who represent the front line of safety oversight, including the time-consuming tasks of approving training and operations manuals for new airlines and enforcing standards that many aviation safety experts contend should be tougher.
"Adherence to the minimum standards is absolutely not enough," said C. O. Miller, a former head of accident investigations for the National Transportation Safety Board. "There isn't a seasoned airline official I know of who doesn't tell you that."
Mary Schiavo, inspector general of the Transportation Department, who oversees investigations of the F.A.A., wrote an essay in the May 20 issue of Newsweek in which she said she had not flown Valujet "because of its many mishaps." She said the F.A.A. was not monitoring the industry closely enough, adding, "I keep seeing the holes in the safety net -- gaps in regulation and oversight that can produce spectacular cases like Valujet."
In a telephone interview yesterday, Linda Daschle, Deputy Administrator of the F.A.A., criticized Ms. Schiavo. "I am disappointed, to put it mildly, that a high-ranking U.S. Government official has seemed to conclude that a regulatory shortcoming has caused this tragic crash of Valujet," Ms. Daschle said. "We do not have any information to suggest what caused this accident."

HEADLINE: Newspapers Are Reshuffled Across Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH 

DATELINE: TORONTO, May 12

 BODY:
One corporate strategy based on profitability of well-managed small-town newspapers and another based on the higher margins available from electronic media have led to an extraordinary shuffling of assets in the Canadian newspaper industry.
The Thomson Corporation, once Canada's biggest publisher, has sold within the last year 23 small-town dailies to Hollinger Inc., a newer media giant controlled by the flamboyant entrepreneur Conrad M. Black. 
 In letting go of The Moose Jaw Times-Herald, The Corner Brook Western Star and other small papers whose names evoke the spirit of small-town Canada, Thomson is concentrating on publishing more specialized information on science and engineering, medicine and health care, financial services and legal research -- mostly delivered electronically. Re-emphasizing that strategy, Thomson agreed last week to buy Securities Industry Daily, a New York area trade publication, for an undisclosed price and place it in the unit that publishes the American Banker and Bond Buyer newspapers.
Both companies are active publishers in the United States as well. Even after selling 25 American dailies last year, Thomson still publishes 82 small-market papers in the United States. Its 10 remaining daily papers in Canada include its flagship, The Globe and Mail in Toronto. Hollinger's newspapers include The Chicago Sun-Times, The Daily Telegraph in London and The Jerusalem Post.
Thomson's strategy is to shift to income sources that are less affected by swings in the economy. "We've reduced our dependence on conventional advertising," Nigel R. Harrison, Thomson's chief financial officer, said in an interview. "Basically, what we like to do is produce information that people have to have to do their job or get an education." Over the years, advertising has dropped to 15 percent of Thomson's revenue, from 90 percent.
In sharp contrast to the Thomson approach, Hollinger's buying spree has brought it 38 of the 106 dailies in Canada, including all those in the largely rural provinces of Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland.
In addition to its direct holdings, Hollinger holds a 19.4 percent stake in Southam Inc., Canada's biggest-circulation newspaper group, and a 19.9 percent stake in The Financial Post, a financial daily controlled by the Toronto Sun Publishing Corporation.
"It's just two different views on how to build a business," said F. David Radler, Hollinger's president and chief operating officer. "We feel this has been an opportunity to find well-run efficient papers, and at the price we're paying we can get an adequate return."
Mr. Black, Hollinger's strong-minded chairman and chief executive, defined the strategy in the company's 1995 annual report, writing that "carefully acquired and managed newspapers are viable and durably profitable."
"The relative de-glamorization of the industry in the light of technological advances in other media, coupled with some serious misjudgments by former owners in some cases, makes acquisition at low multiples of subsequent earnings and cash flow possible," he wrote.
Some analysts suggest both companies may be right, although the stock market now seems to prefer Thomson over Hollinger. Thomson's shares command a higher price in relation to projected earnings and this year have been more buoyant.
Thomson shares closed Friday at a 52-week high of $22.95 (Canadian) on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Hollinger closed at $11.55, $2 below the level last fall when the company restructured to enhance value for shareholders.
"Thomson should benefit from higher margins in information publishing," says Bob Bek, communications and media analyst for CIBC Wood Gundy. "Newspapering is a tough business, where you have to be as lean as possible to compete."
As in the United States, papers in Canada have been hit by high prices for newsprint, although in recent weeks these have receded. In addition, Canadian advertising has been soft. Linage is expected to drop in 1996 for the seventh consecutive year.
Still, some analysts, like Bill Wolfenden of Deacon Capital Corporation, see the Hollinger strategy as less risky than Thomson's. "Thomson has to pay top dollar for the assets it's getting, which means that everything has to go right for them to pay off," Mr. Wolfenden said.
In February, Thomson agreed to pay $3.4 billion -- a large part of which had to be borrowed -- for the West Publishing Company of Eagan, Minn., a leading provider of legal- research materials, college textbooks and CD-ROM's. Two Canadian rating services, the Montreal-based Canadian Bond Rating Service and the Toronto-based Dominion Bond Rating Service, then lowered their ratings of Thomson's unsecured debentures.
Hollinger, on the other hand, is making much more modest investments. "Hollinger is paying a reasonable price for what it's getting," Mr. Wolfenden said. "It feels these are good franchises, and there are synergies, editorial sharing for example, that can make the franchises even more attractive."
In addition to the Thomson properties, Hollinger late last year acquired Saskatchewan's two biggest newspapers -- The Leader-Post in Regina and The Star Phoenix in Saskatoon -- from the Sifton family, which had dominated the newspaper business on the prairies since the last century.
While both papers were profitable, Hollinger immediately laid off 170 employees, about a quarter of the staff of the two papers. Mr. Black was quoted as saying they were not profitable enough.
In a recent letter to The Globe and Mail, Mr. Black defended the layoffs, comparing The Star Phoenix with his Daily Telegraph in London. He said the Canadian paper employed half the staff to produce a paper with one-twelfth the circulation and a fraction of the quality.
No layoffs have been announced at any of the papers acquired from Thomson. "These papers are already down to the bone," said John Miller, chairman of the journalism school at Toronto's Ryerson Polytechnic University. "Most people doubt they can get much leaner."
Thomson and Hollinger are not alone in restructuring their businesses. Another Canadian media giant, Rogers Communication Inc., recently decided to sell its 62.54 percent stake in Toronto Sun Publishing, barely two years after acquiring it. The Sun chain owns tabloid dailies in Toronto, Ottawa, Edmonton and Calgary and has 60.2 percent of The Financial Post of Toronto. The other 39.8 percent is divided equally between Hollinger and Pearson P.L.C., a British media company that publishes The Financial Times.
Possible suitors include Hollinger, the Power Corporation of Canada in Montreal, which owns Power Broadcasting Inc. and has interests in financial services and energy, and Quebecor Inc., also of Montreal, which owns four dailies and other publications as well as printing and forest product companies.
Ben Dube, an analyst for Credifinance Securities Ltd. of Montreal, said Quebecor had "the best fit: no duplication, no two papers in the same city."
All the reshuffling has focused attention on the growing power of the major chains, which today control 93 percent of the Canadian dailies, compared with 77 percent 15 years ago. Antitrust policies are much less vigorously enforced in Canada than in the United States.
"I think it's terribly important for people to have strong newspapers," Professor Miller said. "I'm not convinced this degree of ownership will produce that."

HEADLINE: So, How Did Gasoline Prices Get This High?

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 10

 BODY:
As president of Suncoast Resources here, Kathy Lehne trucks gasoline around Texas and the surrounding states. She routinely buys from the region's refineries, then pumps the fuel into storage tanks at gas stations, other businesses and schools.
But this spring, instead of fuel, some refiners were giving her excuses. "The supply was tight; they were having problems shipping it up the pipeline," she said. "You heard every reason."
By shopping around, she has been able to find supplies. "Somebody always has it," she said. But, especially as her suppliers prepared to change over to summer gasoline formulas, some let their stocks of winter fuels run nearly dry.
In many cases, prices have risen by 20 cents a gallon, more steeply than crude oil prices. Yet most motorists seem to base where they gas up on habit and convenience rather than on price, so for all their complaining, most Americans do little to change the way they shop for fuel. And that, in turn, puts little pressure on the oil companies to hold down gasoline prices. [Page B6.]
Still, motorists and their elected officials have asked, how did prices get so high, and who is getting the extra cash?
Pushing the prices higher are some abrupt changes in how the industry does business, particularly a sharp reduction in the inventories held at refineries and distribution terminals and the increased number of specially refined gasolines.
"The impact of the change in strategy should not be underestimated," Philip K. Verleger Jr., vice president of Charles River Associates, a Washington consulting firm, told distributors and gas station owners in a speech two weeks ago.
"Up until late 1994 or early 1995, the cardinal rule for terminal managers was never run out," Mr. Verleger said. "The situation today is different. One major keeps a sign in its trading room that says 'KILL.' The goal is not to kill the competition but to 'Keep Inventories Low and Lean.' "
The other strong pressure on prices comes from a new wave of less-polluting, reformulated, oxygenated, seasonal and regional gasolines. This "boutique refining" has tightened supplies while raising the cost of driving to the office or mall.
Not that motorists have more choices: stations don't offer dirtier gas for a nickel a gallon less. It is just that refiners and distributors have to meet shifting local, state and national pollution mandates with various formulas at various locales and times.
"You've got reformulated," said Robert Greco, refining coordinator for the American Petroleum Institute. "You've got low R.V.P. summer gasoline. You've got oxygenated winter gasoline. And you've got conventional gasoline. Within all those you've got distinctions as well. Because different types are required for different places, you can't shift gasoline around. Fundamental changes are being made in the industry that people don't notice unless there's a problem -- like right now."
Comparing this April to last April, to correct for seasonal factors, Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a research firm in Cambridge, Mass., found a 12.3 cent rise in gasoline price, to $1.32, that included 7.5 cents in higher prices for crude oil. Retailing and distribution costs, collected by gas stations and wholesale suppliers, rose 5.7 cents, while refineries took in nearly a cent less. Taxes, accounting for the rest of the cost, have been flat.
While the greatest share of the recent price increases went to the producers of crude oil, gas stations and wholesale distributors are collecting 28 percent more than they did a year ago, Cambridge Energy Research said.
Even now that crude oil prices are slipping, gasoline prices are holding steady. While prices already reflected the higher expense of producing the latest formulas, now they are reflecting the much less predictable costs of distributing these supplies.
Although Big Oil is under Justice Department investigation for price collusion, the sleuths seeking an explanation for higher gasoline prices have been looking in the wrong places. Oil company profits have been rising, but mostly in production, because of the higher prices of crude oil.
Several months ago, oil companies and their traders were actually betting that Iraq and the United Nations would find a way for Iraqi oil to reach the market, with that increased supply pushing down prices. But negotiations have faltered, while rising global demand, limited supplies and, in the United States, a long, cold winter helped propel oil prices higher. Chilly weather forced refineries to keep producing heating oil several weeks later than their normal switch to gasoline, raising prices further.
The nation's capacity for producing gasoline from oil has meanwhile continued to fall. Profit margins on refining have often been so narrow that companies have shut their refineries rather than pay for the improvements needed to raise efficiency and make cleaner fuels. In February, the Tosco Corporation bought the Marcus Hook, Pa., refinery, one of the largest in the Northeast, from British Petroleum and immediately shut it when a union refused to make concessions that, the company said, would justify continued operation and necessary improvements.
The oil companies, trying to fend off the fuel price investigators, are quick to highlight the expenses of environmental rules and regulations. Critics accuse the companies of exaggerating the costs of marketing cleaner gasoline.
"That's a convenient excuse," said Edwin Rothschild, energy policy director for Citizen Action, a public interest group. "But we went through a whole year of reformulated gas and there weren't problems in 1995. The key thing is the depletion of crude oil and gasoline inventories. They depleted their inventories to make more money and to lower their costs."
The Shell Oil Company, the nation's leading gasoline retailer, cut its inventory of refined products, including gasoline, to 23 million barrels from 32 millions at the end of 1994, and its crude-oil inventory to 9 million barrels from 19 million. As a result, Shell added $167 million to net income. Kitty Borah, a spokeswoman for Shell Oil, said that there was nothing sinister about that approach, adding, "My understanding is that most big companies today are doing that."
Oil companies can safely acknowledge profiting from the seemingly impersonal market forces that raise the cost of crude oil, but almost nobody in the industry will confess to widening earnings through higher gasoline prices.
"Our margins have been shrinking," said Roy Strasburger, vice president of Strasburger Enterprises of Temple, Tex., a major fuel wholesaler and the owner of 100 gas stations. He has not been able to raise prices enough to cover his own higher costs, he said.
It is not an argument that wins ready acceptance. "Being in the gasoline business," he said, "doesn't make you popular with your friends."
As usual, the approach of the summer driving season has raised the spread between retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices, and refiners have taken all of that increase, and what is more, a bite out of the margins of gas stations and wholesalers. But the amount taken by gas stations and distributors fell by less than 3 cents from January to April, compared with almost 11 cents in the comparable period a year ago.
The bidding for available fuel supplies became the most furious in California, where prices have risen by more than 25 cents a gallon, to $1.58 in the northern part of the state, just in the last month. As in so many other areas, California is also setting the styles in boutique gasoline.
California has led the nation for a decade in trying to disperse its smog through the use of cleaner fuels. Since February, the state has been phasing in what has been called Carb II gasoline, so different from other fuels that gasoline from any other state cannot serve as a substitute. Because the gasoline is too expensive to sell outside California, suppliers have extra incentives to keep their inventories lean.
"It's a special blend," said Theodore Eck, Amoco's chief economist. "It's like going into Starbucks for coffee. You get all this special stuff but you got to pay for it, more than you charge for regular octane coffee at Amoco."
This year, California has suffered a series of refinery shutdowns after accidents, fires and other mishaps. With no Carb II gasoline available from other states, California's remaining refineries have been free to raise prices, analysts say, while gas stations bid prices higher.
California is only an extreme case. Mr. Verleger, the consultant, told the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers of America that higher, gyrating prices are here to stay. "While I fervently wish this situation would go away, I am here today to tell you it won't," he said.

HEADLINE: Am I Bid Six? Click to Bid Six!;
Airlines Are the Latest to Move to On-Line Auctions

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
For Ernie Altvater, April 30 was a banner day. In an auction at American Airlines' site on the World Wide Web, Mr. Altvater submitted a bid of $475 for two first-class, round-trip tickets from Ontario, Calif., to Hartford. He won, and calculated his savings off the full price: $3,701.
"I was in seventh heaven," he said.
While many companies offer goods or services on line using what are, in effect, electronic billboards or catalogues, the auctions and special promotions that airlines are offering on the Web take digital commerce to the level of a cyberspace bazaar. No two airlines are pursuing exactly the same strategy, but the industry's rush to cash in on the Internet is in full flight. 
 The Internet, the airlines have come to believe, offers a rare opportunity to lower costs and increase revenue. By providing flight information on line, for instance, carriers can reduce calls to their toll-free numbers, and perhaps get by with a smaller telephone reservations staff. If travelers book and buy tickets by computer, the airlines save on commissions to travel agents. And with silent auctions and last-minute fare deals handled through electronic mail, the airlines see a chance to cheaply advertise and sell seats that would otherwise go empty.
The potential benefits are so great -- saving and generating billions of dollars, industry experts predict -- that airlines will find ways to make their Web sites required reading for anyone who travels the skies or the Internet.
"The Internet provided and still provides an incredibly inexpensive way of having a sales office everywhere," said Mark T. Weinberger, manager of marketing communications in the United States for Cathay Pacific Airways, which is based in Hong Kong. He says Cathay Pacific will have gained $325,000 in revenue through auctions on its Web site by the time a third one, which begins this week, is over.
The auction as a means of commerce dates back to ancient barter economics when it was used to exchange commodities like grain, cattle or land. But its primary goal these days -- getting as many competitors as possible vying for a single prize -- is peculiarly suited to the dynamics of the Internet, where microscopically detailed information and pictures can be posted in view of millions of people.
The airlines are only the latest on-line auctioneers. Charities including a Los Angeles pediatric AIDS clinic were beneficiaries of on-line auctions last summer. Used-car dealers in the United States and Japan are buying big lots of automobiles on the Internet. And dozens of other World Wide Web sites auction off coins, stamps, sports memorabilia, antiques and, most frequently, computerware.
"The emotion in an on-line auction is there, and it's terribly important," said Jonathan Hubbard, president of Hobby Markets Online (http:// www.numismatists.com), of San Francisco, whose rare-coin auction has been selling about $30,000 in coins a week since starting in November. "Our collectors are very passionate about their hobby, and the fact that there is a time limit on each sale increases the sense of excitement."
Julius Maldutis, an airline analyst at Salomon Brothers, predicted that the airlines' growing use of the Internet would produce the third revolutionary change in the industry, comparable to the impact of jet aircraft in the late 50's and early 60's, and airline deregulation in 1978.
Auctions, he said, are but one example of how airlines will find ways to sell the seats that regularly go unfilled -- on average, about a third of all seats.
"It is now quite clear that the U.S. airline industry is in the early stages of a far-reaching structural change," he said. "And consumers are going to benefit tremendously."
Just two weeks ago, American Airlines, a unit of the AMR Corporation, started auctions (http:// www2.amrcorp.com/cgi-bin/auction/user.cgi), and has already held several. Each ran for 24 or 48 hours, with the current high bid posted periodically during each round.
American has also started sending, by electronic mail, last-minute deals each Wednesday with deep discounts for travel that weekend to anyone in the country who requests the free service at its Web site (http://www2.amrcorp.com/cgi-bin/aans). That idea evolved from fare specials it offered on a local cable station outside Dallas every Wednesday for flights the following weekend. The airline found that people watched at home, then told colleagues at work by electronic mail.
"We said, 'We could do that,' " said John Samuel, American's managing director of distribution planning.
The major shareholders in Cathay Pacific, which offers flights to Hong Kong from Los Angeles and, starting in July, from New York, are Swire Pacific Ltd. and the Hong Kong arm of Citic, China's biggest overseas investment company. The airline set up its Web site last year (http:// www.cathay-usa.com), promising visitors deals not available elsewhere.
To build a data base of consumers, Cathay Pacific conducted promotions, including contests for free tickets to Hong Kong; it also gave away a single prize of one million frequent-flier miles. Last fall, as business travel slowed before Thanksgiving week, Mr. Weinberger decided to auction many seats that seemed certain to remain unsold.
In that first auction, Cathay Pacific required a minimum bid of $25 and guaranteed business-class, round-trip tickets to the top 50 bidders, who offered an average $1,500, just over half the published full fares. The auction earned the airline about $75,000.
For its second auction, held in March, Cathay Pacific requested bids of frequent-flier mileage for 100 round-trip first-class tickets. Normally, travelers cash in 125,000 miles for such a ticket; Cathay Pacific received bids ranging from 60,000 miles to 118,000 miles. A third auction starts on Wednesday, when the airline plans to accept bids for 387 seats -- a Boeing 747's worth, including first, business and coach classes -- to promote the start of its New York-Hong Kong flights. Mr. Weinberger estimated the auction would generate $250,000 in revenue.
Industry executives acknowledge the potential downside of expanding auctions and last-minute fare deals: Some passengers who would be willing to pay higher fares will instead wait for cheaper fares, thereby diluting the average fare paid.
But Mr. Maldutis of Salomon Brothers forecast that the rise in traffic would more than offset lower average fares. If all major United States airlines had adopted an auction system last year, he said, the industry's 1995 earnings could have more than tripled, to $8.3 billion.
There may be an added benefit to consumers. With computer reservations systems, airlines now instantly signal their fares to each other, and competitors almost always match them. But with the Internet, carriers will be less likely to learn of rivals' discounts as quickly. Knowing that cutting prices may bring in a bigger share of bargain-hunting passengers, discounts may be that much deeper, Mr. Maldutis said.
Not all the airlines are convinced that developing the auction market is the best strategy for now.
United Airlines, a unit of the UAL Corporation, and USAir, for example, have decided to invest time and money in software that provides customers with flight information for all airlines, as well as the ability to book tickets, hotel rooms and rental cars. USAir and United have each issued software to more than 50,000 customers, and the airlines are developing similar programs for corporations. The companies would be able to customize software for their employees so they book flights in ways that stay within company policy -- using special deals negotiated with certain airlines, for instance.
Travel agencies are offering similar services at their Web sites. At American Express's site on the Internet (http://www.americanexpress.com/travel), for instance, travelers can book airline tickets and shop for vacation packages with prices that American Express guarantees are the lowest available.
Such programs, which let customers act as their own travel agents, may generate less publicity than the silent auctions, but industry executives say they are still effective.
"We're trying to improve the relationship with our best customers," said Rita Cuddihy, USAir's vice president for marketing and distribution planning. "They are saying we understand their needs."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. to Press Missile Defense As Clinton Test

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans, eager to turn defense policy into a major issue in the Presidential campaign, are preparing to present President Clinton with legislation that they will portray as a test of his commitment to national military readiness.
The first test is to come in the next few weeks as the full House and Senate debate legislation sponsored by Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee, that will force the United States to spend billions of dollars on the deployment of a national missile defense system by 2003. 
 The bill, which revives the national debate over the anti-missile technology popularly known as Star Wars, is expected to be passed by both the House and Senate, setting the stage for a veto by Mr. Clinton.
Called the Defend America Act, the bill is sponsored in the House by Speaker Newt Gingrich and is to come up for a vote in the full House this week, along with the $267 billion military authorization bill.
Mr. Clinton may veto the authorization bill if it retains provisions requiring the Pentagon to spend $13 billion more than it requested. Votes in the Senate on the missile defense bill and its version of the authorization bill are expected shortly.
Although polls suggest that American voters are far more concerned with the economy than with military policy, especially with the cold war a fading memory, Mr. Dole and other Republican leaders are eager to persuade voters that the Clinton Administration has been lax on preparedness and that a second Clinton term could leave Americans vulnerable to attack from missiles fired by countries like North Korea and Libya.
In recent speeches on the campaign trail, Mr. Dole has argued that Mr. Clinton's lack of support for a missile defense system was proof of his weakness on issues of military and foreign policy.
"The fact is that we can't destroy a single missile," Mr. Dole said in a speech last month. "That's not because America is lacking the technical know-how. It's because America is lacking the Presidential leadership to get it done."
In a speech last week, he called for the creation of a program in which the United States would work with Japan and South Korea on a missile defense effort to protect all three countries. "Missile defense is essential to our allies' security," he said.
Only Russia and China have nuclear-armed ballistic missiles that can reach the United States. Pentagon officials say it will be at least a decade before other, smaller nations develop missiles able to reach the continental United States, although they acknowledge that North Korea may be only a few years away from deploying a ballistic missile that can hit parts of Alaska and Hawaii.
Senator Dole has focused on the threat from North Korea, which he described last week as "armed to the teeth" and "determined to develop weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them."
The Administration estimates the cost of the missile defense system, which would depend on laser-equipped satellites and ground-based rockets, at more than $20 billion.
The Administration has proposed that instead of moving immediately to deploy a missile defense system, the Pentagon should continue to study missile defense technology for three more years and then decide on whether deployment is needed.
Administration officials say their plan would allow a system to be built in time to deal with a potential threat from North Korea or other countries and allow the United State to choose the best possible system.
"The Dole-Gingrich bill says we must choose a system now and begin deploying it in three years, independent of how our threat assessment evolves," Defense Secretary William J. Perry said in a recent speech. "Our plan says, 'Let's develop the system, then assess the threat in three years, and make our deployment decision accordingly.' "
Mr. Perry said the Dole bill would cripple the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and endanger other arms control agreements with Russia that call for the dismantling of thousands of nuclear warheads.
Moreover, Administration officials say the Republicans should be far more concerned about the possibility of rogue nations or terrorist groups slipping weapons of mass destruction into the United States through less exotic means than a missile.
"A terrorist with a little technical know-how and 20 pounds of smuggled plutonium could make a bomb powerful enough to destroy a city," said a Pentagon official. "That's what we should be worried about."
Mr. Clinton vetoed the entire military authorization bill last year when it mandated a missile defense system. He signed a later version of the bill that removed the provision. Republicans offered the missile plan in a separate bill this year, hoping to draw more attention to the issue.
The controversy harkens back to the debate in the 1980's over the Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative, popularly known as Star Wars. The United States spent tens of billions of dollars on that research to develop a system that was never deployed to defend against incoming nuclear-armed missiles. But the research from that earlier effort could be incorporated in the missile defense system proposed in the new bill.
Mr. Dole has tried repeatedly to interject military issues into the Presidential campaign. In recent campaign appearances, he has called on President Clinton to expand the production line for B-2 bombers, insisting that the planned fleet of 21 will not meet military needs.
The Administration rejected the proposal, noting that senior officials of the Air Force say it does not need more of the bombers, which cost more than $500 million each. The bombers are built in California, where Mr. Clinton enjoys a big lead over Mr. Dole in polls of prospective voters.

Fast Track for Hospital Bill

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
State Senator Donald T. DiFrancesco said he planned to put the latest measure to end a five-month stalemate on hospital care for the uninsured directly before the Senate on Thursday without going through the committee process. "We have explored every possible option," Senator DiFrancesco said last Tuesday to explain his plan. The measure was approved last Monday by the Assembly; its prospects in the Senate are uncertain. The bill would continue to rely heavily on unemployment payroll taxes to subsidize charity care, distributing $310 million to hospitals this year and $300 million next year.

HEADLINE: A Performance Shaped by Life

BYLINE: By DINITIA SMITH 

 BODY:
Since August Wilson's "Seven Guitars" opened on Broadway in late March, Ruben Santiago-Hudson has been on an emotional roller coaster.
First came the rave reviews for his portrayal of Canewell. (Margo Jefferson, in The New York Times, called him "brilliant"; John Simon, in New York magazine, called him "amazing.") On April 2, six days into the play's run, Mr. Santiago-Hudson's wife, Jeannie Brittan, gave birth to twins. (He missed only one performance.) On April 27, his father died. And last Monday, Mr. Santiago-Hudson was nominated for a Tony as best featured actor in a play. 
 "I have the cards stacked in my favor," he said the other day, "because now I have another person lobbying for me upstairs."
"Seven Guitars" is the sixth in Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays on black life in America to be performed in New York. It takes place in Pittsburgh in 1948 and centers on the return of Floyd, played by Keith David, on the brink of success as a recording star after spending time in prison. Mr. Santiago-Hudson's Canewell, a portly, harmonica-playing, amateur philosopher, is a kind of country counterpoint to the ambitious, urban Floyd.
In Canewell resides all the poetry, the optimism, the love of language and storytelling intrinsic to the Southern black rural experience. He delivers a long homily on the roosters of various states: "The Alabama rooster! See, he fall in love with the way he sound and wanna crow about it every time the notion strike him. Best thing you can do is make a stew out of him!"
These are the kinds of lines that beg an actor to overdo them. But Mr. Santiago-Hudson holds himself in, reciting the words with a gravity that reveals their poetry.
"I don't try to emphasize," the 39-year-old actor said recently at his home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. "I'm not working for the laugh, I'm working for the clarity of the line."
Mr. Santiago-Hudson "just wears Canewell," said Mr. Wilson. "He doesn't push him. He just settles in. Canewell is Ruben Santiago-Hudson. It's wonderful that the two of them met."
In many ways, Mr. Santiago-Hudson's own life incorporates the contradictions of the black diaspora that Mr. Wilson explores in his work. Mr. Santiago-Hudson grew up in Lackawanna, N.Y., a steel-mill town near Buffalo, but he was surrounded by the rhythms of speech, the traditions, brought by blacks from the rural South.
His father, Ruben Santiago, was Puerto Rican, a railroad worker; his mother, Alean Hudson, was a black from Clairton, Pa. "My mother was young and pretty and flighty," he said. Young Ruben was a year and a half old, living with his mother in a boarding house, he said, when the landlady discovered him left alone in front of the television.
The landlady was Rachel Crosby, originally from Virginia, still known as Nanny in the community, and she took him in. "My father stayed in my life," he said. "He would visit me. I get my gentleness from my dad."
Ms. Crosby had lost a baby in infancy, and she took in many children and strangers. "My Nanny used to bring people up from Mississippi," Mr. Santiago-Hudson said, "blues guys boasting of killing people and getting away with it. People telling stories of seeing 'haints,' dead people, running down the road."
When he was 5, Mr. Santiago-Hudson was returned to his mother's care. But she had problems with drugs, he said, and he went back to Nanny.
Ms. Crosby shared young Ruben's upbringing with a couple, Mattie Overton, who came from Alabama, and her husband, Adolph, whom he called Mom and Pop. "All the little white kids would go home to their mama and daddy," he recalled. "Mom and Pop Overton showed me a real family structure."
Mr. Santiago-Hudson said he knew in grade school he wanted to be an actor, when he played Huck Finn in a play of "Tom Sawyer," "because I was the only one who could read the part."
"I wanted people to be in awe of me," he said.
At Lackawanna High School, to which he was bused, he was one of 200 blacks in a school of 1,500 whites, welcomed in the morning, by sneers and racial epithets, he said. His grades fell.
Still, he went to the State University at Binghamton as part of a program for "educationally and economically disadvantaged students," he said, and studied theater. He wanted to play classic roles, but his experience was typical of the generation of black American actors trying to break through the color barrier in the 70's.
"People would say: 'How can you do Shakespeare? You're from the ghetto.' " One white professor, he said, "told me I could never really do classical theater because my lips were too big, and they would get in the way of clarity and making the words beautiful."
When he was 18, Mr. Santiago-Hudson fathered a son, Broderick. The next year, he had another son, Ruben 3d, by another woman. He did not marry their mothers.
He studied for his master's degree at Wayne State University in Detroit, drawn by its program in classical drama. But initially he was denied major roles in college productions. "I was always the spear-toting, diaper-wearing, queen-fanning, rug-bearing, servant bystander," he said, until the day when he told his professors, "I'm not carrying no more spear!" He played Bigger Thomas in a successful run of "Native Son" and was finally allowed to play Caius in "The Merry Wives of Windsor."
When he came to New York in 1983, he was known as Ruben Santiago. He tried to get a part at the Puerto Rican Traveling Theater and was asked if he spoke Spanish. (He does not.) When he wanted to work at the Negro Ensemble Company, "they laughed and said, 'We don't have Puerto Ricans,' " he said. So he added his mother's name, Hudson, and eventually won a part in "A Soldier's Play" at the Ensemble Company.
For three years, from 1990 to 1993, he was Capt. Billy Cooper, a police officer on the television soap opera "Another World." The character was basically just "a utility man," he said, similar to a piece of furniture. Like many black characters of the time, Captain Cooper never got the girl.
In 1992, Mr. Santiago-Hudson made his Broadway debut as Buddy Bolden, the great cornet player, in "Jelly's Last Jam." "The role legitimized me," he said. Buddy Bolden is a figure who seems to haunt Mr. Santiago-Hudson's work. In "Seven Guitars," the character of the mad seer Hedley is waiting for the ghost of Buddy Bolden to deliver money to him.
Mr. Santiago-Hudson has played Lucio in "Measure for Measure," in Shakespeare in the Park, and Jeff Bridges's best friend in the movie "Blown Away."
"The best-friend role," he said, "always that's a safe place to put the black man. You don't have to worry about him making love to your wife, or bringing him home to dinner."
These days, Mr. Santiago-Hudson said, he has found emotional stability in his marriage to Ms. Brittan, a singer and actress. He has also grown close to his mother, who lives in Pittsburgh and is in poor health. "She's like a sister to me," he said.
It was from his mother, he said, that he borrowed Canewell's "street savvy, the Pittsburgh flavor in his voice."
"August and I have the same music in our ears," he said.

HEADLINE: Next Wave of Electric Cars: Hybrids

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 12

 BODY:
A motley collection of electric and hybrid vehicles will buzz, whirr and hum their way over 64 miles from Chesapeake to Annapolis in Maryland on Tuesday, about 50 in all, depending on how many have run out of juice, shorted out a component or otherwise broken down along the way in the eighth American Tour de Sol race, which began in New York City and will end here on Thursday.
The cars in the race are better than they ever have been. For many of the vehicles, the minimum demand of the race, up to 71.4 miles a day over a mixed city, suburban and interstate route, is hardly a challenge. The leading entry hopes to go 300 miles on a single charge, farther than many conventional cars go on a tank of gas. 
 By coincidence, the competitors in the annual race, a seven-day road rally for electric and hybrid vehicles, are heading for a finish line between the Capitol and the White House as President Clinton and Congress are maneuvering about whether to cut the gasoline tax by 4.3 cents a gallon. The best of the electrics have an energy cost of less than 2 cents a mile, compared with about 5 cents a mile for a typical car at current gas prices.
Electric cars have seemed for years to be over the horizon, or maybe the rainbow. Now they are, in fact, around the corner. General Motors will begin leasing a zippy two-seater electric, the EV1, through its Saturn dealerships in California and Arizona later this year. Chrysler will market the Epic, a five-passenger minivan based on the Plymouth Voyager and Dodge Caravan, and Ford will market an electric version of the Explorer, converted by an independent contractor.
Toyota announced last month that it would sell an electric sport-utility vehicle in the second half of 1997, and Honda said it would lease an electric four-passenger car in the spring of 1997 that like G.M.'s entry, is built from the ground up, not adapted from a gasoline design.
Behind the first wave of mass-manufactured electrics are models with far better batteries -- promised soon by Japanese manufacturers. Beyond that is a second wave of technology, demonstrated in force in the Tour de Sol this year: hybrids, combining the best features of electrics and internal combustion engines. No major company has announced a plan to sell one commercially, but engineers say they could open up a new realm of choices for consumers who want fuel economy, environmental satisfaction or maybe even old-fashioned car virtues like faster acceleration and better handling.
The road that electric car development has taken to get to this point has had its share of political potholes.
For years, electric car research had been pushed by California, which had planned since the early 90's to require that 2 percent of the cars sold in that state in the 1998 model year produce "zero emissions," which would mean electric cars. New York and Massachusetts adopted the same rules. But in March, under heavy lobbying from the auto and oil industries, California backed off, settling instead for an expanded pilot program.
But as the auto industry's lobbyists have been fighting off the requirement, its engineers have been putting prototypes on the roads. Whether electric cars can be priced competitively has still to be demonstrated, but technological competition from amateurs and from start-up companies has made it hard for the Big Three to claim that they are being asked for the impossible.
One major change in this year's race is that not all the entrants are purely electric. Many of the cars, covered with bold stickers advertising university and high school teams and corporate sponsors, are hybrids that have small internal combustion engines, some borrowed from motorcycles and others from even less likely sources. In some hybrids, the engines turn the wheels directly; in others, they charge the batteries or make current for electric motors. In either case, they provide extra horsepower for acceleration and hills, allowing them to perform like sports cars.
More and more engineers with experience in hybrids -- including some at Ford, G.M. and Chrysler -- argue that hybrid vehicles can include the strengths of both electric and internal combustion drives. Like an electric, a hybrid can be built to use no energy at idle and to re-capture energy when it decelerates, by letting the car's momentum turn the wheels, which drive the motors, briefly turning them into generators that produce a current to flow into the battery. As a result, hybrids can get 40 or 50 miles for the equivalent of a gallon of gasoline or even more.
And hybrids can use liquid or gaseous fuels that pack a large amount of energy into a small package, as conventional cars do. In addition, marrying the two -- made easier in recent years by advances in power electronic circuitry, the circuitry that allows large amounts of electric power to be handled precisely -- allows the internal combustion engine to keep running in a steady, narrow range where it gets the most efficiency and runs the cleanest.
It also permits a smaller internal combustion engine because it no longer has to perform solo in the hardest job: accelerating thousands of pounds of mass from a standstill to highway speeds in a few seconds. A hybrid can get acceleration help from an electric motor.
The Pentagon is a big backer of hybrid research and development because battlefield vehicles running on electricity would be hard for an enemy to hear or to find with heat-seeking weapons. If those vehicles carried diesel engines to recharge the batteries, their range could be very long, and less fuel would have to be delivered to the battle zone.
Although conventional cars meet consumers' needs and expectations, they contribute heavily to air pollution, getting, on average, 27.5 miles per gallon, as optimistically measured by the Environmental Protection Agency.
A major cooperative research project between the Big Three auto makers and the Federal Government, the Partnership for the Next Generation Vehicle, seeks to do the same work more cleanly, with three times the fuel efficiency. That will require something different.
"It seems like every major auto manufacturer has come to the conclusion that if we're able to market a vehicle that will meet what consumers want from their vehicles -- in comfort level, performance, range and things like that -- the only way you're going to be able to do that is with a hybrid," said Robert P. Larsen, manager of the technology engineering section at the Argonne National Laboratory's Center for Transportation Research, part of the Department of Energy. In related contracts, some of which predate the partnership, Ford, G.M. and Chrysler are each scheduled to deliver hybrids to the Energy Department in about two years.
One of the most important elements of an electric car, or a hybrid, is the battery. In the electric cars scheduled to come to market soon, Toyota and Honda plan to use nickel metal-hydride batteries, the kind that now dominate the laptop computer market. Most of the others are planning to use lead-acid batteries, but they have shown strong interest in nickel metal-hydride or other advanced technologies. Experts assume that before electric cars become popular, they will have batteries that store far more watts per kilogram of battery weight than lead-acid batteries can.
For the hybrids, other major questions remaining to be solved include how to yoke together electric and internal combustion systems.
One method is the series hybrid, like the University of Texas in El Paso's entry in the Tour de Sol, the HY!BRID, which has a Dodge Neon body with a 150-kilowatt (200-horsepower) electric motor and an old engine from a Geo converted to run on natural gas at a constant 3,000 revolutions per minute.
Prof. Carroll Johnson, the team's faculty adviser, sees the vehicle as a prototype for buses, which start and stop frequently and could benefit from having electric motors to capture the energy in stopping and to save wear and tear on the brakes, a major expense in heavy vehicles. A hybrid bus, he said, could do without its 3,000-pound diesel engine and run instead on two 100-pound electric motors and an engine like those in much smaller vehicles, like three-quarter-ton pickups, which weigh about 800 pounds. The hybrid would need a 400-pound generator, but it would not need a transmission.
But Prof. Michael R. Seal, adviser to the team from Western Washington University, in Bellingham, said that people who started by building a series hybrid usually tried a parallel hybrid next, like the ones his team is entering. In a parallel hybrid, the internal combustion engine and the electric motor pull together when the driver pushes down hard on the accelerator, but in the series hybrid, he pointed out, the engine runs independently of the driver, according to how the vehicle's control unit decides it should run.
"It's a most unpleasant thing," Professor Seal said. "We're not used to engines screaming away wide open, particularly when we're sitting at a stoplight, and that will happen because it's got to catch up from its last acceleration."
Chrysler, which has donated car bodies and travel expenses for nine hybrid teams, is showing off one design of its own, although it is not far enough along to run on public roads. Chrysler's Dodge Intrepid ESX carries batteries, a control unit and two 100-horsepower electric motors under the hood, with a 75-horsepower, 3-cylinder diesel engine in the rear. The batteries are lead-acid, but instead of the flat plates used in conventional car batteries, these have been wound into spirals with much greater surface area.
A conventional lead-acid battery is a little like a jug of wine; it may hold a lot but its narrow neck means that it can deliver what it has only slowly. The spiral battery is more like a peanut-butter jar; the volume is small but it can be filled or emptied quickly, which is exactly the load-leveling job that is required for fast starts or to accept current back from the motors in deceleration. Engineers refer to the quantity of electricity stored per kilogram of battery as the energy density; the speed of delivery is called the power density.
The relatively small diesel runs between 2,000 and 2,600 revolutions per minute, its "sweet spot" where it gets the best fuel efficiency, and therefore has good energy density. But Chrysler and others are also looking into fuel cells, devices that make current by combining hydrogen carried on board with oxygen from the air. These have poor power density, working well only at a steady state. That makes them unsuitable to run a car alone, but they have excellent energy density. To balance that weakness, several companies are working on flywheels, which could be spun up quickly to capture the excess energy during deceleration or quickly tapped for their mechanical energy.
But driving the ESX is a bit odd. As Professor Seal predicts, the car moves on electricity when the driver presses the accelerator pedal, but the diesel starts up when it wants to, which can be disconcerting.
Among the pure electrics in the Tour de Sol, the favorite for the distance prize -- and perhaps the efficiency prize, too -- is the Sunrise, a four-passenger sedan with an all-composite body designed around its nickel metal-hydride batteries, built by the Solectria Corporation of Arlington, Mass. Last year, it set a record at 238 miles, but this year, it has improved batteries and Solectria's president, James D. Worden, is hoping for 300. Before the Sunrise, which Solectria built with grants from the Pentagon and other government and private sources, Mr. Worden also set the distance record in 1993, with a converted Geo Metro that went 214 miles.
According to Solectria, interest in electric cars is quickening because of the plans by G.M., Ford and Chrysler. Solectria says that it has sold 215 vehicles since 1991 -- converted Geo Metro's or Chevy S-10 pickups -- but that it might sell 100 this year alone. A spokesman, Mark L. Dockser, said that "the market has become more real" because of the interest by the Big Three auto makers.
Solectria would like to sell the Sunrise and says it could do so for $25,000 each if it could sell 20,000 a year. But at least for the near future, the company is a tiny converter, not a mass manufacturer. Still, advocates say that the Tour de Sol leads by example.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Amid More Rate Talk, Dollar Is Up vs. Mark and Down vs. Yen

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
The dollar fell against the yen yesterday on concern that Japan would raise interest rates in coming months, but it rose against the mark on the view that interest rates in Germany were headed lower.
"We are now seeing a divergence of the German and Japanese economies, and that is causing a divergence in the dollar's path against the mark and yen," said Gary Sakamoto, currency salesman at National Australia Bank in New York. 
 Higher Japanese interest rates may lure investors to Japanese instruments, helping the yen. Higher rates would also reduce investors' incentive to borrow in yen to buy securities in the United States and elsewhere, exchanging yen for other currencies to do so.
In New York late yesterday, the dollar fell to 104.98 yen from 105.45 yen on Friday. The dollar rose to 1.5333 German marks from 1.5280 marks. The British pound traded at $1.5140, down from $1.5205.
Some analysts expect Japan's central bank to raise interest rates to pre-empt inflation as the economy begins to show signs of renewed strength. The Japanese economy grew at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter. "The Bank of Japan has to watch out for inflation because we are seeing some growth and recovery in the economy," said Olev Trygg, treasurer for foreign exchange at Swedbank.
Those concerns were heightened after The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that people familiar with the central bank's deliberations said it could raise rates as soon as the first week of June.
The German economy, by contrast, may need further stimulation in the form of lower interest rates, some analysts said. "People expect a series of German rate cuts over the next three to six months," according to Mr. Sakamoto of National Australia Bank.
Germany's output shrank in the fourth quarter and probably contracted again in the first, most private and government forecasters say. That could prompt the central bank there to lower its 14-day securities rate, known in the trade as the repo rate, to encourage growth.
"There is a good chance they'll start cutting the repo rate this week," said Karl Halligan, strategic currency trader at CIC Bank New York.
The Germans reduced their key interest rates, the discount and Lombard rates, by half a percentage point each on April 18.

HEADLINE: Corporate Secrets

BYLINE: By David Linowes; David Linowes, a professor of political economy and public policy at the University of Illinois, was chairman of the United States Privacy Protection Commission 1975 to 1977.

 BODY:
Should a company secretly gather personal information about its employees -- including their credit history, what clubs they belong to and their family life? Of course not, but it happens frequently.
A newly released University of Illinois survey of 84 Fortune 500 companies found that 75 percent collected such background information. More than one-third did not tell employees how such information was used -- or that they even collected it. But 70 percent of the companies released the files to credit companies. 
 Much of the information came from outside investigators: 67 percent of the companies hired them. Some investigators use surreptitious means when data are not available legally or ethically. Some have illegally impersonated physicians, welfare case workers and Internal Revenue Service agents.
What can employees do? Not much. They have no power to demand records, to make sure that false reports are corrected -- or even to find out if their employers are collecting outside information.
In 1977, the United States Privacy Protection Commission recommended to Congress that employees be given access to their records and that companies be forbidden to ask employees questions about their family relationships, recreational habits, membership in social groups and other matters unrelated to job performance.
The commission, at the behest of industry, recommended that companies be allowed to follow its guidelines voluntarily. But 19 years later, it is clear that Congress should turn the commission's suggestions into law.
Employers need to keep personnel files and should be allowed to ask for information about criminal histories, drug use and problems in the workplace. But they should tell employees what their files are used for, how the information is collected and if the files are shared with other corporations. A worker must be given the right to see his files and seek correction of errors.
Laws to protect workers' privacy are the norm in industrialized nations. Why are American workers kept in the dark?

HEADLINE: Wasteful Criminal Justice

 BODY:
Gov. George Pataki says he is tough on crime and economically conservative. But a big part of his law-and-order program for New York State is not fiscally responsible. He proposes to continue Mario Cuomo's ruinously expensive prison expansion program without seriously testing more cost-effective alternatives.
Mr. Pataki, who has eliminated parole for repeat violent offenders, now wants to do the same for first-time violent felons, while almost doubling some minimum sentences. His criminal justice expert, Paul Shechtman, estimates the state will need up to 9,000 new prison beds to handle the expanded population. As a result, Mr. Pataki has proposed spending nearly $500 million for new jails. 
 New York State presently houses about 70,000 criminals at a cost of nearly $25,000 a year per inmate. The population doubled during the Cuomo administration, and Mr. Cuomo built dozens of new prisons to accommodate the flood of new inmates. Today's schoolchildren will be paying off that debt long into the next century.
Spending $25,000 to keep a dangerous felon off the streets is money well invested. But nearly half the men and women in the state's prisons are nonviolent offenders, mainly street-level drug dealers. They must be punished for their crimes. But their punishment should be targeted at rehabilitation and be as inexpensive as possible.
When Mr. Pataki began his crackdown on violent crime last year, he promised that it would be coupled with programs to get nonviolent inmates out of the prisons and into drug treatment programs. But the state's approach is far too narrow, relying heavily on one short-term program in an upstate institution.
If the state wants to keep violent criminals in prison longer, it must also clarify what a violent crime is. Right now, for instance, an unarmed burglar who breaks into a house when no one is at home is classified as a violent offender. Discovering that one's house has been rifled is indeed traumatic, but it is not the same as being held up at knifepoint.
Ideally, the Legislature should shelve this year's sentencing bill and challenge Mr. Pataki to come up with a cost-neutral plan that combines tighter sentences for dangerous felons with more innovative and inexpensive ways to punish nonviolent criminals. But the Legislature has not been a strong voice for reason when it comes to criminal justice.
The Republican Senate, for instance, is not happy with one sensible aspect of the Pataki plan that would allow nonviolent offenders time off their minimum sentences for good behavior and efforts at rehabilitation. The Democratic Assembly, while less enthusiastic about prison-building, is leery of being branded soft on crime during an election year.
If the Legislature itself cannot act responsibly, it should at least adopt the suggestion of Assemblyman Daniel Feldman of Brooklyn, the Corrections Committee chairman. Mr. Feldman proposes that bonds for any future prison construction program be put up for vote in a state referendum. Financially, he is on solid ground. The State Constitution requires that new bonding programs supported by general tax revenue be ratified by the voters. Under Governor Cuomo, the state used a loophole that made the interest on the debt higher but avoided the referendum requirement.
If state residents are going to have to go into debt to pay for still more prison building, they have a right to have a say in the matter. Supporters of more prisons should have to explain why the state cannot find more cost-effective ways to meet its crime-control goals.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
A Bourgeoisie Blooms And Goes Shopping

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZWARSAW 

 BODY:
In the last two years, Piotr and Danuta Jentes, Polish 30-somethings, have bought a second car and splurged on a $3,000 wind surfer. Owners of a small business, they go to a private doctor, send their youngest child to a private day-care center and spend a lot of money fixing up their home. And in rapidly Westernizing Poland, they are no longer a rarity.
For the first time, after the false hopes and smashed expectations that followed the collapse of Communism in 1989, market researchers and economists say they are seeing the emergence of a Polish middle class. Sometimes dubbed "puppies," these Polish yuppies are buying consumer goods like cars and refrigerators that Americans take for granted but that not so long ago were the preserve of the Communist apparatchiks. And they are showing a sophistication about their new-found buying power that economists say bodes well for the country -- and for the Western companies that have made Poland a key base of investment in the former Communist bloc. 
 In a population of nearly 40 million, by far the largest in Central Europe, the size of the new Polish middle class is a matter of debate. But numerous indicators, experts say, verify its vitality:
*Car sales were up 40 percent in the first three months of this year. More significantly, imported four-door Opels and Renaults instead of two-door Polish-made Fiat putt-putts made the big gains.
*Last year, the volume of car loans also grew by 40 percent, albeit from almost nothing. But it is the change in the mind-set of Poles, who are accustomed to paying for everything in cash, that the growing financial-service sector finds so reassuring. GE Capital and Ford Credit, two big American providers of financing for cars, opened operations in Poland last year.
*Poland's first mutual-fund company, Pioneer First Polish Trust, weathered the 1994 Warsaw stock market crash and currently maintains 256,000 active accounts. Though that is down from a high of 530,000 in the heady early years of the stock market, the viability of Pioneer -- it recently added two retirement funds -- is considered an important manifestation of the middle class's durability.
*Deposits at savings banks grew by 14 percent last year, according to McKinsey & Company, the American management-consulting firm. This suggests that Poles, who are notorious for stashing savings under the mattress, have acquired more faith in their banks.
*The economy grew by a stunning 7 percent last year, its fifth straight year of expansion and the fastest pace of any European country. Inflation-adjusted incomes rose by 5.3 percent, nearly triple the 1.9 percent gain in 1994.
*Economists estimate the number of private businesses that employ more than five people at more than one million.
"The middle class has arrived and it's growing," said Jerzy Kozinski, the marketing manager in Poland for General Motors, which plans to open a factory in southern Poland in 1998, which will eventually have the capacity to assemble 100,000 cars a year. "People's habits are changing. They don't believe you have to have cash to buy. They know about credit and that with inflation dropping, interest rates are dropping."
Mr. Kozinski estimated that 10 to 15 percent of the Polish population, or about six million people, belonged to the middle class by a strict definition of income, which he placed at $800 to $1,600 a month for a household of four with two working parents. (The average Pole earns $300 a month). But, he added, "If we define the middle class as an attitude, the figure is higher -- more than 20 percent" and growing.
Its most visible members are small-business owners, employees of Western-owned companies and, increasingly, professionals in Polish companies, which have raised salaries to fend off poachers. They are all starting out on the road of fulfilling dreams that many Western Europeans first began harboring in the 1950's: owning their own home or apartment, buying a better or second car, ensuring a good education for their children, and taking an annual vacation abroad, especially to ski in Austria, France or Italy.
Market researchers say Poland is developing the biggest and most stable middle class of any country in the former Soviet bloc. The Czech Republic and Hungary have prosperous, though much smaller, populations, but the wealth is centered in their capitals, Prague and Budapest. Romania, Bulgaria, Ukraine and Albania are all struggling to cast off the old command-economy mentality and are years away from developing a meaningful middle class. And Russia itself seems helplessly mired in corruption and political instability.
In contrast, bourgeois habits are taking deep root in all sectors of Polish society. Consumer surveys show that most Polish households own the Western basics of a color television set, a washing machine and a videocassette recorder. Almost half own a car. And while only 12 percent own personal computers, Optimus, a Polish manufacturer that claims 51 percent of the Polish market with sales last year of 134,000 desktop and laptop computers, says it expects sales by all companies to increase by 50 percent this year.
Poles are also showing the middle-class penchant for ample living space. Apartments built last year had an average size of 966 square feet, 148 square feet more than those constructed in 1989. And Ikea, the giant Swedish furniture retailer, says more Poles are making large investments to make that space more livable. "It still takes time for the customer to save money for a $1,000 kitchen," said Jan Musiolik, the manager of Ikea's four stores in Poland. "But we are beginning to see people come in and ask for a kitchen design for their apartments."
Demand for Avon Products Inc.'s cosmetics and body-care products is so strong that the American company is building its own factory in Poland. Susan J. Kropf, Avon's president of Central and Eastern Europe operations, says that she sees more and more videocassette recorders, compact disk players and cellular phones in Polish homes when she visits them with Avon sales representatives.
In the last 18 months, she said: "I've seen a change. I notice what they're reading and watching. They're reading Cosmopolitan magazine and they're watching old television series like "Dallas," and those things are leading indicators to me of what they want." As a market, Ms. Kropf added, "Poland is unbelievable." Avon sales rose 73 percent last year to $9.5 million.
Alicja Malecka returned to her native Poland in 1992 from a career in international finance in the United States to start Pioneer, the mutual fund company, because she knew it would not take long to revive her compatriots' bourgeois instincts, which had been stifled but not extinguished under Communism.
"You have a cultural disposition in Poland to be middle class," said Mrs. Malecka, who left southern Poland in 1968 for New York. "Everyone I knew when I was growing up was in their own mind extremely middle class."
The Jentes, who live in the Warsaw suburb of Wilanow, about a 20-minute drive through morning traffic jams to downtown, are typical. With investments from British and American companies, they have built the label-manufacturing company they inherited from Mr. Jentes's father into a $1-million-a-year business whose products adorn Luvs diapers, Kodak disposable cameras and countless pharmaceutical products. Each month, the couple bring home about $1,500.
They bought their house in 1992. "It was a ruin, but we got tax relief for enlarging and renovating it," Mr. Jente, 33, said. Though he and his wife like to travel, and though they paid the equivalent of two months' income for their wind surfer two summers ago, Mr. Jente, who has a university degree in archeology, says he is careful not to overdo the spending. The refrigerator in the otherwise modern kitchen is a Russian model, the kitchen chairs are plastic, and he has no plans to trade in his three-year-old car for a newer model. It is important, he said, to save enough for emergencies, like the $1,000 bill for private medical care that his wife, Danuta, received when she suddenly became ill.
While he is upbeat about Poland's economic prospects, Mr. Jente sounds a bit like a Republican business owner from middle America when he gripes about the stifling hand of big government. "I would be more optimistic if the state would take its hands off business," he said, a special concern given the former Communists' return to power.
Poland's transition to capitalism has been a gold mine for Malgorzta Konaszewska, 37, a divorced mother who served as a judge in the old Communist system. Its demise awakened her entrepreneurial streak, and she opened a two-partner law firm specializing in trade and intellectual property, the body of law that governs patents, copyrights and the like.
From an average monthly profit of $4,000, she and her partner pay themselves about $1,000 to $1,250 each. She wears the latest fashions, goes skiing in the winter and drives a Fiat Cinquecento that she bought new two years ago for $8,000. And she pays $120 a month to send her 6-year-old daughter, Marta, to private school.
Her firm is doing so well, in fact, that Ms. Konaszewska plans to add a third lawyer in the fall. With the economy booming, she says with satisfaction, "More and more people are asking advice on contracts."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 64.46 as Many Other Stock Indicators Soar to Highs

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
In an unusual display of confidence before a major report on inflation, investors bid many stock market indicators to record closing highs yesterday, following through on Friday's enthusiasm as interest rates edged lower again.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 64.46 points, to 5,582.60, leaping higher at midafternoon after spending most of the session within an advancing range of 10 to 20 points. The Dow, a barometer of 30 blue-chip stocks, has now rebounded by more than 240 points since sliding to less than 5,400 last week amid worries about inflation and increasingly competitive bond yields. But it remains more than 100 points below the record high close of 5,689.74 set on April 3. 
 Most noticeable among yesterday's record-setters was the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, which had not set a new closing high since early February. The Dow industrials and broader blue-chip measures like the S.& P. 500 have struggled in recent months as mounting evidence of a stronger economy stoked inflation fears and dashed hopes for new interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.
Several broad indexes set record high closes. The S.& P. 500 rose 9.42 points, to 661.51, edging its previous mark of 661.45 set on Feb. 12. The New York Stock Exchange's composite index rose 4.31 points, to 354.33 -- the first record high close for that measure since early April.
The Nasdaq market and the Russell 2000 list of smaller companies built further on their records set on Friday as technology and speculative issues continued to rebound from a weeklong slump in their rally. For weeks, investors have favored those sectors as having the most to gain in an improving economy.
The Nasdaq composite rose 19.11 points, to 1,221.87. The Russell 2000 gained 3.35 points, to 354.50. The American Stock Exchange's market value index, which is also dominated by smaller companies, set a record, too, rising 5.92 points, to 597.25.
Yesterday's rally came a day before today's report on inflation in consumer prices during April. Though trading did slow a bit yesterday, the mood was notably more optimistic than on the eve of other major economic reports.
"The market was reassured by the inflation numbers last week, so the report doesn't seem to be creating much fear," Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers, said.
On Friday, a mild reading on producer prices revitalized the financial markets, with stocks staging a broad rally as long-term interest rates moved back to less than 7 percent.
Yesterday's advance was quite broad as well. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 396 million shares, down from Friday's pace.
Stocks were helped again by the return of stability to the bond market, where the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond, dipped to less than 6.9 percent. That rate had jumped to more than 7 percent twice in the last two weeks, making bonds an enticing investment while threatening to raise corporate borrowing costs and slow consumer spending.
The Dow Jones transportation average surged 1.7 percent as some investors bet on improved business for the major airlines following Saturday's crash of a Valujet DC-9 in the Everglades, which killed all 109 people on board.
In Big Board trading, Delta Air Lines rose 3 3/8, to 83 5/8; UAL; the parent of United Airlines, rose 6, to 214, and AMR, the parent of American Airlines, rose 2 1/2, to 92. Stocks of several smaller airlines fell with Valujet, which slid 4 3/16, to 13 11/16.
Several technology bellwethers posted strong gains. Hewlett-Packard, which is due to report earnings later this week, rose 3 7/8, to 112 3/8. Motorola rose 2 1/2, to 63 1/8, I.B.M. rose 1 1/8, to 107 1/2, and Compaq Computer gained 1 1/8, to 47 3/8. Intel jumped 2 5/8, to 71 3/4, and Microsoft rose 3 3/4, to 118 5/8.

HEADLINE: 800,000 May Lose Coverage If Mental Benefits Are Added

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
The Congressional Budget Office said today that 800,000 people could lose health insurance as a result of higher premiums if Congress required insurers and health plans to provide coverage for mental illness equivalent to that provided for other conditions, like heart disease.
The Senate voted last month to impose such a requirement as part of a bill intended to make health insurance more readily available to millions of Americans, especially those changing jobs. But the budget office said the requirement relating to mental health coverage could impose new costs on many employers and lead some to drop health insurance altogether. 
 "The parity requirement could result in 400,000 fewer workers (800,000 fewer workers and dependents) having employment-based coverage," the budget office said today in a report to the House Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities.
About 40 million Americans have no health insurance, and the number has been rising slowly in the last few years, Census Bureau data show.
The mental health proposal, which is strongly favored by psychiatrists, people with mental illness and their relatives, is one of many issues still to be resolved by the House and the Senate, which have passed different versions of the health insurance legislation. The House version says nothing about coverage of mental illness. Work on the bill has bogged down because Senate leaders have not appointed members of the conference committee.
The requirement for parity in mental health coverage was added to the Senate bill at the suggestion of Senators Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, and Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota, who have close relatives with mental illness. They contend that employers will save money in the long run if employees with mental disorders receive proper treatment, because the workers will be more productive.
But the Congressional Budget Office said the requirement would "impose direct costs of $11.6 billion on the employment-based insurance market -- costs that we assume would ultimately be borne by workers." Initially, it said, premiums would increase by an average of 4 percent, but employers should be able to hold the average increase to 1.6 percent by reducing the generosity of health benefits.
The net increase in annual premiums, it said, would average $110 a policy or $55 for each person covered.
The budget office said its estimates had "a high degree of uncertainty" because experts could not know for sure how employers would respond. But June E. O'Neill, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, said any increase in premiums "would most likely be passed on to workers in the form of lower wages or reductions in other fringe benefits."
Almost all companies with employee health plans offer some mental health benefits, but fewer than 2 percent provide mental health coverage that is equivalent to that for other health services, the report said.
Thus, the budget office said, employers would have to make major changes in health benefits to comply with the Senate bill. It assumed that employers would make these changes in mental health coverage:
*Outpatient visits for mental health services, now typically limited to 20 a year, would be unlimited.
*For people with mental disorders who are admitted to a hospital, coverage, now typically limited to 30 days a year, would be unlimited.
*The patient's share of bills for outpatient services like psychotherapy, now 50 percent, would be reduced to 20 percent.
*There would be no lifetime limits on coverage for mental health care. The lifetime limit for such services is now typically $50,000.
Michael M. Faenza, the president of the National Mental Health Association, an advocacy group based in Alexandria, Va., agreed that Mr. Domenici's proposal would cause some increase in premiums, but said the increase would amount to only a few dollars a month.
"The costs of not providing mental health care to children and adults with mental disorders are astronomical," Mr. Faenza said. "If you don't provide outpatient care, these people may end up being admitted to a public mental hospital, at much greater cost to taxpayers."

HEADLINE: After a Surge in Vehicle Sales, Executives Predict a Moderation

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 13

 BODY:
While some investors on Wall Street have worried that auto makers' brisk sales and recent production increases may signal an overheating economy, auto industry officials say they doubt that the recent burst of activity will last.
The combination this spring of low interest rates, large tax refunds, rising employment and more consumer confidence had new cars and trucks driving out of dealerships at a brisk, seasonally adjusted annual rate of up to 15.7 million vehicles during the first four months of this year. But with interest rates rising and the tax refund season mostly over, almost everybody in Detroit expects sales to moderate slightly in the coming months. 
 Sales of 15 million vehicles mark a good year for the auto industry, while sales of 16 million vehicles would represent an excellent year and one not seen since 1986. Officials at each of the Big Three auto makers foresee a steadily growing economy that produces good but not great car and truck sales. Last year, foreign and domestic makes sold about 15.1 million cars and trucks, down from 15.4 million units in 1994.
Alexander J. Trotman, the chairman and chief executive of the Ford Motor Company, issued the boldest prediction yet when he recently nudged his 1996 sales estimate to 15.4 million or 15.5 million vehicles, up from the 15.3 million he had previously forecast.
"The first four months came in a lot stronger" than expected, said John M. Devine, Ford's chief financial officer, who added, "We're not expecting that to continue for the full year, but we'll take it if it comes."
Economists have been among the more pessimistic in the auto industry this year, while auto dealers have been the most bullish. "We've added the production in the second quarter for a very simple reason: the dealers are ordering the vehicles," Mr. Trotman said.
Indeed, dealers have been reporting brisk traffic in their showrooms and steady sales. Henry W. Robertson Jr., a Chevrolet dealer in Joplin, Mo., said that with car loan rates virtually unchanged, higher interest rates on Wall Street had not affected his business yet.
While interest rates have dropped back slightly in the last week, they remain nearly a percentage point higher than two months ago for medium- and long-term bonds.
Auto loan rates tend to move more slowly than market interest rates. And auto loan rates have been particularly immobile lately because the lending units of the big car companies are trying to increase their shares of the market and support high levels of overall car sales.
The Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation, for example, has chosen not to raise the interest rates it charges for car financing. "Our rates haven't changed -- with minor exceptions in some areas -- for several months," said William W. Bivens, senior vice president of the Nissan financing unit, which is based in Torrance, Calif.
Higher interest rates generally have had an indirect effect on the auto industry by eventually braking overall economic growth, slowing the creation of jobs and eroding consumer confidence, which in turn makes people less eager to spend $20,000 or more for a new car or truck. This indirect effect is greater than rising rates on new car loans or on dealer borrowings to pay for new vehicles.
Martin Zimmerman, the chief economist at Ford, said that auto sales typically topped off several months after mortgage refinancings hit a peak. Refinancings hit a high early this year and have been falling ever since, suggesting that auto sales will weaken at some point, too, he said.
Gas prices have also not risen enough or stayed high long enough to change car or truck sales yet, economists and dealers say. "It's a little early in the ball game for that, perhaps, but our business remains brisk -- I haven't noticed any shifting toward more fuel-efficient cars," said Mr. Robertson, the Chevrolet dealer.
G. Mustafa Mohatarem, chief economist at the General Motors Corporation, said that sales would not suffer unless gas prices continued to rise and remained high for a prolonged period -- a combination that he deemed unlikely. "The first response to an oil shock is a change in driving habits rather than the vehicle purchase decision, so people will buy what they were going to buy but drive it less," Mr. Mohatarem said.
W. Van Bussman, the top economist at the Chrysler Corporation, said a sustained rise in interest rates and gasoline prices would hurt the auto industry. But, he said, "I don't see it yet, and believe me I would tell people internally if I did because this is an important question for us."

HEADLINE: It's Back to the Campuses For the C.I.A.'s Recruiters

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

 BODY:
Back in the cold war, in the Central Intelligence Agency's halcyon days, recruiting on college campuses was elementary.
In the 1950's and early 1960's, there was always someone -- a crew coach at Yale, a history professor at Harvard or a dean of students at Princeton -- who could take a promising young man aside and suggest that a wonderful life of adventure awaited him in the secret world. 
 Then, in 1993, with the end of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the C.I.A. shut down its 13 recruitment centers in the United States and reassigned or retired half its recruiters.
Now the agency is once again going around to colleges and introducing itself to the fresh-faced future leaders of America. With some exceptions, the agency is not encountering the demonstrations and denouncements it heard in the 1960's, 70's and 80's. There are fewer placards , but still some puzzlement.
"I was shocked" that the C.I.A. was coming to Clemson University in South Carolina, said Steven Dixon, a 22-year-old accounting major who met with two agency representatives there. "Isn't this kind of unusual for them? Are they serious about hiring us -- fresh out of college, no master's degree?"
Frankly, probably not, the recruiter said. Of the few hundred people the agency will hire this year, most will have an advanced degree or experience more esoteric than having achieved a grasp of generally accepted accounting principles.
But the agency wants it known that it is talent hunting. Openly, if quietly, it is back on campus again.
"Universities like Brown weren't particularly open to us five, six, seven years ago," said Dick Calder, the C.I.A.'s Deputy Director for Administration. "That environment has changed a little bit. There are very few universities now that do attempt to keep us out."
One is the University of Colorado at Boulder, where students have made clear that the agency is not welcome. The C.I.A. circumvents that barrier by renting a video-phone and hooking up applicants from Boulder with a recruiter in Dallas.
But at Clemson, the contact is face to face. And the face of the C.I.A. belongs to Clay Burton, a former marine with a shaved head and a handlebar mustache who has worked out of Los Angeles, San Antonio and now Atlanta as a college recruiter.
At Berkeley and Stanford five years ago, Mr. Burton said, demonstrators poured red paint, symbolic of blood, on the ground before him. But in recent months, on his visits to Southern schools like Emory, Morehouse and Tulane, there has been nothing of the sort.
He found all quiet at Clemson one recent day as 10 students -- 4 women and 6 men -- filed into a humid room at the student union. Most were engineering or accounting majors. None had much idea about what exactly the agency was or did, until Mr. Burton and a C.I.A. man who went only by the name Bob addressed them for nearly two hours.
The students went slightly goggle-eyed as Bob, a senior analyst of Chinese politics, told them that he had to read 100 or more documents before 9 A.M. every day and crank out 30-page papers on professionalism in the Chinese military on short notice. He said the agency's analytical directorate was looking for talented people with graduate degrees in economics, fluency in foreign languages, depth in political science or international relations, a hunger for information, a certain creative twist of mind, the ability to write a supple paragraph and the sang-froid to pass a lie-detector test.
He explained that the C.I.A.'s directorate of science and technology hired engineers and scientists to build state-of-the-art gadgets for stealing, processing and transmitting secret information. The covert-operations side of the house has the job of persuading foreigners -- military personnel, political leaders, shady business people -- to betray their countries and work for the C.I.A.
"Some of these people are operating from noble motives," Bob said, "and some of them are scum."
The wide eyes grew wider.
"Any questions?" Mr. Burton said.
The students were speechless.
To join the C.I.A. or its programs for student trainees, undergraduate scholars, summer interns and graduate students, Mr. Burton said, all applicants must fill out a 21-page form, which, among other things, requires them to write a 500-word essay on a current event and answer personal questions about drug use and the like. To be hired, they will have to submit to the lie detector and a thorough background investigation, including interviews with former boyfriends or girlfriends. The whole thing may take nine months or more. And the pay is not good.
Nevertheless, "this is a great organization to work for," Mr. Burton said enthusiastically. "Love working for this organization."
Mary C. Younginer, a 22-year-old accounting major from Florence, S.C., thought she might love it, too. Miss Younginer, whose father is the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Florence, had come into the meeting thinking that the C.I.A. was "all James Bond types with little pens that explode." Now she thought there might be a job for her in tracking the flow of money in foreign lands.
After meeting with Mr. Burton the next morning, Miss Younginer said: "I would love to work there. All the eccentric people dealing with different issues. Sounds great to me."
Mr. Burton said she had some prospects.
"Good grade-point average, great attitude, fantastic interpersonal skills," he said. "I think she has a good fighting chance."

HEADLINE: Apparel Picked As the Target If U.S. Imposes Curbs on China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Roughly half the economic sanctions that the United States is preparing to invoke against China later this week will be aimed at clothing imported into the United States, Administration officials said today. The goal, they said, is to focus the penalties on one of Beijing's most lucrative state-owned industries.
The strategy, which was approved by President Clinton last week, is designed to convince China's leadership that the Government itself will pay a heavy price if it fails to enforce laws against pirating foreign software, music and videos. 
 "This is very specific retaliation," one senior government official said. "We need to get the attention of the Chinese leadership, and this is the most direct way to do it."
But the Administration's strategy also has a potential political payoff: Apparel plants throughout the South that have been hurt by imported goods produced in low-wage countries -- particularly in key electoral states like North Carolina -- may benefit if the sanctions are in place for a lengthy period.
The $2 billion to $3 billion in trade sanctions the Administration is contemplating are scheduled for announcement on Wednesday morning if last-minute talks in Beijing fail. They are aimed specifically at violations in China of intellectual property rights -- copying everything from Microsoft's Windows 95 software to the works of American recording stars.
The White House is expected to announce a list of about $3 billion of Chinese imported goods that will be hit with punitive tariffs, which would then be winnowed down to $2 billion or so before going into effect. The sanctions would be set aside if Washington and Beijing reach agreement on ways to curb illegal pirating of intellectual property.
Last week, Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided against imposing sanctions in a separate case, involving China's shipment of nuclear materials to Pakistan. Mr. Christopher decided that the transfer of ring magnets, which can be used to create fuel for nuclear weapons, was a commercial transaction that took place without the knowledge of China's leaders.
By dispensing with the nuclear issue, however, the Administration paved the way to come down hard on what the White House says is a far more clear-cut case: China's failure to abide by a trade accord banning software piracy that it signed, also under the threat of sanctions, in March 1995.
Before reaching that agreement, the Administration threatened to impose roughly $1 billion in sanctions, but did not include clothing or textiles on the list.
"It's a bit of a change-up pitch," noted one senior official familiar with the list.
It is also something of a risk, because the sanctions are bound to be opposed by American clothing retailers. They would be the first to feel the pinch of 100 percent tariffs -- which means a blouse carrying a wholesale price of $30 would cost twice that once it lands on American shores. But informal studies conducted by the Administration to predict the effect of the sanctions have concluded that the effect on consumers will be minimal. Competitive products are available from other countries, they contend, and there is enough of an inventory of Chinese-made goods already in the United States that prices are not likely to be affected unless the face-off with China drags on for months.
Sanctions on clothes, however, may also prove difficult to enforce. China's clothing factories are already well practiced, American customs officials say, at sewing in labels that read "Made in Hong Kong," or "Made in Panama." They are also well schooled, officials add, in falsifying the papers that accompany each shipment to disguise the true origins of the goods. That deception is used to sidestep longstanding quotas on Chinese textile exports to the United States.
The sanctions are intended, officials say, to force a response from Beijing by hitting a different group of factories than those that are accused of violating international trade rules but one that is close to the heart of top officials. The state-run company that controls most of the clothing factories, called Chinatex, has no direct relationship to the state-licensed factories that are turning out billions of dollars in fake software and compact disks. "It's not perfect, but it's as close to home as we can strike," one American official said today.
While the acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, prepared to issue the sanctions list, one of her top deputies, Lee Sands, met with Chinese officials to determine if they were prepared to act on a four-point enforcement plan presented to China a month ago. But there were no reports that he had made significant progress.
That did not surprise Administration officials. For weeks now they have said that they expect it will take the publication of the sanctions list -- and the start of the 30-day clock for the actual imposition of the 100 percent tariffs -- to create a crisis atmosphere designed to compel China to respond. That strategy has sometimes worked before. But there is some question whether it will work again.
Some trade experts question whether the proposed sanctions are large enough to force China to move. China exports more than $40 billion in goods to the United States annually, and while $2 billion in tariffs would put a significant dent in those exports, it would hardly stop them.
Others wonder whether China's reaction to trade brinkmanship -- especially at a time of rising nationalism and a power struggle among China's top leaders -- may be defiance and counterretaliation rather than negotiation. Chinese officials have warned in recent days that they will respond to the sanctions list with a list of their own, which could focus on Boeing and perhaps American participation in automobile joint ventures in China.
There have also been threats to place huge tariffs on American agricultural goods in an effort to get some of the most powerful American lobbying groups to force the Clinton Administration to back down before the sanctions go into effect. And there have been cases where the Administration relented without getting anywhere close to what it stated as its goals.

HEADLINE: Study for F.D.I.C. Chides Banks On Failure to Cite Fund Risks

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
More than one-fourth of banks in a study did not properly warn customers about the risks of buying mutual funds and other investments that lack Federal insurance, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said today.
"These results need to be improved," Ricki Helfer, chairwoman of the F.D.I.C., said in a statement. 
 The yearlong study by trained interviewers who posed as shoppers in banks or on the telephone showed that 28 percent were not told that mutual funds lacked Federal deposit insurance, which protects savings accounts and certificates of deposit up to $100,000 in the case of a bank failure.
In 30 percent of the cases, banks failed to tell the interviewers that stocks, mutual funds and other investments were not bank obligations like certificates of deposit or savings accounts.
"The F.D.I.C. will work with the banking industry to insure that all bank customers are fully informed of the risks they are assuming when purchasing mutual funds and other investment products that do not carry Federal insurance," Ms. Helfer said in a statement.
The study was conducted by Market Trends Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., and the findings were analyzed by the F.D.I.C. The results are consistent with recent studies that show banks are not fully informing customers about the potential risks of Wall Street investments sold in their branches. The F.D.I.C. and other bank regulators established guidelines in 1994 concerning what banks should tell their customers, and Ms. Helfer said those rules should be revisited in light of the latest findings.
She said the F.D.I.C. would pursue better training of bank employees who sell uninsured investments. Proposals include requiring such employees to take the securities industry's standardized tests and new F.D.I.C.-sponsored seminars.
The F.D.I.C plans to modify its examination process to determine whether bankers are steering customers to suitable investments.
The study also found that 91 percent of customers were told that their investments were subject to market and interest-rate risk. It found that only 71 percent of the customers were led to a separate area of the bank to discuss noninsured investments, a requirement of Federal guidelines. But nearly 100 percent of the interviewers who visited banks were directed to an employee trained as an investment representative.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Higher As Economic Data Are Due

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury securities rose yesterday, in trading that began quietly but gained momentum near the market close while prices were increasing.
Bond prices had risen sharply on Friday after a report on producer prices showed that inflation in April was weaker than expected. As a result, some market participants sought yesterday to consolidate their positions ahead of today's report on consumer prices for April. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 10/32, to 88 24/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.89 percent, from 6.92 percent on Friday.
At the Treasury's weekly bill auction, the overall results were average, with interest rates unchanged from the previous sale a week ago. The average discount rate for a three-month maturity was 5.02 percent, and the six-month rate was 5.14 percent.
Charles Roden, managing director at Josephthal Lyon & Ross, said the market yesterday was quietly waiting for today's economic data, which also include a regional survey of business conditions by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and a weekly sales report by Johnson Redbook.
Mr. Roden said he was expecting the Consumer Price Index to show a rise of four-tenths of 1 percent, with the core index -- when the categories of food and energy are excluded -- rising one-tenth of 1 percent.
Carroll J. Delaney, director of research at Stires, O'Donnell & Company, said that with today's consumer price and retail sales data, "the market will be facing two critical hurdles that will challenge its new- found optimism."
"The importance of the price and sales figures to the sustainability of the Treasury market's road to recovery cannot be overemphasized," he said.
In corporate dealing, traders were waiting for the Lockheed Martin Corporation to come to market. The company, a military contractor and aerospace giant, is expected to sell at least $2.2 billion in debt this week in one of the largest high-grade bond offerings ever. The largest sale of investment-grade debt was held on March 22, when Walt Disney sold $2.6 billion in securities.
Lockheed Martin is selling the bonds to help repay the $9.1 billion required to buy the Loral Corporation earlier in the year.
Traders have said that among the things that Lockheed Martin has going for it in such a large auction is the company's leading position in the industry and the fact that there have not been many new high-grade bonds to pick from recently.
Last week, the company said that it would sell through Goldman, Sachs & Company $400 million worth of 3-year notes, $600 million worth of 5-year notes, $500 million worth of 10-year notes, $400 million worth of 20-year bonds and $300 million worth of 30-year bonds.
The deal will come from a $5 billion shelf registration filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of new three- and six-month bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

 	 	 		3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Average Price	98.731	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.02%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.35%	High Price	98.741	97.407	Discounted Rate	4.98%	5.13%	Coupon Yield	5.11%	5.34%	Low Price	98.731	97.401	Discounted Rate	5.16%	5.14%	Coupon Yield	5.16%	5.35%	Accepted at low price	53%	21%	Total applied for	$56,983,832	$59,078,191	Accepted	$13,595,836	$13,682,910	Noncompetitive	$1,442,129	$1,249,476	

Both issues are dated May 16, 1996. The three-month bills mature on Aug. 15, 1996, and the six-month bills mature on Nov. 14, 1996.

HEADLINE: Washington's Mayor Is Back and Says He's Going to Stay

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 13

 BODY:
Pronouncing himself spiritually renewed and mentally sharp, Washington's Mayor, Marion S. Barry Jr., returned to work today after two weeks of personal introspection at retreats in Maryland and Missouri.
"I come back better prepared to govern and better able to govern," Mr. Barry said at a cabinet meeting that was opened to reporters. "I'm all right. I'm ready to move forward." 
 In a speech that frequently referred to a rekindled relationship with God and a stronger relationship with his family, Mr. Barry, who is 60, said his need to take a break after 16 months back in office had been caused by stress, physical exhaustion and spiritual depletion.
But later, in an hour of questions from reporters that was extraordinary for the subjects raised, he denied rumors that his hiatus had been caused by drug use, alcohol abuse, problems in his marriage or adverse results of an investigation by the United States Attorney's office and denied reports that he had been caught buying drugs.
"All of them were printed?" Mr. Barry said in mock surprise. "Glad I was away."
He also denied rumors that he had ever contemplated committing suicide or that he had considered resigning before his term expires in 1998.
After serving 12 years as Mayor, Mr. Barry was convicted on a misdemeanor drug count and spent six months in prison. He also acknowledged his addiction to drugs and alcohol. In 1994, he won re-election, campaigning on the theme of recovery, his own and the city's. But in his new term, he confronted a growing financial crisis that was eroding city services and undermining public confidence in the local government. By April 27, it got to him as well.
In an unexpected announcement, he said he needed time away from the job to seek "physical, mental and spiritual rejuvenation," and he set off with his wife, Cora Masters Barry, for the Skinner Farm, a private retreat in southern Maryland.
But an ambiguous reference to one part of the 12-step recovery program used by Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous -- that he needed to take "a fearless personal moral inventory" -- touched off widespread speculation that he had suffered a relapse into drugs or alcohol.
Four days later, he moved to another retreat, the Thompson Center in suburban St. Louis, to escape reporters and the telephone calls of well-meaning friends, he said. But by then, some city officials were suggesting that upon his return, Mr. Barry would resign or at least announce that he would not seek re-election in 1998.
In addressing cabinet members and reporters today, Mr. Barry had seldom looked or sounded more energetic. He urged all city workers to take periodic stock of their own physical and spiritual health and even take time off, if necessary. He cracked jokes. He chided reporters for overzealous interpretation of the facts. And he assigned rumors of his pending resignation to "wishful thinking on the part of adversaries and some media."
But he revealed few details about what had led to his decision to get away, other than to say he had resumed smoking cigarettes, from two a day to half a pack a day. Smoking, he said, is one of the "40 or 50 relapse symptoms" that a recovering addict might experience "long before drinking or drugging again." He also said he had been ignoring his physical well-being after surgery for prostate cancer in December.
Ultimately, he said, he began to contemplate his routine since returning to office: long days consumed by work and worry, sleepless nights, a growing irritability with colleagues and too little time spent with his wife and his 16-year-old son, Christopher.
"No more 16-hour days, not for me," he told the cabinet. "No more putting my family last. No more ignoring my health. No more trying to control things I can't control."
His change in attitude would appear to have come at a propitious time. Efforts to return the city to financial stability have transferred substantial power to the financial control board appointed last year and the city's new chief financial officer, Anthony Williams, who answers only to the board, not the Mayor. With Mr. Barry away, the control board rejected the Mayor's proposed 1997 budget, and Mr. Williams told Congress that hundreds of city employees in his department were incapable of doing their jobs and should be dismissed.
Mr. Barry shrugged off any appearance of a shift in power, saying, "There's no shift in anything." But perceptions, rumors, blizzards and anything else beyond his control, he said, would no longer bother him.
"For me," he said of his need to get away and the benefits it produced, "this was my most favorable moment. My personal health came first, and the D.C. government had able people to carry on in my absence."

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Clinton on The China Road

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
On May 10, the Clinton Administration decided to move along in its China policy. It moved from appeasement of the Communists about violations of human rights to appeasement of the Communists about violations of international agreements against spreading nuclear weaponry.
Washington abandoned months of threats that it would impose sanctions on China for selling nuclear weapons material and technology to Pakistan. As dessert for Beijing, Washington approved loans from American tax dollars to the very government-owned Chinese companies that committed the violations. 
 As it flip-flopped, the Administration treated Congress and the American public like idiots. Straight face hanging out, Washington said that it accepted Beijing's word that it had not known about the sales -- even though the companies are part of the Chinese military system and owned by the Government.
Beijing says it won't do again what it said it had not done -- violate anti-proliferation agreements. Clinton spokesmen say oh, wonderful -- look, we won our point without imposing penalties. The charade is a walkout on the Administration's responsibilities to enforce American law and agreements.
The major dangers of the Clinton decision are three, not yet examined and grasped by public, Congress or press. One is that the structure of anti-proliferation agreements and machinery will fall apart. It will be amusing to hear American diplomats explain to the Russians why they should be penalized for selling nuclear secrets and material to Iran while China gets billions in loans while engaging in the nuclear weaponry trade.
Second: The world will understand that the U.S. cannot be trusted to keep its word to fight proliferation, not if trade is threatened. The third danger is that the American public will turn out to be as stupid, and uncaring about nuclear proliferation, as Washington assumes it will be.
For Republicans, nuclear appeasement should emphasize a critical difference between them and the Democrats, which is election-year gold. That is, if there really was one.
Senator Robert Dole has indeed made some criticism of the Clintonian somersault on the nuclear trade sanctions. I hope Mr. Dole now has some talks, not just with Chinese officials and their American lobbyists, but with fighters against proliferation like Gary Milhollin of the Washington-based Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control.
The Senator will find out from him about deals approved in Washington that will strengthen not peace or freedom but the China National Nuclear Corporation. That's the government company that sold the nuclear technology to Pakistan and is part of the industrial empire that feeds billions of dollars into the Chinese military.
One deal would allow the company's engineers to be trained in advanced reactor technology in the ever-loopy U.S. Another would allow Westinghouse to export steam turbines to the company's nuclear reactors.
Mr. Milhollin can tell him about lots of similar U.S.-China deals. The delightful part for the Chinese and American deal makers is that they do not have to worry about default. The loans are U.S.-guaranteed.
But unfortunately for the American voter's range of choice, the leadership of both parties peddle the same political and ethical monstrosity. That is the idea that trade and chats with the Communists will somehow produce a China that, as Mr. Dole put it, will be peaceful and free and will play by the rules of nonproliferation.
Why the Chinese Politburo and military will encourage freedom and rule by international law, which they have been destroying all these decades, or how they will do it, is not disclosed by either candidate for the Presidency.
This time four years ago, Mr. Clinton was denouncing President Bush's fantasy that trade would persuade the Communist dictatorship to ease its tortures of the Chinese and Tibetan people. After he was elected, Mr. Clinton betrayed his promises, by "delinking" human rights from trade and tariffs. Now he has suddenly delinked the Communists from penalty for nuclear trade double-crossing.
This is tragic for the Chinese and Tibetan people, dangerous for nuclear security and sad for Mr. Clinton's reputation. But I suppose that once you get into appeasement, one thing just follows another.

HEADLINE: THE CRASH IN THE EVERGLADES: THE EQUIPMENT;
Fleet Was Old, but Age Alone Is Not Safety Indicator

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
So when is an airplane too old?
Some of the nation's biggest airlines fly planes that are more than 25 years old. And the military operates B-52 aircraft that are more than 40 years old, flown by pilots who are younger than the planes. 
 Valujet Airlines, whose DC-9 jet crashed near Miami on Saturday, killing 109 people on board, operates a fleet of DC-9 jets whose average age is about 26 years, making its fleet the oldest for any large airline in the United States.
But aviation safety experts said that a plane's age, in and of itself, does not necessarily make it any less safe than a younger plane. Just as with cars, other important considerations are how well a jet has been maintained and how many times it changed owners.
The 27-year-old Valujet plane that crashed had only one previous owner, Delta Air Lines, the nation's third largest airline. "If you are going to buy something used, that's a pretty good pedigree," said David Stamey, vice president of Avitas, an aviation consulting firm that appraises and inspects aircraft.
The age of Valujet's DC-9 fleet is not unusual among major airlines that use the planes. Continental, Northwest, Trans World Airlines and USAir all operate dozens of DC-9's with an average age of 24 to 26 years.
Many of those aircraft will be much older by the time they are retired. Northwest Airlines, for example, plans to invest $6 million per plane to upgrade more than 100 of its DC-9's to comply with Federal noise regulations and keep them flying beyond the year 2000.
There are many reasons that airlines like Northwest are deciding to extend the life of many planes in their fleets rather than buy new ones. New aircraft cost tens of millions of dollars, and many airlines have decided it is more economical to refurbish their old planes than buy new ones, even though older aircraft face more rigorous, and therefore more costly, requirements for maintenance and replacing parts. Many fledgling airlines, in fact, have fleets that are much younger, on average, than some of the more established carriers.
Many regulations intended to guard specifically against the effects of aging were put into place after an accident involving an Aloha Airlines Boeing 737, when the passenger cabin ripped open in 1988 because of corrosion and metal fatigue, sweeping a flight attendant to her death.
After the industry was deregulated in 1978, many airlines started expanding rapidly and ordered new aircraft. And in the 1980's, airlines generally believed that growth would lead to financial success.
But in the early 1990's, the airlines lost billions of dollars, in part because of traffic declines and rising fuel costs as a result of the war in the Persian Gulf. Since then, airlines have focused more on reducing overhead costs, weighing decisions to buy new aircraft more carefully than ever before.
To maintain low costs, many start-up airlines like Valujet have not only bought used aircraft but also paid companies that do heavy aircraft maintenance to work on their jets.
William D. Waldock, a professor of aeronautical science and director of the aviation safety resource center at Embry Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz., said he was troubled by the trend.
"For the airline, it is cheaper," he said. "But the people that you've got working on airplanes for maintenance subcontractors don't have the same level of motivation and feeling of ownership and involvement as an employee of an airline would have toward his company's aircraft."
The Federal Aviation Administration said on Sunday that it would closely scrutinize in coming weeks the six companies that do maintenance work for Valujet.
The Valujet DC-9 that crashed on Saturday had been forced to return to airports seven times in the last two years for a variety of safety problems, including a faulty heat exchanger, a loss of oil because of a loose oil cap and a malfunctioning hydraulic pump. It also made an emergency landing in Memphis a year ago when the plane lost cabin pressure.
It received an F.A.A. maintenance inspection last Tuesday, in which inspectors checked, among other things, fluids and tire treads and other major equipment for signs of fatigue or cracks.
F.A.A. records show that before the crash on Saturday, Valujet had 12 minor problems or more serious accidents since it started flying in 1993, including an inoperative microphone that rendered the pilots unable to communicate with air traffic controllers and a fire in an engine on a runway in Atlanta last year that injured several people on board.

HEADLINE: U.N. Says North Korea Will Face Famine as Early as This Summer

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 13

 BODY:
Hunger in North Korea is growing more intense as the country's economy continues to deteriorate, so that malnutrition could become widespread in the coming months, some experts say.
In the latest sign of the country's crisis, the World Food Program and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations warned today that "the food supply is becoming increasingly desperate" in North Korea, and that without emergency food imports, "the consequences are likely to be devastating for large segments of the population." 
 In their "special alert," the two agencies said that the situation had deteriorated just in the last few months and that the shortages were likely to grow worse this summer.
"There are some cases of malnutrition, but it is not widespread at this time, as far as we can tell," Trevor Page, the country director for the World Food Program, said by telephone from the organization's office in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital. "However, with levels of rations that are now being distributed, malnutrition will develop and become widespread in the coming months unless there are substantial food aid shipments."
North Korea, with the world's last Stalinist government, remains virtually sealed off from the rest of the world, and few foreigners are allowed to visit. But many Western diplomats, business executives, academic experts and visitors to the country say there are growing signs that the economy is deteriorating.
Even in Pyongyang, which has by far the best standard of living in the country, visitors say that power outages are now routine and that water is often cut off for much of the day.
Some Western diplomats and military officials worry that North Korea's economic crisis could make it unpredictable or even lead it to attack South Korea and the American forces stationed there.
North Korea, with a population of about 24 million, was the better-endowed part of the Korean Peninsula when Japan ended its occupation in 1945. The North has a wealth of minerals and other natural resources, but it has been hobbled by its rigid Communist model, by huge spending on its 1.2 million-member armed forces, and by the collapse of trading partners in the former Communist world. Now many North Korean factories are idled by lack of oil and electricity, and collective farms are returning to draft animals because there is no fuel for tractors.
The American Ambassador to South Korea, James T. Laney, warned in a speech on Saturday of "serious risks," including the possibility that "the North may look for other ways of using the only remaining asset it possesses which commands international respect -- its military might."
In a speech that seemed to signal a shifting direction in American policy, Mr. Laney suggested that the old approach of simply emphasizing deterrence against North Korean attack was no longer sufficient. Now, he said, deterrence must be augmented by inducements to get North Korea to cooperate with the West.
Senior officials from the United States, Japan and South Korea are now meeting in South Korea to discuss policy toward the North. Diplomats say they are expected to agree on an assistance plan on condition that the North agrees to President Clinton's proposal last month for four-party peace talks involving both Koreas, the United States and China.
North Korea's economy has been deteriorating for years and was further devastated by widespread flooding last year. Rations have already been halved, and experts say that some peasants are eating bitter wild grasses and roots that have not been part of the diet since 1951, during the Korean War.
But one such emergency food, a grass called naengi, stops growing this month and so will be unavailable in the crucial summer months, until the next grain harvest is ready in the fall. This year's harvest is also expected to be poor, because bad weather delayed planting by about two weeks.
Experts say there are other signs of economic desperation, including the sale by peasants of anything they have -- even human hair -- to China in exchange for wheat flour. Russia is said to have cut freight train service for lack of payment of bills, and that may complicate North Korea's trade picture.
Most staple foods are distributed in North Korea by the Government, but the alert today said that this system "is perilously close to collapse." Moreover, foreign assistance -- which eased the shortages during the winter -- is coming to an end.
Foreign shipments had averaged about 50,000 tons of grain a month since late last year, but plunged to 12,200 last month and are anticipated to be 9,300 this month. Next month, 2,500 tons are anticipated, and then nothing is in the pipeline.
Some North Korea watchers have suggested that the hunger could lead to a revolt or to the disintegration of the system, and there have indeed been a growing number of North Koreans who risk being shot by sneaking across the border into China. But visitors say they have seen no sign of political unrest in North Korea, perhaps the most tightly controlled society in the world.
"Although food shortages are all over, there are no signs that this will cause the political collapse of the country," Mr. Page of the World Food Program said.
The food shortage in North Korea may become perennial, experts say, unless the rigid Communist economic system changes dramatically. The Government appears to be bending its rules a bit by turning a blind eye as peasants plant larger private plots than they are allowed or sell food in informal markets in some parts of the country. Likewise, in the cities some residents are planting crops on spare bits of land or raising chickens on their balconies. But North Korea has given no indication that it is contemplating any major opening.
Another problem for North Korea may be declining cash transfusions from ethnic Koreans living in Japan. Nicholas Eberstadt, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, has concluded that the transfusions were never as great as widely believed and have plunged since the late 1980's.

High Court Strikes Down Restriction on Liquor Ads
The Supreme Court struck down a Rhode Island ban on advertising liquor prices. The ruling casts doubt on the Clinton Administration's proposed curbs on cigarette promotions intended to thwart sales to minors.
All nine Justices agreed that the Rhode Island ban violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech, but offered differing rationales for their conclusion, showing that the Court's approach to commercial speech remains in flux. [Page A1.]

Can Yankees and Mariners Repeat Their '95 Oscar?

BYLINE: By Murray Chass 

 BODY:
The last time the Yankees saw the Seattle Mariners, the Mariners were jubilantly jumping around the Kingdome, celebrating the success of the first post-season foray in the franchise's 19-year history. They celebrated because they had just defeated the Yankees in one of the most scintillating post-season series in baseball history, a series that validated the Mariners' late-season rush to the top of their division, secured the team's place in the Northwest corner of the United States and injected another jolt of juice into the sport cynical undertakers were preparing for burial.
"It's amazing what it's done for all of baseball," Woody Woodward, the Mariners' general manager, said. "I talk to people around the country and they talk about the series with New York and what it did for all of baseball. I still get that, and here we are in the middle of May." 
 The Mariners will be at Yankee Stadium tonight and tomorrow night, but the series will not be a rematch of the teams' playoff encounter last October. For one thing, both teams have significantly different looks; for another, a regular-season series can never be a rematch of a playoff series.
The Mariners won the October series, three games to two, and moved on to the League Championship Series against Cleveland. If the Yankees win these two games, they will not advance directly to this year's League Championship Series. If they win the two games, they will raise the number in their "W" column by two.
These two games will have some meaning for the ultimate destination of the Yankees and the Mariners. But no matter what happens in them, they will make no impact on the game itself, not like the spine-tingling series that ended in the 11th inning with Ken Griffey Jr. sliding across home plate with the second of two runs that Edgar Martinez's double to left produced.
"At the time, it was good for baseball," said Wade Boggs of the Yankees. "Baseball was sliding in popularity. There had been a strike and they had canceled the World Series. Now there was a new round of playoffs and all the games were exciting. It got a lot of attention."
Unfortunately, the playoff did not get all of the attention it deserved. Through an incredibly shortsighted plan, baseball's television experts opted to show each series regionally. It wasn't bad enough that the protracted labor dispute had diluted fans' interest in the game; the television experts had to add to the fading interest by telling fans they weren't interested in seeing all of the playoff matchups.
Who wouldn't have wanted to see the second game of the Mariners-Yankees series that Jim Leyritz ended with a home run in the 15th inning? Who wouldn't have wanted to see the fourth game that the Mariners won with an explosive five-run rally in the eighth inning, the one that Edgar Martinez powered with a grand slam against John Wetteland? Who wouldn't have wanted to see the fifth game in which a weary David Cone pitched courageously into the eighth inning and an even wearier Randy Johnson pitched heroically in relief until the Mariners eked out the decision?
"Whoever won or lost didn't feel like they were a loser," Leyritz said. "The series was played so well. It's not like someone was a goat or something. I remember walking out of the clubhouse after the game and my wife was crying. I asked her, 'Why are you crying?' We played good, sound, fundamental baseball. There was nothing to cry about, nothing to hang our heads about."
Jeff Nelson expressed a similar sentiment, although it might have been easier for him to say because he was on the winning side. But now he is with the Yankees, representative of the changes the teams have made, some out of economic necessity, some out of a belief that wholesale change was needed to move beyond the first-round phase.
The Mariners, forced by their financial concerns, traded away first baseman Tino Martinez and third baseman Mike Blowers, who between them hit 54 home runs and drove in 207 runs. The Yankees, never needing an excuse, changed their general manager and manager, their catcher, first baseman, shortstop and left fielder and part of their pitching staff.
"I don't see this as a rematch," Woodward said, talking about the series here and the one in Seattle Memorial Day weekend. "I don't think there's any carry-over. I know our marketing people have tried to build it up, which is understandable. Let the marketing people do that. If it creates interest, fine."
Woodward is more concerned with the way the Mariners have played since a good start. "We're scuffling to get back on track," he said. "We played well early; we haven't played well lately."
Since winning 12 of their first 16 games, the Mariners have won 8 and lost 13, giving them the same 20-17 record they had after 37 games last season. What isn't the same, though, is their attendance.
When the Mariners made their belated charge toward the top of the American League West last season, they discovered thousands of new fans, who, in the final weeks, began occupying more and more of the Kingdome's 59,856 seats. The late-season surge and the playoff excitement -- never mind that they lost to the Indians -- saved Seattle from the embarrassment of losing a second major league baseball team. In an outcome that most likely would have gone the other way had the Mariners not produced the September-October excitement, voters rewarded the Mariners with approval for a new stadium and they didn't have to look for a home elsewhere.
For now, the uncomfortable Kingdome will do fine. The Mariners, averaging 33,094 a game, have enjoyed the largest attendance increase in the majors, a 76 percent jump that projects to a season total half a million fans higher than the franchise record attendance of 2.1 million.
At that rate, if the Mariners return to the playoffs this year, they should be able to keep the players who get them there.

HEADLINE: God's Stronghold At Mammon's Door;
After 150 Years, Trinity's Spire Still Looms Amid Wall St. Towers

BYLINE: By PAUL GOLDBERGER 

 BODY:
Nowhere else in New York does God confront Mammon as directly as where Trinity Church meets Wall Street. A landmark Gothic Revival church staring down the canyon of capitalism: what better way for architecture to symbolize the very conflict of urban civilization?
Trinity Church, which turns 150 years old this week, is one of those landmarks that New Yorkers take for granted, and which turns out to have a far more profound connection to the idea of city life than it appears to on the surface. This is no mere Gothic Revival leftover amid skyscrapers. It was New York's tallest building for most of the 19th century and one of its most potent symbols, as closely identified with the idea of the New York skyline then as the World Trade Center is now. 
 And far from being squeezed by the explosion of skyscrapers in lower Manhattan, Trinity's parish helped create it. As the owner of 215 acres of Manhattan bestowed to it by Queen Anne in 1705, Trinity encouraged, and profited from, much of the commercial development of downtown, which took place on its land.
So God and Mammon are in what could well be called a permanent standoff at Broadway and Wall Street. In some ways, it has been that way since 1698, when the first of three Trinity Churches on this site was completed. But the real drama of Trinity Church's presence in the New York cityscape began on May 21, 1846, the day that the present Trinity Church, a structure of chocolate-colored brownstone designed by Richard Upjohn, opened its doors, replacing the first Trinity, which burned, and the second one, which collapsed after a heavy snowfall.
The Episcopal church is commemorating the anniversary of Upjohn's building with a series of events, beginning Thursday, Ascension Day, which will include a special commemorative service at 10 A.M., followed by an outdoor Colonial-style street fair. Thursday's celebration also marks the beginning of a yearlong observance of the 300th birthday of Trinity Parish itself, established in 1697.
When the present Trinity Church was new, New York was a city of three-, four- and five-story buildings, nestling together on tight downtown streets. The cityscape was a tangled mass, full of energy but with precious little breathing space, in which the open churchyard of Trinity was like a great park, and the church's spire the city's spectacular exclamation point. At 281 feet, roughly the height of a 22-story building, the spire could been seen from all over the city, and from far out in New York Harbor as well, a sign that Manhattan Island contained not merely buildings, but a community.
The church remained the tallest structure in New York until 1876, when it was eclipsed by the towers of the still-unfinished Brooklyn Bridge. None of the city's earliest skyscrapers -- the Tower Building, the Tribune Building and the Western Union Building -- was big enough to overshadow either the church or the bridge, and it was not until 1890, with the completion of the 309-foot-high headquarters of The New York World on Park Row, that an actual building would reach higher than the spire of Trinity Church.
And then, the free-for-all began. Lower Manhattan grew madly, and Trinity survived only by virtue of its powerful financial position as a rich parish and the owner of much of the land where the city's feverish growth was taking place. Trinity was in a position to remain at the head of Wall Street forever if it wished, and to determine what kind of architecture would surround it. It was no accident that many of the early skyscrapers built close to Trinity, like the 21-story Trinity and U.S. Realty Buildings of 1905 and 1907, just to the north on Broadway, were designed to harmonize with the church, and give it a serene stone backdrop.
Even with Trinity's power to govern development, the explosive growth of New York assured that the relationship of the church to the city would change significantly in the first decade of the 20th century. In 1907, Puck magazine published a cartoon titled "The Future of Trinity Church" that showed the church all but obliterated by one enormous office block, so huge it surrounded the church on both sides and bridged over it, slicing off the top of its spire: Trinity reduced to the status of a puppy cowering at the foot of skyscrapers.
If Trinity was too rich truly to be held hostage to the skyline, the cartoon in Puck nonetheless expressed the fear of many New Yorkers that skyscrapers would overwhelm everything in lower Manhattan. And it underscored the extent to which worry over the fate of landmarks existed even in 19th-century New York: Trinity was one of the first important buildings in the city to inspire New Yorkers with preservationist fervor, not because it was ever in any literal danger of demolition, but because its pre-eminence over the skyline symbolized the whole structure and value system of the city as 19th-century New Yorkers had known it.
The anxiety about Trinity acknowledged a growing sense that churches in particular were vulnerable to the rapid growth of high-rise commercial building in the city. For even if they could afford to survive, what meaning would churches have in this very different city, whose high points seemed designed to show off the power of commerce, not the glory of God? A Trinity Church dwarfed by skyscrapers would not be the same as a Trinity Church that ruled the skyline.
By the 1920's, though, it was clear that Trinity would have a new role in the cityscape: that of survivor, of provider of light and air and open space, and as symbol of a balance between the forces at work in the urban environment. And so it remains today, at the head of one of the great vistas of New York: the view west on Wall Street, now even more compelling than it was when Trinity was new. For now, the canyon of buildings is high, not low, all the more tightly enclosed, perfectly framing Trinity's tall tower, which exerts the pull of a magnet.
It is a vista that exists in time as well as space, for here is a century and a half of New York buildings, their jostling for position given order by the continued presence of the church. Upjohn's sumptuous tower, one of the first great examples of Gothic Revival architecture in New York, was always a bit too big for the medium-sized church behind it, but that is hardly an architectural error. It is big because its architect knew it would have an outsized role in the cityscape, that it had to be a tower for the entire city and not just a spire for one church building, and designed it accordingly.
Yet the rest of the church should not be sold short. This is one of New York's finest Gothic Revival churches, designed by an architect who reveled in the Perpendicular style of English Gothic, with its emphasis on strong vertical lines and the lyrical expression of height. Like so many American revivalists who followed him, however, Upjohn was concerned more with appearances than with the deeper meaning of the architectural style in which he was working. Thus Trinity's buttresses do nothing to support the structure of the nave, but are merely decoration. The ceiling is plaster, not made of real stone vaults.
But if Trinity does not satisfy Gothic purists, no matter; the church is in the noble tradition of American picturesque interpretations of historical architectural styles. And the nave is a magnificent space, its size a tantalizing balance between the grandeur of a cathedral and the intimacy of a country church. If it is less ornate than many churches, it is hardly austere; there is a crisp, tensile feeling to Upjohn's interior, which glows with -- if this makes any sense -- a kind of glorious, enriching restraint.
But the same can be said of the entire building, inside and out: here are intense control and strong emotion, interdependent and together. An icon on the cityscape, a serene space within, Trinity Church defines, as brilliantly as in any piece of architecture in New York, the notion of passion contained.

 CORRECTION:
A chronology on Tuesday with an article about the 150th anniversary of the Trinity Church building referred incorrectly to Trinity School. It is the oldest continuously operating school in New York City. Collegiate School, founded in 1628 but closed from 1776 to 1783, is the oldest school.

GRAPHIC: Photos: The skyscrapers of the Financial District now overshadow Trinity Church, left, but they have not been able to erase its impact. An original drawing of the Episcopal church, right, first published with a study of its architect, Richard Upjohn, shows it as it was in 1839: a neo-Gothic giant looming over the placid countryside that once was Wall Street and Broadway.

HEADLINE: Remembrance of Cheap Meals Past

BYLINE: By FRANK J. PRIAL 

 BODY:
TO most Americans, France, and particularly Paris, seems immutable, unchanging, wedded to past glory. In many ways that is so -- but not when it comes to restaurants. A comparison between the Michelin guide for 1996 and the same guide for 1971 shows that the only thing constant on the Paris restaurant scene is change.
Here is a quote from the Michelin of a quarter-century ago: 
 "However much they may enjoy fine cooking and 'starred' meals, motorists will sometimes want to stop at more ordinary restaurants serving moderately priced meals.
"We thought that it might be of interest to indicate those offering the passing tourist a well-prepared meal, if possible regional in character, for not more than 17 francs in all."
That was about $3.40.
In fact, it's not difficult to thumb through the 25-year-old guide and find many country restaurants where lunch cost not $3.40, but $2 or $2.50, plus about 75 cents for a carafe of the local wine. Michelin still has a bargain list of country restaurants, but the maximum price now is 110 francs, under $25. And there is no more 75-cent wine.
The Michelin guide's highest accolade for a restaurant is three stars. In 1971, dinner at a three-star restaurant in Paris -- there were four, one less than now -- cost $14 to $20 before drinks and service. The 1996 guide notes that Lucas Carton, one of the current three stars, charges up to 1,230 francs, or about $255 a person, for a meal -- without wine or service.
The exchange rate is not to blame. In 1979 it dipped briefly below four francs to a dollar, and in the mid-80's it hovered for a time at just over 10. But in 1971 it was almost exactly what it is now: just over five francs to the dollar.
Inflation is another story. What cost $100 in this country in 1971 would cost $374 now. What cost $100 in Paris in 1971 would cost about $660 now. But as the price of a meal at Lucas Carton shows, the top restaurants have outstripped even France's relatively high inflation rate. The restaurant people cite the cost of the best ingredients, labor, of course, and onerous taxes. The value-added tax on a restaurant meal in France is just over 20 percent.
Some advice for food-loving Francophiles planning their summer pilgrimages: bring lots of money or lots of credit. A respectable one-star restaurant in Paris, like the well-known bistro Benoit, will charge $65 to $90 a person for dinner, exclusive of tips and drinks. And prices in the provinces are not much lower. At the one-star Le Galion in Concarneau, Brittany, a meal will cost $50 to $65.
Running a successful restaurant in France takes it toll. The four three-star restaurants in Paris in 1971 were Maxim's, Tour d'Argent, Lasserre and Grand Vefour. Not one retains its three stars in 1996.
The top five today are Lucas Carton, which rose to three stars under different management, stumbled badly and returned to glory under the skilled direction of Alain Senderens; Taillevent, which had two stars in 1971; l'Ambroisie and l'Arpege, neither of which existed 25 years ago, and Joel Robuchon, which was known as Jamin before Mr. Robuchon arrived in 1981. In 1971, Jamin had one star, and dinner there topped out at about $18.
Of the 18 two-star restaurants in Paris in 1971, only five remain in that group. Taillevent moved up to three stars; so did Lucas Carton, but under Mr. Senderens it is entirely different. Many disappeared, including Chez Max, Chez Garin and the Relais Paris-Est, a fine restaurant in the Gare de l'Est railroad station.
There were 46 one-star restaurants in Paris in 1971. There are 58 in 1996, including six from nearby suburbs. Of the 1971 one-stars, two remain, Benoit and Sousceyrac. A few have moved up, but more than 30 have disappeared, some into the country, where there is less pressure, and some into oblivion.
Curiously, this year's one-stars include Maxim's, but not the legendary one in the Rue Royale. This one is at Orly airport, south of the city. The original Maxim's was removed from the guide years ago, at the restaurant's request. Brasserie Lipp, the famed Left Bank political and show business hangout, made the same request years ago.
The Michelin inspectors can be tough. In the 1982 guide, they dropped 52 one-stars. They can be sentimental, too. Paris's Tour d'Argent was finally dropped this year after years of complaints about food and service.
Similarly, they let La Pyramide in Vienne keep its three stars for 32 years after the death of its founder, Fernand Pont. La Pyramide was the guide's first three-star restaurant, in 1933. The stars remained a year after Mr. Pont's widow died in 1986.
Yet to appear are the American invaders, McDonald's, Pizza Hut and Burger King, of which there are more than 100 in Paris and environs. But none of the more modest French chains have made it in, either.

HEADLINE: Benign Chaos in India

 BODY:
The spirited jockeying for power since India's election is proving difficult even for insiders to follow. But as countless political blocs trade votes and float possible candidates for prime minister, it appears likely that an alliance of centrist and leftist parties will try to form a government, shutting the main Hindu chauvinist party out of power even though it received the most votes. For all the confusion, the horse-trading is reassuring. Politics is the force that binds India together.
For most of the years since independence, India has held itself together under the leadership of the founding Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, or his daughter, Indira Gandhi, or her son, Rajiv Gandhi. But dynastic rule at the top, while spawning corruption, has never stunted the development of a vibrant political culture. India's functionaries, bureaucrats and special-interest lobbyists relish the benign chaos of democratic politics. 
 Whatever government is formed will likely be weak, since no single grouping commands a majority vote. It now appears possible that the long-governing Congress Party, reduced to 25 percent of the seats in Parliament, will support the establishment of a centrist-leftist government but not join it. The strategy would be to block the Hindu rightists from power as a danger to India's secular traditions and stability. By holding the margin of control in Parliament, the Congress Party would theoretically be able to choose when to topple the government in hopes of winning the next national election. Both Mrs. Gandhi in 1977 and Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 withdrew crucial outside support from weak non-Congress Governments, to their benefit.
The Hindu rightists in the National People's Party complain that they have not been asked by President Shankar Dayal Sharma to form a government. But many in India assume that the party is not eager to form a government itself, and that like the Congress Party, it hopes that any new government will be so weak that it will fall within two years. The Indian People's Party has moved away from its strident Hindu chauvinist rhetoric, but it has yet to prove itself free of intolerance.
Perhaps the most important development of this election is the full flowering of politics based on caste, particularly the striving of the lower castes who have submerged their political identity in the past. To the early modernizers like Nehru, caste was the bane of Indian civilization. They never outlawed caste identity, but they dreamed of the day when it would not hold people back. In the meantime, as they appealed to the lower castes to join their party's drive for equality and secularism, Congress politicians balanced their tickets based on caste as surely as American politicians have searched for balanced tickets of their own.
Until the last decade or so, the Congress Party succeeded with the support of these lower castes, as well as the nation's huge Muslim minority. But as economic growth has created new centers of wealth and left many behind, resentments among the lower castes have welled up across the country, creating new parties, some of them regionally based.
Some of these castes are officially labeled "backward" by law but have substantial wealth, large numbers and competing factions of their own. Their demand for representation in a new government is healthy. A new generation of caste-based politicians might help cleanse the government of corruption while adding energy to India's lively politics.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Corn Prices Retreat on Forecasts Of Improved Planting Weather

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Corn prices fell yesterday after weather forecasts showed improved conditions for planting, though an Agriculture Department economist warned of isolated shortages before the crop arrives.
In other activity, cattle prices rose while heating oil fell. 
 On Monday, forecasts for rain in Illinois, Missouri and other regions sent corn prices surging on concern that farm equipment would be kept from muddy fields. After trading, the National Weather Service said the rain would end before the weekend, when a period of drier weather and warmer temperatures would allow farmers back to their fields to plant this year's crop.
"It looks warmer and drier, which should allow plantings to pick up," said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago. "This is an example of how sensitive the market is to the weather."
Corn prices rebounded on concern that there could be shortages before the next harvest. The Agriculture Department's chief economist, Keith Collins, said it was "highly likely" that there would be isolated shortages of corn before this year's crop arrives in September.
Corn for July delivery settled 5 cents lower at $4.8725 a bushel at the Chicago Board of Trade after dropping its 12-cent daily limit, to $4.8025 a bushel, earlier in the day.
While the rain has delayed planting in eastern crop regions, farmers are mostly ahead of schedule. The Agriculture Department said on Monday that 53 percent of this year's crop had been planted, up from 41 percent last week and ahead of the 51 percent average for this time of year.
"Planting in the western Corn Belt is really coming along," said Randy Mittelstaedt, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Company in Chicago.
Cattle prices rose amid speculation that the number of cattle being fattened for slaughter was falling.
Analysts expect that a report from the Agriculture Department due on Friday will show that the number of cattle placed in feedlots fell in April from a year earlier, as feedlot owner's reacted to soaring prices for corn and soybeans.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Moves by Bank of Japan Spur Dollar's Sharp Rise Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against the Japanese yen and other leading currencies after the Bank of Japan drove down short-term interest rates, surprising those who had been betting on an increase.
The dollar's rise against the yen and German mark was aided by strong showings in American stock and bond markets, which were buoyed by economic data indicating tame inflation in the United States. 
 Traders had been buying yen on the prospect that a revived Japanese economy would bring higher interest rates. But the Japanese central bank bought short-term debt securities yesterday -- effectively shaving their rates and confirming its monthslong policy of cutting rates.
"The market has switched back to selling the yen" after realizing the Bank of Japan was saying "this is not the right time" to raise rates, said Dennis Pettit, a foreign exchange manager at the New York office of Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
After rising as high as 106.04 yen, the dollar settled in New York at 105.88 yen, up from 104.98 yen on Monday. The dollar traded at 1.5340 marks, up from 1.5333 marks. The British pound was unchanged at $1.5140.
Traders bought yen Monday as published reports added to speculation that the Bank of Japan would start raising interest rates, making the yen and yen-denominated assets more attractive.
But the central bank sent out different signals, saying yesterday that it had bought nearly 400 billion yen worth of corporate and Government securities that expire this month.
Those purchases put money into circulation and helped lower short-term rates slightly. The move sent the yen falling against the dollar and mark. Lower rates make a country's assets and currency less attractive to investors.
"All the action has been yen and yen-related" transactions against other currencies, Mr. Pettit said. "It's dragged the dollar up."
Traders also realized that the German central bank, whose policy-setting council meets today, is not likely to change interest rates amid indications the economy is rebounding.
Still, traders protectively squared their positions in the afternoon and trimmed the dollar's gains against the German currency.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Monday, were: 1.2505 Swiss francs, up from 1.2490; 5.1951 French francs, up from 5.1850; 1,556 Italian lire, unchanged, and 1.3684 Canadian dollars, down from 1.3705.

HEADLINE: India Alliance Drops Communist as Its Candidate for Premier

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 14

 BODY:
Efforts to form a government that can block Hindu nationalists from power took an unexpected turn today when an alliance of centrist, leftist and regional groups dropped India's top Communist leader as its nominee for Prime Minister and selected a little-known regional leader instead.
The new prospect, H. D. Deve Gowda, heads the government of the southern state of Karnataka. As Chief Minister there, he has promoted foreign investment, particularly in Bangalore, the state capital, which is known as one of India's most economically dynamic cities. Several major American corporations have investments in Bangalore, and their executives have generally spoken positively of Mr. Deve Gowda. 
 The switch to Mr. Deve Gowda, who is in his early 60's, came after the main left-wing group, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), held a fractious central committee meeting in New Delhi that ended with a decision not to put forward its leader, Jyoti Basu, for Prime Minister, and not to join directly any center-left government.
The decision was a rebuff to other parties in the alliance known as the National Front-Left Front, which had settled on Mr. Basu as their prime ministerial candidate on Tuesday and announced that they had the Communists' backing for the move.
Some leading Communists favored accepting the offer, which would have ended nearly 50 years of being excluded from power in New Delhi. But the argument that prevailed was one long advanced by Mr. Basu, the 81-year-old Chief Minister of West Bengal state, who has said joining or leading a government in which Communists would be a small minority would entail too great a compromise of Communist principles.
"We felt that with the numbers we have, it would not be possible to effect any fundamental change in government policies," said Sitaram Mechury, an aide to Mr. Basu.
Mr. Deve Gowda went to see India's titular President, Shankar Dayal Sharma, and told him that he was ready to form a government. But the political arithmetic after last week's inconclusive election meant that Mr. Sharma would have to weigh the competing claims of the Deve Gowda group and the Hindu nationalists before deciding which was more likely to form a government that has any chance of lasting.
Mr. Sharma's decision could come at any time after noon on Wednesday, when the election commission will formally report the election results to the President.
He will face a choice between the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and its allies, with a total of about 195 seats in the 545-seat lower house of Parliament, and the National Front--Left Front, which will have direct control of only about 125 seats, but the likelihood of support on an issue-by-issue basis from two other major groups, the Congress Party and four Communist groups, with a total of 190 seats.
Mr. Sharma's decision could hinge on his assessment of how reliable the backing of the Congress Party and the Communists would be.
Few Indians have forgotten the political instability that set in the last time the country was ruled by minority governments with support of other parties.
In 16 months beginning in December 1989, two center-left Governments collapsed when first the Hindu nationalists, then the Congress Party withdrew support. A new election was needed, and it resulted in the Congress Party's governing for five years until this election.
India's problem now, once again, is that the fragmentation of the electorate, which routed the Congress Party and divided its support among 20 other groups, appears to leave little prospect of a coherent government.
While the Hindu nationalists' parliamentary bloc appears fairly solid, with the Bharatiya Janata Party supported by four other groups, other Parliament groups have shunned them. But those other groups, in turn, have been unable to put together a convincing majority, leaving many Indians convinced that another election may be inevitable within as little as a year.
The role of the Congress Party in the maneuvering has been widely criticized among Indians. Although it voted at a weekend meeting to support a center-left government, the departing Prime Minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, has not given up hope of returning to power if the center-left alliance's efforts collapse and other groups turn to the Congress Party to lead a new government.
Again today, Mr. Rao's spokesman, V. N. Gadgil, issued ambivalent statements about Mr. Deve Gowda's bid to form a government, saying the Congress Party would decide whether to support the candidate after talks. "It is a matter of discussion, debate and negotiation," he said.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Approves Home AIDS Test; Marketing Is to Begin in June

BYLINE: By WARREN E. LEARY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration today approved the first home screening test for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS.
A person using the test kit would draw blood from a finger, put it on a special laboratory paper and mail the sample to a certified testing laboratory. The results would be provided a week later by telephone. 
 Next month the test kit will be available over the counter in Texas and also by mail in Texas and Florida, said the manufacturer. It will be marketed nationwide early next year at pharmacies, health centers, clinics and other retail outlets.
The kit, the Confide H.I.V. Testing Service, was developed and is being marketed by Direct Access Diagnostics of Bridgewater, N.J., a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. The retail price of the test will be about $40, and clinics serving poor people should be able to make it available for about $30, the company said.
Steve Michael of Act-Up, an AIDS advocacy and protest group, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying most people in the AIDS community applauded the new kit. For people in some rural communities, where confidentiality is difficult to preserve, he said, the mail-in specimen may be the only way to have H.I.V. testing done and keep the results secret.
The company decided to make the test available first in two states so it can gain experience with the system, said Arissa B. Cunningham, director of marketing for the company.
Texas and Florida, where residents will be able to buy the Confide kit by calling a toll-free telephone number, were selected for the initial sales because of their ethnically and economically diverse populations and because they have high incidences of AIDS, she said.
The F.D.A. said it had approved the home test because more than 60 percent of Americans at risk of contracting the virus had not been tested. A 1994 study by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of people at increased risk of infection, like intravenous drug users and sexually active homosexual men 42 percent indicated that they would use a home test.
Dr. Curt L. Scribner, deputy director of the F.D.A.'s Office of Blood Research and Review, said home-based tests, first submitted to the agency in 1987, can now be approved because of advances in testing technology, new treatments for H.I.V.-infected people who do not have symptoms of disease and a shift in thinking on the part of public health experts about getting test results by telephone.
The first proposed home-based test was submitted to the F.D.A. by University Hospital Laboratories of Bethesda, Md., and its founder, Elliott J. Millenson. Much like the test approved today, the test called for drawing blood at home, mailing the blood-stained sample paper to a laboratory and having consumers call in to get results from trained counselors or nurses.
The agency refused to consider the test for approval, saying it would only consider tests done in a professional setting where patients could get results directly from a doctor or trained professional. In 1990, the F.D.A. said it had changed its policy on home tests and would consider them, but it did not approve any.
Home AIDS testing initially was opposed by advocacy groups for people with AIDS, clinics doing conventional testing, several medical groups, and others. Mr. Millenson and other proponents of the home test concept contended that the F.D.A. was bowing to outside pressure in not considering the tests for approval.
Dr. Scribner denied that the F.D.A. had unnecessarily delayed the approval of home tests, saying that the technology behind the tests had improved and that attitudes about telephone counseling had changed. An agency advisory committee concluded in 1994 that it was possible to develop a good system for H.I.V. counseling over the phone, he said.
"It is not really the same test submitted eight years ago," Dr. Scribner said. "It's been an evolutionary process. And people were finally able to put together a system that we could agree on to get good results and provide the appropriate advice over the telephone."
A week after a customer sends in a blood sample obtained with a retractable lancet, the manufacturer said, he calls a toll-free number and gives a confidential identification number from the kit. Negative results are provided by an automated message, which includes information about what negative findings mean.
Positive or inconclusive results are given personally by certified counselors, in either English or Spanish, who also can provide local medical referrals. All results are anonymous, the company said.

HEADLINE: President Appoints New Board Members For Troubled Fund

 BODY:
President Clinton has appointed a new board of directors to decide the future of a troubled Government fund that is supposed to promote capitalism in the Czech Republic and Slovakia by investing in private companies.
The $65 million Czech and Slovak American Enterprise Fund, financed by the Federal Government but managed by American businessmen, has been plagued by mismanagement, high expenses and poor investments. A Federal investigation critical of the fund's former chairman led to his ouster last November and prompted a protracted fight among the directors; in late February, the entire board quit. 
 A statement from the White House press office said the new board, officially appointed last Thursday, "has been asked to serve for a limited period, during which it will oversee the management of the fund."
The options include merging the fund with a similar but more successful fund like the Hungarian American Enterprise Fund; focusing it on Slovakia, which has economic problems much worse than those of the Czech Republic, or closing it down, said Donald L. Pressley, a deputy assistant administrator at the Agency for International Development, which monitors the fund.
The new chairman of the fund is John J. Cavanaugh, a former Democratic Representative from Omaha who is the chief executive of a consulting firm that advises American companies on doing business in Russia and Eastern Europe. The other two board members are E. Patrick Coady, a former United States executive director of the World Bank, and Hughlyn F. Fierce, a retired senior vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank who ran the bank's Asian operations.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Up As Inflation Stays Benign

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday after a report on consumer prices showed inflation continuing to be benign.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32 , to 8914/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.83 percent, from 6.89 percent on Monday. 
 Prices rose after the Labor Department said that the Consumer Price Index rose four-tenths of 1 percent in April, pushed up by a surge in energy prices as expected. But the so-called core C.P.I. -- which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy -- inched up only one-tenth of 1 percent.
"There is a faint whiff of inflation in the air, but it smells mostly like gasoline," said Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at the PNC Bank Corporation in Pittsburgh.
Some market participants said the consumer prices data suggested that the Federal Reserve was not likely to change current monetary policy when Fed policy makers meet next week.
"The April Consumer Price Index and retail sales reports portray a low-inflation, modest-growth economy," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch & Company. "The two reports should reduce fears of Fed tightening and economic overheating."
Concerns about growth and inflation accelerating were also eased by a Commerce Department report that showed retail sales fell three-tenths of 1 percent in April, pulled down by a 2.5 percent decline in auto sales.
"The April inflation and retail sales reports have reassured the bond market that the energy price spike has not spread into other prices, and that consumer spending continues to grow moderately, especially excluding auto sales," Mr. Hoffman of PNC Bank said.
"With the risk of recession now more evenly balanced with the risk of faster inflation, Fed policy makers should readily agree at their meeting next Tuesday to maintain the status quo," he said.
Another report, a survey of regional business activity by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, tempered buying yesterday as it showed some strength. The Atlanta Fed's index showed a decline of four-tenths of 1 percent in April, compared with a revised decline of six-tenths of 1 percent in March, while the prices-paid component surged to 14.2 in April against a decline of 1.5 in March.
Nonetheless, Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank at Bank of Boston, said there was nothing in the Atlanta Fed numbers to be concerned about since the survey reflected development for this summer's Olympics in Atlanta.
Kenneth T. Mayland, chief economist at Keycorp, a $65 billion Cleveland-based bank holding company, called yesterday's data market friendly for both fixed income and stocks. "I think both figures will help to push out the expected timing of a Fed tightening," he said.
"In the past two or three weeks we have seen the market price in two and as many as three Fed tightenings. And the pricings are now being pushed out."
Over the next couple of months Mr. Mayland sees improvement in the market, "but we won't go from 6.85 percent to 6.25 percent in a straight line, we'll likely make another 7 percent on the long bond along the way."
Larry M. Berman, senior fixed- income analyst with Technical Data of Boston, thinks significant resistance awaits at 6.80 percent. "While the market has enough momentum to test this level later in the week, it is not expected to get below it on the first attempt," he said.

HEADLINE: Energy Costs Pushed Consumer Prices Up 0.4% in April

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Energy prices registered their biggest monthly increase in nearly six years during April, the Government reported yesterday. But despite the rise, caused largely by higher gasoline prices, the report showed that the underlying rate of consumer inflation remained in check.
In a separate report, the Commerce Department said that retail sales fell last month, their first decline in six months. 
 Financial markets, which have been roiled in recent weeks by the sharp increase in the price of oil and other commodities, interpreted the new reports as a reassuring indication that inflation was not about to surge and that the economy was on a path of moderate growth. After the reports were issued, stock and bond prices jumped.
"The numbers confirm that so far the inflation pressures we are seeing in commodity markets have not been transmitted into general upward pressure on consumer prices," said David Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International.
In its inflation report, the Labor Department said the Consumer Price Index rose by four-tenths of 1 percent in April, the same rate of increase as in March. The Commerce Department said retail sales fell by three-tenths of 1 percent, a drop caused in large part by the biggest monthly decline in auto sales in five years.
Much of the reason for the rise in consumer prices was a jump of 3.2 percent in energy prices. The increase was the fifth consecutive rise for energy prices and the biggest since October 1990, when petroleum markets were reeling in reaction to the Persian Gulf crisis.
The news on the underlying inflation rate was much different. Excluding food and energy prices, which are generally volatile, consumer prices rose one-tenth of 1 percent in April.
The report on consumer prices was in line with market expectations and followed a report on Friday that showed that producer prices, excluding energy prices, were largely unchanged in April.
"The data on producer prices, retail sales and consumer prices acted in concert to alleviate some of the worst fears in financial markets," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "But they have not eliminated them completely. Even though it was mostly due to energy, a four-tenths-of-a-percent increase in consumer prices is not a favorable statistic."
Indeed, some economists said financial market participants were making a mistake to place too much emphasis on the salutary aspects of yesterday's inflation figures.
"I reject the notion that you have to focus on the core inflation rate," said Stephen S. Roach, chief economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "I am not persuaded there is nothing to worry about on the inflation front, because the so-called core rate never rises in the immediate aftermath of a rise in energy and food prices."
Energy prices have been moderating a bit in recent days, and financial market participants may also have bid up stock and bond prices on the expectation that the worst of the increase is over.
"At the consumer price level, the rise in gasoline prices is over, provided there are no more refinery accidents," said Philip K. Verleger, an energy economist at Charles River Associates in Washington. A number of fires and other incidents have slowed production at refineries in the United States this year, including an explosion at a Shell refinery in Martinez, Calif., in April.
"If there are more of those, we will see another real hit in gasoline price inflation, because there is no flexibility in the system and no inventories are being held," Mr. Verleger said.
Economists said they were not alarmed about the slide in retail sales, partly because in issuing its report yesterday, the Commerce Department revised upward its estimates of what was spent during February and March.
"Is the April number that we got today as weak as it seems?" Mr. Fine asked. "The answer is, probably not. But it does suggest sales are moderating from previous months, when we had very strong consumer spending."
Mr. Fine and other analysts said yesterday's figures reinforced their view of an economy expanding at a rate close to the 2 to 2.5 percent a year preferred by policy makers at the Federal Reserve, who see that as a level not likely to fuel inflationary pressures.
As a consequence, monetary policy is likely to remain unchanged at next week's meeting of the Fed's Open Market Committee, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Agriculture Dept. Rebuffed on School Lunches

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
In school cafeterias throughout the United States, the vexing issue of the day has been fat.
Specifically, how should the 93,000 schools in the National School Lunch Program meet new Federal guidelines requiring that children consume no more than 30 percent of their weekly calories from fat. 
 School chefs wheeled into action, tossing out their deep-fat fryers and rinsing fatty clots from ground beef before cooking it. Kitchens stopped buying butter and started making pizza with low-fat cheese. Many schools met the goal in advance of the July 1 deadline.
But that was not enough for the Agriculture Department, which oversees the $4.4 billion-a-year program that serves 25 million children a day. The department wanted to force schools to feed children nearly twice as much bread, pasta, fruits and vegetables as they do now to shrink the share of fat in school lunches. Even schools that met the new standard would have been affected.
"They were using an elephant gun to kill a fly," said Paul McElwain, director of school and community nutrition for the Kentucky Department of Education.
In response to protests from cafeteria workers and school administrators who said the proposal would cost schools millions of dollars for extra food that would most likely go to waste, the House today approved a bill by voice vote that would allow school cooks to serve whatever they want so long as the meals met the new Federal dietary guidelines.
The bill now advances to the Senate, where passage is widely expected.
"The bottom line is that schools know best what children will eat," said Representative Bill Goodling, a Pennsylvania Republican who heads the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee.
Democrats and Republicans say the episode illustrates how a well-meaning Federal agency carrying out a long-overdue change in nutritional standards barged into an area where local school districts know best.
"The bureaucracy wandered off the reservation and tried to grab control of this program," said Representative George Miller, a California Democrat on the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee.
Critics of the Agriculture Department proposal pointed to several examples as evidence that the agency was out of touch with what children eat and what school kitchens can reasonably prepare.
For instance, the department commissioned a group of famous chefs, including Anne Rosenzweig of Arcadia in Manhattan and Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., to donate recipes for dishes ranging from tabouleh to marinated black bean salad.
"I'm sure there are places in the country where tabouleh will go over well with kids, but not here," Mr. McElwain said.
A recipe for brownies called for separating the yolks and whites of 200 eggs (to use only the less fatty whites). "Not many schools have the staff to do that," Mr. McElwain said.
Ellen Haas, the Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, who had opposed the bill, said today that the legislation provided both "flexibility" to school kitchens and "insures accountability" to the new Federal standard.
The dispute came after the Agriculture Department issued proposed regulations in June 1994 to require schools to use computers to analyze the nutrients in each of the foods they served. Many rural schools complained that this would be too costly.
So Congress added another option that would allow schools to serve food groups with known nutrient levels, and have state regulators insure compliance with the Federal standards.
But the Agriculture Department wrote regulations that resulted in the more costly menus. "Big Brother was at work once again in micromanaging how schools went about this task," Mr. Goodling, a former school principal and superintendent, said earlier this month.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
Corporations respond to the Florida crash with concern but no hasty changes in flight policies.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
EVEN as investigators are trying to determine the cause of the Valujet crash in the Everglades, corporate business travelers are re-examining their policies regarding low-cost airlines. Yesterday, the National Business Travel Association, whose 5,000 members spent $31.7 billion on business travel in 1995, asked the Federal Government to take a close look at such carriers.
"While cost savings are important to the traveling public, safety must be the primary consideration," said Judie Shyman, the president of the Washington-based organization. "A review of training, inspection and general safety guidelines is clearly necessary in the wake of the Valujet crash. According to published reports, the F.A.A.'s Inspector General has referred to serious discrepancies in airline inspections, parts, training and the air traffic control system." 
 Corporate America relies on the Federal Aviation Administration for airline safety, Ms. Shyman noted.
The Valujet crash has not produced a "panic situation" among the association members, the group said, perhaps because not many of the members regularly fly low-cost airlines. But half the passengers on low-cost Southwest Airlines, which has had an exemplary safety record in its 25 years, are business travelers, and that percentage is unlikely to drop as a result of the Valujet tragedy.
Another discount carrier, the Newark-based Kiwi International Air Lines, said yesterday that 41 percent of its passengers were traveling for business and that it did not expect that percentage to change because of the Florida crash. Kiwi, like Southwest, has never had a fatal accident, although its record is much shorter, having been in operation less than four years.
Rosenbluth International, a leading business travel agency, has had inquiries from corporate clients since the crash, seeking recommendations. "But we pointed out various options, and most of them decided not to make changes," said Liz Joseph, a Rosenbluth spokeswoman.
The National Business Travel Association is not recommending that members shun or favor particular airlines. "What we're saying," Ms. Shyman said, "is that it's time for each corporation to address the questions that were raised by the Inspector General."
 
Unwanted Bubbles
Orange juice, white wine and mineral water are offered in Swissair business class before takeoff, but not champagne. An economy move? Not according to the airline, which said that test offerings that included champagne "showed a surprising lack of demand."
 
Shortening the Red Tape
Passengers bound from Los Angeles to Sydney on Qantas Airways of Australia can now clear immigration even before their flight departs the United States -- a saving of up to 45 minutes, according to the airline.
When a passenger checks into Los Angeles International Airport the agent scans his or her passport in a Qantas computer, which is linked with Australia's customs and immigration computers. The agent receives almost instant verification of the passenger's name, date of birth, sex, passport number, country of birth and nationality. That information is printed out on a card that will be required upon arrival in Sydney, where it will be scanned again. Because there are special lanes for passengers using this system, time spent standing in line is minimal.
The new procedure, which was tested for six months, is a result of cooperation by customs officials in the United States and Australia. According to Qantas, the American immigration officials say they will have the system working for flights to Los Angeles in a few months. The airline plans to try to expand the service to destinations worldwide.
 
Restoration and Innovation
Hotel Inter-Continental New York, owned by the Saison Corporation of Japan, has completed a $20 million renovation to restore the Old World atmosphere that existed when the building was erected as the Barclay in 1926.
But as if to demonstrate that charm need not be synonymous with old-fashioned, the hotel has a new business center that through Aug. 31 will allow guests to send or receive up to 10 faxed pages on Fridays at no cost. At breakfast, guests can use a preprinted pad at each table to check off services they require -- from access to a fax machine, to express checkout to limousine service.
Beginning June 1, members of the Inter-Continental chain's Six Continents Club will be met at the airports in the New York area by uniformed chauffeurs who will perform the hotel check-in over the car phone, allowing the guest to bypass the front desk.

HEADLINE: U.S.-CHINA TALKS OVER PIRACY FAIL

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, May 14

 BODY:
Two days of last-ditch talks ended today without resolving the wide differences that remain between China and the United States over Chinese pirating of software, music and movies, and the discord drew the two nations ever closer to a trade war.
The United States still accuses China of failing to carry out broad sections of an agreement reached last year on the piracy issue, while China maintains that it is proud of its record of protecting intellectual property rights. 
 Their inability to agree sets in motion a series of punitive actions by the United States. The first step is expected to be the publication of a list of Chinese exports to the United States worth about $3 billion a year that could be subject to 100 percent tariffs.
By mid-June, when the sanctions are to be imposed, the list is likely to be slimmed down to about $2 billion worth or less. Chinese trade officials have said they expect to retailiate with their own sanctions.
In the last four years, negotiations between Chinese and American trade officials have been prone to posturing and public threats that melted away as an agreement was reached moments before a deadline. But the strained political climate between Beijing and Washington -- and the unpredictability of election-year politics -- make this year's outcome harder to foretell.
Lee Sands, an assistant United States trade representative, led the American side in two days of meetings with officials from China's Trade Ministry. No further talks have been scheduled, a United States official said.
A Chinese spokesman blamed the failure of this round of talks on the Americans.
"During the meetings, the Chinese side has shown great sincerity," said the spokesman, Cui Tiankui of the Foreign Ministry's Information Department. "The American side did not make any favorable response to the positions expressed by the Chinese side. The consultations made little progress."
A Chinese copyright official went so far as to assert that China is the best protector of intellectual property rights in the world, rather than a notorious pirate of copyrights and trademarks of all shapes and sizes, as the Americans assert.
"China has done a better job than any other country in the world in its resolute protection of intellectual property rights," said the official, Wang Huapeng, the director of the copyright department of China's National Copyright Administration, in a report by the New China News Agency.
American officials have said they are proceeding with trade sanctions because China has fallen short of enforcing intellectual property violations as spelled out in a landmark agreement reached in February 1995. Chinese officials insist that they have held up their end of the bargain.
"By taking strong measures on cracking down on piracy and protecting intellectual property rights, China has comprehensively fulfilled its obligations," Mr. Cui said today.
The bramble of sharply diverging Chinese and American views over what it means to enforce intellectual property violations point to different expectations and concepts of what is reasonable. To the Americans, Beijing has simply not made intellectual property rights a political priority; to the Chinese, Americans are making demands that are intrusive and unreasonable.
A prime area of dispute, for example, has been how to police the 31 known producers of compact disks, repeatedly cited by the Americans because factories producing them are one of the highest-profile areas of piracy. Almost all of the 31 factories are believed to have illegally copied music or movies at some time.
Chinese officials assert that they have made progress, pointing to the way that they have suspended operations at some of the plants, and started supervising the remaining ones. Mr. Wang cited the assignment oftwo supervisors to each compact disk maker as evidence that Beijing is getting tough on offenders.
In practice, American officials argue, the supervisors often spend only a few hours a day, if that, at a plant, and the supervisors say they cannot possibly monitor plants 24 hours a day. Music industry executives say many compact disk factories simply produce legal recordings during the day and illegal ones at night.
For that reason, some American officials argue, the problem will not be resolved until factories found pirating are permanently closed and see their equipment destroyed, or until offenders are punished with jail terms and sizable fines.
To many local Chinese officials, the idea of destroying expensive, state-of-the-art equipment for an abstract notion of protecting someone's intellectual property rights is almost impossible to swallow.
In Washington, Leon Panetta, the White House Chief of Staff, said that the last-minute talks had yielded little. "They have not accepted any of the steps that we have recommended," he said. "Therefore I think the sanctions are going to be well targeted to get the message across."
Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, will announce the contents of the list. Administration officials have said that the sanctions would be aimed chiefly at clothing and textiles, industries that are still largely Government-owned. But they will also include toys, electronics and other major Chinese exports.
As news of the sanctions list began to leak out, furious lobbying began by American retailers fearful that their businesses will suffer -- an echo of the lobbying last year by car dealers who fought threatened sanctions against Japanese luxury cars.
The National Retail Federation, which represents businesses around the country, issued a statement complaining that the Administration was protecting Hollywood at the expense of middle-class wage earners who buy their clothes at discount stores.

HEADLINE: $2.3 Billion Deal Creates Giant In Managing of Doctors' Offices

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
For more than a decade, doctors have complained, to little avail, as employers, managed-care companies and, later, hospitals came together in competing organizations dedicated to squeezing down health care costs -- and, in the process, limiting physicians' incomes and independence.
But recently many doctors have been fighting back, trying to negotiate a better deal for themselves and regain their autonomy. One way has been to sell their practices to a new breed of companies that manage the doctors' business affairs and strengthen their bargaining power as they negotiate with health maintenance organizations and other cost-cutting purchasers of health services. 
 The creation of by far the biggest such company was announced yesterday. Medpartners/Mullikin Inc., a physician-practice management company, said it would buy Caremark International Inc., which has a similar business, in a stock-swap transaction valued at $2.34 billion.
The new company, Medpartners Inc., would have contracts with 7,250 physicians, mainly in Southern California and across the South and Southwest. And its top executives say this is just the beginning: they plan to buy many more physician groups and the companies that manage them.
Besides handling negotiations with purchasers, physician-practice management companies typically provide computerized systems that help doctors weigh the economic risks of providing medical care to groups at a set charge per head. The management companies also take control of the doctors' office expenses and other nonmedical functions.
Both Medpartners, which has been a recent favorite of investors, and Caremark have been buying doctor groups at a rapid rate. Together their doctor groups will have contracts covering 1.5 million patients
They will be especially strong in five Southern California counties, where their contracts will cover 6 percent of the population and 15 percent of the doctors.
"We want to be the superconsolidators," said Larry R. House, who founded Medpartners two and a half years ago. He will preside as chief executive over a company with $4.4 billion in combined 1996 revenues -- about 2 percent of the $200 billion annual incomes of all physicians in the country.
The shares of Caremark rose 75 cents yesterday, to $29.50, while shares of Medpartners fell $1.125, to $25, on the New York Stock Exchange.
Subject to stockholder and regulatory approvals, each Caremark share would be exchanged for 1.21 shares of Medpartners/Mullikin; at yesterday's closing price, 1.21 shares of Medpartners would be worth $30.25.
Still, the deal's terms reflect the stock market's high opinion of Medpartners; its stock has been priced around 35 times projected earnings. With shares so highly valued, companies can use stock to raise the big amounts needed to pay for the expensive information systems for doctor groups and the costs of expanding across the country.
"This is a beauty contest in a lot of markets trying to convince doctors to sign up," said Lawrence Marsh, a health care analyst with Wheat First Securities in Richmond. He said the new company's increased size would add to its recruiting appeal.
Earlier this year, Medpartners, which is based in Birmingham, Ala., acquired two California-based companies: Pacific Physician Services Inc., in a stock deal valued at $322 million, and Mullikin Medical Enterprises L.P., in a $412 million deal.
In California, where managed care is strong and H.M.O.'s have been in the driver's seat, doctors have seen their monthly payments per person fall for the last 18 months, said Joan Trauner, president of PM2 Inc., a consulting firm in San Francisco.
Listing other reasons the physician-practice managers have been growing, she said that in private partnerships the older physicians often pressed for a sale as a way for them to cash out. Also, practicing doctors are attracted by the companies' promise to provide the expensive computing services needed to handle the increasing amounts of patient information required by employers and the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Although Caremark is the bigger company, Medpartners/Mullikin directors will outnumber Caremark members 9 to 4 on the new board. Caremark has a lower price-earnings multiple, about 22, than does Medpartners. "You need to continue to do acquisitions," said Lance Piccolo, chief executive of Caremark, which is based in Northbrook, Ill. "We were not enjoying the kind of stock multiples that our competitors had" as they bid against each other to take over new medical groups.
Mr. Piccolo said he would be vice chairman of the board and a consultant to the new company. He said he had decided that selling Caremark would be best for the shareholders and noted that he would be holding 1.4 million shares in the new company.
Caremark, which was spun off from Baxter International in 1992, has had a checkered history. It paid $161 million to settle charges arising from a four-year Federal investigation of physician kickbacks in its home-care business. It sold that business to the Coram Healthcare Corporation, which later disputed the value of the assets.
The Caremark units in the merged company will manage physician practices, provide managed care for pharmaceutical users, measure the effectiveness of medical treatments and operate overseas.

HEADLINE: TEACHERS' UNION AND MAYOR AGREE ON NEW CONTRACT

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the union representing New York City's public school teachers agreed yesterday on a new labor contract that is largely similar to one the teachers rejected in December. The main difference is a few sweeteners that union leaders say will help secure ratification next month.
Mr. Giuliani and his aides said that City Hall had made no major concessions in renegotiating the contract. 
 "What they have got is exactly what they turned down last time," the Mayor said. "They haven't gotten any more and they haven't gotten any less."
Mr. Giuliani's aides asserted that all the changes in the new accord were paid for by financial concessions from the union. "The contract is the same contract in that it's within the pattern," said First Deputy Mayor Peter Powers. "Anything extra they got, they paid for."
The revised agreement, like the rejected one, would raise the salary for beginning teachers to $31,911, from $28,749, and would increase the maximum teachers' salary to $70,000, from $60,000.
Like the old contract, the new one calls for no layoffs for three years, a two-year pay freeze, and a 13 percent raise over the following three years. The changes include an incentive package intended to persuade 2,000 to 2,500 teachers to take early retirement, a reduction in the number of years it takes for teachers to earn the $70,000 maximum, and the elimination of a plan to defer part of a beginning teacher's salary.
In addition, the contract offers a $3,500 supplement each semester to teachers who volunteer to teach an additional period each day. Officials said that this would increase productivity and help fill the gap left by teachers who take the early retirement package.
Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers, predicted that teachers would approve the agreement because of these new benefits and because they increasingly see that the city's fiscal woes make it hard to win large raises. Union officials said the teachers, who had rebuked Ms. Feldman by rejecting the first contract late last year, would face added pressure to ratify because District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union, approved a similar agreement in January.
"I believe we have achieved the near impossible -- a new package with some significant improvements that still falls within the original economic paramaters," Ms. Feldman said at a news conference at union headquarters. "And we did it at a time that the city's fiscal situation seems to be worsening with each passing day."
Immediately after the city's 67,000 public school teachers rejected the contract by 56 to 44 percent on Dec. 7, Mr. Giuliani said that "the city is not in a position to offer anything more" and that if anything, "things will have to move in the other direction."
But yesterday, some budget experts suggested that the Mayor had indeed offered the teachers something more.
Ratification is important for Mr. Giuliani because it will help heal the strained relations between him and the politically potent union at a time when teachers are already fuming about overcrowded classrooms and cuts in the education budget.
Consequently, city officials took pains not to boast about the deal, to avoid sending signals that they had bested the teachers and thus tip the scales toward another rejection.
Labor experts predicted that there was a better chance the teachers would ratify this contract because it includes provisions that will help sway such important constituencies as older teachers and because the budget Mr. Giuliani announced last week makes clearer to teachers how hard it would be for City Hall to afford a larger pay increase.
In December, the teachers expressed anger at being asked to accept a two-year wage freeze at a time when the Mayor was getting a $35,000 pay increase. Relations between Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Feldman took a sharp turn for the worse when Ms. Feldman said the timing of his pay increase was a major factor behind the rejection of the contract.
Explaining why she believes the chances for ratification are better this time, Ms. Feldman said, "I think there's more understanding about the city's fiscal condition than there was last year."
After agreeing to the previous contract, Mr. Giuliani was stung by comments from bond-rating agencies and civic groups criticizing the fact that he had neither achieved his goal of wringing major concessions from the union nor won gains to improve efficiency. The new pact drew similar criticisms. "The fatal flaw of the last contract was the wage increases were not financed by productivity gains," said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed advocacy group. "It remains the fatal flaw of this one."
City officials acknowledged yesterday that there were no new concessions in the revised contract, although the mayor's aides have long said that they won a major concession in persuading union leaders to agree to a two-year pay freeze.
To win votes from experienced teachers, the revised contract would allow teachers with 22 years' experience to receive the maximum $70,000 pay. The rejected contract required 25 years' experience. City officials estimate there will be 15,000 teachers with 22 years' experience when that provision takes effect in 1999.
The new contract also eliminates a provision many teachers objected to, which would have deferred 5 percent of new teachers' first-year pay until the beginning of the fourth year of employment. That item was intended to encourage teachers to stay in the school system.
If the pact is approved, the incentives for early retirement would likely create the third substantial loss of experienced teachers from the system in the last several years. Four thousand teachers took early retirement in 1991, followed by 3,500 more in 1995. Critics say the last round created shortages of math and science teachers, while others say the buyouts have provided an opportunity to infuse the system with energetic young teachers.
City officials said that the new provisions would be paid for in several ways. First, the contract would run 61 months rather than 59, meaning the 13 percent raise would be spread over a longer period, saving close to $15 million.
The contract also defers payments into the union's welfare fund, slightly scales back raises for substitute teachers, and speeds up the city's ability to recapture an estimated $27 million from a surplus in annuity payments.
Teachers had mixed reactions to the new agreement.
Lisa Patterson, a guidance counselor at Public School 1 on Henry Street in lower Manhattan, said she had voted against the previous contract but would support this accord.
"They're never going to give teachers what they deserve," she said. "I'd like to hold out, but I know in truth it won't affect anything."
Sandra Roberts, who has taught at P.S. 1 for 16 years, said she also planned to vote yes, saying, "I don't think we can get anything better."
But Carolyn West, a teacher at Intermediate School 131 on nearby Hester Street, said she was undecided, after voting against the previous agreement. Voicing frustration about the budget situation, she said, "If the city indicates it doesn't care about education, I wouldn't do anything to contribute to that."
Ms. Feldman's main opponents in the union, a dissident group called New Action U.F.T., said they would campaign against the agreement.
"This isn't a contract that is worthy of the educators of New York City." said David Kaufman, a science teacher at Middle School 135 in the Bronx and co-chairman of the group. "The membership gave our leadership a mandate to do better. They failed miserably."

HEADLINE: U.S. and Hanoi Agree to Give Boat People One Last Chance

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 14

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration and Hanoi have reached an agreement to allow several thousand Vietnamese now living in refugee camps in Southeast Asia to resettle in the United States, provided they first return to Vietnam and apply in writing.
Confronting rioting in camps in Hong Kong by Vietnamese who face forced repatriation to Vietnam, the United States and Hanoi concluded six months of negotiations to give Vietnamese who were in the camps by Oct. 1, 1995 one last hearing on their appeals for asylum. 
 Twenty-one years after the Vietnam War ended, more than one million refugees have been resettled, and about 33,000 people, many of whom fled Vietnam in boats, remain huddled in refugee camps throughout Southeast Asia.
But a 1989 international agreement covering the boat people is coming to an end on June 30, and except for Hong Kong, which still houses about 18,000 Vietnamese, all the refugee camps will be closed by that date and their inhabitants repatriated, forcibly if necessary.
In talks that involved an unusual cooperative effort among the White House, Congress and refugee advocacy groups, the United States has been negotiating with Vietnam to reach an agreement to allow some refugees to resettle in America.
The American motivation is partly ethical and partly political. First, the United States wants to fulfill what many Americans regard as a moral obligation to their former allies in the former South Vietnam, and to those Vietnamese who suffered from their support of America's involvement in the war.
Second, the Clinton Administration wants to reduce, as much as possible, the kind of violence that ripped through the refugee camps in Hong Kong last weekend, pictures of which brought to mind the anguish over America's involvement in Vietnam, which the President himself opposed as a young man.
The Clinton Administration wanted to be "generous at the end," a senior official said, and started negotiations with Hanoi last November for a last screening of the boat people by American immigration officials.
Under the agreement, the Vietnamese in the camps may apply in writing for a final hearing, but must agree to return to Vietnam with the standard $240 in resettlement money provided by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which also monitors the returnees to try to prevent any political persecution.
American officials in Thailand will then screen the applications of Vietnamese who have returned home. Within 60 days, those who applied will be told if they qualify for interviews in Vietnam with American immigration officials.
The last Vietnamese refugees have resisted all inducements to return to Vietnam voluntarily, although interviews by the United Nations High Commissioner's office have determined that they were not legitimate refugees fleeing persecution, but "economic migrants," seeking a better life in the West.
Still, some of the last internees have connections to the American war effort or the South Vietnamese Government, served time in Vietnamese re-education camps, or are members of persecuted religious, political or ethnic groups, like the Montagnards, who were associated with the Americans.
In the negotiations, the United States tried to convince Hanoi that all boat people should get a final interview in Vietnam.
But officials said Hanoi did not want a "half-way" house on its soil, or a large population of angry, rejected applicants all in one place. Vietnam finally agreed to the current application process, and nearly 1,500 boat people have applied since the program was announced in the camps three weeks ago.
Officials said talks with Vietnam will continue this week over the technicalities of the program. Those include issues like whether foreign counselors will be permitted in Vietnam, how the costs of the processing will be met, where the interviews will take place, how quickly Vietnam will issue exit permits and whether those who are rejected will get further help to resettle in Vietnam.
While officials were reluctant to estimate how many Vietnamese might be allowed to resettle, one person closely involved with refugee groups suggested a range of 2,000 to 6,000.
Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican who is chairman of the subcommittee on international relations and human rights, has pressed for Washington to take as many of the boat people as possible. But he said he is reconciled to the new program, though he is somewhat concerned about how it will be carried out.
"The central flaw is that people, many of whom may be refugees, are being forced back to the very country where they fear persecution," he said. "But something is better than nothing, and I'm hopeful the program will be implemented in a generous and protective spirit."
Shep Lowman, director of International Refugee Affairs for the United States Catholic Conference, said he was reasonably pleased.
"But in any refugee program, it's the operational details that have so much to do with how it comes out," he said.
He, like Mr. Smith, wanted counseling to be arranged in Vietnam for the 4,000 Vietnamese who returned after Oct. 1, so they will know how best to fill out their applications.

HEADLINE: Fall of a Shirtmaking Giant Shakes Its Hometown

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

DATELINE: WATERVILLE, Me.

 BODY:
When C. F. Hathaway began making men's shirts out of his house here in 1837, he turned to the farming communities outside the town for cheap labor. The Hathaway shirtmaking company has depended on the labor, and the loyalty, of the women of central Maine ever since.
It was women, 95 percent of the work force at the Hathaway plant in Waterville, who pitched in when the parent company, the Warnaco Group, opened a clothing plant in Honduras and sought workers who could go there to help train their foreign counterparts. More recently, they forfeited a raise to help pay for consultants who were brought to Waterville to teach them how to work smarter and faster. By this March, their union and the consultants agree, they had doubled their productivity. 
 But it was not enough. On May 6, the Warnaco Group announced that it would no longer make Hathaway shirts and that it planned to sell or close the Waterville factory this year, along with Hathaway plants in Ontario and Puerto Rico. The women had fallen victim to a world in which their average wage of $7.50 an hour was considered a high price to pay for labor, and in which demand for the venerable Hathaway shirt had diminished.
Analysts say that Hathaway has been losing millions of dollars a year and that its decline can be traced to a variety of related factors: pricing pressures that result from competitors' reliance on foreign labor, a drop in the market for dress shirts with the commensurate rise in the trend toward casual wear, and intensified competition within the dress-shirt market that remains.
But for the 500 workers at the Hathaway plant here, for Waterville itself (population 17,000), for people across Maine, Warnaco's announcement struck with a force that made them feel as if the ground had shifted. In the last two decades, the story of central Maine, and of much of the rest of New England, has been one of textile mill layoffs and closings. But this was Hathaway, America's oldest shirtmaker. Maine has four landmarks: the ocean, Mount Katahdin, Hathaway and L. L. Bean -- and Hathaway has been around almost eight decades longer than L. L. Bean.
"My mother called the other day and said, 'What's up?' " said Theresa Robinson, who has been stitching Hathaway shirts for 22 of her 40 years. "I said: 'Nothing's up. Everything's tumbling down.' "
Janice Littlejohn, who arrived at the plant 36 years ago, can remember a time when a threat to the business would have been unthinkable. "Hathaway shirts -- even movie stars, even famous people, used to try to get them," she said. "Everybody wanted them."
Ms. Littlejohn and her co-workers, who have only high school educations and have built lives around the shirt they thought men would always want, will not be given other jobs at Warnaco.
Mrs. Robinson's husband, Jim, a 34-year-old plumber, died of a stroke in February. He left not only his wife, who is 40, but also their two children, 10 and 12.
Now, said Mrs. Robinson, who buried her husband in a blue striped shirt made in Waterville, it is as if two marriages are over. "I was with my husband 16 years," she said. "I've been at Hathaway 22 years."
From London, where she was working on Warnaco's purchase of the European lingerie company Lejaby, Linda J. Wachner, the chief executive, said the decision to stop making Hathaway shirts had been "based on strategic objectives." The Hathaway division, she said, is "not making money, and we're in the business of operating for a profit."
"We did need to do the right thing for the company and the stockholders," added Mrs. Wachner, who last year was paid $10 million in salary and stock. Her company -- whose holdings include Warner's and Olga, makers of intimate apparel; Calvin Klein underwear, and Chaps by Ralph Lauren -- had net 1995 income of $46.5 million.
In the shirtmaker's heyday, the image of the Hathaway man was of a dashing executive. Its distinctive print advertisements showed any one of a number of famous men -- Ted Turner, for instance -- wearing a black eyepatch, and a Hathaway shirt. That campaign was first introduced in 1951, the creation of the advertising executive David Ogilvy, who used George Wrangell, a Russian baron, as the first model.
"Hathaway was class," said Muriel Rancourt, who has spent close to 43 years stitching the shirts.
The Hathaway women, in turn, were renowned for their devotion to quality. "I walked into a mill in Bangor, and said I worked at Hathaway," Ms. Littlejohn said, recalling a time when she briefly left Waterville. "They said, 'Hathaway, good, we want you.' " The mill in Bangor has since closed.
Hathaway women are paid for piecework, with the average wage $7 to $8 an hour. "It can be stressful," Mrs. Rancourt said. "You want to make money, and you want to do perfect work."
At their sewing machines on May 6, the Hathaway women were summoned to an emergency meeting in the cafeteria. The personnel manager, Dick Mitchell, read a brief statement from Warnaco headquarters in New York. He took no questions.
"I had to leave the room," Mrs. Robinson said. "I didn't want to break down in front of everyone."
The workers recall another meeting in the cafeteria, with Mrs. Wachner in January 1995. "She stood there right in front of us and said she would not close the plant if we would do quality work and bring the cost of the shirt down," said Debbie Perry, vice president for the local of the Union of Needle Trades, Industrial and Textile Employees.
The women joined with management to cut costs. They learned to work in teams. Collar women learned how to do cuffs. Stitchers pitched in with packing, eager to help make the Hathaway plant modern and streamlined. "We were all very excited about it," Mrs. Robinson said.
The plant's chief consultant, Peter Lazes, the president of Workplace Systems Inc. in New York and a labor relations professor at Cornell University, said, "They put their guts into it, and they turned this plant around."
But the company had long since all but stopped advertising Hathaway shirts nationally, and the man with the eyepatch had been retired in 1990. "When you're losing money," Mrs. Wachner said, "you don't spend a lot on advertising."
Ms. Littlejohn said, "She gave up on us."
When she started at Hathaway, Ms. Littlejohn was young and strong and climbed the four flights of stairs to her sewing machine in the sleeve facing unit. Now she has diabetes, high blood pressure and severe arthritis, and she rides the elevator to the label stitching unit on the third floor. Not as fast as she used to be, she earns $6.50 an hour from her piecework.
"I'm 58 years old," she said. "Who's going to hire me?" She seemed to be thinking aloud. "Perhaps I could get another stitching job. But there's none left."
The Governor of Maine, Angus King, is trying to find a buyer for the Hathaway division and has talked to Mrs. Wachner about keeping the plant open long enough for a sale. Mrs. Wachner said the plant would probably remain open through August.
Even now, the women are determined to turn out quality shirts. "You've got to hang on to hope," Ms. Littlejohn said. "We've got fantastic workers. I can't believe someone won't want to buy the workers."
Mrs. Robinson said she would be working as quickly, and as well, as she could. As a newly widowed mother facing the possibility of unemployment, she needs the money now more than ever. And, she said, "I wouldn't go in and not do my job the way I've been trained to do it."

U.S. China-Talks Fail; Trade War Grows Closer
Two days of last-ditch talks between Chinese and American negotiators ended without resolving the wide differences over Chinese pirating of software, music and movies.
The discord drew the two nations ever closer to a trade war. In the first of a series of punitive actions, Washington is expected to list $3 billion of Chinese exports that could be subject to 100 percent tariffs. [A1.]
 
Inflation Tame, Despite Gas Rise
Energy prices made their biggest monthly increase in nearly six years in April. Still, the underlying rate of inflation remained in check with the Consumer Price Index rising by four-tenths of 1 percent. Retail sales fell. [D2.]
 
Stocks Climb on Economic Reports
Stocks climbed on the stable inflation news. The Dow industrials rose 42.11 points, to 5,624.71, still shy of the record closing of 5,689.74 set on April 3. But the Nasdaq, S.& P. 500 and Amex indexes all set records. [D10.]
 
Prices of Treasury securities surged on the favorable inflation news, sending the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond down six basis points to 6.83 percent. [D20.]
 
$2.3 Billion Merger for Doctors
Medpartners/Mullikin Inc., a physician-management company based in Birmingham, Ala., plans to buy Caremark International in a stock-swap valued at $2.5 billion, creating by far the biggest business-management company for physicians trying to deal with H.M.O.'s and other cost-cutters. [A1.]
 
Netscape and Hewlett-Packard Link
Netscape and Hewlett-Packard have formed an alliance to exploit the growing demand for corporate computer networks based on Internet technology. [D4.]
 
Corning to Spin Off Metpath
Corning Inc. said that it would spin off its Metpath laboratory-testing and its pharmaceutical-services businesses to shareholders, creating two additional, independent companies. [D4.]
 
Conoco and Phillips in Talks
Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum are discussing combining their gasoline refining and market businesses, forming a company with $13.6 billion in annual revenue. [D4.]
 
Crash Stirs Up Air Safety Debate
The fatal Valujet crash in the Everglades has set off a debate within the Transportation Department over the safety of aircraft operated by low-cost airlines. [A16.]
Corporate travelers are re-examining their policies regarding low-cost airlines. Edwin McDowell: Business Travel. [D6.]
 
Nuveen to Offer Equity Funds
John Nuveen & Company, which has stuck with municipal bond funds as equities have boomed, has decided to start selling stock mutual funds. Market Place. [D10.]
 
Home AIDS Test Approved
The F.D.A. approved the first home screening test for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. It was developed and is being marketed for about $40 by Direct Access Diagnostics, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. [A15.]
 
G.M. Retools Corporate Ads
General Motors, in a campaign to burnish its corporate image, is using a theme, "People in motion" to promote its brands. It echoes an anthem for hippies from the 1960's. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [D9.]
 
Hathaway, the Shirt Off Their Backs
For the Maine women who have worked ever harder stitching Hathaway shirts, Warnaco's decision to quit the money-losing brand is like the end of a marriage. [A14.]

HEADLINE: On China, Sanctions and Scolding Won't Work

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "The Annual China Brawl" (editorial, May 12), you say that Washington should "match specific Chinese misconduct with strong, targeted sanctions" in contrast to an across-the-board increase in tariffs. But policy-by-sanction is misguided, no matter how nuanced. 
 No one can deny that many aspects of Chinese behavior are contrary to our interests, but when has there been a viable relationship between two nations when one is constantly scolding the other and pursuing a policy of threats, condemnations and sanctions?
You say trade "strengthens a regime that abuses the rights of its people, bullies its neighbors and undermines American arms control policies." This ignores the billions of dollars and millions of jobs that benefit us; it ignores the way trade has facilitated economic reform in China, leading to improvements in the lives of millions of Chinese, and it ignores the links that trade forges between our societies.
You acknowledge that our leverage is limited when we act by ourselves. But you say that if we can't get international help, we should act by ourselves anyway. Should we not press Europe and Japan to stand with us when it counts?
We need a thorough review of where we are headed with China, and we need to fashion a more sophisticated, less confrontational policy.

To the Editor:
You assert (editorial, May 12) that there is "little evidence that trade is fostering political liberalization" in China. Such a view is contradicted by a body of evidence gathered by Western researchers that discloses slow but steady evolution toward a more open political system. 
 For example, the National People's Congress has gained a high degree of institutional autonomy as a counterweight to the Communist Party. It has become a player in China's legislative process and recently passed a landmark criminal code that establishes the assumption of innocence, rights to legal counsel and limits on detention without charge.
Citizens can sue the Government for miscarriage of justice under the Administrative Litigations Act. About 27,000 such cases are filed each year, with plaintiffs winning about 20 percent of the suits.
In 1980, when China was a negligible trading power, political prisoners represented 13 percent of its prison population; by 1989, a decade after economic reform, that percentage had dropped to 0.5.
Citizens seek to express grievances to the news media and to delegates of the People's Congress instead of to the Communist authorities. A 1994 poll of 2,500 showed that about 25 percent took complaints to the news media, and 22 percent to delegates of the People's Congress.
These trends vindicate the theory of political development that has been proved in South Korea and Taiwan.

HEADLINE: She Asks, She Tells

BYLINE: By LINDA MATHEWS 

DATELINE: LANGLEY, Wash.

 BODY:
HOMOSEXUALITY "isn't a weed that grows up among us," Col. Margarethe Cammermeyer says, sitting in her living room here overlooking Puget Sound.
"It's part of society and always has been," she continues, "but unless all of us accept that, unless young gays know that they are accepted, they will continue to commit suicide in disproportionate numbers. They will continue to hurt themselves with substance abuse. That can't be what anyone wants." 
 Colonel Cammermeyer loved the Army so much that she put camouflage bedspreads on her sons' bunk beds. She volunteered for Vietnam. She aspired to be a general and the chief nurse of the Army National Guard. She even dreamed, she says, that "I would retire with full military honors, in a parade with a band playing."
But a parade for Colonel Cammermeyer, now 54, looks doubtful. For seven years, ever since she told a military investigator that she was a lesbian, the Army has been trying to discharge her.
She is still in uniform with the Washington State National Guard, thanks to a ruling by a Federal District Court that an Army ban on homosexuals violated her constitutional rights. But the Army and the Justice Department are appealing that ruling, although she is less than a year away from mandatory retirement and on May 6 went on inactive duty.
Becoming a general is no longer her mission, so she has found another: educating everyone, particularly parents, about the realities of homosexuality and the perils of discriminating against gay people.
In her 1994 autobiography, "Serving in Silence" (Viking Penguin), she confessed to occasional impulses toward suicide herself in the late 1970's, brought on by the end of her 15-year marriage to another military officer and her confusion about her sexual orientation. She met her current partner, Diane Divelbess, an artist and retired university professor, in 1988, and only then recognized why "all my life I had recoiled at being intimate with a man."
Last year, "Serving in Silence" was turned into a made-for-television movie that won three Emmys and, in March, a media award from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation for telling a gay story "with honesty and integrity." The movie cost her what was left of her privacy, but she says there have been compensations.
"It helped my sons" -- the four of them are now 19 to 27 -- "understand what I went through, in a visual way, and I think it was a vehicle for sensitizing other people, too. It says to people: 'Gay people are just like you. We go to work, just like you. We get stuck in traffic, just like you. We stop on the way home to shop for groceries.' "
She says that she and Ms. Divelbess are "shining examples of middle-class normalcy." Like many other middle-aged couples, they are responsible both for a teen-ager (Colonel Cammermeyer's youngest son, Tom Hawken, a college freshman), and for an elderly parent (Ms. Divelbess's mother, Veda, 90, who lives with them).
Veda Divelbess, a slight, sweet-faced woman with a childlike manner, wanders into the living room and asks for lunch. She is worried, she says, because "I don't have any money." Her daughter, Diane, has a headache and has gone to bed. So Colonel Cammermeyer reassures Mrs. Divelbess that she won't need money for lunch, which a friend is preparing. She describes Mrs. Divelbess's condition in clinical terms, a reminder of her 30 years as a nurse, including 14 months as head nurse of intensive care wards at Long Binh, Vietnam.
Home for this blended family is a new cedar-shingled house, shaped like the wings of a sea gull, that Colonel Cammermeyer and Ms. Divelbess built here on Whidbey Island, an hour by car and ferryboat north of Seattle. With its four bedrooms, family room, art studio (for Ms. Divelbess) and two offices, it is bigger than Langley's old-fashioned town hall. Nearly every sun-struck room faces a private beach and Saratoga Passage, a strip of Puget Sound. The halls are adorned, gallery-style, with Ms. Divelbess's abstract paintings.
The house was largely financed by Ms. Divelbess, 60, who had been a tenured professor at California State Polytechnic University in Pomona.
They chose to live here because "it's peaceful and it's isolated," the colonel says, though she puts up with a commute of two and a half hours, each way, to her civilian job at the Veterans Administration Puget Sound Health Care System, south of Tacoma, Wash. She will soon be eligible to retire from her job there, as head of a project on sleep disorders, but doubts that she will.
Her full-time civilian job, which was never in jeopardy, has shielded Colonel Cammermeyer from the economic hardships faced by many of the 1,500 full-time members of the armed forces discharged annually because of their sexual orientation.
Colonel Cammermeyer frequently speaks to high school and college audiences, because, she says, young gay people need the most support. "Barriers are broken one case at a time, one person at a time," she says. "People now will say, 'I know Joe, and he's gay but he's all right,' the way they used to say, 'I know Joe, and he's black but he's all right.' It's a slow process."
In this particular struggle, she doubts that the military will be in the forefront. "The military isn't good about dealing with the realities of sexuality, either heterosexual or homosexual," she says.
Poised and articulate, Colonel Cammermeyer rarely raises her voice. Just over six feet tall, she is a commanding presence even on her day off, dressed in black sweat pants, a baggy sweater and fluffy bedroom slippers. But a glint of impatience surfaces when she is asked whether a middle-aged, monogamous lesbian is the best judge of whether 20-year-old gay men might pose a threat to a military unit's morale or cohesiveness, the usual rationale for keeping homosexuals out of the military.
The policies on homosexuals stem from "an unrealistic fear that gay men will harass straight men," she declares.
"Gays in the military have lived side by side with straights for years, and they have served side by side in foxholes, and the straights aren't being attacked or abused," she says. "If they were, you'd hear about it, and you don't hear about it."
Heterosexual men "don't have a clue," she continues, adding: "The military wants members of a unit to bond, for the sake of morale. And too many young men worry that if they're around a gay person, and they bond with him, then, gee, that means they're gay, too. Of course, it means only that they recognize the person as a good friend or a comrade."
She pauses and grins wickedly. "Maybe we should just teach men how to say 'no,' the way we teach young women," she says. "Most men never have to learn."
She thinks the Pentagon's current "don't ask, don't tell" policy has been "a tragedy," just as bad as the 1982 regulations decreeing automatic discharge of any known homosexual, which were used against her. Despite the Administration's promise to end witch hunts, "people are still asked whether they're gay," she says, adding: "They're still investigated, held incommunicado and questioned until they crack."
When young members of the armed services call her for advice, Colonel Cammermeyer says, she warns them that if they "come out" to their commanders, they will probably lose their careers. "I figure they should know what the likely consequences are," she adds.
She doesn't blame the Justice Department or the Army for pursuing the case against her. "The Army needs closure, and I suppose I do, too," she says. But her old love for the Army, which has been her second home since 1961, is gone. "It was a wonderful career, and I was given wonderful opportunities," she says. "But you have to be naive to love a system that is geared to kill. When I was a nurse in Vietnam, I felt I was fighting for freedom. Now, it's harder to know what you're fighting for."

HEADLINE: Television Grows a Brain

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE B. JOHNSON 

 BODY:
SINCE its birth 57 years ago, the television has been basically unchanged, a friendly, bulky box that brings football games, weather reports and Lucille Ball into our living rooms.
But in the coming months, the television will mutate, undergoing a change many viewers would like to emulate: It's going to get thinner and smarter. The television of the not-too-distant future may even shake the epithet of "boob tube." 
 It will take multimedia into a new dimension, allowing viewers to play Monopoly with a friend in Montana, surf the Internet, order an exercise bike, download sports statistics or settle in for a screening of "Beverly Hills Cop VII." One model will even play reviewer, "suggesting" which shows you would like, based on past preferences.
And rather than taking up floor space, your big-screen set may hang on the wall. It may be merely an inch deep and not use anything like the traditional picture tube to create its vivid image.
This isn't science fiction, but a new order of home entertainment, and it's headed toward reality on a fast track. (And not surprisingly, it's going to cost more.)
One of the new concepts for the television is a limited merger with the personal computer. Perhaps the most ambitious expression of that idea is the Genius Theater under development by Thomson Consumer Electronics, the maker of RCA products. It will extend the range of home entertainment services available: viewers can switch between on-line programs and television, game playing and watching a movie brought down by satellite. With a screen of up to 52 inches, the set will allow several people to look at a computer program together comfortably, rather than scrunching around a tiny monitor meant for one.
"What the Genius Theater will make possible is instant access to things like multimedia titles you can download," said Lou Lenzi, president of design for Thomson, referring to music videos, guided museum tours or even information from sports archives combining sound and image. "The data might be downloaded either via satellite or phone lines, with communications access to the World Wide Web," he said.
The Genius Theater's sound system, CD-ROM player, modem and connections for telephone line, digital satellite system, cable and standard antenna are housed in an unthreatening maple cabinet. To keep users comfortable with its many functions, the set offers an on-screen menu depicting a living room with point-and-click icons. But the remote control has been replaced by a compact wireless keyboard that allows you to manage the entire system from the sofa.
Mr. Lenzi said the versatile new television might reach consumers by late next year and that it will probably cost $4,000 for a 36-inch model and $6,000 for a 52-inch rear-projection set.
Gateway 2000, a major mail-order computer company, has taken a more restrained approach to the range of home entertainment in its new Destination televisions. Each model combines a personal computer with a 31-inch video monitor that doubles as a conventional television.
The Destination is compatible with VCR's and laser-disk players, and audio signals can be fed through home hi-fi systems for surround sound. It comes with Microsoft Windows 95 and an electronic version of TV Guide and is controlled by a wireless keyboard and mouse. It costs $3,500 to $4,700, depending on software and sound system.
Other companies are gearing up their own smart televisions.
In the fall, Zenith plans to introduce Netvision, a 27-inch television fitted with a high-speed modem and a connection for the coming generation of superfast cable modems. Although it lacks a full-fledged computer, Netvision, at $899, will offer Internet access at a lower price.
Toshiba has introduced a 20-inch television that can be plugged into your computer as easily as attaching a VCR. The Toshiba integrated multimedia monitor offers the fine image resolution required when viewing a picture at close range. It costs $1,000.
While Thomson and the others are expanding the television's function, some makers are shrinking its dimensions.
Sharp Electronics, a longtime leader in liquid-crystal-display, or LCD, technology, has developed several prototypes of hang-on-the-wall LCD televisions about an inch thick. Very chic, but very expensive.
Unlike a conventional cathode-ray picture tube, in which an electron gun shoots color phosphors to create an image on screen, an LCD television uses thousands of red, green and blue crystals, which are electrically charged to produce a picture.
Although LCD projectors are common, often used in giant-screen projection television, self-contained LCD televisions are just coming to market in Japan. Robert Garbutt, vice president for Sharp's LCD products group, said the projected price of $4,000 to $10,000 makes them too expensive to bring to market in this country.
That staggering cost comes from the difficulty of producing the absolutely flat glass needed to make an LCD image viewable, combined with the expense of assembling hundreds of thousands of high-grade crystals. For now, an 8 1/2-inch model is being sold for $4,000 in Japan, making it usable in a kitchen or an office, where the viewer would be working close to the screen.
Why bother with so expensive a television? For one thing, the image is perfect in minute detail. Besides, you can hang it on the wall.
"Within the next two or three years, we should see LCD televisions of 20 to 21 inches," Mr. Garbutt said. "That's ideal for a bedroom. When prices begin to drop, LCD technology will be ready to take off like a rocket ship."
The flat-screen concept is about to go into a higher technological orbit with the plasma gas television. In this variant of a conventional liquid-crystal display, a thin layer of plasma gas behind the screen receives an electrical charge that activates the colored crystals.
Sony Electronics calls one television it has under development the Plasmatron and will introduce its first plasma-crystal model in Japan this year. One advantage of this hybrid design is that it allows for larger LCD screen sizes with the same fine image resolution, though still at considerable cost -- $8,000 to $10,000 for a 25-inch set.
Jim Palumbo, senior vice president of Sony's television-products division, said the company expected to bring the Plasmatron to the United States within two years, in sizes up to 50 inches. Like conventional LCD televisions, he said, the plasma designs are light enough to hang on a wall and offer greater brightness, as well as better picture quality viewed from off-center.
But while Mr. Garbutt at Sharp forecasts a progressive takeover by the unobtrusive, LCD televisions, Mr. Palumbo said the standard cathode-ray tube isn't going away.
"We all know there's a multimedia convergence coming," Mr. Palumbo said. "In a sense, it's already here. But it's also fair to say, from the perspective of consumers, that a distinction will continue to be made between the uses of the television in the family room and the PC monitor in the home office."
In the family room, at least, "big-screen TV is where the industry is headed," he said.
So far this year, he said, color television sales are down about 10 percent, but the big-screen business -- 25-inch to 35-inch models -- is up 15 percent. Rear-projection sales were up 17 percent through the first two and a half months.
Where the television will eventually go, no one can predict. A couple of years ago, it appeared that the squarish screen would be replaced by a wider, more cinemalike version. But without wide-screen broadcasts, makers have backed away from the cinema look and concentrated on better pictures in traditional shape.
That may change with the emergence of digital television over the next two to three years. Digital sets will incorporate decoders for translating digital television broadcasts, much like the set-top boxes that now convert satellite signals into pictures and sound. Digital broadcasting, especially high-definition television, is likely to bring the wide-screen-cinema look to everyday viewing.
Who knows? One day you may be able to surf the Net in Panavision.

Chart: "Ushering In the 21st Century"
 The television has begun its transformation into a smarter, thinner creature. Here is a look at the shape of television to come, and one that is already here.
 
LCD SCREEN TV
 
PRO: Liquid-crystal-display television, just a few inches deep, are lightweight and wall-mountable, they offer excellent picture quality.
 
CON: Price: The Sharp Museum Series 8 1/2-inch screen televisions - the Art model in a gift fram, the Objet model in a high-tech design - cost about $4,000 in Japan.
 
HOW SOON: Sharp has backed off from recent projections of early next year. The company says LCD television will come to the United States when it can be sold for $2,000.
 
PLASMA GAS TV
 
PRO: Gas charged by current activates crystals over a larger surface, allowing for a big-screen adaptation of LCD television. Screen sizes up to 52 inches give a cinemalike, wide-screen look. This 25-inch Sony Plasmatron is just four inches thick and weighs about four pounds.
 
CON: Bigger screen, bigger price. The Plasmatro could cost up to $10,000.
 
HOW SOON: Within two years.
 
MULTIMEDIA TV
 
PRO: RCA's Genius Theater system, offers home-theater-size viewing of movies, video games, information from the Internet and other computer functions.
 Gateway 2000's Destination combines full computer operation with television and a 31-inch screen, large enough to allow family viewing.
 Zenith's Netvision provides an internal modem for an economical way to get onto the Internet without a full-fledged computer built into the television. The cost is $899.
 
CON: The Genius Theater is not practical for all computer use, like financial planning and spreadsheets; it is fairly expensive, at $4,000 to $6,000.
 Destination restricts close-up, personal-computer use because of the screen size; it costs $3,500 to $4,700.
 The Netvision has no built-in computer, so it cannot use some digital program sources, like CD-ROM.
 
HOW SOON: Genius Theater should appear late nex year.
 Destination became available last month.
 Netvision is scheduled for the fall. (pg. C2)

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Central Europe is unsettled by a currency union for West Europe.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell 

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
THE 200 politicians, business executives and assorted policy wonks attending the first congress of the New Atlantic Initiative -- a tony pep rally here for trans-Atlantic harmony -- got the good show they no doubt expected.
They heard President Vaclav Havel of the Czech Republic warn: "Unless democrats proceed with greater vigor to build a European order, others will start to do so -- and we know who the others are." The group was also treated to a star turn by Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister. After agreeing with Hobbes that "covenants without the sword are but words," she called for the merger of the North American free trade area of the United States, Canada and Mexico with the European Union. 
 But those who stayed for the panels organized by the conservative American Enterprise Institute, Center for the New Europe and National Review Institute were exposed to one distinctly downbeat theme: The drive to create an economic superstate in Western Europe, specifically the plan for monetary union beginning in 1999, could unhinge the Atlantic alliance and leave Central Europe out in the cold.
"If a monetary union is launched on schedule," predicted Jan Krzysztof Bielecki, the former Prime Minister of Poland, "it will touch off a chain reaction that will halt integration."
This is not an entirely new thought, but it is particularly relevant as the deadline for locking together at least a handful of Europe's currencies nears. Economists of varying ideological stripe have long worried that the transition to monetary union may trap some less-advanced nations into chronic recession, much the way single currencies handcuffed efforts to develop Canada's Maritime Provinces and Italy's poor southern region.
A common currency makes it impossible to adjust currency rates to reflect differences in productivity within the currency zone. That is eased for those born in Newfoundland and Calabria, though, because they are free to migrate within their countries.
But multilingual, multinational Europe is an entirely different matter. How many Europeans would be comfortable with tens of millions of jobless citizens crossing national borders to find work? Certainly no more than the number of western Germans who welcomed eastern Germans heading for Munich and Stuttgart after reunification -- and probably a lot fewer.
What does all this have to do with Central Europe, particularly the leading candidates for future membership in the European Union -- Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic? Back up for a minute. The primary barrier today to their admission to the 15-nation European Union is the costly subsidy policy now used to help bind the economies of Western Europe.
Brian Hindley of the London School of Economics notes that the European Union's payments to the less affluent members -- Portugal, Spain and Greece -- along with price supports for virtually all farmers, already cost more than $60 billion a year. Most of the cash comes out of the coffers of Germany, Britain, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands. Mr. Hindley estimates that adding Central Europe would raise the bill by an additional $50 billion.
But there is a way out of this quandary, Mr. Hindley argues. If farm subsidies were converted from price supports to income supplements unrelated to production -- and new entrants to the European Union were declared ineligible -- the cost of integrating the three new countries would be modest. Indeed, Mr. Hindley sees the incorporation of Central Europe as an opportunity to deep-six a scandalously wasteful farm policy that now generates enormous agricultural surpluses.
Whatever the outcome of that debate, all bets are off, Mr. Bielecki says, if plans go forward for monetary union before the end of the decade. For one thing, he points out, that would distract political energies from what is bound to be a traumatic transition for the union's weaker economies.
For that and other reasons, Mr. Bielecki expects that Western Europe -- preoccupied with its own situation -- will postpone formal integration with Central Europe for many years. That may or may not be a disaster. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are all recovering from the collapse of central planning and beginning to grow again. But both Poland and Hungary have found the going so hard that their voters have turned to governments of former Communists, whose commitments to completing the transition to free markets would probably not survive a serious recession.
Most of those assembled in the glitter of the Hapsburg Palace in Prague probably do not agree with Lady Thatcher that European monetary union is "in truth a nightmare." But as 1999 approaches, they are finding it ever harder to ignore the risks.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Comments by Japanese Officials Aid Dollar's Rally Against Yen

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar rallied against the Japanese yen yesterday for the second consecutive session as senior Japanese officials reaffirmed their desire for a strong dollar and stifled speculation that Japan would raise interest rates.
"The currency market heard a great sigh of relief," said David DeRosa, a director of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank. "The only question is how long will the Bank of Japan be able to resist raising these very low interest rates." 
 In late trading in New York yesterday, the dollar rose to 106.96 yen from 105.88 yen on Tuesday.
The yen had recently rallied as analysts speculated that Japan would soon raise interest rates from their current low levels.
But the director general of the international finance bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Finance, Eisuke Sakaibara, said yesterday that the market might have misread Japan's interest-rate situation.
In a separate speech, the governor of the Bank of Japan, Yasuo Matsushita, said he supported Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin's repeated calls for a strong dollar.
"A lot of the fear of imminent interest-rate hikes was alleviated by the official comments," Mr. DeRosa of Swiss Bank said.
Tokyo has been cooperating with Washington and monetary officials from other capitals to strengthen the dollar against the yen in an effort to aid Japan's battered exporters.
While some Japanese companies sold some of their stockpiles of dollars for yen yesterday, ample buying by American funds and other investors supported the dollar, currency traders said.
"The dollar was incredibly well bid here," said James Powers, vice president at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale. "Over all, the trend seems to still be in place where the dollar should go higher."
The yen's weakness helped bolster the German mark. But the dollar held its ground against the mark and should tend to move higher in coming sessions, dealers said. In New York, the dollar traded at 1.5335 marks, down from 1.5340 marks.
"We're poised to test the recent highs at 1.54 marks, but I don't see the dollar going crazy," Mr. Powers said.
The mark received a modest lift when the European Commission forecast improvement in German and European economic growth through 1997.
In other trading, the British pound slipped to $1.5125 from $1.5140.

Rise in Output Doesn't Move Bonds Much

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
The prices of Treasury securities were virtually unchanged yesterday, with the market showing little reaction to a report that industrial production surged in April.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond slipped 1/32, to 89 13/32, leaving its yield at 6.83 percent, unchanged from Tuesday. 
 The report on industrial production, from the Federal Reserve, dampened buying somewhat. The Fed said that output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose nine-tenths of 1 percent last month, after a decline of five-tenths of 1 percent in March.
In addition, the capacity utilization rate at factories increased to 82 percent in April from 81.2 percent in March. The numbers on production and capacity utilization both were higher than the market had expected.
But the gains largely reflected a resumption of work at General Motors assembly plants after an 18-day strike. Excluding automobiles, production was unchanged in April.
"The bond market took these gains in stride," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management.
Still, he added, "despite all the month-to-month volatility seen thus far this year due to labor discord and the weather, the fact remains that overall industrial production has grown at a rather respectable 4.2 percent annual rate since December, with the manufacturing sector leading the way at 4.8 percent."
But Matthew F. Alexy, chief market strategist at CS First Boston, said that factories in general remained a long way from reaching capacity utilization rates normally associated with inflation fears, which would hurt the bond market. "In late 1994 and early 1995, utilization rates north of 84 percent pushed the bond yield into the 7.5 percent to 8 percent range," Mr. Alexy said. "The drop in yields we have seen so far in May reflects, in part, the market's belief that capacity utilization will not run up to the 84 percent trigger."
Ken McCarthy, founder of the Economic Intelligence Company, a research firm, said the economy continued to grow at a moderate, sustainable pace last month. "But the inventory correction that kept industrial growth weak for most of 1995 has ended," he said.
Today, the market turns its attention to the weekly report on initial claims for unemployment benefits, a report on housing starts in April and a survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
In the corporate bond market, the Lockheed Martin Corporation increased the size of its high-grade debt offering by about 60 percent yesterday.
The offering amount was raised to $3.5 billion from the $2.2 billion originally estimated. It will be the largest high-grade debt offering ever, surpassing the $2.6 billion sold by the Walt Disney Company in March.
Underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs & Company will be selling the debt securities in six parts, representing six maturities, rather than the five parts originally planned. The additional maturity consists of $300 million in 40-year bonds with a "put" provision, meaning they can be sold back to the issuer after 12 years.
Lockheed plans to use the proceeds from the sale to help pay for its $9.1 billion acquisition of the Loral Corporation.

Energy Prices Mixed on Word Of Tentative Iraq Deal at U.N.

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Energy prices turned mixed in the futures market yesterday on word that a tentative agreement was near to resume limited Iraqi oil sales.
A senior diplomat said negotiators from the United Nations and Iraq had reached a tentative deal to let Iraq resume oil sales, but were still waiting to hear whether President Saddam Hussein would accept the terms. 
 Light sweet crude rose slightly while refined petroleum products slipped.
In quiet trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for crude oil settled up 6 cents at $21.48 a barrel.
Unleaded gasoline for delivery next month was off 1.23 cents at 67.20 cents a gallon. June home heating oil fell 0.51 cent, to 54.81 cents a gallon.
Traders said the tentative Iraqi deal had only a limited impact on prices. "I guess people are still waiting for something signed and sealed," said Gregory Dreis, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.
The agreement would reportedly allow Iraq to sell $1 billion of oil every 90 days to ease the effects of United Nations sanctions imposed after it invaded Kuwait in 1990. It would increase worldwide petroleum supplies.
In other futures markets, grain prices were mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade, as fears of a Chinese-American trade war tempered weather-induced run-ups.
Forecasts that North Dakota's already wet spring-wheat fields would receive more rain combined with news that the Canadian prairie would get more frost this weekend sent wheat prices higher in early trading.
The run-up on weather worries, however, was tempered by concerns about threats of a trade war between Beijing and Washington, said Mike Young, an analyst at the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle.
"Anytime you start putting up tariffs, it's not good for the overall psychology of export markets," he said. '
Wheat for July delivery dropped 1 cent, to $5.8225 a bushel. July corn rose a quarter of a cent, to $4.8750 a bushel.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Sony Signals a Recovery With Upswing in Earnings

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 15

 BODY:
The Sony Corporation reported its strongest earnings in years today, owing to brisk sales of computer components and its new Playstation video game machine and a return to profitability of its Hollywood studio operations.
The profits for the fiscal year partly reverse a huge loss from the previous year, when Sony took a $3.2 billion charge against earnings stemming from box-office flops and significant cost overruns at Sony Pictures Entertainment. 
 The latest results suggest that Sony is recovering from several years in which it was hurt by turmoil in its movie business, a recession in Japan, the rise of the yen and a lack of new hit consumer electronics products.
For the year, which ended on March 31, Sony earned 54.25 billion yen, or $511.8 million, compared with a loss of 293.36 billion yen, or $2.8 billion, a year earlier. Revenues increased 15.1 percent, to 4.59 trillion yen, or $43.3 billion.
Sony said operating income of 235.32 billion yen, or $2.2 billion, was its third highest, behind the fiscal years that ended in March 1990 and 1991. Net income was the best in four years, though still less than half the peak levels in the early 1990's.
Results were bolstered by 41.4 percent growth in sales of electronic products outside its traditional audio and video business. These include the Playstation video game machine as well as monitors, semiconductors, CD-ROM drives and other components that were in demand during last year's personal computer boom in the United States and Japan.
Sony's results are in sharp contrast to some of the other Japanese consumer electronics companies that do not have the same breadth or strength in computer components.
The Pioneer Electronic Corporation, for instance, is planning to cut its work force by 800 people, or about 11 percent, in the next few months through early retirement and other measures. The company, hurt by weak sales and low prices in the audio business, is expected to report a loss of 15 billion yen, or more than $140 million, in the fiscal year that ended in March.
Sony's entertainment business, which includes records and the movie studios, registered an operating profit of 54.9 billion yen, or $518 million, compared with a heavy loss the year before.
Sony does not report the earnings for Sony Pictures Entertainment, which operates the Columbia and Tri-Star studios. But officials said it was profitable owing to successful movies like "Jumanji" and "Sense and Sensibility," better cost controls, and the off-network syndication of the television comedy "Seinfeld." In revenues, the pictures group saw a 13 percent gain, to 318.3 billion yen, or $3 billion.
But the music group, which includes the former CBS Records, suffered a decline in operating income while sales declined in the United States. Overall music group sales rose 3.6 percent, to 512.9 billion yen, or $4.8 billion, based on stronger sales outside the United States.
Sony's core consumer electronics business did well, with sales of television sets up 12.2 percent and sales of video equipment up 5.8 percent, as measured in yen. Audio sales, however, were flat.
Sony forecast aggressive gains in profits for the current year, assuming the yen does not appreciate again.

HEADLINE: Protecting Ourselves

BYLINE: By Alan Tonelson; Alan Tonelson is a research fellow at the United States Business and Industrial Council Educational Foundation, a trade association.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Opponents of renewing China's most-favored-nation status are regularly accused of sacrificing American economic interests for the worthy but impractical purpose of protesting China's human-rights violations. Yet the privilege needs to be revoked for a practical reason: to help change a largely one-sided relationship that harms our economy and workers.
Congress is expected to vote on China's most-favored-nation status in early summer. Most of China's apologists hope that a tough American stand on the current dispute over China's piracy of American software, music and movies will ease the pressure to revoke the trade privileges. But whether this week's impasse on intellectual property leads to a trade war or not, the two countries' basic economic relationship still must be redefined. 
 Most-favored-nation status, routinely offered to most American trade partners, guarantees them low tariffs. But China is no ordinary trading country. Some American companies profit from trade with China, and our exports support American jobs. Yet these exports of goods to China, valued at $11.7 billion in 1995, were lower than our exports to Belgium or even Hong Kong. And despite years of double-digit growth in China, the increase in our exports has been sluggish.
Further, because of heavy American corporate investment in Chinese factories, which approached $3 billion in new deals in 1994, many exports to China cause the loss of jobs at home because parts are shipped there for manufacturing that used to be done in our factories.
Equally important, American imports from China have grown much faster than exports, producing a merchandise trade deficit of $34 billion in 1995. These net losses depress job creation, wages and growth for our economy as a whole. Nor are these losses being offset elsewhere: America's merchandise trade deficit was a record $175 billion last year.
 The nature of the trade deficit is worrisome, too. Of the 20 industries running the biggest trade surpluses with China in 1995, only aerospace companies and businesses that produce man-made fiber turn out the high-value, sophisticated goods that generate the best-paying American jobs. The other industries sell raw materials and low-value products like fertilizers, cereals, wood pulp and ore slag and ash -- the kinds of goods third-world countries sell to industrialized ones. If this trend continues, third-world wages for our workers are inevitable.
American trade problems with China stem largely from its protectionism, not from market forces. China's tariffs are among the world's highest. Not only is China the world's worst thief of intellectual property, it has become a major dumper, selling goods here at artificially low prices aimed at driving American competitors out of business.
China regularly extorts know-how and high-skill jobs from American companies like Boeing. As a condition of sales, it forces businesses to manufacture parts of their products within its borders and to transfer technology to Chinese partners. Beijing's aim is to set up its own industries and supplant our suppliers in sectors like aerospace, semiconductors and automobiles.
The United States is the biggest target of China's protectionism. But our huge trade deficit with China also gives us tremendous leverage. We buy up to 40 percent of China's exports, and the hard currency China earns helps finance industrial and military modernization. Beijing could not easily make up lost sales to the United States by increasing its exports to Japan and Europe, whose markets are more closed than ours.
Revoking China's most-favored-nation status is often portrayed as economic aggression. Yet many American tariffs would still be lower than China's tariffs on our products. The change would simply introduce long-overdue reciprocity into our trade relations. Tariff reductions should then be tied to a measurable opening of Chinese markets.
Doing business with the United States is not something the world's protectionists are entitled to. It is a privilege they should earn.

HEADLINE: ON PRO BASKETBALL;
Best Shot for Ewing? It's Outside New York

BYLINE: By Harvey Araton 

 BODY:
This was a good hour after the Knicks took their familiar end-of-the-season walk from the court toward the locker room in Chicago Tuesday night. Michael Jordan had just left the interview room, and now Patrick Ewing maneuvered his long, tired body onto the platform and into the seat behind the table. Ewing said nothing we haven't heard before, mostly with no expression. But then, after all the questions about the game, about the season, about the direction of his team, he was asked if he had any doubts regarding his own return to the hackneyed Knicks.
Ewing's face suddenly illuminated with this magnificent smile, as if he kind of knew something the rest of us did not. "Only time will tell," he said. 
 There are times we foolishly respond to athletes' failure as if it is some unspeakable calamity, as if they will go home, lock themselves in a room and stare at a wall. Ewing, following an 11th pro season that did not yield a championship ring, said that his personal suffering would not dissipate until he started all over again next fall. It sounded sincere but it couldn't possibly be. How could he mourn the death of a title hope that never really lived?
Not this year, anyway, and Ewing surely knew that, no matter how he played along all season, mouthing cliches that would allow him to slip away from the interviewers and into New York's cold winter nights. His body language late Tuesday night was altogether different from what it was in Houston two years ago, when the title was right in front of his eyes, or even last spring, when his finger roll against Indiana popped off the back rim and the Knicks officially became a team that couldn't get out of the second round. Then you could see this proud man was in pain because he thought he had a chance, and until that Game 7 deflation a year ago, so did most everyone else.
It is five springs now since Ewing temporarily decided, at the career peak age of 29, that there would never be a legitimate opportunity to win in New York. He had already played for a handful of coaches and general managers, and witnessed a parade of unspectacular players pass through the Garden locker room.
Ewing told the Knicks that he wanted to exercise a clause in his contract to become a free agent. The team contested his right. The argument dragged on and Ewing was attacked in print and on talk radio as greedy, as a loser, an infidel. His agent, David Falk, pleaded for his muted client. He said it was just business, just Ewing exploring his contractual options.
After the matter was settled favorably for the Knicks in arbitration, Ewing was rewarded with an $18 million balloon payment for this, the next-to-last season on his original 10-year deal. It was good business for the Knicks, Dave Checketts explained. Ewing was a franchise player. They wanted him to be paid market value, and play happy, which he did, for four years under Pat Riley.
And Ewing and the Knicks did come close, barely losing the title in Houston. "He had his chance when I was gone," said Jordan. When it comes to the subject of competition, Jordan can be so coldly candid. He also happened to be right. It was over for Patrick Ewing's Knicks. Ewing has one year left on his contract, for $3.3 million. If he plays it out in New York, then Falk will be knocking on Checketts's door next summer. Ewing, who has finished these last two seasons numbing the pain in his aching knees with icepacks, would be turning 35. By that time, the rate for superstars will have escalated dramatically, with Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal setting this summer's scale.
And that is why the Knicks must at least explore a deal that would send Ewing away for a foothold into the future. This franchise needs to be redirected as much as the team needs to be rebuilt. It needs to stop thinking about serving up season-ticket holders false hope in return for an annual and short-sighted price hike.
What could the Knicks have done better in the Chicago series? "Rebounding the ball, not turning the ball over, hit the shots," Ewing said, which pretty much translates into the need for a whole new team.
There are no easy solutions, no quick fixes. But Seattle is a serious title contender without a star center. Utah is still alive. Rebounder/shot blocker Dikembe Mutombo, another free agent in Falk's stable, is five years younger than Ewing. Checketts should tell Falk: "You bring Mutombo here; we'll send Patrick where he wants to go."
This is no referendum on Ewing's Knick career either. No star whose best supporting talent has been Charles Oakley, Derek Harper and John Starks has to defend himself. But facts are facts. Ewing will not be worth what he'll want next year. He is on the downside of his excellent career. He is highly marketable right now.
This is nothing personal, of course. It is just business.

HEADLINE: Hockey Team Is to Remain, For Now

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 15

 BODY:
The Hartford Whalers hockey team, Connecticut's only major league sports franchise, announced today that it would remain here for two more years, but probably no longer.
The team also said it would try to cut its budget by $7 million, which might involve reducing player salaries and marketing efforts. 
 "It should be obvious to everybody that if the economic performance of the franchise does not improve within two years, the franchise will be gone," said Peter Karmanos, the Whalers' principal owner, who said the team had lost $30 million in the last two years.
The announcement came after more than six weeks of "Save the Whalers" rallies and news conferences, at which state leaders including Gov. John G. Rowland stressed the team's importance to Hartford and the region. The drive was intended to sell 11,000 season tickets, the number the team said it needed to make a profit.
Despite the support of Hartford's corporations, which helped finance ticket purchases by their employees, and a two-week extension of the deadline, the team has sold only 8,433 tickets.
In announcing their decision, team officials did not fault the fans. Instead, they charged that state officials had failed to offer them a written agreement giving the Whalers about $7 million in parking and food concessions, money the team says it needs to break even.
Mr. Rowland said he would continue to negotiate with the Whalers. "It is my goal to extend the team's relationship with Hartford beyond the length of the current contract," he said in a statement.
But on Tuesday night, he was more caustic. "Frankly," he said, "the fans deserve more respect, the business community deserves more respect and so do the people that worked tirelessly over the last few months to offer a good deal to the Whalers."
The state already has a lot invested in the Whalers. When the current owners took over two years ago, the state subsidized $25.5 million of the $47.5 million purchase price. The agreement required the team to remain in Hartford for at least four years. After that, they could leave if they had lost $30 million.
The team said today that it would live up to that agreement, although it has said that its losses already exceed $30 million.
People eating lunch in the food court of the Hartford Civic Center, which includes the coliseum where the Whalers play, responded angrily to the team's probable move. Many said that Mr. Karamonos had made unrealistic demands, and several said that they thought he had planned on moving ever since he bought the franchise two years ago.
The ticket drive "was an unrealistic ploy to make it seem like the public was the reason he was leaving," said Kevin A. Lindsay, 24, who works downtown. "They were just trying to make the public the scapegoat."
A spokesman for Mayor Michael P. Peters said the announcement was good news, since it would give the state and the team an additional chance to reach an agreement. "It gives us some time," the spokesman, Paul D. Shipman, said. "If the team does better, maybe the crowds will pick up."
With an average attendance of 11,500, the team has the third-lowest average attendance in the National Hockey League, the league reports, and the fifth lowest based on percentage of capacity. The coliseum can hold 15,635 people.

HEADLINE: U.S. Judge Approves Orange County Plan

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

DATELINE: SANTA ANA, Calif., May 15

 BODY:
A Federal Bankruptcy Court judge approved the reorganization plan of Orange County, Calif., today, clearing the way for the county to emerge from bankruptcy proceedings next month.
The decision, by Judge John E. Ryan, comes 17 months after Orange County filed for the largest municipal bankruptcy in history, and it will enable the county to sell $920 million in new debt next month. The county will also repay $800 million in debt that it was unable to meet when it matured on June 30, 1995. 
 Under the plan, Orange County will fully repay bondholders, suppliers and employees while schools, cities and local agencies will count on lawsuits to recover the final 10 cents to 20 cents of every $1 lost.
Judge Ryan said the case involved 3,000 court filings, more than 477 judicial orders and 6,836 creditors' claims.
The county filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors on Dec. 6, 1994, after losing nearly $2 billion on high-risk, highly leveraged bets on the course of interest rates.

HEADLINE: Factory Output Up in April; Gain Tied to G.M. Reopening

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
Factory output jumped in April, the Government reported today, but the increase was solely a result of General Motors reopening auto plants that had been shut down by a strike.
Another report, meanwhile, suggested that inventories were becoming lean enough that many businesses would have to meet demand with new orders and increased production rather than from stocks already on shelves and backlots. 
 Output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities shot up nine-tenths of 1 percent last month, rebounding from March's five-tenths of 1 percent decline, the Federal Reserve reported. It was the second advance in industrial production in three months.
But the growth included a 19.2 percent surge in motor vehicles following the end of the 18-day strike in March that virtually shut down the General Motors Corporation's assembly plants. Excluding autos, production was unchanged from March.
Still, the recent data "continue to indicate moderate improvement in the manufacturing sector," said Marilyn Schaja, an economist at the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation in New York.
David Orr, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C., agreed. Averaging the nonauto production for March and April produced a 1.8 percent annual growth rate, "which is fair to middlin," he said. "Manufacturing definitely has a better tone to it."
The report also suggested little inflation pressures. It said the nation's industries were operating at 83 percent of capability in March, up from 82.5 percent a month earlier but still low enough to avoid shortages that would produce higher prices. At the same time, the Commerce Department reported that business inventories declined three-tenths of 1 percent in March, the first drop since stockpiles fell four-tenths of 1 percent last December.
Again, the G.M. strike contributed to the report as auto inventories fell by 2.8 percent.
Still, the shrinkage was widespread. "It confirms that inventories are under much better control," Mr. Orr said. "Any increase in orders now will help the production side."
In its report, the Fed said factory output jumped 1.3 percent in April, more than erasing the eight-tenths of 1 percent loss a month earlier.
Production of durable goods, including cars, expected to last more than three years rose 2.3 percent after falling 1.3 percent the previous month. However, nondurable goods output was flat after a two-tenths of 1 percent decline in March.
The Commerce Department report said business inventories totaled a seasonally adjusted $980.5 billion in March, down from $982.6 billion a month earlier.
Business sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $703.5 billion, up from $701.3 billion in February, when they bounced back 1.1 percent from January's storms. Sales in January had plunged nine-tenths of 1 percent.

HEADLINE: A Spy Agency Admits Accumulating $4 Billion in Secret Money

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
In a complete collapse of accountability, the Government agency that builds spy satellites accumulated about $4 billion in uncounted secret money, nearly twice the amount previously reported to Congress, intelligence officials acknowledged today.
The agency, the highly secretive National Reconnaissance Office, said last year that the surplus money totaled no more than about $1 billion. Congressional intelligence overseers said in December that the amount was about $2 billion. 
 They were misinformed. The secret agency was unaware until very recently exactly how much money it had accumulated in its classified compartments. To put the $4 billion in perspective, what the National Reconnaissance Office did was to lose track of a sum roughly equal to the annual budgets for the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the State Department, combined.
John Nelson, appointed last year as the reconnaissance office's top financial manager and given the task of cleaning up the problem, said in an interview published today in a special edition of Defense Week that the secret agency had undergone "a fundamental financial meltdown."
Senior intelligence officials confirmed Mr. Nelson's unusually candid account, and said the meltdown was fueled by excessive secrecy, financial incompetence and a lack of accountability at the agency.
All the money spent by the secret agency, a clandestine branch of the Air Force, is hidden through various false line items that make up the so-called "black budget," which finances secret intelligence and military programs and is shielded from public scrutiny. The existence of the reconnaissance office was itself a state secret, though badly kept, until 1992.
The reconnaissance office issues secret Government contracts to build systems and components for space satellites that take pictures, record radar images and eavesdrop on telecommunications. It spends about $6 billion in secret money a year building the satellites for the Central Intelligence Agency, the Air Force and the Navy.
While technically adept, it was financially inept, senior intelligence officials said. It had 15 different accounting systems in its 15 different program offices, each kept secret from one another.
"Everybody did it a little different, none of them talked to each other, and it was a mess," Mr. Nelson told Defense Week. "This was literally a house on fire in many ways."
The financial incompetence of the reconnaissance office meant that one of the nation's biggest intelligence agencies misinformed Congress, the Director of Central Intelligence and the Secretary of Defense about how much money it had on hand, Mr. Nelson said.
The agency's secrecy made Congressional oversight next to impossible, intelligence officials said. Thus, the Congressional intelligence committees kept appropriating money for the secret agency, unaware that it was building up a surplus of billions of dollars.
The reconnaissance office found itself in trouble in 1994 for constructing what several senators called a "stealth building." The Senate Intelligence Committee protested that the agency had built itself a headquarters outside Washington, costing more than $300 million, without disclosing the building's true cost and size.
The agency's financial managers explained the lapse by saying they had treated the construction project as if it were a covert operation, and had broken the financing for the building into indecipherable fragments to hide the cost.

HEADLINE: General Electric Spreads Its Wings;
An Aviation Giant Built on Engines, Leasing and Finance

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
Quick. Who has the most airplanes in today's crowded skies? Not United. Not American. Not British Airways, either.
The winner is the General Electric Company. 
 Its finance arm's leasing division has the largest fleet in the air -- owning, or managing for others, one of every 12 commercial planes worldwide.
It has become a low-profile airline partner, helping to patch up the balance sheets of carriers from Continental and Northwest to Varig and China Southern.
G.E.'s engine division, with help from its partnership with Snecma of France, has won more than half of all orders in the 1990's and is the only engine maker overhauling its competitors' engines. G.E. is also a partner in Polar Air Cargo, which has 12 Boeing 747's.
And it is getting bigger. The leasing division recently placed a $4 billion order for Boeing jets and is offering, along with the engine division, new services to airlines that are looking to outsource some costly parts of their business, like upgrading aircraft to meet noise regulations.
With planes, as with cars, high purchase costs are a big reason for the growth of leasing, with nearly half of all aircraft now under lease worldwide, up from about a quarter a decade ago. And with this growth, no company has done as much as G.E. to change the airline and aircraft manufacturing industries in subtle but important ways.
The aviation business, in all its faces, shows how one of America's premier companies gets bigger and bigger while maintaining lofty profit margins. Aviation has everything General Electric likes -- good growth prospects, huge capital requirements that keep most rivals out and a demand for parts and strong service that strengthens ties to its customers.
"We never would have thought," said Jim Johnson, president of the leasing and finance division, GE Capital Aviation Services, "that the kind of services we provide were actually part of our charter."
Indeed, G.E.'s charter in the aviation business has broadened rapidly in recent years to the extent that its huge interests, whose financial contributions are not all detailed in earnings statements, generate a combined operating profit of about $2 billion on revenues of about $10 billion, according to an estimate by Wolfgang H. Demisch, an analyst at BT Securities. The company's broad reach has at times been a sticky subject as well, prompting criticisms about a less-than-level playing field and questions from investors about potential conflicts of interest.
Take G.E.'s ties to GPA Group. G.E. saved the Irish aircraft-leasing company from bankruptcy in 1993. But GPA still struggled under an onerous debt burden, prompting its recent successful bid to raise $4 billion backed by hundreds of aircraft and associated leases.
One potential conflict that has raised investor concerns stems from the fact that GE Capital Aviation Services, or Gecas, manages not only the GPA aircraft in the latest deal but also its own aircraft, other planes owned by GPA and those owned by other investors. So when it comes time to lease available planes to customers, whose aircraft get the biggest marketing push?
"They are playing so many roles, in a sense they are running into themselves within the same transactions," said Philip Baggaley, an analyst at Standard & Poor's. The credit rating agency, however, has told investors it expects G.E. to be able to handle potential conflicts professionally. And in the prospectus for the deal, Gecas said it would not unreasonably discriminate among the available planes.
G.E. drew criticism when it won an order in 1991 for engines to power Boeing 777's for British Airways, at the same time buying -- apparently at a hefty premium -- the airline's engine-overhaul base in Wales.
Airbus Industrie, the aircraft manufacturer, concerned that Europeans had been frozen out, called the purchase a rebate for the engine order -- the first time British Airways had bought engines not made by Rolls-Royce. The British Government determined that the transactions were separate.
G.E.'s size was raised again as an issue last week, when the company said its engine division would work with Pratt & Whitney to develop a new engine for the Boeing 747. Many experts said that with G.E.'s market share in engines, antitrust agencies were likely to look into the potential consequences of the joint venture. But the two companies have not yet filed details of their proposed corporate structure with Government agencies like the Justice Department.
Such concerns are unlikely to be raised about G.E.'s leasing division, which competes with dozens of companies that finance aircraft. "The leasing business is essentially the investment of money," said Steven A. Newborn, an antitrust lawyer with Rogers & Wells in Washington. "If there is any hint of supracompetitive profits to be made, there will be a lot of entry into that industry."
In fact, many airline executives say the leasing division's size actually fosters competition. G.E.'s willingness to lease planes to start-up airlines helps them grow.
Gecas drives tough bargains. But several airline executives said G.E. executed deals quickly, provided good service and because it was so big, generally had planes available.
"They help make the entire industry more efficient," said Edward R. Beauvais, chairman of Western Pacific Airlines, which leases five planes from G.E. "The role G.E. is playing is extremely vital for smaller companies."
And for larger ones, too. G.E. was instrumental in helping Continental Airlines emerge in April 1993 from its second tour through bankruptcy. GE Capital was the first big investor to put money on the table, among other things lending Continental $310 million.
When Continental ordered $4 billion in new aircraft in 1993, it ordered G.E. engines for nearly all the jets. That prompted speculation that GE Capital had just been out to win highly profitable engine orders. But John E. Luth, at the time a top Continental executive, said G.E. narrowly beat out competitive bids.
The impact of leasing companies on aircraft makers, which in recent years have taken in sizable orders from companies like Gecas and the International Lease Finance Corporation, is less clear.
Boeing and Airbus executives said they appreciated winning huge orders that would keep production lines humming. And Christian Scherer, vice president of an Airbus division created 18 months ago to work with leasing companies, said companies like Gecas helped expand the market by placing planes with carriers in far-flung corners of the world. The leasing companies, he said, employ more salespeople than Airbus.
In a sense, Mr. Scherer added, leasing companies are becoming a new distribution channel, much the way dealers help auto makers sell cars.
"There is a definite recognition," he added, "that G.E. has a huge amount of marketing expertise that is different from aircraft manufacturers' expertise."
But the growth of leasing companies may have also created as much work for aircraft makers as it has saved. Richard R. Albrecht, executive vice president of Boeing's commercial airplane group, said Boeing salespeople must still work to persuade airlines to lease Boeing aircraft from leasing companies like Gecas.
G.E. has every intention of changing the marketplace even further. The president of Gecas, Mr. Johnson, who had been an executive at Boeing and Pratt, said he wanted Gecas to move from being a finance and leasing company to handling everything from financial transactions to hardware changes for airline fleets for its 157 customers in 54 countries.
For example, the company recently closed a large deal to buy "hush kits" to bring its fleet's engines into compliance with Federal noise regulations. But it is also offering to upgrade the planes its customers own, swapping in one of Gecas's spare aircraft while the work is done.
For its part, the engine division is trying to expand its "power by the hour" contracts, in which it offers to bear the cost and risk of maintaining its engines. It also recently won a 10-year, $2.3 billion contract to maintain all British Airways engines.
Analysts say industry trends should play into G.E.'s service strategy. "The biggest airlines are going to continue to do the vast majority of work in-house," said Edmund S. Greenslet, who runs ESG Aviation Services. "But the smaller airlines will be more and more relying on outside contract services, and G.E. will be more and more a part of that."
Mr. Johnson said his other goals included creating a better balance of short- and long-term leases to flatten the effects of the cyclical industry. After all, consistent performance appears to be the key to surviving and thriving at G.E., and Gecas executives said the aircraft and leasing division would remain at roughly 5 to 8 percent of GE Capital's total investment portfolio only as long as the division performed up to standards.
"At GE Capital, you make your numbers," Mr. Johnson said.
The engine division has shown that it can turn the difficulties of an industry downturn into an opportunity. Although its sales fell from $7.7 billion in 1991, to $6.1 billion in 1995, a broad restructuring resulted in higher margins.
Mr. Johnson said one of his goals was to broaden the type of airlines Gecas counted among its customers. Historically, it has worked with higher-risk credits, but Mr. Johnson said he also wanted bigger, more established carriers, whose greater stability would justify the lower returns their business might yield.
Gecas, however, will continue to look for airlines, like Continental, that need help but are often seen as too risky.
"G.E. really stayed with Continental through a couple of cycles, and G.E. lost a lot of money in those cycles, but it's been a win-win for both of us," Mr. Johnson said.
"G.E. is large enough that we have some staying power."

This Man Wants a Job

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Before, Bob Dole didn't have a vision.
Then Bob Dole didn't have a vision or money to campaign. 
 Now Bob Dole doesn't have a vision or money or a job.
I'm worried about the guy. His world is shrinking. I picture him, an unemployed veteran deprived of the well of the Senate, sitting in a darkened room in his apartment at the Watergate, eating Chinese takeout and watching C-Span and yelling at the screen, "Agghhh, Trent Lott, you backstabbing friend of Newt, that's not the way Bob Dole would have asked for a motion to table the amendment so that the Senate could proceed to passage of Calendar No. 472, H.R. 3558, with no intervening action or debate." I picture him trying to get Senator Lott on the horn and not being put through.
Still, I've always been a sucker for grand, self-sacrificing gestures.
Sydney Carton in "A Tale of Two Cities" doing a far, far better thing. Patrick Henry demanding liberty or death. Edward VIII giving up the crown for the woman he loved. Rick giving up the woman he loved for Capt. Louis Renault.
An Italian journalist told me that in Italy, Senator Dole was considered a dead ringer for Humphrey Bogart. And though that tough, silent, cool image has not yet caught on here, maybe the Senate majority leader is just one desperate, dramatic act away from a beautiful friendship with the voters.
So we all jammed into a room in the Senate to see Bob Dole give up something he loves to do for something he hates to do to try for something he probably can't have. It was an event that, until now, was considered an oxymoron: an electrifying Dole moment.
"I feel like I'm at a rock concert," gushed one television reporter, as Nancy Kassebaum and Bob Kerrey squeezed past.
Everybody wanted to be there when Mr. Dole threw away his net. He had a good speech at last, with the rumble of railroad tracks and the breeze of summer running through it. And he gave it well at last, with a genuine quaver in his voice and without the usual dry litany of legislative accomplishments. ("And then we got the Lawn Sprinkler Act of 1985 passed . . .")
"With all due respect to Congress," he said sweetly, "America has been my life."
The man who wanted to be a doer, not a talker, suddenly has to be a talker, not a doer -- before he has even articulated why he wants to be President. Though Republicans were excited that he described himself as "buoyant," his remarks were still a touch dark for a country that craves sunny. "I have done it the hard way," he said, "and I will do it the hard way once again."
He moved the audience when he put his resignation in perspective of the sacrifice of his war injuries. "But I will be the same man I was when . . . I rose from my hospital bed and was permitted, by the grace of God, to walk again in the world." It was a rare glimpse of personal authenticity in a campaign where that has been the hardest quality to find.
He did not want to give up his cozy club. Several months ago, when a Republican friend suggested that Howard Baker had found it difficult to run for President while he was still the Republican leader, Mr. Dole growled that he was not Howard Baker.
But his wife, Elizabeth, convinced him that he had to give his campaign shock therapy to get Americans to give him a second look, to move away from the man he has been his whole life, the backroom deal maker in the dark blue suit.
And he finally realized he could not control all those characters in Congress. Leaving was the only way to get a divorce from Newt Gingrich, though the Speaker dryly notes that the White House has plenty of pictures of him with Mr. Dole stored up. (See you later, triangulator.)
The danger, of course, is whether Mr. Dole's move smacked more of retirement than regeneration.
When he said he was going to "the White House or home," what he really meant was the White House or homeless. It's possible to imagine Bill Clinton outside the Beltway, maybe as a studio head in Hollywood. But for Bob Dole, it's Beltway or die.

HEADLINE: An Ultimatum on Chinese Piracy

 BODY:
A trade war between the United States and China could prove costly to both countries, but Beijing's piracy of American goods has left the Clinton Administration no choice but to threaten a confrontation.
The United States trade office took the first steps yesterday toward a trade conflict. It issued a preliminary list of Chinese imports -- mostly clothing and electronics goods -- that will be slapped with steep tariff increases unless China quickly stops its factories from illegally copying American films, computer software, music and other intellectual property. The Chinese immediately responded with a list of American automobiles and other goods targeted for retaliatory trade barriers. 
A trade war would harm both sides. Unlike Washington's threatened tariff spike on Japanese luxury cars last year, the American victims of a trade conflict with China will not be the most affluent consumers. Low-income families, especially those that rely on inexpensive clothes, would be forced to pay higher prices for some goods. The Chinese, for their part, would lose a rich market that is more open to their exports than other Western economies are.
The damage to American consumers can be eased. There are other low-cost suppliers of clothing, especially in Asia and Latin America. The bigger threat would be to American corporations, like Boeing, which China could decide at a later time to lock out of its market. Aircraft manufacturers rely on large production runs to bring down their costs and, ultimately, the price they charge for their planes. If China buys the European Airbus instead, Boeing's overall competitive position could be damaged.
As serious as these risks are, the greater threat to American interests would be not to challenge China's conduct. The Chinese piracy brazenly violates trade accords and costs American business billions of dollars a year. The Administration has patiently sought a negotiated settlement, and last year the Chinese Government signed an agreement to end the theft.
The international commitment to open trade depends on every country's honoring the rules of fair trade. President Clinton could not allow China to steal intellectual property with impunity without weakening the United States' credibility among other Asian countries and trade partners around the globe.
The Clinton Administration has declined to impose trade sanctions to punish China's violations of human rights and its shipment of restricted nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan. In those cases, independent American action to defend international interests might have been undermined by the failure of other countries to impose similar penalties. The threat of American action on piracy is more credible because it focuses on a narrow goal that concerns only China and the United States.
The most desirable outcome now is for China to recognize that good relations with the United States, as well as a large source of its foreign currency revenue, will be threatened if it fails to enforce trade laws. If internal political turmoil in Beijing prevents the leadership from doing what is right, China could impose small retaliatory tariffs as a prelude to negotiating a quick settlement. The issues are too important for Washington to turn away from a fight. Intellectual property is one of America's most valuable exports.

HEADLINE: In Trade Rift, U.S. Outlines Penalties, And So Does China

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
After months of warnings, the Clinton Administration today published a list of $3 billion of Chinese goods that could be subject to the largest trade sanctions ever imposed by Washington if Beijing refuses not to close factories that pirate American software and music.
In a bitterly worded response, China retaliated within minutes by threatening to block new American investments and to place enormous tariffs on American automobiles, telecommunications equipment and other goods. China declared it was acting to safeguard its "state sovereignty and national dignity." 
 While the exchange of charges and countercharges sounded much like the opening shots in a broad trade war between two frustrated superpowers, Administration officials said they were betting that Chinese officials would back down before the 100 percent tariffs on clothing, textiles and electronics went into effect on June 17.
But the Administration warned that it would not settle for another written agreement, like the one China signed more than a year ago, under threat of less punitive sanctions. Charlene Barshefsky, the acting United States trade representative, said the 31 factories churning out more than $2 billion in illegally copied compact disks and CD-ROM's must begin to close in coming weeks if China wanted to avoid the sanctions.
"At the end of the day what we want here is a substantial curbing of piracy," said Ms. Barshefsky, who succeeded Mickey Kantor after he was appointed Commerce Secretary. "This is not a question about China's capability. It is a simple matter of political will."
But in private, Administration officials concede they are taking a considerable risk over how China will react. While today's sanctions are relatively small -- the final list of $2 billion will affect under 4 percent of American imports from China -- experts note that Chinese leaders are jockeying for power as they wait for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, to die. Under the circumstances, Beijing may be reluctant to be seen bowing to American pressure.
"I'd be lying if I didn't say there were reservations here about our tactics," one senior Administration official said today.
Such moves are becoming a familiar feature of the trade landscape. A year ago, the United States threatened sanctions against Japanese luxury cars in a dispute over American access to the Japanese auto and auto parts markets. But those sanctions were averted when a settlement was reached at the last moment in June.
Even American industry is fractured over the threats against China. While Hollywood and the American software industry applauded today's move, the leading association of American retailers denounced the imposition of sanctions on clothing, textiles and silk as "clearly illegal."
And the Ford Motor Company, vying for approval to build an assembly plant in China, warned that it could become the victim of a superpower standoff. "It is unfortunate to see these two great nations, who obviously have so much to gain by increasing trade and other exchanges with each other, caught in this dilemma," said W. Wayne Booker, an executive vice president at Ford. "We do not believe that unilateral sanctions by either country are constructive or likely to lead to a solution of the problem."
Ford is caught in a double bind: If China fails to live up to its agreements, automotive designs and parts can easily be stolen; if the United States angers the Chinese leadership, access to the Chinese market will go to Toyota or Volkswagen.
The Administration's action today came just days after Secretary of State Warren Christopher decided against trade sanctions on China for shipping nuclear-related materials to Pakistan, arguing that the Chinese leadership might not have known of the transaction.
Republican critics of the Administration's policy say that decision was more evidence of a disjointed policy toward China, one that places trade and American jobs ahead of nuclear dangers or human rights. Mr. Christopher answered those charges today, insisting that the Administration acted on a case-by-case basis, moving when it had clear evidence that China was ignoring its commitments and staying its hand when it did not.
Next week, President Clinton is expected to lay out his rationale for extending China's broad trading privileges, called most-favored-nation status. He will argue that the best way to change China's behavior is to respond to specific violations with narrowly focused sanctions rather than by destroying China's ability to export to the United States. That argument has been gaining currency on Capitol Hill, especially after Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, endorsed most-favored-nation status.
But if China goes through with its counterretaliation, one Administration official said, "this would become a much, much tougher fight." And now, with Mr. Dole leaving the Senate, it is hard to predict how the debate over China will unfold on Capitol Hill.
Today's action marks a major escalation in the fight with China over trade piracy. In February 1995, the United States first threatened sanctions against China for its failure to negotiate an accord that would keep factories throughout the countryside from turning out unauthorized copies of hit movies, expensive software packages and popular music.
At that time, China and the United States alike were careful to avoid threatening important industries in the other's country. That restraint is gone today. Two-thirds of the potential sanctions announced today by Ms. Barshefsky involve clothes, textiles or silk, all state-dominated industries concentrated in southern China, the same region that is harboring the software pirates. When China turned out its vaguely worded list of goods subject to counter-retaliation, it said it would hit hardest at American cars and car parts.
While America's list of threatened sanctions was highly specific, China's was vague and its size was difficult to measure.
China's countermeasures will go into effect on the same day that United States sanctions against China take effect, June 17, the report said.
China has argued repeatedly that it is committed to stamping out piracy, and American officials say Beijing has begun to crack down on many retailers who sell thousands of dollars worth of American computer software for $5 or so, and popular CD's for around $1. Nonetheless, China's exports of pirated material have actually increased since the 1995 agreement was signed.
"The fact is that piracy is lucrative, very lucrative," Ms. Barshefsky said today. What she hesitated to add was that the beneficiaries of many of the profits are the families of national and local leaders and the military.
Ms. Barshefsky insisted that many of America's allies, including Japan and countries throughout Europe, supported the Administration's effort to force China to respect copyrights and trademarks. Indeed, many of their products will benefit, too. While Hollywood and the American software industry have pressed the issue, the world's largest producers of compact disks include Sony, Polygram and Bertelsmann, all based outside the United States. But no other countries are expected to join the action, in part for fear of angering China.
The American sanctions list was put together with the aim of minimizing the impact of the tariffs on American consumers. Most of the products subject to the penalties are also made in the United States or imported from Mexico, Latin America or Southeast Asia.

HEADLINE: If It's Good for Margin, It's Good for the Nation

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "We're Leaner, Meaner and Going Nowhere Faster" (Week in Review, May 12): Productivity statistics should not be based on revenue per working hour. The important statistic is profit margin per working hour. Only when there is margin can wages increase and resources be spent on research, development and other functions of real growth. 
 After World War II, when the United States was the world's industrial power, we could sell at any price everything we manufactured. This produced the prosperity of the 1950's. When the world caught up and we had competition, prices came down and so did margins.
Staying profitable required reducing costs through economies of scale, specialization, technology and downsizing. When margins are declining, there is bad news for everyone. We must never ask "How's business?" but "How are your margins?"

Paranoia, Bigotry and Hate Exploding Into Death

BYLINE: By JOHN J. O'CONNOR 

 BODY:
Television entertainment likes to sell a comforting vision of America the beautiful, a place that can always be relied on, no matter how unsettling its problems, to find an upbeat ending. But CBS's "Ruby Ridge: An American Tragedy" is stuck with America the horrifying.
Despite some fudging and judicious editing, the story of the Weaver family's deadly confrontation with the United States Government in remote northern Idaho does not lend itself to uplift of any kind. This is not a tragedy. It's a madness virus. Powerfully reconstructed with an outstanding cast,"Ruby Ridge" is being broadcast Sunday and Tuesday, from 9 to 11 each night. 
 Randy and Vicki Weaver (Randy Quaid and Laura Dern) marry in the late 1970's and settle into a standard middle-class existence in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Vicki is already compulsive ("Dishes on the left, toys on the right," she primly insists) and deep into apocalyptic interpretations of the Bible. She sees the world going crazy with sex shops and violence, not to mention wars, earthquakes and a one-world economy, and she truly believes that "the end is nigh." Randy, who calls his wife "Mama," is not quite so zealous, but he goes along with Vicki.
Job problems and increasing paranoia about what they call the Zionist one-world conspiracy lead Randy, a former Green Beret in Vietnam, and his family to the isolated area of Ruby Ridge, where he teaches his children defensive warfare with the help of his imposing arsenal of guns. The property includes a hut for women to go to when they're having their "unclean" times.
The Weavers attend an Aryan Nations World Congress, where, as youthful skinheads rock and mosh, the talk runs to concerns about ZOG (Zionist-Occupied Government) and white purity. At this congress, Randy meets a man who gets him to sell a shipment of sawed-off shotguns. The man is an undercover Federal Government agent.
Failing to appear in court on an arrest warrant, Randy is sought by the local United States marshals' office. Monumentally incompetent marshals ("We're looking like idiots because of this jerk and his kids," one complains) head for the Weaver home. A brief confrontation leaves 14-year-old Sammy Weaver and a marshal dead. The Federal Bureau of Investigation arrives with a crack hostage rescue team ordered to shoot any armed adult outside the cabin. Vicki is killed holding her 10-month-old infant. The siege lasts 10 days.
In a subsequent trial, Gerry Spence (Joe Don Baker) heads the defense team ("We'll win by stuffing their own case down their throats," he promises). Randy and Kevin Harris (Darren Burrows), a family friend, are acquitted. It's a victory for Randy, but nobody wins. Despite the terrible ordeal, it's impossible to feel sympathy for a man who tells his squabbling children to "save your fighting" for the Jews and blacks and who says to a weapons buyer, "Let's hope they go to some street gangs back East."
This is a world of religious zealots, loopy survivalists and an incendiary cocktail of bikers, gung-ho veterans and ignorant bigots whose world vision defies rationality. Only stupefyingly arrogant and misguided government agencies can perversely give them a semblance of stature. Jess Walter, the journalist whose book "Every Knee Shall Bow" was the basis for this film, maintains that "the Weaver case was really the spark that started this whole brush fire of government distrust," soon spreading to Waco, Oklahoma City and the current standoff in Montana. But the Weaver roots were deep in sections of the American psyche long before Ruby Ridge.
The movie is chilling. Watch it and shudder or, as the Irish say, cry for us all.
 
'Interview Day'
PBS, Sunday night
(Channel 13, New York, at 9)
This modest 90-minute "Masterpiece Theater" presentation, written by Jack Rosenthal and directed by Piers Haggard, is a gently wrenching, even while humorous, tale of parents and children letting go of one another. The occasion is interview day for potential students at Cambridge University. The candidates preparing for the interviews, played especially well by Benedict Sandiford, Laura Howard and Grant Warnock, are understandably on edge. But their nerves are further jangled by doting parents wanting the best for their adored offspring. Fine performances on this side of the equation are contributed by Tom Wilkenson, Anna Carteret (currently on Broadway in "An Ideal Husband"), Maureen Lipman, David Ross and Kathryn Pogson.
A subsidiary plot finds one interviewer (James Fleet) trying to persuade his father to enter a home for the elderly. As it happens, foxy Dad is played by Sir Alec Guinness, who can look as if he's preoccupied doing nothing even as he steals every scene in sight. Catch Sir Alec asking with sweet sarcasm as he finishes a tour of the ghastly center, "There's no bingo at all, then?" Very clever, these English types, and delightful.

HEADLINE: Dominican Republic Votes, With New Blood in the Race

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 16

 BODY:
Responding eagerly to a rare opportunity to bring a new generation of leaders to power, Dominicans flocked to the polls today in the first phase in a watershed presidential election.
Neither of the octogenarian strongmen who have dominated Dominican politics since the 1950's was on the ballot. Recent constitutional changes prohibit President Joaquin Balaguer, who is 89 and in his seventh term of office, from succeeding himself; his lifetime rival, Juan Bosch, 86, has been sidelined by old age and illness. 
 "This is our chance for a change that has been long, long overdue," said Carlos Rojas, 18, a student and first-time voter. "If we fail to take advantage of it, then we are going to be sunk as a country."
In a recent poll by the Gallup organization, 46 percent of those surveyed said they planned to vote for Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, a former mayor of the capital who is the candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Liberation Party followed, supported by 37 percent.
Both men have stressed their differences from Mr. Balaguer and with the status quo. Mr. Pena Gomez, 59, a social democrat, has focused on personal and ideological disagreements, while Mr. Fernandez, who is 42 and grew up in New York City, has emphasized his youth and hipness, even running television advertisements that show him playing basketball.
The electorate's clear desire for change has hurt Mr. Balaguer's Social Christian Reform Party, whose candidate, Vice President Jacinto Peynado, trails badly in every poll. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the top two finishers is to be held on June 30.
Interest in the vote has been running so high that hundreds of Dominicans living in New York City have returned, many on charter flights organized by the main political parties, to cast ballots. Among the returnees was Jose Hugo Rodriguez, a Brooklyn resident who was working today as an election judge at a polling place in the capital.
"I felt it was my civic and patriotic duty to be here," said Mr. Rodriguez, wearing a purple badge that identified him as a supprter of Mr. Fernandez. "We have a chance to win this thing in the first round, and I wanted to do everything I could to help."
But almost every election since the fall of the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in 1961 has been plagued by accusations of fraud or intimidation. In 1994, those allegations were so widespread and so convincing that in order to avoid civil disturbances, Mr. Balaguer consented to an agreement that required him to hold a new election in two years, halfway through his term.
Because of that pattern of irregularities, voters welcomed more than 150 international observers. But Mr. Balaguer's camp has complained of "foreign interference," and observers have been told they will not be allowed access to the Central Elections Board, where the vote will be counted when polls close this evening. Results are promised by Friday night.
On Monday Mr. Balaguer also brought a hardline general blamed for killings and kidnappings during the 1970's out of retirement. The general, Enrique Perez y Perez, is to be the new head of the National Police, and voters took that as a sign the Government is prepared to deal harshly with any popular discontent that may arise.
Among the electoral reforms agreed to in 1994 was a new and highly unusual voting system in which men and women cast their ballots separately, women in the morning and men in the afternoon. That arrangement, which also requires voters to stand in line for several hours while their credentials are checked, has been criticized as inefficient and intended to damp voter turnout.
Nevertheless, election officials said turnout was running as high as 80 percent in some areas. "This election today is a result of our struggle, and we're ready to endure anything in order to express our will," said Odalizo Arias, 56, a farm worker in Bani, a sugar-growing center west of here, who supports Mr. Pena Gomez.

Dollar Is Little Changed as Rally Sags on Profit Taking by Traders

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar ended little changed yesterday after an early rally succumbed to profit taking.
Investors used the dollar's sharp recent rally against the Japanese yen to book profits, sending the dollar lower. 
 The dollar sprinted to a 15-month high against the Swiss franc but failed to hold the gains and slipped back toward Wednesday's levels.
"The market didn't have enough enthusiasm to take the dollar higher," said Dennis Pettit, foreign exchange manager at Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar slipped to 106.65 yen from 106.96 yen on Wednesday. The dollar traded at 1.5325 German marks, just down from 1.5335. The British pound edged up to $1.5126 from $1.5125.
The dollar rose as high as 1.2620 Swiss francs yesterday, its highest since Feb. 16, 1995, when it touched 1.2760 Swiss francs. It settled in New York at 1.2555 Swiss francs, up from 1.2530 Swiss francs on Wednesday.
The Swiss franc has continued to come under pressure because of low interest rates, which make assets linked to the franc less attractive, analysts said.
"We all know from a long-term perspective the Swiss franc is still overpriced," said Anne Parker Mills, foreign exchange analyst at Lehman Brothers.
The dollar approached its recent highs near 107 yen and 1.54 marks before it ran into heavy selling pressure. European accounts reportedly sold the dollar heavily against the mark, with Japanese exporters selling dollars for yen, traders said.
"We had heard talk all week of selling interest and it appears to have been quite substantial," said Steven Walker, a currency trader at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in New York.
Many European markets were closed yesterday for the Ascension Day holiday, which kept trading volume light.
That thin volume had been expected to foster volatile price action and a possible dollar rally, but after an early dollar peak, market players sold their dollar holdings.
"People were expecting the thin market conditions to exaggerate any move to the upside," Mr. Walker said. "When it didn't happen, they closed their positions."

Energy Prices Fall on News Of Possible U.N.-Iraq Deal

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Energy prices nose-dived on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on news that the six-year embargo on Iraqi oil sales might end, allowing the country to sell millions of barrels of oil for food and medicine.
On other exchanges, corn prices surged to new highs and wheat took a hit on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
 Diplomats said late on Wednesday that the United Nations and Iraq had reached a tentative agreement allowing Iraq to sell $2 billion in oil over six months.
The deal, however, needs the approval of Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, which has traders on edge, said Tim Evans, an analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. "This is something the market has been fearing on the part of the bulls and hoping for on the part of the bears," he said.
Three rounds of talks have stalled over who would distribute goods to the rebel Kurds in northern Iraq. Baghdad says it should be allowed to make deliveries, but the United Nations disagrees.
Suggestions of a settlement affected the entire energy market with much of the pressure felt in crude oiland gasoline, said Andrew Lebow, an analyst with E. D. & F. Man International Futures Inc. in New York.
Light sweet crude for June delivery dropped 70 cents, to $20.78 a barrel. June gasoline dropped 3 cents, to 64.20 cents a gallon -- its lowest settlement since the beginning of April.
The old corn crop reached new price highs on Agriculture Department figures showing exports of just under a million tons and bad weather continued to plague the eastern Corn Belt. Exports have helped usher in record prices and have kept reserves at their lowest point since 1948.
Corn for May delivery rose 16.75 cents, to $5.1725 a bushel, on the Chicago Board of Trade. The active July contract rose the maximum limit of 12 cents, to $4.9950 a bushel. July soybeans rose 13.25 cents, to $8.2875 a bushel. July wheat dropped 4.5 cents, to $5.78 a bushel.
Soybean prices rose on weekly figures that had exports at 437,000 tons of old crop and 207,300 of new crop. Soybean traders also bought on rumors that China had purchased 50,000 tons of soybeans from Argentina and at least the same amount from Brazil, said Steve Bruce, an analyst with E. D. & F. Man in Chicago.
Continued rain-related planting delays in the eastern Corn Belt, however, tempered soybeans' rise, said Victor Lespinasse, an analyst at Dean Witter, Discover & Company.

Housing Data Send Treasury Prices Down

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday after an unexpectedly strong rise in housing starts revived concerns about a strong economy and accelerating inflation.
Prices were also weighed down by anticipation of a flood of new supply, in particular a $3.5 billion offering by the Lockheed Martin Corporation that was priced for sale yesterday. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dropped 23/32 , to 8820/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.91 percent, from 6.83 percent on Wednesday. The slump ended a recent run-up that came as investors were beginning to feel secure about the prospect of moderate growth and low inflation.
But that view on growth and inflation was thrown into question after the Commerce Department reported that housing starts surged 5.9 percent in April. The construction of houses and apartments was at its higest annual rate in two years.
The data prompted investors to worry that economic growth might not be slow enough to keep inflation from accelerating and the Federal Reserve from raising short-term rates in response.
"The housing sector has remained relatively strong so far this year even given the rise in interest rates," said Cheryl R. Katz, senior economist at Merrill Lynch & Company.
But Jack Ablin, director of fixed income and senior fund manager at the Private Bank at Bank of Boston, said the strength of the housing number might have come from home buyers rushing to obtain mortgages before rates rise any higher. "Some of this could steal from next month's number," he said.
Economic strength was also in seen in the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's monthly survey of regional business activitiy. The Philadelphia Fed index fell to 16.0 in May from 17.2 in April, a smaller decline than some had expected. The data hinted at a rebound in manufacturing.
The impact of the housing starts and Philadelphia Fed reports was softened by the Labor Department's weekly report of first-time claims for unemployment benefits, which showed a larger-than-expected increase of 12,000 last week to a seasonal adjusted 352,000.
"We're seeing strength, and not looking at a recession, but the economic pop that people had expected has not come through through completely," Mr. Albin said.
In the corporate market, Lockheed's offering drew strong investor interest from the regular buyers of new corporate debt, mutual funds, insurance companies, investment managers and pension funds. Investors were drawn in part by the company's relatively light debt load.
The debt offering, rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's, was sliced into six parts.
The first part consists of $500 million of three-year notes priced to yield 6.567 percent, or about 32 basis points -- or hundredths of a percentage point -- more than a Treasury securitiy with a similar maturity. Next were $750 million of 5-year notes priced to yield 6.868 percent, or about 42 basis points more than a similar Treasury, and a similar amount of 10-year notes priced to yield 7.263 percent, or about 56 basis points more than a Treasury.
For $600 million of 20-year debentures, the price produced a yield of 7.692 percent, or about 72 basis points more than a 30-year Treasury, with a similar amount of 30-year debentures priced to yield 7.792 percent, or about 82 basis points more than a Treasury. The sixth piece of the debt offering included $300 million of 40-yer bonds with a put provision that entitles bondholders to sell the bonds back to the issuer in 12 years. These were priced to yield 7.223 percent, or about 52 basis points more than a 10-year Treasury note.
Goldman, Sachs & Company leads the underwriters in the sale. Lockheed plans to use the proceeds of the offering to help repay its $9.1 billion purchase of the Loral Corporation.

HEADLINE: The Bonds: Some Issues Not Settled By Treasury

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
The Treasury's proposal to issue inflation-index bonds raises a number of issues, some of which have not yet been resolved.
The maturity of the bonds.
The Treasury said it was considering 10-year and 30-year bonds, but it had not yet decided. It plans to sell new bonds every three months. 
 The "real" interest rate.
That rate, before adjustments for inflation, will be determined by what buyers will demand. The Treasury used an estimate of 3 percent. That may be low. The rates now quoted in Britain are closer to 4 percent. But in 1981, when the British bonds were introduced and when inflation concerns were high, the real interest rate that investors demanded was under 3 percent. It is likely that the real rate will fluctuate to some extent depending on how fearful investors are of inflation. When inflation fears are high, investors may be so eager to buy the bonds that they will accept a low real rate. But when inflation fears are low, they may demand a higher real rate to assure a good return even without a lot of inflation.
The inflation index.
The Treasury doesn't know what inflation index to use. It could be the Consumer Price Index, or perhaps the "core" index, which excludes changes in energy and food prices. Or it could be an index of wage costs, or the inflation rate as measured in the gross domestic product calculations. Or it could be some combination of indexes.
The likely buyers.
The Treasury hopes that the bonds will be bought by institutions and individual investors. They will be denominated as low as $1,000, making them possible investments for many investors. And it is probable that mutual funds would be created to invest primarily in such bonds.
The bond market impact.
Inflation-indexed bonds could expand the demand for bonds. "This is a whole new asset class," said Dan Bernstein, the research director of Bridgewater Associates in Wilton, Conn., a money management firm that owns some foreign inflation-indexed bonds. He thinks pension funds, which must meet obligations that can rise with inflation, would become large buyers of such bonds.
If many more investors came into the bond market, that could help to lower interest rates, at least marginally. But the bond market is huge, and such an effect is far from certain.
The stock market impact.
Such bonds could siphon off some money from stocks, although their expected returns will not be as high as stocks in recent years. "It might seriously drain money from the equity market," said Andrew Smithers of Smithers & Company, a British economic consulting firm. That is because individuals saving for retirement would believe they could lock in a real return without taking the risks of the stock market.
Taxation issues.
As with any other Treasury bond, the twice-a-year interest payments would constitute ordinary income. But in addition, each six months the principal value of the bond would rise, and an investor would owe tax, at ordinary rates, on that gain as well. So the effective tax rate, as a percent of the cash that is coming in, would be higher. If a bond is sold before maturity, the investor would have a capital gain or loss based on whether the price was higher or lower than the cost of the bond plus the increases in principal value on which tax had earlier been paid.
But bonds held in tax-deferred accounts, such as individual retirement accounts or 401(k) plans, would not be taxed until the money is taken out, and it is in such accounts that many individual investors would choose to own such bonds.
The impact on inflation.
By comparing the prices of inflation-indexed bonds and normal bonds, analysts could make a much better estimate of what inflation expectations are, said Barbara Moore, a senior vice president of the SEI Corporation, a pension fund consultant. When those expectations are rising, it may be a signal that action is needed by the Federal Reserve, and thus help to fight inflation.
On the other hand, if investors feel they are protected against inflation, they may be less worried about it, and less likely to put pressure on the Government to fight it.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "The New Bonds: What Treasury Could Offer"
The Treasury Department announced yesterday that it would issue bonds indexed to inflation. In 1981, Britain became the first country to issue such investments and Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Sweden also offer inflation-indexed bonds. The Treasury said it would issue "bullet bonds" and that it might issue other types as well. Chart lists other possible types.
 
Graph: "A Good Deal by Investors? Posslibly"
Are inflation-indexed bonds better investments than conventional ones? That depends on the real interest rate an investor agrees to and on the inflation rate over the bond's life. Graph shows hypothetical comparisons. (Sources: Treasury Department; SEI Corporation)

HEADLINE: Nasdaq Hits 26th Record Of the Year

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News 

 BODY:
Nasdaq stocks rose to their 26th record of the year yesterday, as the stock market shrugged off a slump in bonds.
The Dow Jones industrial average advanced 9.61 points, to 5,635.05, still shy of its record closing high of 5,689.74 of April 3. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.75 points, to 1,239.31. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off 0.57 point, to 664.85, but would have ended with a gain if not for a slump of 8 5/8 in shares of Hewlett Packard.
"It's been hard to keep this market down," said Phil Schettewi, chief portfolio strategist at Loomis Sayles in Washington, which has about $30 billion under management. "There's some evidence that Europe might be picking up and the big multinationals will benefit from that."
Yesterday's advance came even after bond prices tumbled following a report on housing starts that was stronger than expected. The report revived fears of an overheating economy and the inflation that it would bring, and bond traders drove Treasury prices down.
Bond prices and their yields move in opposite directions from each other, and yesterday the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond -- a benchmark for interest rates -- rose to 6.91 percent from 6.83 percent on Wednesday. Higher interest rates are often viewed as bad for stocks because they raise the cost of corporate borrowing.
The Dow industrials were led higher by shares of Caterpillar, up 2, to 68 3/4, and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, up 1 3/4, to 67 3/8. The Dow was dragged down by shares of oil companies as the United Nations moved closer to allowing Iraq to sell as much as $2 billion of oil over six months to pay for food and medicine. Crude oil for June delivery dropped 70 cents, to $20.78 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Shares of oil companies often track the price of crude. Texaco Inc. fell 1, to 82 1/4; Chevron Corporation fell 5/8, to 58 3/8, and Exxon Corporation fell 3/4, to 83 7/8.
Computer shares fell after Hewlett-Packard reported earnings of $1.37 a share in the second quarter, 9 cents shy of what analysts had expected. Hewlett-Packard slumped as much as 10 3/4, before closing down 8 1/2 at 105 1/4. On Wednesday, the stock closed at an all-time high.
"A stock that's up that much is bound to react to anything that might hinge even slightly on the negative side," said Ned Riley, chief investment officer at the Bank of Boston's Private Bank, which has about $16 billion under management."
Among other computer makers, Digital Equipment fell 3/8, to 56 3/8; International Business Machines slipped 3/8, to 108 5/8; Apple Computer fell 1/8, to 28 3/8, and Dell Computerslid 7/8, to 48 1/2.
Microsoft Corporation fell 1/2, to 117 1/8, after Morgan Stanley Inc. lowered its rating on the company to "outperform" from "strong buy." Morgan Stanley lowered its investment opinion because Microsoft's shares recently climbed to a record.

HEADLINE: 1997 Budget Debate Begins: Same Old Story

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Three weeks after ending their bitter 17-month battle over budget-balancing plans for fiscal 1996 and beyond, Republicans and Democrats in Congress today began debating the shape of a package for fiscal 1997 and beyond. It was deja vu all over again.
Democrats denounced the Republican majorities in Congress for proposing restraints on spending that the Democrats variously called reckless, extreme, drastic, devastating, dangerous, silly and nonsense. Republicans said the Democratic plan, written by President Clinton, was fiction, gimmickry, a "U.F.O. budget," smoke and mirrors and, in one extended burst of oratory, inconsistent with sound fiscal practice. 
 Much of the fighting was over which side's proposal to slow the growth of Medicare spending could be depicted as most scandalous.
The Senate argued most of the day without approving or rejecting either proposal. In the House, the Republicans pushed their version of the budget to passage on a nearly straight party-line vote, 226 to 195.
Mr. Clinton's budget, which the House considered earlier in the day, was less fortunate: 40 percent of the Democrats in the House, 78 in all, voted to reject it, along with all but one of the Republicans who voted. The final tally was 304 to 117.
Representative John R. Kasich, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the House Budget Committee and was in charge of the debate, called that "a pathetic show of support." Mr. Clinton's plan lost the backing not only of conservative Democrats, who saw his package of modest tax and spending cuts as too tepid, but also of black lawmakers and liberals, many of whom concluded that it went too far.
Both of those factions sponsored their own alternatives to the Republican budget, and both were handily defeated. But the day's biggest surprise may have been the support for the conservative version, written by a group of free-range Democrats who call themselves the "blue dogs."
The blue dog plan actually won more Democratic votes than the White House proposal; it was rejected by a vote of 295 to 130, 110 of them Democrats. The rest were moderate Republicans.
The votes were probably symbolic; no plan is likely to become law in an election year when both parties are mostly trying to underscore their differences, not resolve them. Today's arguing suggested that those differences remain huge.
The Republican proposal would erase the $145 billion-a-year deficit in six more years and return at least $122 billion in tax cuts, mostly as a $500-per-child credit to middle-income taxpaying families. It envisions larger tax cuts and savings from Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and domestic spending than does the White House plan, but would spend slightly more on the military.
The blue dog proposal reaches balance with fewer spending reductions than either plan, largely because it contains no tax cuts and scales back the Government inflation index used to calculate yearly increases in Social Security benefits.
Democrats argued that the Republican plan would gut benefit programs like Medicare and neuter Federal initiatives on issues like environmental protection that have broad support.
"What good does it do to balance the budget," asked Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, "if we're going to rip the heart out of the laws that have made us a strong and healthy nation?"
Republicans argued that Mr. Clinton's plan was a fraud.
In essence, they charged that the White House had juggled Medicare's financial accounts to make it appear that they had staved off the program's impending bankruptcy. And they noted that under Congress's accounting methods, the President's plan would reach balance in six years only by rolling back the last two years of its tax cuts and making another $67 billion in domestic spending reductions.
The House and Senate budget proposals are basically identical, but still must be merged into a single document that will come before both houses once more, probably next week. Congress will use the finished plan as a framework for writing a detailed budget for fiscal 1997 later this summer.

HEADLINE: Plan Approved to Let Power Users Pick Suppliers of Their Electricity

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16

 BODY:
The State Public Service Commission approved a far-reaching plan today to deregulate New York State's electric industry, a move designed to reduce high electric rates by allowing consumers to choose who will provide their power much as they select a long-distance telephone company.
The new policy is based on the premise that breaking the electric utilities' monopoly and injecting greater competition into the market will ultimately drive down rates for everyone, though no one yet knows by how much bills will fall. 
 The policy unanimously approved today by the five-member commission lays out the broad outlines for a top-to-bottom restructuring of the industry over the next two years that will require utilities to buy cheaper power on an open market starting early next year. That alone, the commission contends, will reduce rates, among the highest in the nation.
By early 1998, the plan calls for all consumers to be able to shop among competing companies for the electricity that will be brought into their homes and businesses.
The plan does not lay out a detailed prescription for how that competition should take place. But the commission, which regulates the electric industry and has sweeping powers to enforce its policies, ordered five of the state's seven electric utilities to develop specific proposals to meet its goals by Oct. 1. The commission is already reviewing restructuring plans for the other two companies, Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation and Long Island Lighting Company.
Under the current system, consumers can buy electricity from only one company -- for instance, Consolidated Edison Company in Manhattan. But in the deregulated market envisioned by state officials, new companies will emerge that will buy electricity from power plants, then package and market it to homeowners and businesses -- competing directly with Con Edison and other utilities for individual customers.
These startup companies will generally not build new power lines, but will instead use the existing transmission system, which will be opened up to all power companies. The system will work in much the same way that local telephone companies allow long distance carriers like Sprint to use their wires, for a price.
States across the nation have begun deregulating their electric industries, mainly at the insistence of large manufacturers who contend that high utility costs are reducing the nation's economic competitiveness. New York's plan resembles a policy already in place in California. Massachusetts, Maine and New Hampshire have also begun deregulating their power companies.
The Federal Government is also moving toward encouraging competition in the electric market. Last month, Washington ordered utilities to open their transmission systems to outside energy providers. The move is expected to reduce costs for utilities in high-cost regions, like the Northeast, by allowing them to buy cheaper power from the Midwest.
But the Federal action did nothing to break the utilities' monopoly hold over customers in their own regions -- something the Public Service Commission's plan would do.
Under New York State's plan, most consumers will not begin noticing a change until at least 1998. But at that time, state officials and consumer groups predict, homeowners and businesses are likely to receive aggressive sales pitches from competing companies. The result will be falling rates, the officials say.
"Competitive forces will remodel the electric industry, revitalize New York's economy and provide customers with lower prices and greater choices," said John F. O'Mara, chairman of the commission.
Groups representing large manufacturers praised the plan. But they said the state must still reduce energy and property taxes before New York's electric rates will fall in line with those of other states.
Environmental groups also endorsed the plan because it includes a surcharge on electric rates that will generate funds for energy efficiency programs.
But some consumer groups and the Democratic leaders of the State Assembly said that deregulation would reduce protections against price gouging and shoddy service in areas where there is little competition for customers.
Critics also asserted that the plan might benefit only large manufacturers who would be able to negotiate the lowest rates by threatening to take their business elsewhere.
Electric utility officials had mixed reviews. Kevin Burke, vice president for corporate planning at Con Edison, which serves New York City and Westchester County, said the state had set an overly ambitious schedule for breaking up the electric utilities' monopolies, though he did not disagree with the broad goals.
 The commission's plan does not deal with two major problems facing many electric companies: high debt costs from building generating plants and expensive contracts with small independent power producers. Under the current system, utilities can pass those costs on to customers. But in a deregulated system, they might have to absorb more of those costs, in the process reducing their profits.
Under the commission's plan, a commodities exchange for electricity would be created next year. It would purchase the cheapest power available, including electricty from companies outside the state. The power would then be sold on a spot market to utilities that would transmit it to their customers.
An independent authority, probably consisting of officials from the utilities, would be created to operate the transmission lines to ensure that companies did not try to block their competitors' access to power.

HEADLINE: Data Show Rise In Productivity And Housing

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Fresh statistics pointing to an expanding economy were released yesterday, including an extremely healthy rise in workplace productivity and a surprisingly big jump in home building.
The reports -- especially the housing numbers -- unsettled the bond market, sending prices down and interest rates up. 
 The Labor Department said yesterday that productivity in the workplace had jumped in the first quarter, reversing a decline recorded for the last three months of 1995.
Productivity, which measures output per number of hours worked, rose at an annualized rate of 2.6 percent, the Labor Department said. That is the largest gain in nonfarm productivity since the second quarter of 1995, when the measure climbed 3 percent. During last year's fourth quarter, productivity fell by 1 percent.
Private analysts tend to cast a skeptical eye on the quarterly productivity figures, because they are often subject to fairly dramatic revision. But they called one component of yesterday's report, a very low reading on unit labor costs, particularly impressive.
In the first three months of the year, unit labor costs -- a measure of a specified amount of work done in an hour -- rose just six-tenths of 1 percent, the Labor Department said. That is the smallest gain since the second quarter of 1994.
"Quarterly productivity numbers deserve to be viewed skeptically because you have two huge numbers, output and labor, that are subject to significant backward revision," said John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers.
"But if the challenge for investors is to look for incipient inflation pressures, they certainly will not be found in these numbers," he said.
In a separate report, the Labor Department said yesterday that new claims for jobless benefits rose by 12,000, to 352,000, last week. Many analysts had expected a smaller, 9,000 advance.
But the four-week moving average of applications for unemployment insurance, which smoothes out the spikes in the weekly reports, fell to 353,000, the lowest since September.
As they reviewed the productivity numbers, analysts said that the big first-quarter gain probably overstated how much productivity had improved. A better reading, they said, would be an average of the last two quarters.
"The fourth quarter was better than reported, and the first quarter was worse," said David Wyss, research director at DRI/McGraw Hill. "On average, they probably got it about right."
Mr. Wyss and others noted that compared with the corresponding quarter a year earlier, nonfarm business productivity was up 1.6 percent.
Edwin Dean, associate commissioner for productivity and technology at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, called the year-over-year increase a "healthy performance," and, indeed, it is far better than the annual gains recorded so far this decade. From 1990 to 1995, productivity gains averaged 1.1 percent, the same rate of increase recorded during the 1980's.
Some economists argue that the Government has understated the rate of productivity increase, in large measure because it has failed to gauge efficiency in the service sector accurately.
"On the face of it, measured productivity gains continue to be quite disappointing," said Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell/C.J. Lawrence Inc.
"However, I think productivity gains are probably stronger than the measures indicate, particularly in the service sector, where the statistical procedures for measuring output and productivity are quite flawed."
Separately, the Commerce Department said that construction of new houses and apartments rose by 5.9 percent in April, to an annualized rate of 1.52 million units. It is the highest level in two years, and the gain in April was the biggest monthly increase since November.
The increase surprised many analysts and traders, who had been expecting a slight decline from the annualized 1.44 million start figure in March because of the increase in mortgage rates.
Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 8.08 percent this week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation said yesterday. As recently as mid-February, rates on such loans were averaging slightly less than 7 percent.
As a rule of thumb, economists estimate that every percentage-point increase in rates prices 250,000 to 300,000 families out of the housing market.
The monthly payment for principal and interest on a $100,000 mortgage with a 7 percent interest rate is $665 while the payment on the same loan with an 8 percent rate is $734 -- a difference of $69.
Start of construction on single-family homes, about 80 percent of residential building activity -- which are particularly sensitive to interest rates -- shot up 4.2 percent, to an annual rate of 1.21 million, the highest since the rate of 1.22 million in July 1994. Single-family starts had slipped 1.5 percent in March. Every section of the country joined in the gains, except the Northeast, were starts fell 1.4 percent, to a 137,000 annual rate.

HEADLINE: Adirondack Park Agency to Lay Off 12 of 62 Workers

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Following budget-tightening recommendations from Gov. George E. Pataki's office, the state agency that regulates private land in the Adirondack Park is cutting 20 percent of its staff, despite the objections of both business interests and conservationists.
The planned layoffs were revealed on Wednesday to employees of the 25-year-old Adirondack Park Agency, which tries to mesh economic activity and environmental protection in the Vermont-size mosaic of wilderness and private property. 
 Earlier this year, Governor Pataki had been criticized by environmental groups and some Adirondack politicians for seeking to cut 10 of the 62 jobs at the agency. But the announced cuts go further, eliminating a dozen positions, according to several Park Agency staff members. "For us to even think of functioning at any level of service to the public or the environment with 10 or 12 people gone is crazy," said one staff member, who asked not to be identified.
He said the agency's new executive director, Daniel Fitts, apologetically announced the layoffs on Wednesday. The intent was to give employees notice before the cuts are announced by Mr. Pataki's task force on trimming state payrolls, the employee said. Mr. Fitts declined to be interviewed.
Zenia Mucha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Pataki, said yesterday that, under an agreement with the Legislature and unions for state employees, the Governor's office could not discuss planned agency cuts. She did say that shrinking the staff was in line with Mr. Pataki's goals, adding, "The Governor's interest has always been that we want state government to run in a much more efficient and effective manner."
Park Agency staff members said that those being laid off included two lawyers and a specialist in wetlands who examines proposed sites for logging or waterfront development. Also on the list is one of three people who roam the 6 million-acre region to investigate possible violations of environmental rules.
Timothy Burke, executive director of the Adirondack Council, a private environmental group, said, "To have only two enforcement people for 20 percent of the land mass of New York would make enforcement a complete joke."
Joseph Rota, the head of a group of local government representatives that has long called for abolishing the Park Agency, said the cuts would hurt local development in the short run, but might increase pressure on local governments "to pick up some responsibilities and start their own planning and zoning boards."
Kevin King, executive director of the Empire State Forest Products Association, a timber industry group whose members own half the park's 3.5 million acres of private land, said that while the group generally supports the Governor's attempts to cut bureaucracy, "There would be a concern if the permitting process is slowed down."
Katherine O. Roberts, a member of the Adirondack Park Agency board appointed last year by Mr. Pataki, said she was "deeply disturbed" by the cuts. "The agency is always criticized for not being responsive to the people in the area," Ms. Roberts said. "The new leadership had made a real effort to change that, but with 12 members of the staff cut, it's going to be impossible for us to respond to requests in a timely fashion."
In the past, similar cuts were planned, but funds were restored by the Legislature, she said, adding, "I would hope that the Senate and Assembly in their wisdom will restore these positions."
But signals from the Senate yesterday appeared to indicate that, this time around, the cuts will stand. "If the agency streamlines the permit process, cuts red tape, and makes itself more user friendly, I think the impact could be negligible," said Thomas Bergin, a spokesman for the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Ronald Stafford, whose district includes 80 percent of the Adirondacks.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Chrysler Lifts Dividend and Splits Its Stock

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 16

 BODY:
The Big Three auto makers, led by the Chrysler Corporation, which announced a stock split and a dividend increase today, are moving to improve returns to shareholders.
The moves by Chrysler reflect an industrywide combination of strengthening auto sales this spring, healthier balance sheets and a new willingness to put slightly more emphasis on earning profits instead of winning market share. Responding to the same trends, officials at the General Motors Corporation and, to a lesser extent, the Ford Motor Company have also hinted in recent months at eventually paying out more money to shareholders. 
 "Chrysler's actions today signal to the market that this is an industry with excess cash flow and management committed to increasing shareholder value," said David Bradley, an auto analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities Inc. in New York.
Shares of all three auto makers climbed today on the New York Stock Exchange, with Chrysler showing the biggest jump, a $2.25 increase, to $67.125. Ford shares rose 50 cents, to $36.75, and G.M. edged up 37.5 cents, to $55.50.
At its annual meeting today in Towson, Md., Chrysler announced a 2-for-1 split of its common stock. For each share held by shareholders of record on June 15, the company will issue a second share.
Chrysler's board also approved an increase in the company's quarterly dividend, to 70 cents from 60 cents. Both moves surprised Wall Street, which had expected Detroit auto makers to delay any moves to reward shareholders until after this summer's negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union. The union's contracts with the Big Three will expire on Sept. 14.
A hostile takeover bid last year by Kirk Kerkorian, the Las Vegas investor, put pressure on Chrysler to pay more money to shareholders. Chrysler reached an agreement with Mr. Kerkorian early this year, in which he promised to support the company's management in exchange for a seat on the board for one of his aides.
G.M. and Ford are also trying to figure out what to do with their growing cash from strong auto sales. After disastrous attempts at diversification in the 1980's, auto executives are now looking at ways to reinvest the money in the car business or return it to shareholders. G.M. and Ford have been cutting costs aggressively; G.M. announced today that it would buy a large, relatively inexpensive office complex in downtown Detroit instead of building a new headquarters.
G.M. raised its dividend early this year and has been quietly signaling to financial analysts that it may pay out more money to shareholders next year, several analysts said today. Like Chrysler, G.M. has just finished topping up a previously underfunded pension plan, leaving it with more disposable cash than it has had in several years.
G.M. is currently raising its cash reserves, which stood at $8.84 billion at the end of the first quarter. And with union negotiations and the possibility of a strike in the autumn, no one expects any quick moves by the company to pay out more this year.
Discussing G.M., Scott Sprinzen, a managing director for auto credit ratings at Standard & Poor's, said the agency "would fully expect that they would be more aggressive" next year in paying more money to shareholders.
Ford also appears to be hinting at possible payouts. Alexander Trotman, the chairman and chief executive, mentioned at a meeting here with financial analysts on Wednesday that if Ford someday found itself with excess cash reserves, it might consider a repurchase of stock among other options, four analysts who attended the meeting said.
In the past, Ford executives had said emphatically that they would not repurchase shares, preferring instead to raise their dividend if the cash became available.
Chris Vinyard, a spokesman for Ford, said today that the company had no immediate plans for a repurchase of stock. Ford plans to continue reinvesting in the automobile business and building its cash reserves for the next recession, he said, and did not think that its cash reserves, $12.94 billion at the end of the first quarter, were excessive.
"It was largely a hypothetical, what-if kind of discussion" at the meeting with securities analysts, Mr. Vinyard said.
But analysts who attended the meeting perceived a shift in Mr. Trotman's position on stock repurchases. "This might just be characterized as the first hint of his mind-set," said Joseph S. Phillippi, an auto analyst at Lehman Brothers, who noted that Ford had previously signaled moves with ostensibly hypothetical discussions at analyst meetings.
Any stock buyback would have to win the approval of the Ford family, which controls 40 percent of the voting rights. The family has traditionally preferred dividend increases to stock buybacks -- because family members have no intention of allowing the company to buy back their stakes -- so Mr. Trotman's mention of a buyback on Wednesday was all the more unusual.
One big disadvantage of larger dividends is that they erode a company's cash cushion for recessions. All the Big Three auto makers quickly burned through their cash reserves during the last recession five years ago, and they have been determined not to repeat the experience.
Larger dividends and lower cash reserves also mean slightly less assurance to bondholders that a company will be able to repay them in hard times. As a result, companies with generous dividends tend to have slightly lower credit ratings, which raise their borrowing costs.
Mr. Sprinzen at Standard & Poor's said that if Chrysler had not raised its dividend and continued to prosper, the ratings agency might at some point have considered raising its A- credit rating. "As things stand now, we don't think a higher rating is attainable," he said.
Ford's relatively conservative policy on stock buybacks and its maintenance of very large cash reserves have led to the highest credit rating of the Big Three, an A+. This strong rating has allowed Ford to pay slightly lower interest rates on its debt, one reason that Ford's car-loan and other lending businesses have been highly profitable in recent years -- even more so than its car-building operations. G.M. has an A- credit rating.

HEADLINE: U.S. Report Says Bosnia Peace Is Fragile

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 15

 BODY:
A draft intelligence report circulating in the Government warns that the chances are poor that Bosnia will hold together as the multi-ethnic, unified state called for in the Dayton peace agreement, senior American officials say.
The National Intelligence Estimate -- a classified effort to pull together a consensus view of the American intelligence agencies -- questions the public position of the Administration that the civilian effort in Bosnia and Herzegovina is on schedule and going well. 
 The report comes as American allies are expressing concern that the United States, which has 20,000 troops in Bosnia as part of a NATO-led peacekeeping force, is being overly optimistic about the chances for a fair election there this fall so long as Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who has been indicted by the international war crimes tribunal in The Hague, retains power and influence.
Senior American officials have predicted regularly that Dr. Karadzic will soon be removed, undermined by the Serbian president in Belgrade, Slobodan Milosevic. But Mr. Milosevic has been slow to act.
Under the peace agreement, reached in Dayton, Ohio, last November, both Dr. Karadzic and the Bosnian Serb military leader, Gen. Ratko Mladic, are supposed to give up their positions and be handed over to the tribunal in The Hague for trial.
According to senior American officials, the National Intelligence Estimate is still "a work in progress." But they say the current draft is sharply pessimistic about the effort to build a unified, multi-ethnic Bosnia. It predicts that elections, if held, will be along ethnic lines in a country increasingly divided among Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
According to the draft analysis, the leaders of all three groups, none of them especially democratic, want to preserve their power bases and fear the dilution of their control in a multi-ethnic state.
The report says that the goals of the Dayton peace accord are incompatible with a situation in which Dr. Karadzic, a public advocate of Bosnian Serb separateness, maintains power and influence.
And it says that the Muslim-Croat federation the Americans pushed those groups to create two years ago, in large part to protect the Muslims from being swallowed up, remains largely a figment of American imagination.
American officials from President Clinton to Secretary of State Warren Christopher tried to put new substance into the Muslim-Croat federation on Tuesday, bringing Muslim and Croatian leaders to Washington and pushing them to integrate the command structure of their separate armies, set up a joint civilian-led defense ministry and establish joint institutions to manage taxes, investment and economic aid.
The draft estimate, intended to help guide policymakers but not necessarily to reflect their views, is normally circulated for their comments and questions, officials say. White House officials asked the authors to consider other questions and evidence that might lead to less pessimistic conclusions, officials say.
The need to do something soon to curb Dr. Karadzic was stated publicly this week by Michael Steiner, the senior deputy to Carl Bildt, who is in charge of implementing civilian components of the Dayton accords. Mr. Steiner said that progress is being made to improve freedom of movement within Bosnia with the new help of the NATO forces there, but that there are "psychological checkpoints."
He said there is "a deeper insecurity in the minds of the people, who see the same leaders in power, and these leaders not behaving in a way that indicates to people that the peace will hold."
Mr. Steiner appealed to the United States and its allies to remove Dr. Karadzic from power or sharply limit his influence. "As long as Karadzic remains in power, we can't expect the elections to come out the way we want," Mr. Steiner said.
Mr. Milosevic has told American officials that the elections would themselves solve the Karadzic problem, since as an indicted war criminal, he is banned from running in them. "But for us that's not enough," Mr. Steiner said. "Karadzic would spoil the whole atmosphere."
The elections themselves are necessary for establishing the multi-ethnic, unified institutions of the weak central Bosnian Government called for in the Dayton accords.
Senior American officials argue that while Bosnia is a mess, it is improving, and that the incremental progress being made on civilian questions like freedom of movement and resettlement of displaced people is in rough line with the schedule laid out in the peace accords.
"It's a cumulative process, and we knew it would be painful and we have to keep the pressure on to squeeze progress" from the faction leaders, a senior official said. "Instead, everyone asks if the parties are prepared to move to the end point right now, and we never expected that. The true test will be if at the end of the year, there is something standing and self-sustaining."
For example, American officials say they recently "read the riot act" to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, NATO, the police, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and Mr. Bildt's office to get them to focus on the need to promote freedom of movement and resettlement.
There are new efforts to get the peacekeeping troops deployed in visible, imposing ways to intimidate those trying to prevent freedom of movement, the officials say, and NATO has appointed a two-star general to work with a task force on the elections.
At the same time, a top American official working on the elections with the Organization for security and cooperation in Europe, William Steubner, resigned over the lack of progress in preparing for a free and democratic vote.
There is a general agreement in the American Government that Dr. Karadzic "intends to try to thwart an open election," a senior State Department official said.
The official recalled the problems American troops faced after their failed attempt to capture a renegade militia leader in Somalia in 1993. He said that rather than risk a similar military confrontation or the possible seizure of hostages that could follow the forcible arrest of Dr. Karadzic, the United States would prefer to reduce his influence among Bosnian Serbs, "and the debate is over how best to do it."

HEADLINE: Neither Ridicule Nor Rancor Halts Gorbachev Election Bid

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: STAVROPOL, Russia, May 16

 BODY:
The last leader of the Soviet Union stepped out of his car on the edge of his boyhood village on Wednesday and looked expectantly at the small group of people gathered.
"So, who is meeting me here?" he asked jovially. He looked closer and frowned as he recognized only Western reporters. "It's mostly foreigners. I want to see someone I know." 
 When two police officers walked over, the presidential candidate rushed to greet them, radiant at the chance to shake hands with voters.
Once one of the most influential men of the century, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, aged 65, is running for public office for the first time in his life. Greeted at every stop by indifference mixed with ridicule and rancor, his is a crusade that has more to do with personal redemption than winning the presidency.
Revered in the West as the man who ended the cold war, Mr. Gorbachev is viscerally disliked by most Russians, who, among other things, blame him for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Public opinion polls invariably give him about 1 percent of the vote. His chances of victory are nil.
Even in his tiny hometown of Prevolnoye (population 4,000), about 100 miles northwest of Stavropol, old friends and neighbors express bewilderment and even contempt for his battle to return to the Kremlin.
But there is nothing mysterious about Mr. Gorbachev's quixotic attempt at a second act. Energetic and opinionated as ever, Mr. Gorbachev is struggling to wrestle free of his forced retirement and restore his reputation. A man who loves and clearly misses the limelight, he is driven by a compulsion to rewrite history, as well as a deep, nourishing hatred for the two forces that he feels forced him out of power before his time -- the Communist Party that jettisoned him, and Boris N. Yeltsin, who nimbly took his place.
He has an insatiable appetite for campaigning and media attention. And his ego has not shrunk in exile. Before a hostile audience in the nearby village of Krasnogvardeyskoye, he likened himself to Jesus.
"I will fight to the bitter end, even if you crucify me," he told hecklers in the audience. "I am reminded of Jesus Christ on the way to Golgotha," he said of himself, "how he walked through the streets and people spat at him."
He tells voters that if he is squeezed out of the race in the first round on June 16, they should abstain from voting for either Mr. Yeltsin or his Communist challenger, Gennadi A. Zyuganov, in the second. "They are equally bad," he said at a small news conference attended by a handful of European and American reporters. "Both choices are worse."
But in his speeches, Mr. Gorbachev evinces a deeper, more personal loathing for Mr. Yeltsin, whom he refers to as "the betrayer" who "stabbed Gorbachev in the back."
He arrived in Prevolnoye accompanied, as he always is, by his wife, Raisa, glamorously turned out in designer sunglasses and bronze platform sandals. Even there his was not a festive, all-out hometown welcome. A few old friends gathered outside his old house to say hello and he and his wife gamely sat down to a simple dinner of crawfish, lamb stew and potatoes at a farm canteen with a dozen local officials and farm directors. But there were no crowds lining the streets, no parades or rallies.
"He's already been President," said Maria K. Gopkala, 62, a second cousin and neighbor who sat on a bench outside Mr. Gorbachev's family house and complained about the economic woes she said the former leader's reforms had wrought. "He's retired, let him rest. We're all for Zyuganov."
But she expressed more pity than anger. "He tried to do good, of course, but they wouldn't let him. Now it's time for a younger, stronger man to take over."
There was less sympathy in the audience in the district capital, Krasnogvardeyskoye, where Mr. Gorbachev gave a speech explaining how he tried to save the Soviet Union, but was betrayed by Communist hard-liners and by Mr. Yeltsin's personal ambition.
It is the leitmotif of all his speeches. Mr. Gorbachev, who calls himself a social democrat, says little about his own election program, and never goes into any depth about exactly how he would carry out his pledges to increase industrial and agricultural production, end the war in Chechnya and reform tax policy. In something like a Russian version of talk therapy, he keeps revisiting the greatest crisis of his past.
As he was explaining, for the second time, how Mr. Yeltsin and the Communist hard-liners who tried to oust him in the August 1991 coup undermined his efforts to preserve the Soviet state, an old woman stood up mid-speech and pointed her finger accusingly.
"You are blaming everyone except yourself!" she shouted. "You are responsible for what has happened, you personally!"
Mr. Gorbachev did not take umbrage -- he is similarly interrrupted at almost every campaign event. He replied that he had personally fought to win her the freedom to express such views, and ordered her to sit down.
Later he turned back to his Communist antagonists in the crowd and scolded them with gusto. "You were sheep, grazing in the grasses of Stavropol," he said. "I want you to think and choose as citizens, and all you want is a new shepherd."
Mr. Gorbachev wants badly to be loved again, but he doesn't seem to mind being hated. What upsets him the most is being ignored.
And mostly, he is. No national or local reporters from the Russian press covered his trip home -- they rarely cover any of his campaign stops or speeches. When he is in the news, it is usually for something embarrassing.
In Omsk last month, a man in a crowd reached out and struck him. Reporters called it a slap. Mr. Gorbachev angrily insists it was an assassination attempt, and claims the man was a special forces operative who tried to administer a lethal chop to the neck. The assailant was arrested, but the ultranationalist party of Vladimir V. Zhirinovksy proposed a measure in Parliament to grant the man amnesty. "He did what many dream of," said Boris Finko, the bill's sponsor.
While campaigning, Mr. Gorbachev sometimes displays the flashes of charm that early in his tenure bedazzled Russians and the West, bantering with school teachers, flirting roguishly with bashful charwomen, earnestly listening to the laments of impoverished pensioners.
But Mr. Gorbachev, who often still refers to himself in the third person, also seems not to comprehend his dramatic drop in stature. Asked at a news conference in Moscow to comment on an appeal for compromise between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Zyuganov signed by 13 prominent businessmen in April, Mr. Gorbachev seemed stunned that the reporter had not already read his written response. "Haven't you read my written assessment?" he replied, genuinely shocked. He blamed the news agency Interfax for failing to distribute it properly.
Local officials in Russia, many of whom cowered before him only a few years ago, seem to relish putting the fallen Communist leader in his place. In Stavropol, where he was once an all-powerful party boss, the local administration snubbed him. The agricultural academy he attended as a youth rejected his request to address the faculty and students.
"He is disliked everywhere, but here most of all," said Pyotr P. Marchenko, the governor of Stavropol. Mr. Marchenko, who was appointed by Mr. Yeltsin, spoke on Monday in Moscow, where he was on a visit to Yeltsin campaign headquarters. "We don't understand what's gotten into him," he added with a smirk. "I'm certain he gets the poll results, I'm certain. I think he has lost all touch with what real people think."
Raisa Gorbachev, who is almost as unpopular among Russians as her husband, has recovered from the stroke she suffered during the attempted coup. She, too, angrily echoes her husband's complaints of a conspiracy between the news media, the Government and the Communist Party to muzzle Mr. Gorbachev.
"They have imposed the lie," she said, "that he is to blame for the collapse of the Soviet Union. They destroyed it, and there is a media blackout to say that it was him, not them."
She said she had tried to persuade her husband not to run, worried about further affronts to his dignity and even assassination attempts. "It didn't work," she said. "A writer writes books, an artist paints. Gorbachev is a politician, it's his life. Even if he is not understood in his own country, and that's because life has grown so hard, politics is the goal of his entire life."
Mr. Gorbachev offers another rationale for his campaign.
"I will not lose if they are genuinely free elections," he tells his audiences. "I have a good chance of getting there, I feel it." He added, "But even if I am not elected, if there are free elections Gorbachev will still have won, for this is what Gorbachev was fighting for."

HEADLINE: Battle Ends On Free Care For Uninsured

BYLINE: By JENNIFER PRESTON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 16

 BODY:
For the first time since January, New Jersey will be sending out reimbursement checks to the 84 hospitals that provide free medical treatment to the uninsured, now that the state has finally agreed on a financing plan.
Ending a five-month debate over how to pay for hospital care for the uninsured, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman signed the bill into law about an hour after it was approved 32 to 7 by the State Senate. The two-year plan continues to rely on payroll taxes designated for the state's unemployment fund and seeks to move the uninsured into a managed-care network that has yet to be created. 
 Governor Whitman also signed a bill that extends unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 39 weeks through the end of this year.
The Legislature included an extension of unemployment benefits to win the support of organized labor leaders who had joined with business leaders to oppose diverting any more payroll taxes designated for the unemployment fund to pay for hospital care for the uninsured. Since 1993, the state has paid for so-called charity care with $1.6 billion in payroll taxes that had been earmarked for the unemployment fund.
Under the new plan, the state would take $660 million more out of the unemployment fund over the next two years. The rest of the charity care bill would be paid with $56 million from the state budget. The bill also includes a $300 million reduction in unemployment taxes for employers, but several business executives said they were unhappy that the Legislature and the Governor had not reached a permanent solution that relied less on the fund. Business leaders worry that unemployment payroll taxes will increase because so much money has been diverted from the fund.
"We are disappointed," James F. Leonard, a vice president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, said. "The opportunity to make a solution permanent was missed."
Until Wednesday, it was unclear whether the measure would win passage in the Senate. Democrats and several Republicans objected to the continued use of the unemployment fund to finance charity care. But today, both Republicans and Democrats voted to support the proposal. The Assembly passed the bill May 6.
Even as they voted today, two State Senators said that they had to "hold their nose" as they cast their votes.
"We can vote yes for what many of think is a lousy bill," said State Senator William E. Schluter, a Republican from Hunterdon County, urging his colleagues to support the bill during a lengthy debate. "We have to get this behind us, even if you, like I do, have to hold your nose while you are doing it."
Governor Whitman said she wholeheartedly approved of the legislation. She also signed a bill that provides $10 million for Health Access, a state-subsidized health insurance program. But there is not enough money provided so that new applicants could join the program. The $10 million only covers health benefits for the 22,000 people currently enrolled in the program.
State Health Commissioner Len Fishman said that he would begin working on a plan with hospitals to develop a managed care network that would start with first identifying the patients who received charity care services.
Many hospital administrators, who had begun to trim staff and delay payments to suppliers as they tried to make do without the state aid, said they were relieved that the state had finally come up with a financing plan.
But Gary S. Carter, president of the New Jersey Hospital Association, said the plan does not provide enough money to reimburse hospitals for all the free medical care that they are required by state law to provide.
Mr. Carter said hospitals provided $600 million in free care last year and they received $388 million in state reimbursements. Under the new plan, hospitals would receive $310 million this year, a $78 million reduction over last year, and $300 million next year.

HEADLINE: Tough Talker For a Delicate Job;
China at Top of Trade Chief's Agenda

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
On the verge of becoming acting United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky faced a particularly delicate negotiating challenge: persuading three hockey fans at a bar to change the channel on the television.
A month ago, Ms. Barshefsky was on her way back from Beijing, where she had just warned the Chinese that failure to carry through on their commitment to shut the factories pirating American software, music and videos would result in billions of dollars in sanctions against their exports. Switching planes in Los Angeles, she checked in with her office and was told that President Clinton was about to make an announcement that would change her life. She had to find a TV -- fast. 
 "The only working television was at the bar," Ms. Barshefsky recalled, warming to an oft-told White House tale. "There are these guys, glued to a hockey game. So I ask them: 'Would you mind switching to the President's news conference?' And I get this look of disgust that says, 'Watch what?' "
Announcing Ms. Barshefsky's promotion, the President described her as a woman who "has brought tears to the eyes" of leaders around the world. The barflies were not impressed. "They didn't even buy me a drink," she said.
Now, Ms. Barshefsky -- known in Washington as a supreme tactician, a quick study, an extraordinarily patient negotiator and a mother who ignores the phone in the evenings so that she can help her two daughters with violin and piano lessons -- must prove as wily in dealing with China's aging leaders as she was with those grumpy hockey fans.
On Wednesday, Ms. Barshefsky made her opening parry. Stepping into the television lights, she looked around, smiled, and -- making good on her threat -- crisply announced a sanctions list of $3 billion in Chinese goods that could soon be subject to 100 percent tariffs.
Facing down China would be a daunting task at any time, but it is particularly challenging just as Ms. Barshefsky must make the leap from the tactical role of the No. 2 and emerge from the shadow of Mickey Kantor, her former boss. Mr. Kantor left the job to succeed Ronald H. Brown as Commerce Secretary after Mr. Brown was killed in a plane crash in Croatia.
She has already proved to be plenty tough. Within weeks of taking up her post as a top trade deputy in 1993 and plunging into talks with Japan, Ms. Barshefsky's colleagues named her "Stonewall." "Believe it or not, she is even more direct and blunt than I am," said Mr. Kantor, who is not known for shyness.
Still, by her own admission, Ms. Barshefsky, 45, lacks the long experience of Mr. Kantor as a Washington deal maker, or his deep connections to President Clinton and other members of the Cabinet. "Mickey's political, I'm not," she said shortly before she was appointed to the job. Moreover, the trade representative's office she is inheriting -- a scant 150 people -- has been transformed in recent years into a central player in the formation of American foreign policy. And she must do all this in the supercharged atmosphere of a Presidential election year.
Yet until she joined the trade office in 1993 from one of Washington's top law firms, Steptoe & Johnson, Ms. Barshefsky had never stepped foot in Asia, where the contours of merging trade with diplomacy are most treacherous. Nonetheless, by virtually all accounts -- including Japanese opponents who are not easily impressed -- she is a natural.
"She may be the most intuitive negotiator I've ever seen," Joan Spero, the Under Secretary of State for Economic and Agricultural Affairs and one of Ms. Barshefsky's closest friends, said the other day. "She has this incredible ability to pick up the body language of the negotiator on the other side of the table. She reads them brilliantly."
In public, Ms. Barshefsky is remarkably confident, talking in perfect paragraphs. At her news conference on the Chinese sanctions, swathed in one of her trademark French silk scarves, she began with a concise description of the Administration's objectives in China, focusing on enforcing trade accords, but remembering to touch on nuclear nonproliferation, human rights and a detailed defense of the dangers of isolating Beijing by terminating its broader trade privileges, called "most-favored nation" status.
Friends say that behind the articulate barrage, she is torn by at least a few self-doubts about the difficulty of doing her job without slighting her daughters, 8 and 12 years old, a balancing act that she talked about at length in The New Yorker earlier this year.
Indeed, in the Winder Building near the White House -- where Lincoln once got reports from the Civil War battlefield and that now serves as the command center for America's 20th-century trade wars -- she is still adjusting to her new status in the Clinton inner circle.
But whether she can ever drop the "acting" from her title depends largely on the interpretation of an amendment to American trade law adopted last year that prohibits appointing anyone as trade representative who has "represented, aided or advised" foreign governments in trade negotiations. That rule, if taken in its broadest sense, would ban from the post nearly every trade lawyer in Washington.
Just before leaving private practice, Ms. Barshefsky played what the Administration terms a "monitoring" role for the Canadian Government in its disputes with the United States over imports of softwood lumber, a subject from which she recused herself in office. Viewed in light of Congress's intent, Ms. Barshefsky said, "Nothing we have seen so far suggests there will be any problem."
Nonetheless, she has not yet moved her desk into Mr. Kantor's old office.
But from her slightly more cramped quarters, she has already given the stiff arm to most of America's trading partners, large and small, over the issue that became her first test -- a global agreement on telecommunications.
For years the United States has been sparring with other nations that want access to the world's most lucrative telecommunications market but say their own markets are not yet developed enough to throw open their doors to the American giants. When Ms. Barshefsky came face-to-face with the deadline to close the global deal at the end of last month, she concluded that many countries simply had not given enough.
So she pulled the plug, telling the rest of the world to try again next year, with better offers.
"Twenty years ago we were willing to enter nonreciprocal agreements," she said. "We were a fully developed nation, compared to others, and we had economic leeway and political leeway to place other priorities well ahead of trade. And there was the cold war, which drove our agenda. Now, we expect foreign countries to provide the same level of access to us that we have provided to the world. You get what you give. It's that simple. No free rides."
Ms. Barshefsky's critics, none of whom would speak for attribution, say the problem with that philosophy is that Washington now gives lip service to working within the World Trade Organization that sets global trade ground rules, but sidesteps unpredictable panels of international judges and threatens unilateral sanctions whenever a big problem erupts. America, many in Europe and Asia say, cannot have it both ways.
"The U.S. is between a rock and a hard place," she shoots back. "If it flexes its muscle in the W.T.O. or outside of it, the charge is that we are putting the international trading system at risk. If we are passive or agreeable, the charge is we are not showing leadership. The presence of a W.T.O. system does not mean the United States cannot pursue other interests, in other ways."
Ms. Barshefsky was, by her own admission, a reluctant trade warrior. "I was captured by indecision for 10 days," she recalled about her initial move to the trade deputy job, "looking for any sign of what I should do." She found it driving to work one morning with her husband, Edward B. Cohen, on a car with the license plate "GO4IT."
The first country to get a dose of Ms. Barshefsky's driven, focused style was Japan. In 1993, just weeks into her job as Mr. Kantor's deputy, she opened negotiations on an umbrella agreement that would eventually cover more than 20 different industrial sectors. That July, as President Clinton arrived on his first trip to Japan, Ms. Barshefsky picked up on the differences between Tokyo's more accommodating Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the hard-line Ministry of International Trade and Industry and managed to strike a deal that drove a wedge between the bureaucratic rivals. The result was a much publicized fistfight in the lobby of the Okura Hotel -- witnessed by many, but denied by the Japanese Government -- between the feuding Japanese bureaucrats.
Since then Ms. Barshevsky has held endless negotiations, mixing a hard line -- sometimes harder than Mr. Kantor's -- with some graceful touches. A senior Japanese diplomat remembers receiving a shawl from Ms. Barshefsky and her daughters for his wife, who was fighting cancer. The gesture was so unusual that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto later thanked her.
But China is a very different challenge and its hardball response that Ms. Barshefsky's approach will only end up forcing China to close its doors to American investors and products has already shaken some big American companies. But Ms. Barshefsky's public pose is firm.
"Certainly China is a desirable market," she said the other day, "but it is by no means the only growing market in the world."

Guilty Plea in Pipeline Case
The company that built a 375-mile pipeline from the Canadian border to Long Island to supply millions of Northeastern homes with natural gas has agreed to plead guilty to omitting crucial safety devices and damaging wetland areas. And the Iroquois Pipeline Operating Company will pay fines of $22 million, according to two defense lawyers involved in the case. [Page A1.]
 
Deregulation Plan Approved
The state's Public Service Commission approved a plan to deregulate New York State's electric industry, a move designed to reduce the state's high electric rates by allowing consumers to choose who will provide their power. The new policy is premised on the idea that breaking the electric utilities' monopoly and injecting greater competition into the market will ultimately drive down rates for everyone. [B1.]
 
Judge Steps Aside
A Federal judge whose handling of a Washington Heights drug case drew harsh criticism removed himself from the case, saying his decision was "in the interests of justice." The judge, Harold Baer Jr., said he hoped to avoid time-consuming delays caused by an inevitable defense challenge to his decision to reinstate 80 pounds of drugs as evidence against a confessed drug courier. [B1.]
 
Hope and Temporary Relief
The season of hope and relief took wing on college campuses this week. But far from being starry-eyed idealists, most graduates seem to be painfully aware that their horizons may be narrower than those of their parents, those refugees from the soaring 60's. NYC by Clyde Haberman [B1.]
 
Dimming the Lights
Times Square is about to lose one of its most dazzling displays: Sony is turning off the Jumbotron, the bigger-than-life television screen that has flashed news and advertising over the intersection since 1990. The decision is strictly business, Sony said. [B3.]
 
Mayor's New Quest
As he gears up for next year's re-election campaign, Mayor Giuliani is embarking on a new quest for the trust of New Yorkers. His constituents, he says, should cast aside their instinctive skepticism of municipal government. [B3.]
 
Judges Take on Pataki
Angered by Governor Pataki's plan to toughen the state's penal laws, trial judges began taking the unusual step of going public with their criticism because they believe that the Legislature may soon approve the Governor's proposals. The judges, including prominent Republicans, contend that the Governor's plan would diminish their role in the courtroom by sharply scaling back their authority over sentencing. [B5.]

HEADLINE: Clinton Prods Executives to 'Do the Right Thing'

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
Seeking to encourage American companies to take more responsibility for the well-being of their employees, President Clinton presided today over meetings and seminars with business executives that he said offered proof "you can do the right thing and make money."
The summons of business leaders to a White House-sponsored Corporate Citizenship Conference was Mr. Clinton's latest attempt to use the President's bully pulpit to highlight an issue and challenge the private sector to meet social problems, without actually legislating change. 
 The technique has helped Mr. Clinton raise his favorable ratings in an election year by speaking to voters' concerns about issues like corporate downsizing, without having to push a program through a resistant Republican Congress.
Working in conjunction with his political strategist, Dick Morris, over the past months, Mr. Clinton has explored the rhetorical powers of his office, using such forums as well as speeches to step into the Republican territory of social and cultural issues and also build a Democratic agenda of values based around family issues like school uniforms, school competency test and a battle against teen-age smoking.
At a similar White House meeting with the leaders of the entertainment industry in February, Mr. Clinton was rewarded with an industry pledge to produce a voluntary television ratings system by January.
Today, Mr. Clinton showcased companies that assist families with measures like on-site child care, a summer camp, flexible work hours and paternity leave, as well as companies that invest in their work forces by offering stock options, full health insurance benefits for part-time workers and employee tuition for outside training programs and education.
"I believe the power of example to change the behavior of Americans is enormous," Mr. Clinton said as he began panel discussions at Georgetown University. "What I want to see us do is to elevate the good practices that are going on, show how they are consistent with making money and succeeding in the free enterprise system, and hope that we can reinforce that kind of conduct that so many of you have brought to bear in your own companies and with your own employees."
Republicans called the sessions election-year gimmickry. "Bill Clinton profferring business advice while companies are laying employees off makes about as much sense as throwing a drowning man a brick," said Christina Martin, the deputy campaign press secretary for Senator Bob Dole, the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee. "Bob Dole understands job creation is key to economic growth. Lower taxes and less regulation, that's the message Bob Dole is taking to the American people."
Political strategists of both parties have been grappling with how to deal with a changing economy that has brought moderate growth, low inflation and high employment yet also caused caused wide anxiety among workers because of stagnant wages and highly publicized layoffs.
For months, Mr. Clinton's administration was divided between figures like Secretary of Labor Robert B. Reich, who wanted worker anxiety to be a campaign focus and advocated tax incentives to reward companies that keep more workers on their payrolls, and Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin, who doubted the utility of the tax policy and did not want the President to be seen as vilifying corporations. The President's campaign strategists also shied away from a populist message that would veer too close to class warfare.
The result of the debate has been the kinds of themes struck at today's conference, which put the spotlight on companies that treat their workers well while not condemning or singling out those that do not.
Mr. Clinton also said today that he favored not just the renewal of an expired tax provision that exempts employees from paying taxes on tuition their employers reimburse them for, but the measure's expansion to allow small businesses a 10 percent income tax credit for employee education and training. The Republicans have favored only partial extension of the expired tax provision.
The President began the conference with a closed White House breakfast with 100 executives. They ranged from Aaron Feuerstein of Massachusetts, who has received recognition for keeping his 2,400 mill workers at Malden Mills on the payroll after his textile factory was largely destroyed in a fire, to Robert E. Allen, the chief executive of AT&T, who became a political whipping boy because of his high package of salary and compensation in the face of his company's plan to lay off 40,000 workers.
Some of the group later moved to Georgetown University, where speaker after speaker said the kinds of benefits they offered their employees paid off in their bottom lines.
Explaining his outdoor wear company's commitment to on-site child care, flexible hours and paid maternity and paternity leave, Yvon Chouinard, the chairman of Patagonia, said of his employees: "I want them to bond with their children. I want them focused, and if they are distracted by guilt they can't focus. We don't provide these benefits because we're nice."
At one point, one onlooker, Donald F. Hastings, the chairman of the Lincoln Electric Company of Cleveland, complained that the group was not addressing the issue of layoffs.
To honor companies that show concern for their workers, Mr. Clinton today announced the creation of a corporate citizenship award named after Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, who died last month in a plane crash while leading a delegation of business executives in a trade mission in the Balkans.

HEADLINE: U.S. PLANS BONDS THAT GIVE SAVERS INFLATION GUARD

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16

 BODY:
In an effort to get Americans to save more, the Treasury announced plans today to issue a new type of Government bond that would protect average investors from inflation as well as help the Government finance the national debt.
The new bonds would offer returns that would rise and fall in line with inflation -- a feature that the Treasury said should make Americans more willing to buy Government bonds to pay for their retirement or their children's education. The bonds would be backed by the Government and priced so that unexpected increases in inflation would not erode their value. 
 "We will be offering a unique investment vehicle, an opportunity for middle-income people to save for retirement or their kid's education," said Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin. "We are trying to better serve citizens by creating a vehicle that provides inflation protection, a real rate of return and the backing of the Government. Over time, this will be well used by Americans seeking to save."
Mr. Rubin said the bonds would not be issued until later this year, at the earliest, and that many decisions still had to be made: How many bonds to sell, what inflation index to use in setting the prices for the bonds, whether to sell 10-year or 30-year bonds, or both. He said the Treasury would soon meet with Wall Street executives, mutual fund companies and average investors to sort out these issues.
However these issues are decided, Mr. Rubin said, the new bonds are expected to help cut the cost of borrowing and enable the Government to turn to the growing retirement market to help finance the national debt. Currently, a total of $675 billion is invested in 401(k) plans, or self-directed retirement plans, according to Access Research of Windsor, Conn., and these bonds are expected to be marketed as a new option in such plans.
Right now, Government bonds are not a popular option for 401(k) plans and other forms of long-term savings. Government bonds generally offer lower returns than stocks or corporate bonds. And while these other investments may be riskier than Government bonds, their higher returns have been a way that average Americans have tried to protect their savings from inflation.
"This new security is a good idea that makes great sense," said Allen Sinai, chief global economist at Lehman Brothers, an investment banking firm. "If the inflation index goes up, so do their returns. This makes these bonds safer for investors than bonds without this protection. I would expect this to turn out to be a very popular item."
These inflation-indexed bonds are also expected to be a popular item for the many brokerage and money market firms that package 401(k) plans and college savings plans. "It's an excellent idea," said Paul Boltz, chief economist at T. Rowe Price, a Baltimore mutual fund company. "We always tell investors that they have to take inflation into account in their long-term savings. This is one way for them to have it covered."
The Treasury is proposing that these bonds be sold in denominations as low as $1,000. Mutual fund companies and brokerage firms, however, may decide to buy some of these bonds in bulk and repackage them in even smaller amounts for their customers.
The Treasury is still trying to decide how to structure the bonds. In its simplest form, the principal value of a $1,000 bond would rise to $1,030 at the end of the year if inflation is 3 percent that year. If inflation is lower, the figure could be lower; if inflation is higher, the number could be higher. In addition, the coupon -- the interest paid every six months on such bonds -- would rise in line with the inflation index being used.
The Treasury is also considering other options for these bonds: One would be a zero-coupon bond, in which a person gets all his money back at the end of the bond's life along with an inflation premium. Other possible types of bonds would pay interest and some principal each year.
The bonds are a departure from the Treasury's reliance on issuing only fixed-rate securities -- ones with a set interest rate that does not change over time. The Treasury estimates that it can cut its own borrowing costs and save taxpayer money with these bonds because they will, in general, be issued for lower rates than comparable fixed-rate securities because they offer this inflation protection.
"We hope to save money for the taxpayers with these bonds," said Darcy E. Bradbury, the Treasury's Assistant Secretary for Financial Markets.
But if inflation rises, the bonds could prove to be much more expensive for the Government over their lives than conventional bonds.
Currently, Britain and Canada are the largest issuers of such bonds. In Britain, such inflation-indexed bonds represent about 15 percent of the Government bond market. Money managers said similar securities had also been issued in Australia, New Zealand and Sweden.
Treasury officials said they hoped the proposed new bonds would encourage people to save more. "Most economic experts believe that a higher savings rate is good for the economy," said Lawrence H. Summers, the Deputy Treasury Secretary. "It permits more investments in America, so that is good for the nation. And since people are living a longer time, people have more need to put money aside. At other times, inflation has had a very pernicious effect on savings."
While many in the bond markets and Wall Street expressed interest in these bonds, there were some concerns. Some bond dealers were questioned why the Government was issuing inflation-protected bonds at a time when inflation was low. Others wanted to make sure that the Government would issue bonds in sufficient numbers to create a broad and robust market for traders.
"The timing of these bonds is somewhat difficult to understand," said David M. Jones, vice chairman of Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York government securities dealer. "It is a period of time when inflation, thank goodness, is not a major problem. So the question of how attractive these will be to individual investors is up in the air."
Mr. Jones was also concerned that the issuance of the bonds might be a signal to foreign investors that the United States was having trouble keeping inflation under control. "Typically, these bonds were started in countries where inflation was a problem," Mr. Jones said.
And Ian MacKinnon, head of the fixed-income division at the Vanguard Group, a Valley Forge, Pa., mutual fund company, warned that while investors could do well in periods of high inflation, they could be disappointed with returns in deflationary times. If inflation is negative -- that is, if consumer prices are falling over a sustained period -- investors may see the coupon payments and the principal value of their inflation-indexed bonds decline.
"This is a good idea with certain caveats," Mr. MacKinnon said. "It won't be a perfect hedge against inflation, although it will go a long way in that direction. But, there is still no guarantee that you will have more wealth at the end than if you bought a fixed-income bond. It might be the opposite. If you had deflation, you'd be better off in a fixed-income bond than in an inflation-index bond. It's kind of a mixed bag."

Japan's Brokerage Houses Rebound
Bolstered by rallies in the stock and bond markets, Japan's four biggest brokerage houses reported a return to profitability in the latest fiscal year. Analysts warned, however, that the difficulties were not over. [D2.]

HEADLINE: G.M. Buys A Landmark Of Detroit For Its Home

BYLINE: By ROBIN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 16

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation said today that it had bought the flashiest landmark in Detroit's skyline, the Renaissance Center, and would move its world headquarters to the downtown complex of five shiny glass towers.
The purchase means that the city synonymous with the automobile industry will soon house the world's largest auto company in the building shown on Motor City postcards. The move from G.M.'s 15-story building near a highway to the 73-story Renaissance Center in the heart of downtown will make true the old phrase: on a clear day, you can see General Motors. 
 And in a delicious twist, not only is G.M. taking over a complex that was first championed by Henry Ford 2d, but it also now becomes the landlord of the No. 2 auto maker, the Ford Motor Company, which occupies an entire tower at the center.
The deal also means that the center, which opened in 1977, may finally live up to its name, which promised renewal for a troubled city. General Motors will move 5,400 workers from its current headquarters to the Renaissance Center and will fill up the rest of the space with up to 5,000 more workers from other locations across Michigan. Because so many area companies do business with General Motors, the company's strengthened presence in Detroit may persuade other companies to move downtown as well.
General Motors is essentially moving from one commercial center in Detroit, the New Center area, to another commercial region, the city's downtown along the Detroit River. Both neighborhoods have few department stores, restaurants or residents, so that when office workers go home in the early evening, the streets quickly become deserted.
Mayor Dennis W. Archer said the deal would revitalize Detroit. "Whenever the world thinks automobiles, it thinks Detroit," he said. "The largest corporation in the world has reaffirmed that Detroit has what it takes to be a headquarters city."
That may prove true. But General Motors was also bottom fishing in a weak real-estate market. The Renaissance Center cost $350 million to build nearly two decades ago. By last summer, the asking price was $125 million, and there were no takers.
A Texas company, Highgate Hotels, bought the property this spring, reportedly for $72 million, and General Motors bought it from Highgate for what G.M.'s vice chairman, Harry J. Pearce, would only describe as "the right price." He also said that buying the cut-rate headquarters building was attractive because his company felt the importance of "social responsibility" and sought to strengthen the city.
Indeed, it was Henry Ford 2d whose dream was to build the Renaissance Center, so named because he hoped it would spur urban renewal in the decade after the 1967 race riots here.
The center is 83 percent occupied now, and General Motors said it would soon begin moving into vacant offices. About 600,000 square feet are expected to open up in the next 10 months. G.M. said it would honor current leases -- Ford's lease runs out in 2005 -- and then fill up the towers with its employees as other companies' leases expired.
Eventually, that will leave empty the company's current Detroit headquarters and threaten to put that part of the city in an economic tailspin. The current General Motors Building, a few miles north of downtown, was designed by the architect Albert Kahn and completed in 1920. The neoclassical building's ornate lobby has vaulted ceilings with gold leaf, brass and iron chandeliers, and three kinds of marble.
General Motors plans to establish an economic development fund for the neighborhood it has called home for 76 years, and to design a transition plan to help it weather the shock. The effects may be softened because the building is in Detroit's Empowerment Zone, making new tenants eligible for Federal tax breaks.
However beautiful, the historic building is outdated. After studying the problems, General Motors concluded that renovating it would be more expensive than building a giant office complex from scratch, and the company was quietly considering moving out of Detroit altogether. When it realized a month ago that the Renaissance Center was about to be sold, it acted quickly to buy it.
The center consists of five glass towers. A 73-story tower houses the Westin Hotel, which has more the 1,400 rooms. It is surrounded by four 39-story office towers. Together, the complex has more than 2.2 million square feet of space.
The towers are connected with a notorious maze of halls housing fast-food restaurants and shops. Visitors as well as longtime tenants routinely get lost going from one part of the confusing complex to another, and General Motors has vowed to correct that problem.
Until then, Mr. Pearce said, "I suppose we could hand out some global positioning systems," the satellite guidance systems G.M. is developing for some of its cars.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Trust Me, Giuliani Says, Striking a New Theme

BYLINE: By DAVID FIRESTONE 

 BODY:
In a city that he describes as "being destroyed by cynics," Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is embarking on a new quest for the trust of New Yorkers. His constituents, he says, should cast aside their instinctive skepticism of municipal government.
In his speeches and public remarks, the Mayor has begun to make public trust one of his broad new themes as he gears up for next year's re-election campaign. He asserts that by keeping his promises in such areas as lowering crime and reducing the welfare rolls, he has proven himself unlike the "cynical politicians" who governed New York for 20 years. Therefore, he says, he should not be subject to the same level of distrust that has traditionally been accorded local officeholders. 
 "Rudy: He's earned our trust" was the dominant slogan of his huge fund-raising dinner at the Sheraton Hotel Tuesday night, beamed from the video monitors, printed on the programs -- even emblazoned on the curious little cheerleader pom-poms that served as wavable napkin holders for those who ate the $1,000 meals. In his speech before 1,300 contributors, he worked to distinguish himself from the kind of politicians he used to prosecute as United States Attorney, and he elaborated on the idea in an interview this week.
"You can't just ask someone for their vote," he said. "You have to give them a format around which to make that decision. If you seek their trust, you'll get some to trust you, and you'll get some that have questions, but still reach out to vote for you. And I think we have the kind of record from which we can make that argument."
Public opinion polls over the 29 months of the Mayor's term have consistently given him higher marks for effectiveness than compassion. Asking for trust while reciting a litany of accomplishments may be the Mayor's way of replacing the personal bond that he has yet to build with the electorate, said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion, which regularly surveys the Mayor's approval ratings.
"It's a hard sell," Mr. Miringoff said. "The national electorate is very skeptical, and New York's is only more so."
Distrust was on display at Mr. Giuliani's most recent town meeting, in Port Richmond, S.I., last month. A local environmental leader stood to demand the closing of Fresh Kills landfill, and residents refused to accept the Mayor's assurances that he would somehow find a way to solve the malodorous problem.
After being heckled by some members of the audience, the Mayor angrily insisted that he had done more for Staten Island than all of his predecessors combined, and that he should be given a little credit for being serious about finding a way to close the dump.
"And don't try to put me on the spot and say when," he said, his voice rising at the otherwise placid town meeting. "I'm going to tell you, you should trust me to solve this problem, and I will solve it. And it isn't right for you to look at me like that, like I'm giving -- no, listen to me! -- like I'm trying to fool you. Because I don't do that with people."
The landfill confrontation illustrates the challenge of a "trust-me" campaign in New York. City voters have been conditioned by repeated episodes of corruption and decline not to place much hope in politicians. Mr. Giuliani asserted that he was the one who prosecuted some of these politicians and has established a record on which he can support his request for trust.
But not everyone agrees that the Mayor's accomplishments have been altogether beneficial. Although few people dispute that crime has been reduced under Mr. Giuliani, many people at the lower end of the economic spectrum are unhappy about the Mayor's reduction in the welfare rolls, by 122,000 people. He has won praise from fiscal watchdogs for lowering the city's spending, and says the city is cleaner than it has been in 15 or 20 years. But he is using his administration's own benchmarks for these statements, and many residents, using their own yardsticks, have complained that basic city services have suffered.
The Mayor believes that the remaining doubts are the legacy of a loosely defined political establishment that disappointed the city for 20 years. He says he is not referring to specific former mayors, but he leaves no doubt that he considers himself to be of a different breed.
"What we're going to try to do, to build up people's trust, is to show, here are the promises, here's the performance, and it's a good record," he said in the interview. "People come to me and say -- and it's probably exaggerated -- you're the first politician who actually did what he promised."

HEADLINE: Egalitarianism Invades a Shrine Of V.I.P. Privilege;
A Young Software Company Gives a Few New-Age Twists To Some Old-Style Luxuries

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., May 16

 BODY:
Lucy Ricciardi, chief financial officer of the Hyperion Software Corporation, didn't want a visitor to get the wrong impression on a tour of the company's new headquarters above Long Ridge Road.
Yes, there were kitchens stocked with snacks and drinks around every corner, and a gym, and a nature trail across the campus's 38 leafy acres, and a billiard table next to the cafeteria, for whenever employees had an urge to take a break. And yes, the main reason she rejected the idea of installing arcade games along a wide tunnel connecting Hyperion's two buildings was that programmers already had better games on their computers. 
 But all this, she said, was necessity for a software company, whose means of production are the brains of people who do not necessarily think 9 to 5. Any touches of true luxury, she said, were left over from the original owner, Combustion Engineering, a Fortune 500 company that built a monument to corporate permanence, only to be taken over, downsized and moved.
"When you walk around and see teak and mahogany and marble," Ms. Ricciardi said, "it's because it was too expensive to rip out."
Hyperion's move last winter marked a changing of the economic guard in Fairfield County, as a headquarters built by one of many old-line corporations that helped make Stamford a business center in the 70's and 80's and then moved on was occupied by a company founded 15 years ago to serve them.
But it also illustrates the change in office cultures over the last 20 years. For Hyperion, the challenge was to convert a suit-and-tie management center into an unbuttoned-white-collar factory. And while the company is mildly embarrassed by the lavishness of its home, it sees the amenities as crucial.
To survive, Hyperion had to continually create new lines of its financial-management software for personal-computer networks. To do that, it had to attract more software designers to Fairfield County, a world away from the computer industry's hothouses of talent, the Route 128 corridor of Boston and the Silicon Valley in California.
So as streamlined headquarters shed employees and abandoned their self-contained campuses, Hyperion seized on the former Combustion Engineering complex as its answer to the grow-or-die imperative of the software industry.
The setting next to the Merritt Parkway offered a soothing landscape with plenty of room to expand, a place that was safe and secure for employees to come to and leave at all times of day or night as product deadlines neared. All Hyperion had to do was transform plush buildings designed for the kind of hierarchical, mainframe-era corporation that its own software was remaking, into a flexible, innovation-encouraging Microsoft East.
Creating a software culture in the relative isolation of Stamford was not new for Hyperion's chief executive, Jim Perakis, who came to what was then I.M.R.S. in 1985, when it had 14 employees and $1 million in sales.
The company had been founded in 1981 by Robert Thomson, a Scot who picked Stamford because it had so many of the corporate headquarters that he hoped to make his customers. I.M.R.S. software enabled corporations to do sophisticated financial analysis on personal computers instead of on mainframes, not only saving money but also helping to break down the rationale for large, centralized headquarters.
"Stamford stood out as a place that had little in the way of software development," said Mr. Perakis, who admitted that he would go to Boston or San Jose if he were starting over. "We had to build a software culture, and in each location we had to build a place where the software culture would work."
Starting downtown, the company progressively moved north toward the parkway. Along the way it grew to 1,100 employees, including 500 in Stamford, and $165 million in sales. And like other successful software companies that happened to have their start in relative isolation, including Computer Associates International on Long Island, it now had no choice but to stay and somehow attract new recruits. It could not afford to lose the work force it had assembled by moving to another part of the country.
When Ms. Ricciardi looked at the lavish Combustion Engineering campus, everything spoke to a different culture. Was it a relic, or could it be converted into a software factory where appearances and rank didn't count as much as talent?
Four months after moving in, Mr. Perakis and his employees are still getting used to their surroundings, and trying not to be too embarrassed by or too comfortable with some of the headquarter trappings that architects decided were simply too expensive to remove.
"It's a pleasant, almost rural environment," said Mr. Perakis, tieless and dressed casually, in his sparely furnished office. "If someone wants to take a walk on the nature trail, or just look out the windows at trees, they can.
"We wanted a work environment that is comfortable for employees but not plush. As a company in a competitive market, we have to make a statement of austerity. When we bring customers in, we don't want them to see a lavish style for our employees. We don't want to appear to be spending money foolishly.
"One reason my office is in this building, is to make a statement that I don't need to be surrounded by teak and marble."
In Hyperion's world, the order of the campus has been reversed. Combustion Engineering's main building for its top executives, with its softly gleaming boardroom and a chairman's office with working fireplace and antique French mantle, is now home to Hyperion's training center for its customers' employees.
The main offices and the creative center are now in a plainer second building. Behind a lobby that is unchanged, and therefore impressively sleek, the long corridors of executive offices have been broken up into mazes of unexceptional cubicles and meeting rooms.
The kitchens and other amenities are important, Ms. Ricciardi said, but so is a floor plan that encourages people working in teams to shout across a room or to walk across.
The architectural effect is not stunning; the point is to avoid impeding the creative flow with dress codes, fixed schedules or unnecessary walls.
"We don't care how you look or how you dress," Ms. Ricciardi said. "We're looking for people who are geniuses at writing software."
With a nationwide shortage of software writers, Hyperion has the disadvantage of being in an expensive housing market that lacks a concentration of companies that can be a source of employees and a safety net. Even though Fairfield County has become home to nearly 400 software companies, the great majority are still small start-ups.
"If I was a software engineer and I wanted to make sure there was a place for me if I had to leave, I'd want to make sure I was somewhere with a concentration," said Steve Markman, senior vice president of Pencom Systems, an international recruiting firm for the industry.
But growing companies like Hyperion offer their own advantages to technical people, and the right atmosphere in the workplace is one of them, Mr. Markman said.
"They all want to make money, but they all also want to work on cool projects with really progressive companies," he said. "Then they can go to work in cut-offs if they want, and you can't do that in certain environments."
Tom Feinstein, a product development director who recently came to Hyperion from the Digital Equipment Corporation outside Boston, said, "One of the things that attracted me was this employee-oriented approach. When you think about it, you spend a good part of your life at work, and half of the rest sleeping. So if you spend a lot of time with other people, you want to offer that balance of work and play."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Speed of Italian Reorganization Crimps Mark's Appeal as Haven

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar finished higher against the mark yesterday as the German currency was weakened by the surprisingly quick formation of a new Italian Government.
The mark, frequently sought as a currency haven in Europe, had benefited from political turmoil in Italy in recent months. Romano Prodi, a center-left economist, formed Italy's 55th postwar Government yesterday. 
 The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen, but ended mixed over all in thin trading, with European markets quiet between the Ascension Day holiday on Thursday and the weekend.
The dollar found some support from the revision by the Commerce Department of its February trade figures, which showed a sharply narrower deficit than first thought. American stock and bond prices were also higher yesterday, further bolstering the dollar.
In trading in New York late yesterday, the dollar rose to 1.5333 marks from 1.5325 marks on Thursday. The dollar traded at 106.77 yen, up from 106.65. The dollar lost ground to the Italian currency, slipping to 1,545 lire from 1,554.
The dollar continued its advance against the Swiss franc, rising to 1.2605 from 1.2555. The British pound traded at $1.5140, up from $1.5126.
The dollar begin its rise around noon in New York, as the mark fell against European currencies, particularly the lira.
"I think people have a certain amount of confidence the new Government is going to remain stable," said Wayne Grigull, director of foreign exchange sales at Merrill Lynch. Also, Mr. Grigull said, private economists predicted good inflation numbers would be released by Italy next week.
The dollar tumbled against the mark in early trading in New York after the Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit soared to $8.92 billion in March, 26.8 percent higher than February's imbalance.
That news was enough to send traders to sell the dollar.
"Initially, the headline number was worse than what the market was looking for," Mr. Grigull said. But then they examined other figures supplied by the Commerce Department showing that February's devastating deficit of $8.2 billion was revised downward to $7.04 billion.

HEADLINE: Indian Leaders Try to Calm Fears of a Pakistan Conflict

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 17

 BODY:
Setting out to allay fears it has stirred at home and abroad, India's new Hindu nationalist Government said today that it would seek "the best of relations with Pakistan" and speed market-based economic reforms that have begun to stir the economy out of decades of socialist sluggishness.
But the minority Government of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee also offered a hint of the more hawkish policy that has long been a part of the Hindu nationalist creed. 
 The new Defense Minister, Pramod Mahajan, said that military spending would be increased and that India's 350,000-member force in Indian-held Kashmir, bogged down by a Muslim insurgency, would be given "proper powers."
The assurances on Pakistan and on the continuation of the economic changes affirmed the calming effect that the new Government has sought since its ascent to power this week, when the Hindu nationalists were given the chance to govern despite controlling barely a third of the seats in Parliament after last week's inconclusive general election.
Center-left parties controlling the remaining two-thirds of the new Parliament, furious at being shunted aside, have said that they will topple the new Government in a confidence vote, expected on May 30.
In Western capitals -- where officials are unsure what to expect of a Government formed by politicians who have spent decades on the rightist fringes of Indian public life -- the message to Pakistan seemed likely to be especially welcome. Led by the United States, Western powers have striven to keep tensions between India and Pakistan from exploding, especially since the stakes of a potential conflict have been raised by both countries' acquisition of at least small stockpiles of nuclear weapons.
The olive branch to Islamabad was offered by Murli Manohar Joshi, Home Affairs Minister in the new Government, whose reputation until now has been as a Hindu firebrand. Mr. Joshi noted that Mr. Vajpayee had been credited with improving relations with Pakistan when he was Foreign Minister in a non-nationalist Government in the late 1970's.
"We had most cordial relations with Pakistan when Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the Foreign Minister," Mr. Joshi said. "Now he is the Prime Minister."
Two Cabinet ministers with decisive influences on economic policy -- the new Finance Minister, Jaswant Singh, and the Industry Minister, Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu -- struck similarly upbeat notes. Before the election, Mr. Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party, or Indian People's Party, had unsettled Indian financial markets and foreign investors by fomenting popular antagonism toward American investments and waving the flag of "swadeshi," a concept going back to pre-independence days, which stresses India's ability to go it alone economically.
But Finance Minister Singh said the Government intended to slash through bureaucratic hurdles to foreign investment and double the flow of capital, which reached about $2 billion in 1995, a fraction of that being attracted by China and some other Asian nations.
Mr. Prabhu said that a desire to go it alone did not change the economic facts confronting India. "The fact remains that we need foreign direct investment," he said, adding that with low domestic savings, "we will not be able to raise enough funds to meet our investment requirements."
At these and other interviews on their first full day in office, senior ministers in the new Government appeared to have mixed objectives. By striking a moderate tone on some issues, they appeared to be reaching out to groups in India and abroad whose support might help the new Government's standing in advance of the confidence vote in Parliament.
At the same time, by striking some more hawkish notes on other issues, they appeared to be laying the grounds for a nationalist challenge in a new election if their Government was soon ousted.
Nothing that has happened since the chaotic events of Wednesday, when India's President brushed aside the center-left parties and asked the nationalists to form their first government, has changed the odds that seem to be stacked against the nationalists.
At meetings today, the center-left parties and the Congress Party, ousted for only the third time since independence in 1947, vowed anew to use their majority of seats in the new Parliament to bring down the Vajpayee Government. As a first step, they said they would use their power to select the Speaker -- usually a Government prerogative -- when Parliament meets next week.
Since the Hindu nationalists would have no chance to adopt a budget or to bring about policy changes if they were defeated, some of their statements today were seen as positioning themselves for possible defeat.
Some Western diplomats thought the new Defense Minister's pledge to step up military outlays and to give new powers to troops in Indian-held Kashmir had a ring of electioneering about them.
Finance Minister Singh has said that the Government, if it survives, will have to find ways of curbing the "profligacy" in public spending. The remark was one of several that impressed the Indian financial markets, which had been wary of losing the Congress Party Finance Minister, Manmohan Singh, regarded as the architect of recent economic change. Against expectations, the Bombay stock market, after falling on the inconclusive election results, has rebounded on the Vajpayee Government's appointment, and the rupee has also steadied.
In their remarks on foreign investment, the new Finance and Industry Ministers marked their distance from the previous stand of the nationalists, who led attacks last year on two prominent American ventures, a chain of Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets and a $2.8 billion power plant being built by the Enron Corporation south of Bombay.
Today, about the only condition the two ministers set was that investment projects should jibe with India's priorities, like power projects and telecommunications, and in high technology generally.

HEADLINE: Christopher Says He Seeks Regular Talks With China

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
While China and the United States threaten to impose trade sanctions on each other, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, speaking in New York yesterday, called for regular summit meetings between the countries and frequent Cabinet-level exchanges to keep relations from drifting from one crisis to another.
Mr. Christopher, addressing a combined audience of several foreign policy organizations, said that "even in the darkest days of the cold war," there had been regular high-level meetings between Soviet and American counterparts. 
 "Given the range of our interests, and the importance of China to our future security and well-being, I believe the time has come to develop a more regular dialogue between our two countries," he said. "Holding periodic Cabinet-level consultations in our capitals would facilitate a candid exchange of views, provide a more effective means for managing specific problems, and allow us to approach individual issues within the broader strategic framework of our overall relationship."
Mr. Christopher said he would raise the issues of more regular consultations in talks with China's Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, when they meet in July in Jakarta, Indonesia.
Bob Dole, who is expected to be the Republican challenger for the Presidency in November, charged in a speech last week in Washington devoted to the American role in Asia that President Clinton was "lacking a strategic policy toward China."
"The bottom line is that American credibility in Asia is low and still declining," Mr. Dole said. Mr. Christopher's speech was in some ways a reply to those charges, although it focused solely on China and, by extension, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
The Secretary of State pointedly called for a bipartisan consensus on dealing with China, something he said the United States had maintained since 1972, when Washington and Beijing opened diplomatic ties.
In recent months, the Clinton Administration has sent mixed signals to Beijing. It has threatened to impose 100 percent tariffs on up to $3 billion in Chinese exports to the United States annually, starting next month. The sanctions were proposed to punish China for the continuing piracy of software, compact disks and other "intellectual property."
Almost at the same time, Washington chose not to punish Beijing for selling nuclear-related equipment to Pakistan.
But the Administration has rejected calls from Congress and human rights groups to use trade sanctions to retaliate for human rights abuses, especially after the United States and Europe lost a fight to have China censured by the United Nations Human Rights Commission.
In a speech that was generally conciliatory in tone, Mr. Christopher ranged over all major issues in United States-China relations and reiterated the Administration's belief that Beijing's most-favored-nation trade status should be renewed. Mr. Clinton is expected to notify Congress of his position as early as next week. A lively debate is expected.
Mr. Christopher said the debate over China's trade status "should not be a referendum on China's current political system or on whether we approve of the policies of the Chinese leadership." He also said revoking China's favorable trade status or granting it conditionally would not advance human rights in China.
"Demonizing China is as dangerously misleading as romanticizing it would be," he said.
The Secretary of State, who has visited China only once in more than three years but who has had 13 meetings with Mr. Qian, stressed the importance of American participation in the phenomenal economic growth of China, a message that companies with substantial financial interests in China like to hear.
He told the audience from the Asia Society, the Council on Foreign Relations and the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that American trade with Asia had doubled since 1990.
"China can tip the balance in Asia between stability and conflict," he said. "Its booming economy holds a key to Asia's continued prosperity and, increasingly, to our own."

HEADLINE: Import Surge Raises Deficit In U.S. Trade

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
The nation's trade deficit widened in March as imports climbed to a record while the 17-day strike against the General Motors Corporation contributed to a small decline in exports, the Commerce Department reported today.
At $8.9 billion, the March gap was somewhat more than most analysts expected, but the figures were muddied by new methodology and mislaid documents that prevented a meaningful month-to-month comparison. 
 Nonetheless, the Clinton Administration found things about which to boast, including a narrowing of the trade imbalance for the third consecutive quarter and a shrinkage of the United States deficit with Japan, which was for the sixth consecutive month lower than it was in the comparable 1995 period.
"The trend is absolutely clear here," Mickey Kantor, the Commerce Secretary, said in reference to the imbalance with Japan. He said the progressively lower deficit, which came to $4.1 billion in March, reflected "a combination of factors," including the 1995 automotive agreement in which the United States sought to expand its penetration of the Japanese market.
As for China, which the Administration threatened this week with what would be the strongest sanctions ever imposed by this country, today's figures did nothing to enhance Washington's bargaining position. In March, the deficit shrank $600 million, to $1.8 billion, which was even with March 1995. It was the second consecutive monthly decline.
Washington said that it would impose 100 percent tariffs on electronics and textiles on June 17 if Beijing failed to close factories pirating American computer software and music. When asked whether China might seek to rush related goods into the United States before the deadline, Mr. Kantor essentially repeated an earlier assertion that he remained cautious about prospects for improved trade relations with China.
In New York, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the United States would have no choice other than to carry out the sanctions if China did not sharply curtail the copying of American goods. But he added that the sanctions should meanwhile be regarded "as a step that could lead to a successful outcome."
Over all, today's Commerce Department tally showed that imports rose 1.7 percent, to a peak $77.7 billion in March, while exports eased eight-tenths of 1 percent, to $68.8 billion.
But the comparisons were misleading, analysts said, because a new Government method of processing numbers swelled February exports, many of which would have been recorded for March under the old process, by $750 million. Another $350 million was added to February exports upon receipt of boxes of documents whose delivery from Chicago had been stalled because of neglect by a freight-forwarder.
As a result, the department revised the February deficit to $7 billion -- $1.2 billion below the level first reported in late April.
While no new trend was discerned in monthly numbers today, analysts noted that over the last six months activity has slackened on both sides of the trade equation. "Growth in both imports and exports has slowed dramatically," Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis economic consultant whose namesake principal has been nominated to the Federal Reserve Board, told its clients.
Carol A. Stone, senior economist at Nomura Securities International in New York, came to a similar conclusion while predicting that today's figures could cause gross domestic product for the first quarter, initially estimated at a 2.8 percent pace, to be revised upward to perhaps 3 percent.
The trade report also showed that the United States had a rare, albeit small, surplus in March with the four newly industrialized regions of the Far East -- Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan -- in contrast with an $815 million deficit in February.
Mr. Kantor also pointed out that United States exports to Mexico -- first quarter of 1996 compared with the first quarter of 1995 -- climbed slightly faster than imports from Mexico, for the first time since late 1994, when Mexico suffered a peso crisis.
The nation's bill for imported crude oil and other petroleum products in March climbed 8.4 percent, to $4.3 billion, from February mainly because of sharply higher prices. Volume rose 2.2 percent.
Also in March, trade in advanced technology products generated a $2.6 billion surplus for the United States, up from $1.9 billion in February and the largest since March 1994. This account had tumbled into a deficit last September and October before rebounding strongly.

HEADLINE: What Companies Can Do

 BODY:
President Clinton deserves credit for what he did not say during this week's White House seminar on corporate responsibility. With polls registering high levels of anxiety over job security and stagnant wages, politicians are drawn to blaming managers. Some criticism is surely deserved, but corporation-bashing is no answer for everything that ails the economy.
Mr. Clinton resisted the temptation to pick on easy targets or embrace reckless policy prescriptions. Instead, the daylong gathering of about 100 C.E.O.'s spotlighted companies that have treated their employees generously and also found ways to earn handsome profits. The White House's purpose was to praise "family-friendly" practices in the hope that other companies would emulate them. Starbucks, a chain of retail coffee outlets, provides health insurance even to its part-time employees. Fel-Pro, a maker of auto parts, provides employees flexible work schedules, day care and profit sharing. Other companies were applauded for providing on-site training and education benefits. 
 These businesses are not engaged in charity. Nor is it obvious that they should be. Money that managers spend on fringe benefits could have been returned to shareholders (in dividends), consumers (in lower prices) or workers (in higher wages). What the executives argued was that generosity can be smart business. Pensions, child care and profit-sharing arrangements can help cut down costly turnover and create a loyal, productive work force.
Prominent Democrats have called for tax subsidies to reward companies that train workers and avoid layoffs. But Mr. Clinton's economic advisers wisely fought off such ideas. No one knows exactly what a company's work force should be or how to design subsidies so they do not become corporate boondoggles.
The seminar participants largely ignored the subjects of job security and low wages. They focused on issues like health coverage, pension rights and child care, which business and public policy can usefully address. The White House is more than a little naive in hoping that a daylong gabfest will encourage large numbers of companies to emulate the role models Mr. Clinton gathered together. But by focusing on businesses that are doing something right for their employees, he has found a way to touch base with anxious workers without engaging in destructive name-calling.

HEADLINE: 6.83% Yield As Prices Rise On Treasuries

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO 

 BODY:
Reports showing a wider United States trade deficit and weaker consumer sentiment eased fears of an overheating economy yesterday and sent Treasury prices sharply higher.
With the exception of the shorter- maturity bills, longer-term Treasury securities surged and recouped the previous day's losses, which came on a surprisingly strong housing report. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond climbed a full point, to a 8915/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.83 percent, from 6.91 percent on Thursday. For bondholders, the rise in prices yesterday meant a gain of $10 for every $1,000 invested.
Bond prices rose in early trading after the Commerce Department reported the United States trade deficit widened to $8.9 billion in March from $7 billion in February. It was more than the $8.2 billion many economists had expected.
"The report," said Anthony Chan, vice president and chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers in Columbus, Ohio, "is consistent with moderate economic growth, and that's encouraging."
Traders said the market received a further push from the university of Michigan consumer sentiment survey for May. The preliminary reading was 89.9, compared with the average forecast of 93.8 and last month's reading of 92.7, traders said. The current-conditions index was at 104.7, compared with 107.8 in April, and the expectations index was at 80.5, compared with 83 in April, traders said. The university's report is issued only to paying subscribers.
Yesterday's reports did not change the expectations of most market participants that the Federal Reserve would leave interest rates unchanged when its policy-making group, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets on Tuesday.
"All the data to date have failed to make a good case for either an easing or a tightening at the next F.O.M.C. meeting that will take place next Tuesday," Mr. Chan said. "Consequently, given the political ramification of any action, the Fed is likely to remain on the sidelines until the data point in a clearer manner mostly in one direction."
The Treasury market, which was weighed down on Thursday by concerns over a flood of new corporate supply, in particular the Lockheed Martin Corporation's $3.5 billion offering, was bolstered yesterday as the Lockheed bonds traded well.
In fact, the longer maturities of the Lockheed issue outperformed expectations, with the spread between Treasury securities and Lockheed's debt tightening a couple of basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point.
The 20-year corporate bonds were initially priced with a spread of 72 basis points to the Treasury. Yesterday the spread was 70 basis points. A 30-year maturity with an initial spread of 82 had a spread of 80 yesterday. Mike Allen, managing director and head of the North American fixed-income syndicate at UBS Securities, said credit should go to the lead underwriter, Goldman, Sachs & Company, "given the large size of the issue and how well received it was." He added, "It will probably be the benchmark issue in the corporate bond market for the next couple of months."

HEADLINE: Inflation Fighters for the Long Term

BYLINE: By John Y. Campbell and Robert J. Shiller; John Y. Campbell is a professor of applied economics at Harvard. Robert J. Shiller is a professor of economics at Yale.

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin announced on Thursday that the Government plans to issue inflation-indexed bonds -- that is, bonds whose interest and principal payments are adjusted upward for inflation, guaranteeing their real purchasing power in the future.
This is a historic moment. Economists have been advocating such bonds for many long and frustrating years. Index bonds were first called for in 1822 by the economist Joseph Lowe. In the 1870's, they were championed by the British economist William Stanley Jevons. In the early part of this century, the legendary Irving Fisher made a career of advocating them. 
 In recent decades, economists of every political stripe -- from Milton Friedman to James Tobin, Alan Blinder to Alan Greenspan -- have supported them. Yet, because there was little public clamor for such an investment, the Government never issued indexed bonds.
Let's hope this lack of interest does not continue now that they will become available. The success of the indexed bonds depends on whether the public understands them -- and buys them. Until now, inflation has made Government bonds a risky investment. In 1966, when the inflation rate was only 3 percent, if someone had bought a 30-year Government bond yielding 5 percent, he would have expected that by now his investment would be worth 180 percent of its original value. But after years of higher-than-expected inflation, the investment is worth only 85 percent of its original value.
Because inflation has been modest in recent years, many people today are not worried about how it will affect their savings. This complacency is dangerous: Even a low rate of inflation can seriously erode savings over long periods of time.
Imagine that you retire today with a pension invested in Treasury bonds that pay a fixed $10,000 each year, regardless of inflation. If there is no inflation, in 20 years the pension will have the same purchasing power that it does today. But if there is an inflation rate of only 3 percent per year, in 20 years your pension will be worth only $5,540 in today's dollars. Five percent inflation over 20 years will cut your purchasing power to $3,770, and 10 percent will reduce it to a pitiful $1,490. Which of these scenarios is likely? No one knows. Inflation ultimately depends on the people who are elected and appointed as guardians of our money supply.
At a time when Americans are living longer and planning for several decades of retirement, the insidious effects of inflation should be of serious concern. For this reason alone, the creation of inflation-indexed bonds, with their guarantee of a safe return over long periods of time, is a welcome development.
No other investment offers this kind of safety. Conventional Government bonds make payments that are fixed in dollar terms; but investors should be concerned about purchasing power, not about the number of dollars they receive. Money market funds make dollar payments that increase with inflation to some degree, since short-term interest rates tend to rise with inflation. But many other factors also influence interest rates, so the real income from a money market fund is not secure.
The stock market offers a high rate of return on average, but it can fall as well as rise. Investors should remember the bear market of the 1970's as well as the bull market of the 1980's and 1990's.
Inflation-indexed Government bonds have been issued in Britain for 15 years, in Canada for five years and in many other countries, including Australia, New Zealand and Sweden. In Britain, which has the world's largest indexed-bond market, the bonds have offered a yield 3 to 4 percent higher than the rate of inflation. In the United States, a safe long-term return of this sort should make indexed bonds an important part of retirement savings.
We expect that financial institutions will take advantage of the new inflation-indexed bonds and offer innovative new products. Indexed-bond funds will probably appear first, but indexed annuities and even indexed mortgages -- monthly payments would be adjusted for inflation -- should also become available.
Although the Clinton Administration may not get much credit for it today, the decision to issue inflation-indexed bonds is an accomplishment that historians decades hence will single out for special recognition.

HEADLINE: Bobbing and Weaving on Issue of Layoffs

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
It was two days before the White House was to convene its long-awaited conference this week on corporate responsibility, and Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich was warming to the theme. Increased political and media pressure recently placed on corporate executives over layoffs, he argued, had forced managers to think twice about downsizing their work forces.
"Up until five months ago, it was common for C.E.O.'s to proudly proclaim to Wall Street their intentions to ax thousands if not tens of thousands of workers," Mr. Reich said in an interview. "In the last month, the announcements have been markedly different. C.E.O.'s have been reassuring Main Street that there will be few if any job losses." 
 That has indeed been the case for a few companies. But only minutes after Mr. Reich spoke, Conagra Inc., a big food processing company, announced that it was laying off 6,500 workers. Its stock rose sharply on the news.
And that was just another reminder why the Clinton Administration is increasingly taking the position that corporate layoffs are an inevitable part of today's fast-changing, globally competitive economy.
In the view of the Administration and several business executives that does not mean there are no steps that can be taken to address the throbbing anxieties of workers. Indeed at the conference on Thursday they suggested several -- from making it easier to keep health and retirement benefits when moving from job to job to increased corporate support for child care to better on-the-job training.
But heading into the Presidential campaign, White House officials have clearly concluded that it makes little political sense to rail against corporate downsizing when they have little to offer as Government solutions beyond vague assertions that the economy needs to grow faster. Moreover, Mr. Clinton's advisers are reluctant to do anything that might distract from the White House's pronouncements that the United States is the world's best job-producing machine and that Mr. Clinton has met his vow to preside over an economy that added at least eight million jobs during his first term.
That approach was evident at Thursday's daylong series of meetings between President Clinton and business leaders on corporate responsibility, where layoffs were a subtext for the discussions rather than the focus.
Instead, the theme of the conference, both on the part of the President and most of the nearly 100 business executives who attended, revolved around how Government and corporations should help prepare workers to deal with the reality that their jobs might one day disappear. The dominant idea was "employability" -- the concept that lifetime employment is outdated and that instead workers should have the training, skills and flexibility both to succeed in their current jobs and to find another when that job disappears.
"There are some things we have to do to help people become more employable, even if they don't have specific job security, in terms of improving access to educational benefits and creating greater portability for health care and retirement," Mr. Clinton said. "We know that the Government should do these things, but we also know that most of the action has to be in the private sector."
John Snow, the chairman of the CSX Corporation and the chairman of the Business Roundtable, took much the same view after the meeting.
"We must start with the reality that corporations cannot guarantee anyone a lifetime job any more than corporations have a guarantee of immortality," Mr. Snow said. "The challenge for corporate America is to maintain its competitiveness and in the process help employees prepare themselves for whatever changes lie ahead in this constantly changing world."
Indeed, the political risks of arguing that Government policy or even adept use of the bully pulpit can be effective in holding back the tide of revampings and downsizings hit home again at the White House corporate responsibility conference. For in the midst of the discussions, the Donnelly Corporation -- whose chief executive, Dwane Baumgardner, was in attendance -- announced that it was closing a plant in Tennessee that makes windows and sun roofs for cars, putting as many as 95 jobs at risk. Elsewhere, the Phelps Tool and Die Company of Kansas City announced that it was laying off 150 of its 580 employees because of increased foreign competition.
In fact, to the extent that there were any awkward questions raised about the inevitability of layoffs, they came not from the politicians or the handful of labor leaders who attended, but from two of the chief executives in attendance, Donald F. Hastings of the Cleveland-based Lincoln Electric Company, and Gerald Greenwald of the UAL Corporation, the employee-owned parent of United Airlines. Both companies have no-layoff policies.
"Everyone -- this audience, the Administration -- is assuming that layoffs are inevitable," Mr. Hastings said. "Thinking ahead and having creative solutions for when there is a downturn is what management is all about."
And Mr. Greenwald chided his fellow executives not to reach for the layoff weapon before exploring other alternatives. "Don't we have a responsibility," he asked, "to use attrition long before we think of buyouts and certainly before we think of layoffs?"
Still, for all the recognition on the part of the attendees that job insecurity is an inherent feature of a dynamic economy, the conference also reflected a growing awareness on the part of corporate chieftains that they had to do something else to deal with the anxieties of their workers. And by doing so, several executives argued, corporations would receive a tangible payoff in greater productivity, enhanced loyalty and higher profits.
Kenneth Lehman, the co-chief executive of Fel-Pro Inc., an auto components maker in Skokie, Ill., described how his company's generous benefits -- including heavily subsidized health insurance, on-site child care, an eight-week summer camp and automatic $3,500 college scholarships for children of employees -- added 70 cents an hour an employee to the company's cost. But those added benefits represented less than 10 percent of Fel-Pro's total benefit costs, and they more than paid for themselves, he said.
"We feel our benefits enhance our products," Mr. Lehman said, "and as long as our bottom line confirms this we will keep doing it."

HEADLINE: Dow Stocks Soar 52.45, Short of High

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks soared yesterday but ended just shy of a high, while the Nasdaq composite index set another record as Wall Street was soothed by new consumer data showing the economy appeared to be plodding along and not about to overheat.
"It's just a frenzy to own stocks," said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Company. "We're seeing a sellers' strike from those who own stocks and are afraid to sell for fear stocks will go higher." 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 52.45 points at 5,687.50, just shy of its closing high of 5,689.74 set on April 3. An afternoon rally stopped at 5,698.58, unable to break through the psychological barrier of 5,700 points. For the week, the Dow was up 169.36 points.
In the broader market, advancing issues led declines, 1,469 to 869, in active trading of 429.1 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
The Nasdaq Composite gained 2.57 points, closing at a high of 1,241.88. Highs were also set by the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, up 4.06, to 668.91; the American Stock Exchange index, up 2.48, to 605.21, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks, which rose 2.37, to 358.78.
Analysts said Wall Street toasted a survey of the nation's consumers that appeared to bolster the argument that the economy was not growing fast enough to require the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. The University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for May fell to 89.9 from 92.7 in April, analysts said.
"The numbers showed a drop in consumer sentiment, and anything that's bad news is good for bonds," said Hildegard Zagorski, analyst at Prudential Securities. "It's like all the other numbers. It suggests we are on a slow growth path."
The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond gained a full point, to 8915/32 , sending its yield down to 6.83 percent, from 6.91 percent on Thursday.
Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management, said: "It's the best of all possible worlds for stocks -- low rates and good, strong corporate earnings growth. The record mutual fund money is fueling the recent surge."
Mr. Metz remained cautious, despite the market's recent surge. Just last week the Dow industrials fell below the key support level of 5,400, and yesterday the average backed off after flirting with 5,700 points.
"The stampede higher is occurring as fundamentals are getting worse rather than better," he said.
Mr. Metz also said that investors' "tendency to look for hot stocks in small caps on the O.T.C. market is symptomatic of an aging bull market -- the frenzy before reality sets in."
Among the most active issues on the Big Board, was Brazil's telecommunications company Telebras, which rose 1417/64 , to 59 1/8, on stronger-than-expected earnings.
Hewlett-Packard rose 4 1/8, to 109 3/8, rebounding from its 8 1/2-point fall on Thursday when it posted earnings at the low end of analysts' forecasts. Hewlett-Packard announced a 2-for-1 stock split yesterday and a 20 percent increase in its quarterly dividend.
DSC Communications lost 3 1/2, to 31 3/4, after Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities downgraded the stock.
Autodesk slumped 4 3/4, to 35 3/4, on news that its earnings shrank during the last quarter.
Urocor, a provider of diagnostic services, jumped 6, to 17, in its first day of trading.
In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 230.61 points, or 1.04 percent, yesterday, to 21,916.60. For the week, it gained 2.3 percent.

Dow Average Climbs 52.45, As Nasdaq Sets a Record
Blue-chip stocks soared but ended just shy of a new high, closing up 52.45 points at 5,687.50, while the Nasdaq composite index set another record, gaining 2.57 points, to close at 1,242.88. Wall Street was soothed by new consumer data showing the economy was just plodding along, not about to overheat.
Analysts said investors were in a frenzy to own stocks, but some cautioned that the bull market could be entering a dubious speculative phase. [Page 35.]
 
The credit markets also rallied with the 30-year Treasury bond gaining a full point, to 8915/32 , sending its yield down to 6.83 percent, from 6.91 percent on Thursday. [41.]
 
Supercomputer to Be Purchased In Japan Rather Than in U.S.
The Government announced that the National Science Foundation planned to buy a supercomputer for atmospheric research from NEC. It was the first such purchase from a Japanese company and had been closely watched both as an indicator of United States trade policies and as a measure of the competitive strength of the embattled American supercomputer industry. [1.]
 
Rates Seen as Remaining Stable
Economists say the Federal Reserve is likely to leave short-term interest rates at current levels when its policy-making body meets on Tuesday. The Fed may also choose to leave rates unchanged at its subsequent policy meeting in July. Why? Inflation is under control despite low unemployment. And economic growth has been revived. [32.]
 
Mexican Economy's Mixed Results
 
The Mexican Government reported that the economy contracted by just one percentage point in the first quarter of 1996, compared with last year's first quarter, a far stronger performance than either the Government or private economists had expected. The news sparked a rally in the stock market, which rose 1.03 percent, but it masked an underlying weakness that has left the average Mexican unable to afford anything but food. [32.]
 
Sale of Biogen Drug Is Approved
Biogen received approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin marketing Avonex, its genetically engineered drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Avonex is the first drug shown in clinical trials actually to slow the progression of relapsing multiple sclerosis, a degenerative nerve disease that frequently disables sufferers. [33.]
 
Disney Contests Katzenberg Claim
Walt Disney contended that Jeffrey Katzenberg, its former studio chief, was well aware of the financial consequences of leaving the company and should not receive the $250 million in damages he has sought. Mr. Katzenberg, who quit in 1994, filed a breach of contract suit last month, accusing Disney of failing to pay him enough for blockbuster movies like "The Lion King" and "Beauty and the Beast." [33.]
 
Sale of WNYC Is Cleared
The Government cleared the way for New York City to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to ITT and Dow Jones. The companies plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation on the channel that now carries programming like "Eye on Asia" and "Haitian Programming." The ruling was seen as a significant relief to Mayor Giuliani, whose proposed budget for the coming fiscal year relies on $207 million from the sale to help close a budget gap. [23.]
 
WB Network Develops Cable Box
The WB Television Network has developed a technology that could allow it to expand through small cable systems. Since its start 16 months ago, the network has had trouble competing with other broadcast networks because of limited distribution. Gerald M. Levin, chairman of the parent, Time Warner, said the technology, called "network in a box," gave him new optimism about WB. [33.]
 
F.A.A. Cites Valujet Safety Flaws
The F.A.A. said that Valujet airlines had been beset by safety problems in the months before the fatal Florida Everglades crash and that in investigating those problems the agency had discovered deep flaws in its own monitoring of the airline. It maintained, however, that the airline is safe. [7.]

HEADLINE: Federal Aid For Renewal Is Endangered

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
Eighteen months after the Federal Government announced with great fanfare that it was providing $100 million to help revitalize Harlem and parts of the South Bronx, the redevelopment proposal is being threatened by a bitter dispute between city and state officials.
The dispute, which comes at a time of unusual tension between the economic advisers to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki, is over who will exert the most control over the board that decides which businesses and programs will receive the benefits of an economic Empowerment Zone that the Federal Government agreed to establish in 1994. 
 After an intense competition among big cities, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development selected Harlem and the South Bronx as one of six urban Empowerment Zones around the country to receive $100 million in Federal support. With the city, state and Federal government pledging equal contributions, $300 million was to be made available over 10 years for grants and loans to business, job training and other economic incentives.
But the program has been troubled, with barriers erected by both the city and state, and yesterday the Federal Government said it would withdraw its $100 million commitment unless aides to the Mayor and Governor came to terms.
"At some point, you have to conclude that the city and state just don't want to do this," said Andrew Cuomo, an assistant secretary of Housing and Urban Development, "and we are very close to that point."
The sticking point, which appeared this week to be intractable, was a demand by the chief economic deputy to Mayor Giuliani for a change in the rules that will govern the zone's board of directors, even before the zone is formed.
While New York's efforts to establish the zone have made little progress, officials say the five other cities selected under the program have quickly launched their programs and have begun to receive Federal subsidies.
"I would think this is an embarrassment for New York, and I know it is a tragedy for people living in some of its poorest communities," Mr. Cuomo said.
While the political rivalry between the city and state is clearly a factor, some Federal officials speculate that the standoff reflects an even deeper conflict of political will. That is because the empowerment-zone program is administered by a Democratic administration in Washington and was brought to New York largely through the efforts of the former Democratic administrations at City Hall and in Albany, as well as of Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat.
"I see something Machiavellian going on here," said a high-ranking Federal official who has negotiated with the city and state and who spoke on condition of anonymity. "Nobody will actually say they want to walk away from a big Federal commitment, but do the Mayor and Governor really want to match it with $100 million for Democratic neighborhoods where they won't win many votes?"
The top economic officials for both the city and the state said they wanted the empowerment zone to succeed, but were standing on principle to insure that both the Governor and the Mayor maintained equitable influence over the program.
"I'm not about to sacrifice the interest of New York City," said Fran Reiter, Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, who has borne the biggest brunt of recent criticism for slowing down the actual creation of the zone.
Civic leaders in Harlem and the South Bronx are seething.
"I am furious," said the Rev. Calvin Butts 3d, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who is planning a job-training and counseling center that would be paid for by the empowerment zone subsidies and by money from several Manhattan bankers and business executives.
"People are working with us, they have confidence in Harlem and they are ready to go," he said. "But I'm almost to the point where I would walk away myself rather than lose any more credibility."
Representative Rangel, whose Congressional district includes Harlem and the South Bronx, and who was one of the strongest advocates of the Empowerment Zone designation, said yesterday that the program was being "sabotaged."
"The money is there, waiting to be spent, and it is just being tied up for political reasons," he said. "It sure is dumb."
Federal officials said both the city and state bore responsibility for creating snags. Mr. Cuomo said he had expected financing for the zone to be "front-loaded," meaning that the flow of government subsidies would be at their highest levels during the first few years of the program.
But both the city and state resisted that approach, he said, with Governor Pataki imposing the biggest barriers last year. The state did not agree to any financial contributions until January, when all sides agreed to make $6 million contributions -- a total of $18 million -- during the first year.
Since then, the main dispute has shifted to how the zone will be governed. According to preliminary rules agreed to in January, the zone's board is to be chaired during its first year by the designee of Mayor Giuliani, and the chairmanship will switch each year between a city and state appointee.
But that means that the zone's board, even before the zone is formed, is controlled by Ms. Reiter, who has engaged in a bitter conflict with state officials over control of the board of the Hudson River Park Conservancy.
Even though Ms. Reiter controls the empowerment zone's board, she fears that the bylaws make it too easy for the representatives of New York State to increase its control by removing a representative they oppose. She insists that the bylaws be rewritten to require a two-thirds majority vote to oust any member. "I am adamant," said Ms. Reiter, who said she was refusing to call a meeting of the empowerment zone's board unless the state accepted her demand that its rules be changed.
Until she calls a meeting, the empowerment zone will receive no government support. Indeed, Ms. Reiter said, the city has already taken back $3 million -- half its original commitment for the program's first year -- to be used in other municipal programs.
Ms. Reiter's counterpart in New York State is Charles Gargano, chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation. In an interview, he said he would not accede to Ms. Reiter's demand, but instead proposed that she call a board meeting, allow government subsidies to begin flowing into the zone and then haggle over board procedures.
"We are being held up by minutiae that can be worked out later," said Mr. Gargano. "People at City Hall are entitled to personal feelings, but they shouldn't stand in the way of something as important as this."
He said he knew of no way the empowerment zone program could be salvaged, complete with its commitment of $100 million in Federal funds, unless the standoff with Ms. Reiter was resolved quickly.
"We are exploring ways to make the money the state has committed available, even without participation from the city," he said.
But Mr. Gargano added that the approach would probably dissolve the original triumvirate of city, state and Federal government envisioned for the program, and "we couldn't be sure that the Federal money would still be there."

HEADLINE: Steady Rate Policy Is Seen At Fed's Tuesday Meeting

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17

 BODY:
With inflation under control despite low unemployment and a revival in economic growth, the Federal Reserve is almost certain to leave short-term interest rates at current levels when its policy-making body meets on Tuesday, economists say.
The lack of upward pressure on prices and wages could also persuade the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its subsequent policy meeting in July, the economists say, despite forecasts that growth in the second quarter is likely to accelerate from the unexpectedly robust 2.8 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year. 
 "The Fed is generally reluctant to stray far from the Main Street view of the economy," said David C. Munro, the chief domestic economist at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm. That view, he said, is of an economy that is "prosperous but not booming, with remarkably little in the way of price pressures."
Salomon Brothers told its clients today that the Fed would probably hold rates steady next week, "reflecting relative contentment with the present economic and inflation backdrop."
But the outlook for the rest of the year remains extremely unsettled, analysts said. While the current debate is whether the Fed will have to raise rates at some point, there is also the possibility that an expected economic slowdown this fall might provide an opening for the arguments of those business executives, economists and politicians who contend that Fed policy is too tight. A rate cut, these people say, would bring stronger growth with little risk of inflation.
The last time the Fed acted -- it reduced the Federal funds rate by a quarter-point, to 5.25 percent, in late January -- the central bankers apparently failed to anticipate the strength of the first-quarter rebound in growth. Those signs of strength produced a sharp run-up in long-term interest rates this year and rekindled fears, so far unfulfilled, of greater inflation.
The Fed's actions will come under even greater scrutiny than usual in coming months. Not only will the Presidential campaign leave the Fed open to being second-guessed in an intensely partisan atmosphere, but the renomination of Alan Greenspan as Fed chairman is being held up by Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, a Democrat.
Mr. Harkin, who contends that Mr. Greenspan is sacrificing economic growth to an overemphasis on stamping out inflation, is holding out for an agreement by the Republican leadership to allow a full Senate debate on monetary policy and a recorded vote, rather than the planned voice vote, on a third four-year term for Mr. Greenspan. Mr. Greenspan's nomination is expected to be approved by a wide margin once it comes to a vote, and he continues to serve in an acting capacity until then.
The holdup has also frozen the nomination by President Clinton of two new Fed members: Alice M. Rivlin, currently the Administration's budget chief, and Laurence H. Meyer, an economic forecaster. They will not take office until confirmed.
Amid the debate over the Fed's role, there are also growing pleas from the business community for the Fed to consider that growth may not be as robust as it seems.
In a survey by the Business Council, a group of chief executives from 100 of the nation's largest corporations, nearly half the respondents said it was harder to raise prices in their industry than it was six months ago, and only 9 percent said it was easier. Many said their own sales figures did not reflect any significant economic quickening.
Almost half the respondents urged the Fed to stimulate the economy by cutting rates. "There is absolutely no inflation," said John F. Welch Jr., the chairman of the General Electric Company.
"We don't see industrial prices or labor pressures" driving inflation upward, Mr. Welch said.
Edgar S. Woolard Jr., the chairman of the Du Pont Company, said the Fed should hold rates steady at its meeting next week, but that it should then "err on the side of testing inflation" later in the year.
Fed officials have been indicating that they see no strong case for a change in short-term interest rates, barring some new evidence of overheating.
"I don't see any driving forces at this time that would take growth on a greatly accelerated path from the trend growth picture that we have been looking for for some time," a Fed governor, Edward W. Kelly Jr., said last week.
But Fed officials said they were keeping a close eye on wages, which could start rising faster if the current 5.4 percent unemployment rate dips further. They said they were also watching energy prices, which have jumped sharply in recent months but have now started leveling off, and food prices, which could be driven up by rising grain prices.
While Fed officials said they were not altering their views on inflation, they also gave some indications that they were looking into whether the economy currently has a greater capacity for noninflationary growth than the statistics may indicate. For one thing, widespread fears of job insecurity have contributed to an easing of wage demands.
"I don't think we have the same kind of inflationary psychology that we used to have," said Susan M. Phillips, a Fed governor.

HEADLINE: Smaller Is Better: Conde Nast in Times Sq.

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
In architecture, downsizing is seldom a cause for dismay. Four Times Square, a building scheduled to rise on Broadway between 42d and 43d streets, is a case in point.
The 47-story skyscraper, intended as the future home of Conde Nast Publications, is by any reckoning a big building. Still, it is only a vestige of the mammoth four-tower complex originally envisioned for Times Square. And while all four sites will be developed eventually, the impact on the cityscape will be far less catastrophic than under the earlier plan. 
 Designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee, the four-tower Times Square Center was announced with great fanfare by city and state officials in 1984. Here, at last, was the solution to that perennial problem, cleaning up Times Square. The solution was: stomp it to death.
The four towers straddled the historic intersection of Broadway, Seventh Avenue and 42d Street like a colossal elephant. The architects had tossed aside the design guidelines, drawn up to insure that the new buildings would preserve some of the district's colorful character. Instead, the plan called for four nearly identical towers, sporting paste-on pilasters at the base and sloping mansard roofs.
The frivolity of the design was galling. This was a time in which city planning was rapidly devolving into a rubber stamp for real estate developers. With the fiscal crisis of the 1970's still fresh in memory, the city's economic recovery was staked to a vibrant real estate market. Common wisdom held that large-scale urban development could not proceed without financial concessions from the public sector.
As it turned out, however, development in Times Square exploded in the 1980's without direct government support, even as Times Square Center was bogged down in 47 lawsuits.
A change in city zoning, made to shift new development to the west side of midtown, encouraged the proliferation of new skyscrapers all along Broadway. Times Square Center came to symbolize the public sector's abandonment of the public interest. When the project was halted in 1992, making way for the interim mix of shops, theaters and restaurants now taking shape on 42d Street, it was like a belated recognition that the 1980's were finally over.
The break-up of the original four-tower complex is a result of market pressures, not city planning. Even so, it is a welcome development. Visual diversity has always been one of the hallmarks of Times Square. The incremental development of the four sites will help to preserve that character.
The expected relocation of Conde Nast to 4 Times Square is also good news. The main weakness of "the New 42d Street," the revitalization plan being developed under city and state auspices, is that it places too much emphasis on the consumption of popular culture, not enough on its production. The relocation of Conde Nast will reinforce Times Square's identity as a place where the makers and consumers of popular culture rub elbows in the public realm.
Still, it's not easy to imagine the high-gloss world of Conde Nast Publications fitting seamlessly into the raffish milieu of Times Square. Can Gourmet magazine flourish on a site once occupied by Nathan's hot dogs?
Perhaps it is helpful to remember that Times Square is not just a place. It is a backdrop, a colorful, iconic setting that symbolizes the round-the-clock vibrancy of New York City. Millions of tourists have seen it that way. Why shouldn't the publishers of Vogue and GQ?
Conde Nast's editors routinely dispatch photographers and models to fabulous beaches, glittering cities, stretches of photogenic desert terrain. But 42d Street and Broadway may be the most exotic location they have ever encountered.
The design of the new headquarters, by the New York firm of Fox & Fowle, should go far toward easing the trauma of relocation. Though the design was largely completed before Conde Nast decided to be the building's main tenant, it looks custom-made for a company whose stock in trade is the knowing mix of high style and popular culture.
This is a zippy collage of a building: part billboard, part corporate tower, a layered slab of masonry, glass, and electric light. It excels as a piece of urban theater, with a cluster of neon signs at the base and an eruption of high technology hardware popping out of the top.
The tower's architects have enjoyed a major advantage over the designers of earlier schemes for this site. The Durst Organization, the new building's developer, also owns two adjacent properties. By combining them into a single parcel, the architects have been able to introduce setbacks into the design. Instead of a sheer, scaleless slab, the tower's modulated profile will echo midtown's jagged skyline.
Four Times Square is still a tall building, with its height roughly matching the fin-topped tower at 1515 Broadway (between 44th and 45th streets). But it is not monstrously out of scale with the parade of new towers that have arisen on Broadway in recent years.
The tailoring of form to context is one of the strengths of buildings designed by Fox & Fowle. That talent gets quite a workout here, in a design that tries to relate the building to bright lights of Broadway and the masonry cliff bordering nearby Bryant Park.
The core of the building is a shaft of pale green glass, elegantly scored by steel window mullions. On two sides of the building, the shaft is partly sheathed by facades of gray granite, designed to bring a corporate look to the main entrance on 42d Street. The sides facing north and west are wrapped with shallow setbacks, faced with glass. Like the stone facades, these are designed to integrate the shaft into Times Square's mix of low, medium and high-rise buildings.
The street level on the Broadway side will be devoted to shops. The architects have already accommodated the area's special zoning requirement for blockbuster signs. A 10-story cylinder, containing offices, will be cantilevered over the northwest corner. Properly outfitted with neon, the cylinder will make a dandy giant soda can, film spool, aerosol spray, or a current issue of House and Garden, rolled up for swatting pushy street photographers or flies.
A metal grid on the Broadway side will permit a mix of advertising gimmicks, including video and electronic screens. But the most dramatic advertising display will occur at the tower's crown, where four huge square panels loom out over the midtown cityscape. The structure anticipates the installation of satellite dishes and other high technology devices.
The details of 4 Times Square are still being refined. In a recent version, the cornice lines of the glass setbacks were overdesigned. Rows of protruding metal fins grate against the elegant green-silver skin of the building's central shaft. But, on the whole, the design is a good example of corporate, building-skin architecture.
Unlike recent projects by Richard Rogers and Jean Nouvel, this extroverted project does not rethink the tall office tower from the inside out. Yet it should make a fine home for a corporation built on the mesmerizing power of surfaces.

HEADLINE: Vote in Dominican Republic Forces a Runoff by 2 Leftists

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic, May 17

 BODY:
The first round of balloting in a watershed presidential election here has ended with none of the three major parties winning a majority, forcing what promises to be a contentious runoff next month between two left-of-center candidates.
Nearly complete official results announced late tonight by the Central Elections Board showed Jose Francisco Pena Gomez of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, who is making his third attempt to win the presidency of this Caribbean nation, with just under 46 percent of the vote. Mr. Pena Gomez, 59, a former mayor of the capital, is one of the best-known leaders of the Latin American wing of the Socialist International. 
 In the second round, scheduled for June 30, Mr. Pena Gomez will face Leonel Fernandez of the Dominican Liberation Party, who won 39 percent of the vote. A 42-year-old lawyer who went to elementary and high school on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, Mr. Fernandez is the political protege and heir of the leftist firebrand Juan Bosch, but has worked to move the party toward a more centrist position.
At a news conference this morning, Mr. Pena Gomez said he considered himself "virtually the President of the republic" on the basis of his strong showing. "We have won a resounding victory," he proclaimed, arguing that he could lose only if "acts of magic" were directed against him.
In private, however, some of his advisers were more circumspect. "We haven't won the World Series yet, only the playoffs," one said.
The cause of their concern lies in the same polls, conducted by the Gallup Organization for the news magazine Rumbo, that correctly predicted Mr. Pena Gomez's margin of victory in Thursday's vote. Those soundings show that if a second round were to be held immediately, Mr. Fernandez would be the victor, winning 52 percent of the vote.
Even before the vote, there were numerous signs of a tacit alliance between Mr. Fernandez and Joaquin Balaguer, the country's 89-year-old President, who is in his seventh term of office and prohibited from succeeding himself. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Balaguer systematically undermined the campaign of his own Social Christian Reform Party, which finished a weak third, with 15 percent of the vote.
Mr. Balaguer despises Mr. Pena Gomez, whose enemies always suggest his patriotism is in doubt because of his Haitian ancestry, and is expected to do all that he can to prevent his victory. In his final campaign speech Sunday, Mr. Balaguer, in a clear slap at the front-runner, urged voters to support the candidate who was "most authentically Dominican."
Such campaigns of racial innuendo have proved successful in the past, and appeared to be influencing some voters today. "I'm for Leonel because Pena Gomez is a dangerous man," said Teodoro Mendez Reyes, a 40-year-old farm worker. "He wants to let the Haitians take over."
In interviews this week, Mr. Fernandez said that he, not Mr. Pena Gomez, was the candidate best equipped to end corruption and bring about the changes that voters have been demanding. But he also said he would welcome the support of Mr. Balaguer's followers, acknowledging that they are the key to victory.
"We will win handsomely in the second round," Mr. Fernandez said at a news conference this afternoon. The mere fact that he was able to force a second round, he added, created "a negative scenario" for Mr. Pena Gomez, who, he said, had already hit his "ceiling of support."
In contrast to past elections, international observers and all three of the major candidates agreed that there had been no fraud or intimidation and that the Central Elections Board had performed impartially. In 1994 Mr. Balaguer was declared the victor by a scant 30,000 votes, but the civil disturbances that followed forced him to agree to a new election in two years instead of four.

Celebrations and Concerns at NJN's Silver Anniversary

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Kent Manahan has been a news anchor on the New Jersey Network for 20 of the station's 25 years, and she doesn't think its mission has changed since NJN went on air in a converted bowling alley in a Trenton suburb in 1971.
"The mission has always been to inform and educate the people of New Jersey," said Ms. Manahan, who has lived in the state most of her life. "And I think that remains the mission today." What has changed is the technolog, she said. 
 Through programs devoted primarily to political, economic and cultural issues in New Jersey that out-of-state television stations ignore in favor of crime and disaster news, the state's only public broadcasting station is "one of the components helping to give New Jersey an identity," she said.
In honor of its silver anniversary, NJN has made big plans for the end of this month. They include the premiere of its documentary "Domestic Violence: Faces of Fear," narrated by Diane Sawyer, on Tuesday at 9 P.M. and a gala fund-raiser on Wednesday to honor its supporters.
But the celebrations are tempered with concern about the future. State support has been drying up and now represents only 30 percent of NJN's operating budget. Competition from commercial and cable stations is increasing, and many viewers are still unaware of NJN despite its professionalism, resulting in traditionally low ratings.
"There is a void it fills," said Prof. Cliff Zukin, who teaches political science and mass media at the Eagleton Institute of Rutgers University, "but it could fill it even more if it had the resources and could promote itself more."
In January 1969, the state Legislature passed enabling legislation, and on April 5, 1971, NJN went on the air in a Ewing Township bowling alley where rain sometimes came in through the roof. Since 1993, headquarters has been a modern, roomy five-story building on Stockton Street in Trenton, built specifically for the station.
From 1971 to fiscal year 1989, direct state support rose from $2.5 million to $10 million. By fiscal year 1995, the amount had dropped by 43 percent, to $5.7 million. This fiscal year, with an operating budget of $13 million, NJN received $4.8 million. It will lose 21 percent of that in the next fiscal year when the subsidy drops to $3.8 million.
As a result, operating hours have been cut in recent years, and five news division staff members were laid off. There are now seven full-time and two part-time reporters, although Bill Jobes, the director of news and public affairs, says he can raise the total to 16 if he counts anchors and three producers who sometimes fill in as reporters.
The 6 P.M. newscast, featuring Ms. Manahan, was cut two years ago from an hour to a half-hour. It is rebroadcast at 7:30 and 11 P.M., but on major stories the tape can be topped with live coverage.
Nevertheless, NJN, one of the leading producers of local programming in PBS, continues to increase its public affairs programming. It has expanded business coverage, added an anti-violence beat and examined the criminal justice system. Its local and state election coverage has consistently drawn high praise, and Mr. Jobes calls it "a hallmark" of NJN's programming.
"What has changed over the past 16 years I've been here," said Mr. Jobes, a veteran print and television journalist, "is that more commercial stations have shown an interest in New Jersey, but that is a valuable barometer of how you're doing." He added, "Competition is good."
More competition may be on the way. In March, a new cable station, News 12 New Jersey, started in Edison. Affiliated with The Star-Ledger of Newark, it is aiming to provide around-the-clock coverage to two-thirds of the state.
Prof. Stephen Salmore, also of the Eagleton Insitute, said NJN was hurt by its position on the dial. It appears on all New Jersey cable systems and UHF, but people seem to have trouble finding it, he said. On UHF, NJN is Channel 52 in Trenton, 23 in Camden, 58 in New Brunswick and 50 in Montclair.
Elizabeth G. Christopherson, the executive director of NJN, and chief executive of the nonprofit foundation that raises money for it, said the challenges were formidable, but that's about as negative as she gets. Using the upbeat personality that made her a successful fund-raiser as vice president for institutional advancement and public affairs at Bloomfield College and as chairwoman of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts for several years, she has helped to raise donations by 16 percent since coming to NJN in June 1994.
"We feel we've had some admirable successes in fund raising and from new revenue opportunities and some prudent fiscal management," she said in her NJN office.
Those opportunities include an arrangement she made in September to receive $4.3 million over eight years for letting the TV Food Network use its slot on Time Warner's cable system in New York City.
Another is the agreement she made in March to lease NJN's excess microwave transmission capacity to Atlantic Microsystems, which operates wireless cable television systems in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, for $3.6 million over 10 years.
And last year's NJN fund-raising dinner, only its second, brought in $400,000 and won the station a PBS national development award.
Ms. Christopherson senses that NJN is attracting more viewers. A special A. E. Nielsen survey showed that in February 1.7 million New Jersey households tuned into the news for at least a quarter-hour during the month. That's about 18 percent of the New York and Philadelphia markets.
Another gauge of success, she said, is the number of educational programs that NJN has offered to teachers and students through satellite, computer or conventional broadcast. They have ranged from adult literacy programs to working with colleges to provide a two-year degree through televised courses.
Professor Zukin said that when he conducted focus groups of occasional viewers from Bergen and Mercer counties in February, he found each was impressed with the substance of newscasts. All felt they had learned something about the state from watching NJN, he said.
"Both groups were extremely laudatory," he said. "There was nothing negative."
Professor Salmore, who praised Ms. Manahan and her colleagues as savvy New Jersey reporters, said NJN may have more clout than its ratings would indicate because it is watched by a high number of opinion-makers like politicians, teachers and students of government.
"It probably doesn't have an impact on public opinion," he said. "But it does on informed opinion."

THERE WERE ANCIENTS IN ANCIENT TIMES -- ACCORDING TO the Bible, Methuselah lived to the age of 969 -- but they were very few in number. Historically, all human societies have been dominated by the young. But that is about to change.
A new class of people is being created. For the first time in human history, Western societies will have a large group of affluent, economically inactive, elderly voters who require expensive social services like health care and who depend upon government for much of their income. It is a revolutionary class, one that is bringing down the social welfare state, destroying government finances, altering the distribution of purchasing power and threatening the investments that all societies need to make to have a successful future. 
 Expenditures on the elderly have fundamentally altered our fiscal systems. In the 1960's, governments generated what was then called the fiscal dividend. However large its deficit, a government could generate a budget surplus simply by doing nothing for a few years. Now, the opposite is true. Even with rapid economic growth and no new programs, government spending rises faster than tax revenues.
Washington budget-cutting is almost irrelevant before this tidal force. As the numbers of the elderly rise, pension costs will soar and health care spending will explode, particularly as we employ expensive new technologies to help the elderly live even longer. Draconian budget cuts like those now being proposed by the Congressional Republicans bring only a small amount of breathing room.
Back in 1900, 4 percent of America's population was over 65. Now, about 13 percent is, even before the first baby boomer retires. In many countries the percentage of the population over 65 will double by 2025; in the United States, the elderly are expected to account for at least 20 percent of the population. And America faces what might be called the double-40 whammy. On average, those over 65 receive 41 percent of their income from government. And slightly less than 40 percent (38 percent to be precise) of the elderly receive 80 percent or more of their income from government. In contrast, only 35 percent receive money from private pensions.
This enormous transfer of resources has made the elderly into one-issue voters who exercise a disproportionate impact on the political process. Already the needs and demands of the elderly have shaken the social welfare state, causing it for all practical purposes to go broke. Today, spending on entitlements plus interest payments on the national debt (most of it accumulated in recent years to make payments to the elderly) take 60 percent of total tax revenue. (Excluding interest on the national debt, half the Federal budget goes to the elderly.) By 2003 expenditures on the elderly (plus interest payments) will take 75 percent, and by 2013 they will take 100 percent, if current laws remain unchanged.
Over the past 25 years many entitlement programs have been paid for by reductions in military spending from peak Vietnam War levels. But even with the end of the cold war, there is not much room left for such shifts. Military spending is down to less than 4 percent of gross domestic product, and even if America were willing to take defense spending down to zero, the day of reckoning would be postponed by only a few years.
The elderly obviously don't want their benefits cut. The alternative is raising taxes, but the current 15 percent Social Security tax rate would have to be boosted to 40 percent by 2029 to provide the benefits that have been promised.
Not surprisingly, government spending on things other than the elderly is plummeting. Not counting expenditures on the elderly, domestic spending has fallen from 10 percent to 7 percent of G.D.P. in the last 20 years in the United States. Most important, expenditures on the elderly are squeezing government investments in infrastructure, education and research and development -- from 24 percent to 15 percent of the Federal budget in 20 years.
Spending on the elderly is no longer an issue of equity or deprivation. In 1970 the percentage of the elderly in poverty was higher than for any other part of the population. Now there are fewer poor people among the elderly than among any other group.
Adjusting for things like household size, taxes and noncash benefits like health insurance and school lunches, the elderly have a median per capita income of a whopping 67 percent above that of the population as a whole. Looking at cash income alone in the 1960's, the average 70-year-old was spending only 60 percent as much as a 30-year-old. Today that 70-year-old is spending 20 percent more. The elderly also are much wealthier than the nonelderly. Those 65 to 74 have an average net worth of $222,000 versus $66,000 for those age 35 to 44. No public interest is served by making parents rich at the cost of making children poor.
While the elderly are not the spendthrifts they are sometimes made out to be, they quite understandably are not big savers for the future. Much of the decline in personal savings rates in the United States, from about 9 percent in the decades after World War II to 3 percent in the 1990's, can be attributed to the elderly or those about to be elderly. The near elderly, confident about their pensions, are saving less than they used to right before retirement. The elderly, knowing they have monthly pension checks and health coverage, are spending more during retirement.
While all of our economic resources are not going to be given to the elderly (police and fire departments, for instance, must be financed), no one knows how the growth of entitlements for the elderly can be held in check in democratic societies. Even now, when older adults are only 13 percent of the American population, they are so powerful that no political party wants to tangle with them.
Newt Gingrich could attest to that. His supposedly revolutionary Republican Congress never even talked about cutting Social Security. It focused solely on reducing the rate of increase in Medicare expenditures while balancing the budget. Nevertheless, the Republicans were savaged in the polls as the Democrats gleefully accused them of robbing the elderly of their hard-earned benefits.
That's today. Will democratic governments be able to cut benefits when the elderly are approaching a voting majority? A panel appointed by President Clinton reported that it could not agree on any specific proposals to slow the growth of Social Security, Medicare or other Government benefit programs, even though it could agree that the current programs would raise the Government deficit eightfold by 2030 if nothing was done.
Democracy is not yet a survival-of-the-fittest species. Universal suffrage is less than 100 years old. But it is going to meet the ultimate test in the elderly. If democratic governments cannot cut benefits that go to a majority of their voters, then they have no long-term future. No other investments can be made unless those benefits are brought under control.
The political problems are not created entirely by the political power of the ever more numerous elderly. All of us will eventually become old, and all of us, especially the near elderly, would rather use our own money for the luxuries of life and let the Government pay for our necessities when we are old. Less-generous programs are ultimately less-generous programs for us and not just for them.
That holds even for the young. If the elderly have to pay more of their bills, then the young may have to pay more, or feel the guilt associated with not paying. Moreover, big bills for the elderly mean smaller inheritances.
The political message is simple. A policy of directing benefits to low-income elderly families reduces costs and improves economic efficiency by getting the money to those who need it most. But it quickly loses political support.
If one is looking for a group in need, it is not the elderly. The group with the highest proportion now in poverty is children under 18. Yet government spends nine times as much per person on the elderly (who vote) as it does on the young (who don't). Precisely the group that most needs investments if there is to be a successful American economy in the future is the group that is getting the least.
Leaving aside health care, advocates for the elderly argue that Social Security is running a surplus and, hence, needs no restructuring. But that is an illusion. If the Government is running an overall deficit, it is irrelevant if one sector has a "surplus" because it is credited with collecting more taxes than it needs. What matters is what is driving the expenditure side of the budget.
In the years ahead, class warfare is apt to be redefined as the young against the old, rather than the poor against the rich. As a young Frenchwoman said during a 1994 protest against government policies that would have lowered the wages of the young: "We have no future. That's why we're out here." In America the conflict is already clear. The elderly systematically vote against education levies when they have a chance. Better yet, they establish segregated retirement communities for themselves so that they will not have to pay for schools at all.
All successful societies need to make long-term investments in education, infrastructure and the basic research that leads to growth industries like biotechnology and new business opportunities on the Internet. How is this going to happen when the largest and most powerful voting bloc is the elderly, who know that they stand no chance of seeing the benefits of these investments? Quite simply, we have to generate values that allow us to go beyond the normal welfare calculus of capitalism to a mentality in which the satisfaction of building a better tomorrow outweighs the immediate appeal of greater and greater consumption.

HEADLINE: Facets of Clinton

BYLINE: By Todd S. Purdum; Todd S. Purdum covers the White House for The New York Times.

 BODY:
IT IS MIDNIGHT OVER THE ATLANTIC AND the President of the United States is wide awake. He is returning from an extraordinary antiterrorism summit in Egypt and a 24-hour visit to Israel, where he was praised as the peacemaking hope of the world. He has eaten a dinner of grilled shrimp and teriyaki linguine, played five games of hearts, watched a movie and talked to reporters traveling aboard Air Force One for a solid hour on topics from Arafat to Farrakhan, from the V-chip to the N.C.A.A.
Now, having exhausted his aides in the forward cabins, he is pacing the length of the darkened Boeing 747, working out a charley horse and waiting for the 12-hour flight to end so he can get home to the White House and sleep. In blue jeans, sneakers and leather bomber jacket, he appears from the galley at the tail of the giant plane, ambling up the aisle of the cramped press section, which contains the 14 reporters, photographers and cameramen in the rotating pool that covers him constantly. 
 Bill Clinton stops, sinks to squat on my carry-on computer case and starts to talk once more. And talk on and on and on for two more hours. His restless, self-revealing ramble is stunning in its breadth, its energy, its originality, its length. He rolls around the universe like a pinball in a machine. He critiques movies and noodles over the possibilities of the 21st century, when, he suggests in awe, human beings may routinely live beyond 100 years. He unspools a seamless string of insightful stories about the political problems and physical quirks of half a dozen world leaders and frets about the casual cruelties of the information age. He jokes about his daughter's dating and melts into fatherly mush at the thought that she will leave home for college next year.
He is charming, informal, PG-profane as he sips ice water and searches face to face for approval, his beefy hands and long, oddly delicate fingers cutting the air. Even after announcing that he is losing his voice, he talks for 30 more minutes. The performance is, in the end, overwhelming.
But the reporters traveling with him have been ordered by his press secretary not to take notes, tape his words, take his picture or attribute his thoughts in any detail. The reason: the last time Clinton dared to muse aloud on the record -- on a long cross-country flight last September -- he bought himself no end of grief by saying it was his job to lead America out of a late-20th-century "funk" over the pace of economic and technical change. The comment, plunked into the middle of what amounted to an upbeat summary of the State of the Union and his own psychic recovery from the devastating midterm electoral reverses of 1994, exploded into three days of unflattering headlines and comparisons to Jimmy Carter's maladroit meditation on malaise.
Clinton was furious, complaining about the unfairness of a press that he says has helped make him the most maligned President in the history of the Republic, an information overload that has already spawned half a dozen major books, a documentary and a best-selling novel. So this midnight bull session is a small, self-described effort by his spokesman, Mike McCurry, to reintroduce the President on the eve of his re-election campaign as the inveterate charmer he can be yet protect him from himself by a ban on direct quotation.
And therein appears the paradox of Bill Clinton. One of the biggest, most talented, articulate, intelligent, open, colorful characters ever to inhabit the Oval Office can also be an undisciplined, fumbling, obtuse, defensive, self-justifying rogue. His strengths and weaknesses not only spring from the same source but could also not exist without one another. In a real sense, his strengths are his weaknesses, his enthusiasms are his undoing and most of the traits that make him appealing can make him appalling in the flash of an eye.
"It's almost impossible not to be charmed by him, and it's almost impossible not to be disappointed by him," one longtime aide says flatly.
Clinton tries so hard to be liked that he inevitably disappoints even his friends. He is essentially sunny yet capable of black cloudbursts of thundering rage. He is a splendid salesman and tireless storyteller but confesses that he has failed to sell his Administration's story. He lacks a single feature that is technically handsome yet exudes physical attraction. He is breathtakingly bright while capable of doing really dumb things.
George E. Reedy, Lyndon Johnson's aide of many years, once summed up his President in words that apply equally to this one: "He was a man of too many paradoxes. Almost everything you find out about him you can find out a directly contrary quality immediately, and your problem is always which quality was real and which was assumed. Or maybe neither quality was real, or maybe both were real, who knows."
Bill Clinton used up eight and a half of any politician's allotted nine lives just getting elected, and has stretched the remaining half a life into an improbable spree of accomplishment and chaos, progress and inconsistency, mastery and drift. After nearly three and a half years, his term is not so much that of a single administration as shards of several.
In the clutter around his desk in the Oval Office stands not a single bust of a favorite predecessor, but five: Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, Truman and two of F. D. R., plus a statuette of Will Rogers for good measure. If governing is choosing, this collection is a metaphor for this President's trouble with choices, and he himself allows, "That's the story of my Presidency, that desk."
Clinton campaigned in 1992 as a "new Democrat," forswearing Big Government liberalism for a blend of old-fashioned economic populism and moderation on values issues like crime and the death penalty. But from the beginning of his term he has tried to blend disparate traditions, sometimes in dizzying and not always successful succession: deficit hawkishness, free trade, traditional liberalism, warmed-over moderate Republicanism. He now speaks expansively of ending the century as it began, with a burst of T. R.-style progressivism. The notion remains a work in progress, leading both supporters and enemies to ask: What kind of Democrat is he, anyway?
The President's personality complicates his politics, and George Stephanopoulos, a senior adviser, charges that his boss is the victim of a modern media preoccupation with "psychological reductionism in the information age." But Stephanopoulos also likes to say that Clinton is a kaleidoscope, that how one sees him depends on the twists and turns. Clinton has invited such scrutiny by the sheer range of his selves.
He has been man-child, running the West Wing in his early days like a pizza party and confessing his underwear preferences on MTV. He has been tenderfoot, lurching through homosexuals in the military and the collapse of health-care reform. He has been braveheart, reassuring the nation in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and presiding with sensitivity through tragedies like the crash of Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown's plane in the Balkans.
And now, just shy of his 50th birthday and facing what will almost certainly be his last campaign (unless, as he likes to joke, he goes home and runs for mayor or school board), Clinton is once again what he has been for his entire adult life: a canny, protean politician, as popular with the public as he has ever been in his term. Since the Republican electoral triumph of 1994, he has defined himself not only by what he is for (so many things that it is often hard to keep track) but also by what he is against (Republican ideas for cuts in popular Government programs).
With a typical mix of multipart answers, high-beam charm and sunny self-analysis, a confident Clinton sums up his situation in an hourlong interview in the Oval Office in April.
"I decided that we just -- we had to -- even though we had lost the Congress, and if the election were held tomorrow I would have lost the White House," he says, snorting a bit, "I had to keep taking on the tough decisions and making the hard decisions and banking on the good sense of the American people and the goodwill of the American people and, hopefully, the good results of the decisions, that it would work out all right.
"So I just decided to relax."
Then the restless President makes a confession. He needs sleep. Enough that often in the afternoons, he'll "just sort of mosey over to the house and get a book and throw a blanket -- just lay down on top of the bed, not take the covers off, just build the pillows up and get a book and throw a blanket over me and sleep for 30, 45 minutes, sometimes as much as an hour. It makes a big difference.
"I mean, I realized after about six months here that I was too often on edge. And it was because I was trying to carry a different order of magnitude of decision than I had previously. Now, if I don't get six hours, it's not enough. And a lot of times, I'll stay in bed seven hours, which is -- it's an eternity for me in my lifetime."
Clinton is clearly more relaxed these days. His White House runs better, and so does he. Yet like the rest of him, his nap confessional is a hybrid. The story is sweet, human, real. But one can't help thinking that if Clinton didn't stay up so late chewing the fat, he might not need the naps.
Just as he is the sum of all his contradictions, so the very factors that could help re-elect him could help defeat him. In nearly each of his virtues lurks a liability, as is evident from an examination of five facets of Bill Clinton and his Presidency: his record, his strategist, his character, his wife and his program -- or lack thereof -- for a second term.

 HIS RECORD
 
 Clinton has had a complicated term. That is clear from the most casual perusal of his ups and downs, but a challenge from one of his senior advisers distills the problem. When I ask this adviser to recommend questions for the President, he says I should ask Clinton what is consistent about his record because the President needs such an exercise to focus his own defense.
If Clinton has a central conviction, his supporters say, it is a belief in the power of Government to encourage social progress, a faith born of his firsthand observation of the Federal civil rights revolution. But from the moment he returned from Georgetown, Oxford and Yale to start his political career in Arkansas, his approach to politics has always been situational, wrapping essentially liberal ends in moderate rhetoric and means.
It is Clinton's instinct to try to square every circle and sand down every sharp edge. As a result, he tends to deal with problems one at a time. In his campaign, he pledged to end the ban on homosexuals in the military, an important nod to a key constituency little noticed by the broader public. When he moved to fulfill the pledge on taking office, a 90's social moderate suddenly seemed a 60's-style liberal, and he wound up alienating both the middle and the left by settling for the split-the-difference policy of "Don't ask, don't tell."
In his first months in office, circumstances, excess optimism and sloppy homework brought flip after flop. He nominated flawed appointees, stuck by them as controversy built, then dropped them cold, thereby maximizing political damage. He forsook a promised tax cut in favor of deeper deficit reduction and forced Democratic House members to vote for a politically unpalatable energy tax, which he dropped in negotiations with the Senate.
Clinton admits that he badly underestimated the differences between Little Rock, where his ad hoc style was easier to sustain, and Washington.
"It's just not the same," he says. "It's just bigger and deeper and more complex here. I could short-circuit a lot of processes and always know it was going to be all right. I have much greater respect now for trying to let our economic team work through a problem before I take a position, letting our national security team work through a problem, and really rely on the people we put in these staff positions to have an orderly development of process."
In other ways, his record has been steady. Clinton promised to cut the Federal deficit in half (he has, as a percentage of the economy) and create 8 million new jobs (now 8.5 million and climbing). He successfully pressed a host of popular legislative and executive measures, from the family medical leave bill to an expansion of the earned-income tax credit for the working poor to shrinking the Government work force.
He won other victories: passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement; the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; the Brady bill, which requires a waiting period for the purchase of handguns, and a crime bill that, for the first time, bans the sale and distribution of 19 kinds of assault weapons.
"By all the classical standards he has a terrific record," says Mario Cuomo, never one to praise Clinton lightly. "The difficulty is that all he says about his record is accurate enough, but it doesn't resonate with the American people."
What's more, two of the biggest things Clinton said he would do -- overhaul health care and welfare -- remain undone. "I think I overestimated how much the system could change to deal with all the various challenges in health care in one bite," says the President, who now supports an incremental approach. "I think you just have to do it in discrete steps, even though if you do it in discrete steps, when you solve a problem it presents new challenges."
On welfare, Clinton never came through with the bold plan he sketched in the campaign, which would have required big spending for job-training programs, because there was no money. Instead, by last year he was so eager to be seen as signing something that could be called welfare reform that he said he would support a Senate bill that his own advisers warned could plunge more than a million children into poverty. (In the end, he vetoed the measure because it moved closer to the harsher House version he had always opposed.)
Clinton's foreign policy record is uneven. He campaigned mostly on domestic issues. He criticized George Bush bitterly for coddling China, then took office and softened his own stance. He bemoaned Bush's temporizing on Bosnia, then temporized some more. It was as if, one senior foreign policy adviser says, the Administration came to believe its own press on foreign policy: that it was no good at it.
But last summer, heightened violence in the Balkans focused Clinton's mind on the probability that Bosnia would explode this election year. He led the charge for stepped-up NATO air strikes against the Serbs, and the new policy led to the fragile peace agreement brokered in Dayton, Ohio. He pressed on with support for the Middle East peace process and prodded the British on Northern Ireland, and though both areas remain profoundly unsettled, Clinton's campaign video claims progress.
But the President is still at some pains to show how the record fits with his promises and the public's concerns. He says he now has a "much more sober assessment of where the limits are" in the capacity of the Presidency to move America. He acknowledges that he has been responsible for failing both to execute policy and to tell his story well enough. Lately, Clinton's record has stood out more clearly by contrast to the Republican proposals he opposes, and he cites the earned-income tax credit as a prime example. As part of his economic plan in 1993, Clinton expanded the credit to millions more working-poor families.
"Now, we said it, we talked about it," Clinton says. "But, still, it's cumbersome -- the earned-income tax credit, who knows what that is? But when the Republican Congress came in and they tried to reduce the earned-income tax credit and raise taxes on working people, having said that there was going to be a tax cut, and I said no, then there was a conflict, and somehow it pierced through, and I realized people knew we'd done it and it mattered again."
That is true enough, but it points out the uncomfortable reality that Clinton is better at defining himself in relation to the opposition than to goals of his own. Michael R. Beschloss, a historian who has studied Presidents from F. D. R. to Bush, says that one problem with Clinton's record is that "there's a little bit of ad hoc-ery to this Administration that later on will probably be praised by historians." But, Beschloss adds, while in office "Presidents tend to get praised for things they were seen as being about," like Nixon on foreign policy. Only now is Nixon's record in expanding social programs, affirmative action and environmental protection celebrated.
In his new book, "In Defense of Government," which Clinton read in galleys, Jacob Weisberg distills the political realities that have made it hard for Clinton to build on his fragile plurality: "A Clinton who walked a clearer ideological line would be less frustrating to his sympathizers; he would have more permanent allies and antagonists; he would get more respect. There is no reason to think he would have a larger base of support."

 HIS STRATEGIST
 
 The part of Clinton that refuses to walk a clear ideological line has a face and a name. He is a bantam, with a nervous tic in his twisting shoulders, forever taking notes on an electronic pocket organizer, his index finger stabbing in one letter at a time. He is a fan of French wines and April in Paris and Amsterdam at tulip time. He is also the principal political adviser to the President of the United States.
And as such, Dick Morris is at the moment both the best known and the most anonymous of that peculiar political species: the consultant. Part pollster, part seer, part Svengali, part soul mate, he has known Clinton since his first campaign for governor in 1978 and helped him develop the concept of governing as a perpetual campaign. The relationship is intense enough that Clinton is said to have struck Morris in a shouting match over a long-ago disagreement.
Like the man he serves, Morris is a dizzying mix of blue-sky theorist and brass-tacks politician. White House aides who work with him acknowledge his successes, but he makes them uncomfortable because he reminds them of some of their boss's less appealing qualities. "He's basically Clinton's dark side," one sniffs.
The twist is that this ambidextrous operator, who worked mostly for Republicans in recent years and took no formal role in Clinton's 1992 campaign, has come closer than anyone to helping Clinton articulate a coherent approach to his Presidency, albeit a largely strategic and symbolic one. Since the disastrous days of late 1994, Morris has become the dominant hand in shaping the White House message. At first in secret telephone calls -- initiated by Clinton -- and in recent months openly, he has almost completely supplanted the team that guided Clinton's 1992 campaign, dividing and demoralizing much of the White House staff in the process.
But with the President's close and sometimes solitary cooperation, Morris has overseen the virtual remaking of Clinton's Presidency. Topic by topic, Clinton and Morris set out to co-opt Republican issues, from school prayer to the balanced budget, accommodating where possible and drawing lines in the sand where polls showed the public breaking ranks with the Gingrich revolution.
The process culminated early last summer, when Clinton, over the objections of virtually all of his other senior aides, decided that he could not beat the Republicans on the issue of balancing the Federal budget by a certain date. So he decided to join them, but on his terms, with smaller, slower cuts in spending for programs for health, education, the elderly and the environment. Concerned that the President had come to be seen as too liberal, Morris worked with Clinton to reposition him as the centrist he campaigned to be in 1992, all the while avoiding anything that smacked unduly of class warfare.
The President's critics dismissed the budget shift as just so much repositioning. But by fall, when deadlock with the Republicans over spending led to two Government shutdowns, it was clear that Clinton's arguments against the severity of the Republican cuts were playing well in part because the public saw the President as reasonable. Even James Carville, Clinton's chief 1992 strategist, who remains an informal adviser, says: "If Clinton was doing bad, Morris would get all the blame. The President's doing well -- hell, why not give the guy some credit?"
Morris is fond of metaphors, and uses one from sailing to defend Clinton.
"He tacks," Morris says. "He doesn't sail with the wind, he tacks. So if the wind is blowing in one direction, he aims just a little to the left of his destination. When the wind switches, he aims just a little to the right. But always going toward his objectives, not just sailing with the wind." And Morris is frank to say that Clinton's objective is "to accomplish his agenda while maximizing his political power."
Morris has helped devise a series of unusually early television commercials, run in swing states, touting Clinton's record and blaming the Dole-Gingrich Congress for continuing gridlock. The story line underlying these ads implies a clear march by a bright-eyed young President, the anti-Newt and anti-Dole, against a tired old Republican who will lurch from negative attack to negative attack.
Morris's strategy has worked so far. But by ceding so much substantive ground to the Republicans to preserve his strategic advantage, Clinton once again highlighted the basic question about him: Does he have a center of his own, and where is it?
Others in the White House, especially Harold Ickes, the deputy chief of staff and de facto campaign chief, are skeptical of Morris's insistence on early advertising and assume the race will tighten dramatically, even dangerously, if Dole manages to summon the kind of Main Street, Middle Western strain that has always been powerful in American politics. Congressional Democrats have already pressed for more aggressive economic populism by trying to force a vote on a minimum wage increase that Clinton has supported.
And traditional Democrats remain skeptical of Morris's sometimes stagy positioning of Clinton as one point in a strategy of "triangulation" with Congressional Democrats and Republicans. They argue that Morris's centrism has worked only because Clinton first attacked the Republicans for trying to shrink the growth of Medicare to give tax cuts to the wealthy.
"The mushiness of this whole thing," Mario Cuomo scoffs, "the idea that the President should play one foot in the boat and one foot on the dock without winding up with his tush in the water -- that can change with one little wave, right? He'll triangulate himself right into the water."
Under Morris's tutelage, the President has played possum. Putting his once-ambitious legislative agenda on hold, he has become a kind of civic cheerleader in chief, issuing a flurry of executive orders and endorsing such popular, low-cost notions as support for school uniforms, voluntary curbs on television violence and a crackdown on teen-age smoking. Viewed cynically, each is a piece of poll-tested sleight of hand.
But Morris contends that the most enduring problems facing the nation, from the collapse of the family to the decline in civility, are behavioral ones against which Government programs can make little headway but Government persuasion can lead the way: "The problems we face, not the symptoms, but the causes, are fundamental causes best dealt with by altering the way people think and act and do."
Clinton suggests that his relationship with Morris works because they understand each other so well and because Morris shares his fascination with finding a new path between Democratic orthodoxies and Republican dogma.
"I think he is, first of all, brilliant, tactically and strategically," the President says. "Secondly, with me he's always been very straightforward and honest, the bad news as well as the good and, if possible, the bad news first. Thirdly, he knows how I think, and he knows what I will do and what I won't do.
"Fourthly, he's full of new ideas all the time. And finally, we've been together so long that he not only understands me, I understand him. So I know when he says something that won't work. I have an instinctive -- I'm almost never wrong. Once in a great while we miss it, but, usually, if he suggests something that won't work, I can figure that out."
The most controversial part of Morris is his willingness to work for both Republicans and Democrats. In 1994 in New York, he worked for the Republican gubernatorial primary campaign of Richard Rosenbaum and -- secretly -- for the Democratic primary campaign of Eliot Spitzer, the son of an old friend, for attorney general. That same year he advised Jim Smith, a Republican contender for the gubernatorial nomination in Florida, and wrote a speech in which he said that the Clinton Administration's budget cuts "make our military a joke."
Doesn't all that bother the President?
"I wouldn't say it doesn't bother me," Clinton says carefully. "I think he's loyal to me, and I don't think he's going to do anything while working for me that will hurt my allies in Congress. That's the only thing we've got an understanding about -- that you're going to work for me now, that you can't be out there trying to beat any people that I care about, that I'm supporting."

 HIS CHARACTER
 
 In the opening scene of "Primary Colors," the anonymous novel that set Washington on edge this winter, the Stephanopoulesque narrator describes his first encounter with Gov. Jack Stanton, the Clinton-esque candidate. The passage may be the best word-picture of the Clinton treatment ever put on paper.
"I've seen him do it two million times now, but I couldn't tell you how he does it, the right-handed part of it -- the strength, quality, duration of it, the rudiments of pressing the flesh," the character recalls, before going on to catalogue how the candidate uses the other hand. "If he doesn't know you all that well, and you've just told him something 'important,' something earnest or emotional, he will lock in and honor you with a two-hander, his left hand overwhelming your wrist and forearm. He'll flash that famous misty look of his. And he will mean it."
The secret of Bill Clinton is that he always means it, in the moment he says it or does it or tells it or asks it. It's just that he says, does, tells and asks so many things in such succession. Even his supporters concede that his carelessness in living, then retelling his own life and record, from the draft to Whitewater, is his most exasperating flaw and one the Republicans will once again seek to exploit this fall.
The empathy and intellect that work for Clinton in hand-to-hand campaigning and spontaneous sermonizing can boomerang. "I know I'm going on a little too long," an impassioned Clinton told a town meeting in Sacramento in October 1993, talking about a pending crime bill. "But this is a big deal."
A computer search shows that since taking office Clinton has used the same three-word phrase more than 75 times -- to describe the effects of the deficit on ability to invest in education, a Western buffalo preserve, the joys of homeownership, the dangers of guns, the deer population of Arkansas and the need to protect the earned-income tax credit for working families. In one sense, this is a verbal tic. But if so many things are really a big deal, is any one thing? And how could his listeners tell? Like Mozart, whose music was dismissed by the Emperor in "Amadeus," Clinton often sounds "too many notes."
"This is a man of very deep and complex thought," one longtime aide says. "It works for him because he's a much more sober judge of the world. It works against him because in this day and age you cannot be seen as discussing complexity."
Of course, it is this quality that gives Clinton the resources to persevere. It is the quality that sent him back through history, reading the speeches of predecessors, searching for clues about leadership in the dark days after the midterm electoral defeat. It is the quality that makes him aware of the concerns and questions of audiences in the town hall format of which he is the past master.
Robert O. Boorstin, a former Clinton speech writer, describes his old boss as among the race of "Empaths," like Counselor Deanna Troi, the "Star Trek" character who immediately feels everything that everyone around her is feeling. His capacity for absorbing and acting on the troubles of others can be astounding.
Erskine Bowles, a North Carolina businessman who didn't know Clinton before 1992 but ended up a deputy chief of staff in the White House and one of his best friends, recalls their second meeting, alone in the back seat of a car after a fund-raising event. Bowles's oldest son, Sam, is diabetic and had suffered a wrenching seizure that morning. Sensing Bowles's mood, Clinton asked what was the matter, and Bowles poured out his frustration over President Bush's ban on fetal tissue research, which he considered the best hope for a cure for his son.
"It was like I was talking to a wall, or the car door," Bowles says. "He never said a word to me. But then, about a month and a half later, somebody from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation called me and said Clinton had mentioned Sam in a speech on health care and vowed that if elected, he'd end the ban on fetal tissue research. I'm telling you, I mean, it got to me."
Yet the same Clinton was too abashed to tell Lani Guinier, an old friend whose wedding he attended, to her face that he was dropping her nomination for assistant attorney general, and he has not spoken to her since.
Clinton is capable of dropping a friend like Guinier if politics demands it, but he never stops trying to win over strangers. And his overflowing empathy leads him to hyperbole. Like Tigger in "Winnie-the-Pooh," whose braggadocio makes him the reigning expert at whatever is under discussion, from swimming to tree climbing, Clinton often cannot contain his need to do likewise and overdoes it. At a farm conference in Iowa last spring, he allowed that he surely knew more about agriculture than any other President, ignoring the agrarian expertise of, say, Washington, Jefferson, Truman and Carter.
Campaigning in Iowa this winter, Clinton said he had heard about the legendary Iowa caucuses since he was a little boy: at that time, they were unimportant and unheard of. And in March, at an education conference in New York, he claimed, "I suppose that I have spent more time in classrooms than any previous President," glossing over Woodrow Wilson, who spent 30 years as a professor and college president.
In one sense this boasting is harmless enough, but the quality it reflects is a lingering tendency to be, as the British say, economical with the truth. If a politician's word is all he has, Clinton's word sometimes doesn't mean much, as he himself made clear when he apologized to an audience of wealthy contributors in Houston last fall for raising their taxes too much in the 1993 economic plan -- the one he often cites as his greatest accomplishment. He was forced to apologize for the apology, and a minor flap blew up into page 1 headlines.
His aides cringe at such excess, as they do at other appetites that leave their boss looking undisciplined, inconsistent or worse. To this day, campaign aides can recount with something approaching horror Clinton's leaving a rally where he had shaken hundreds of hands and then, without washing his own, consumed a whole pie barehanded in the back seat of his car.
Most tricky, of course, is Clinton's reputation for libidinal overdrive, which he sometimes seems to do nothing to minimize. Once, aboard Air Force One, a bikini-clad actress jumped up from a swimming pool on the video screen over his shoulder in the press cabin (where, it must be noted, photographers had chosen the in-flight film). The President caught sight of her, paused and offered a cheery "Hell-looo!" before resuming a discussion on the future of democracy.
If Clinton invariably makes men comfortable with a "Nice tie!" when he shakes their hands, he is just as quick to drop his eyes to a woman's decolletage and murmur appreciatively, "Nice pin!"
White House aides discount Republican talk of such questions as an issue and note that he was elected despite all the publicity about his acknowledged marital problems. But this aspect of Clinton seems to have taken root and led people to take him less seriously and to express a greater visceral distaste than for any President since Nixon. Clinton is nightly grist for talk-show hosts like David Letterman, who mentioned in a recent monologue that the President had agreed to play a cameo role as himself in a made-for-TV movie about the family medical leave bill but "was disappointed that he didn't have to sleep with anybody to get the part."
This phenomenon is broader than sex and is partly cultural, the reflection of a national discourse that is coarser in every sphere. It is partly generational, the preoccupation of baby boomers with living out loud. But it is partly pure Clinton.
"Every American can see a part of himself in this President" one senior White House aide says. "It's unsettling. They don't like to be confronted with their faults. They see this enormous passion, this restless intellect, and think, 'Gee, why can't it produce more for us?' "

HIS WIFE
 
 In the dark-wood warren of the Palm restaurant, an A-list of Washington's political and media elite has gathered on a March night to celebrate publication of Carville's populist paperback, "We're Right, They're Wrong." Hillary Rodham Clinton praises the man of honor and speaks volumes about her relationship with another man as well.
"I'm a pushover for sweet-talking Southern boys," she says in a mock syrup-thick twang. "I know where they're coming from, but I still fall for it."
There is no doubt that Hillary Diane Rodham fell hard for Bill Clinton at Yale Law School more than two decades ago, followed him home to Arkansas and stuck by him. And there's no doubt that they retain a bond of such intensity, mutual dependence and unspoken understanding that it can only be called love.
"I find I get very nervous when he does something like a debate or makes a major speech," she tells me on a recent Saturday afternoon in the Yellow Oval Room on the second floor of the White House. "Because, you know, my heart's in my throat and I want him to do well, and it's really hard on me."
There seems equally little doubt, however, that their partnership amounts to what one senior aide describes as "the most complicated relationship I have ever seen between two people."
In the last three years, Hillary Clinton's public place in that relationship has changed profoundly. In 1992, she was the brainy asset of whom her husband would say on the stump, "Buy one, get one free." On national television, she defended their marriage as no mere arrangement and presented an image of moral rectitude in contrast to her all-too-fallen man.
She remains an asset in many ways, overwhelmingly popular among women, minority groups and the rest of the traditional Democratic base. Her book on children's issues, "It Takes a Village," has been on the nonfiction best-seller list for 17 weeks, and her solo travels to China, South Asia, South America, Bosnia, Greece and Turkey have won raves as models of diplomacy.
But drip by drip, disclosure by disclosure, she has become more controversial than her husband, with unfavorable ratings at 41 percent, nearly 10 points above her favorable rating and more than twice the worst ratings Nancy Reagan ever received. More than half the public is convinced that she is hiding something on Whitewater. From health care to the firings in the White House travel office, from the initial closing of the press office corridor in the West Wing to her early reluctance to release documents relating to the First Family's personal finances, she has been in the middle of the defining controversies of her husband's Administration -- and she knows it.
In our interview, she is a picture of control, gently but firmly deflecting nearly every question about her record and regrets into an upbeat answer about "my husband's" underappreciated achievements. But this winter, just after she became the first First Lady in history to be subpoenaed by a grand jury, she gave a better indication of the pressures she is under. Asked by The Boston Globe whether she thought of her tenure as "a failure," she answered with her usual poise, and then, when the reporter left, burst into tears.
"I mean, it has to make you a little bit sad, I suppose," she explains in our interview. "I don't think it's an unfair question. I just think it's an off-base question. It's not my term. It's my husband's term. It's not my failure or success that is ultimately important. It's what he's done."
It is not so simple. Like Mary Todd Lincoln, Edith Wilson and Eleanor Roosevelt before her, Hillary Clinton has built a public reputation that has subsumed part of her husband's, for good and ill.
On the stump, among the Democratic faithful, she is received almost like a rock star and remains the most requested speaker after the President and Vice President. Clinton's support among women is a big part of his lead over Bob Dole in current polls, and the President's campaign advisers believe his wife can be a magnet for the female voters who stayed home in the 1994 midterm elections. The White House makes it clear that she will campaign extensively, both with the President and on her own.
At the same time, she is a polarizing figure to moderate swing voters, whose support the President wants to retain. The First Lady dismisses any notion that she is an albatross. "Everybody's entitled to their opinion," she says. "I just don't agree with that."
While Hillary Clinton is often painted as the embodiment of the liberal orthodoxies that her husband has strived to see beyond, she is a practical politician and strongly encouraged Morris's return to the scene. After a series of confessed errors of judgment in dealing with Washington and the media, she, too, has recast herself and settled on her line of defense for the campaign: attacks on her are mainly attacks on her husband, inspired by Republican fear of his political skills.
For his part, the President says, except for the deaths of their family members and friends, the intense criticism of his wife has been the most painful experience during his Presidency.
"She wouldn't take a nickel to see the cow jump over the moon, you know," he says. "And this sort of parody picture of her as a sort of humorless, overbearing, power-wielding person that did all these things in this Whitewater deal -- it has just been heartbreaking. I mean, I have to tell you it's been the toughest thing about it for me."
Hillary Clinton is no less a collection of contradictions than her husband. One of the First Lady's best friends in the White House sums up her effect on grown men this way: "She can freeze people, like, What are those big bronze blobs? Like Henry Moore sculptures." In the early months of the Administration, aides recall, she was capable of eviscerating the President in front of others with verbal barrages, which he absorbed in silence. But among the small group of close aides she rides the hardest, a cheery bunch of almost all women, she is adored, keeping abreast of details about their families, their dates, their interests.
In public speeches she talks in a deliberate, story-hour tone as if she were a Sunday-school teacher. But in relaxed, more private moments, she has a rueful, mordant sense of humor. When I ask what her biggest regret is, her eyes search the ceiling and she gropes for an answer. But when I suggest some possibilities, including "ever talking to Michael Lerner," the New Age writer who seemed to suggest that he was her spiritual adviser because she had borrowed his concept of "the politics of meaning," she bursts into a rich, rollicking, full-throated laugh that shakes the yellow damask sofa.
But her guard goes up again the moment it comes down. When I ask why the public has so little sense of her capacity for laughter she demurs. "You know, I will have to leave this to other people," she says. "I think there are lots of reasons for that, some of them having to do with me and how I present myself, which I am fully aware of."
So does she think of herself as intimidating, a hard case?
"I didn't until I kept reading that I was," she says. "And so I said, 'Well, maybe I am.' " She says that especially early in the Administration she was taken aback at how high people jumped at her every word. To illustrate her point, she chooses not a tale of travel office intrigue but of a state dinner in France, where President Mitterrand's wife apologized in advance for tables that would seem hopelessly bare because she had heard that President Clinton's allergies precluded centerpieces.
"And of course it was attributed to me," Hillary Clinton says. "That, you know, that 'Mrs. Clinton does not want flowers on the table because her husband's allergies would not permit it.' So it's not only what you ask for. It's little pieces of information that well-meaning people take and then explode into a decision that they want to make for you, to please you."
Yet she often seems her own worst enemy. On her trip to South Asia in 1995, she talked to the reporters traveling with her on almost every leg of the journey. But she insisted that our conversations be off the record, so it was hard to capture the humanity and humor of her observations, including a lengthy middle-of-the-night talk about public obsession with her hair styles and the difficulties of living in the media bubble.
Told at one point how impressive Chelsea, then 15, had been, she sighed, "Ah, yes, but now I have to take her home and put her back in purdah," referring to the Muslim practice of secluding women behind veils. She, too, has spent much of the time since the Republican Congressional triumph in 1994 in a kind of purdah, lowering her profile while remaining influential behind the scenes. She no longer attends group meetings in the White House but still sends her surrogates; she talks to Morris; she keeps a hectic schedule of appearances in local media markets, promoting her book and attending events aimed at women and children. And aides she supports rise in the White House, like Evelyn Lieberman, a former assistant who recently replaced Erskine Bowles as Ickes's co-deputy chief of staff.
One White House aide, reflecting a wider view, points to Hillary Clinton's reluctance late in 1993 to release documents relating to Whitewater as "the single worst decision of this Presidency." It led eventually to the appointment of a special prosecutor and the consequent turmoil. Clinton delicately suggests that this was a problem: "Maybe she didn't deal with it so well because I think she was shocked in the beginning that such outrageous things could be given such currency. So maybe none of us are blameless in this."
The First Lady's role in a second term remains unclear, and in our interview she does not discuss it directly. But asked whether, given the experience of the last three years, there is a piece of her that hopes Clinton won't win again, she flashes back: "None, not a cell, not any part of me. I think my husband's been a wonderful President."
In an interview with The Washington Post this winter, the President said her role would be up to her, then in the next breath that he hadn't given it much thought. "I'm not worried about it at all," he tells me. "We'll figure out what to do."

HIS FUTURE
 
 Every working day in his Oval Office present, Clinton has a window on his past, out the French doors to the Rose Garden, the scene of his sword-in-the-stone handshake with John F. Kennedy as a 16-year-old in 1963. An avid student of the Presidency, Clinton has always had a romantic idea of himself and his tenure. But the view of his future is murky, and the electorate is entitled to wonder what he will do next.
His strategy of opposing the harshest Republican budget cuts while sidestepping his way to accommodation of such longtime Republican goals as reducing taxes and balancing the budget may re-elect him. But to do what?
Win or lose, Clinton will be the youngest ex-President since Theodore Roosevelt, who was 50 when he left office in 1909. If he loses, friends say, he has mused on many possibilities, from a university professorship to a Supreme Court seat, one of the few Government jobs ever filled by an ex-President, William Howard Taft.
If Clinton wins, the possibilities are just as varied. His first term has been so many things that even his supporters wonder what a second would be, and the 20th-century record of second terms is full of pitfalls, from Wilson's undoing over the League of Nations to F. D. R.'s Supreme Court-packing fight to Nixon's Watergate and Reagan's Iran-contra. The questions are compounded because a Government committed to balancing the budget will have little money to spend, and control of the Senate, if not the House, seems destined to remain in Republican hands. "I think he might find it very frustrating, especially if you accept this notion that he sees himself as doing big things," says Michael Beschloss, the historian.
Since 1994, Clinton has repeatedly said he tried to bite off too much at once and in our interview speaks of exploring a collection of incremental steps: extending health insurance piecemeal by various means, including the opening of programs that cover Federal workers to small businesses and the self-employed, and the granting of new tax credits to help corporations provide worker training and cope with downsizing.
"I'm not much of a lame-duck type," the President says. "It's not in my makeup. So I expect that I will be hitting it full time until the last day I'm here."
Still, for 22 years, Clinton has run for office every two or four years, and his closest aides wonder quietly what would happen if he were freed from that obligation. Some suggest he might drift; others warn of increasingly bitter staff rivalries. The scenarios spin out: would Hillary Clinton press for more liberal appointees and agendas? Would Al Gore, looking to his own ambitions in 2000, insist on playing a more decisive role? Would continued gridlock keep Clinton from doing any more than nibbling around the edges, or would the President swing for the fences of history?
Clinton talks grandly of initiating "a new progressive era in America." He sees this as a time "where we use the power of Government to try to both accelerate the positive developments in the economy and to bring the American people together and give everybody a chance to participate in it and win and to compose a good life and to be empowered to make the most of their own lives and their families' lives and their neighborhoods."
But like Clinton's theme in his grab-bag State of the Union Message this year -- "The Age of Possibility" -- this is a deliberately gauzy notion, poll-tested palaver encompassing all manner of potentially contradictory themes.
"Progressive," with its suggestion of moving forward, is a safe word. Its alternative, of course, is "regressive," which no one could support. One senior White House aide says that what Clinton means is a Government that is "active but not large."
"He's trying not to use the word 'liberal' -- that's the essential matter here," says David Herbert Donald, the Harvard historian whose new Lincoln biography Clinton admires. "What he's advocating is really very worthwhile, but it misses the essential difference between this and earlier progressive eras. I grew up in the Depression on a farm, and we looked to the New Deal as the savior. Now my brother runs the farm in Mississippi and he sees the Government mostly as sort of a dragon."
At a fund-raising event in Florida in April, Clinton himself acknowledges, "There has been a lot of talk over the last couple of years about what we Democrats stand for, whether it is clear, what is the difference between the two parties, does it matter anymore?" He went on to sketch his vision of economic incentives in exchange for work, shared values and respect for diversity and a refusal to surrender to renewed isolationism.
In his better moments, Clinton does seem to be searching for something elusive, a path of leaner, more limited Government, still capable of compassion for social wrongs and dedicated to fostering economic growth in a new century that will differ from what the Founders imagined as much as the trusts and factories of the Gilded Age differed from Jefferson's agrarian ideal.
"He's speaking a new language that's not entirely clear," Mike McCurry says. "It's not the old F. D. R. programmatic liberalism" or "Neanderthal Republicanism" but something that borrows from both.
Clinton seems almost fatalistic about the ultimate judgment of his attempts to piece together a program.
"The day I made the decision to assist Mexico to prevent the bankruptcy there, there was a poll in the paper that said by 81 to 15 the people were against it," he says. "There was no real support for what I did in Haiti. The position in Bosnia was tenuous. Here at home, even though the polls looked good when I became the first President to take on the Brady bill and the assault weapons issue or the tobacco issue, they are very misleading, because of the intensity of the opposition, which is why no one had ever done it before."
Clinton's confidence is born of a resilience his adversaries should never underestimate. In slogging back from his defeat after a single term as Governor of Arkansas, in enduring the slings of Gennifer Flowers in 1992, when many experts were convinced he was dead, or in recovering after the Congressional defeats of 1994, Clinton has resolutely refused to acknowledge the scorn others heap upon him.
On the stump this winter, Patrick Buchanan delighted in rebuking Clinton as "shameless" in his willingness to pander to almost any group. In his willingness to remake himself, Clinton is truly without the shame that would stop others from carrying on. He has known sorrows and family turmoil few people even dream of, and gone on. He has stumbled and fallen and got up and gone on. At a Pentecostal church in Alexandria, La., this spring, he recalled how the Pentecostals in Arkansas had supported him after his wrenching defeat in 1980.
"I was the youngest former Governor in American history," Clinton told the packed church. "I had no career prospects.
"I was alone. You made me not just think, but feel, that my God would look past what I was to what I could be. You made me not just think, but feel, that my faith could make me whole. And that is a great gift."
It is Clinton's great gift to look past what he is to what he might be, to look over what he has not been to what he wants to be, to dream no small dreams. But what is his dream now? F. D. R.'s legacy can be summarized as "Nothing to fear but fear itself," J. F. K.'s as "Ask not what your country can do for you" and Reagan's as defeating the "Evil Empire." What will Clinton's epigram be?
"There's nothing wrong with America that can't be cured by what's right with America," he answers quickly, echoing his own inaugural address. But then, typically, he goes on. "People are always asking me, this bumper-sticker saying. But I think the 'Evil Empire' meant more afterward than it did before because it was the end of the cold war." He says that no one knows yet what his phrase will be.
"I can tell you what the Evil Empire, New Deal, Fair Deal, Square Deal, New Frontier phrase will be much better when I'm finished with my work than I can now," he says, still groping for a summary. "And if the voters think we're tomorrow's progressives and not yesterday's progressives, I think we'll win the election in '96 and be given the opportunity to continue to work, to build the kind of future in this dramatically different and very exciting but somewhat challenging period we're living in."
In other words, this President hopes and believes, there's nothing wrong with Bill Clinton that can't be cured by what's right with Bill Clinton.

Tourist Helicopters In Hawaii Can Fly Lower

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Federal Aviation Administration has been allowing helicopter tour pilots to fly lower and lower in the Hawaiian skies, a year and a half after it imposed altitude limits and other safety restrictions on tour operators there in response to a series of fatal crashes.
Many operators have already been granted permission to fly as low as 1,000 feet, and now the agency is beginning to let some of them fly as low as 500 feet as long as other safety rules are met, according to agency officials. 
 In September 1994, the agency issued emergency regulations governing air tour operators in Hawaii, where hundreds of thousands of tourists each year take helicopter tours. The rules were a response to five fatal helicopter accidents there between 1991 and 1994, killing 24 people; there have been no such accidents in Hawaii since then, according to the F.A.A.
The agency, at the request of the National Transportation Safety Board, is still considering nationwide safety rules on companies offering aerial tours, a growing business sometimes called flightseeing. The agency expects to issue a proposal late this year.
If Hawaii's experience is a guide, those rules may emphasize issues involving pilot training, aircraft reliability and the like, more than the question of altitude restrictions. (Separately, the agency is considering restrictions on flights over national parks, mainly focusing on the noise problem.)
When they were first issued, the F.A.A.'s rules for Hawaii generally limited helicopter flights to at least 1,500 feet above the surface (except during takeoff and landing). The rules also required other safety measures, such as training for pilots, pre-flight briefings for passengers and the use of lifejackets and other flotation devices.
But the restrictions made the flights less appealing to some tourists, and the industry's revenues are said to have declined since they took effect. At least one tour operator filed for bankruptcy, and the others sought and received waivers to let them fly lower.
The F.A.A. officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the agency's increasing flexibility toward the tour operators is based mainly on safety considerations, not on any economic troubles faced by the industry.
Indeed, the industry and the National Transportation Safety Board have complained that the higher flights could pose new risks even as they reduced the risks that are inherent in low-level flights. Since the new regulations took effect, tour operators and safety officials have worried that one side effect would be to crowd the air lanes at 1,500 feet, especially in cloudy conditions when light planes might fly at that level to get below the clouds, while helicopters climbed to that altitude to comply with the rules. Aircraft operators reported a rash of close calls involving planes and helicopters flying near each other.
Paradoxically, it can be safer to crash-land a helicopter from a higher altitude than from close to the ground. If pilots suddenly lose power, the extra altitude gives them time to "auto-rotate" -- a tricky maneuver that uses the helicopter's descent to spin its blades, generating lift at the last minute so that the aircraft can settle down gently.
The F.A.A. waivers allowing 15 helicopter tour companies in Hawaii to fly as low as 1,000 feet required pilots to have extra proficiency training, to stay away from populated areas and to follow other special procedures. Three operators of tours using fixed-wing airplanes also were given permission to fly at 1,000 feet, according to the F.A.A.
Already, IO Aviation has been granted authority to fly two-engine helicopters even lower, at 500 feet, and other applicants seeking permission to operate at that altitude are likely to be granted waivers soon, the F.A.A. said.
"We believe now that safe operations can be conducted in specific sites by operators meeting specific requirements," an F.A.A. official said.
Opponents of the helicopter tours, who have raised complaints about noise as well as safety, are upset by the increase in low-level flights.
"It does seem to me that the change has been the result of intense lobbying by the industry, which is solely interested in their bottom line," said Paul Achitoff of the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. "They have never been as interested in safety as the public would like them to be."

FROM THE SHADOWS
 The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War.
 By Robert M. Gates.
 Illustrated. 604 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $30.
Early in his turbulent tenure as President Ronald Reagan's Director of Central Intelligence, William J. Casey startled his aides by leaning out his office door one day and demanding two vodka martinis for himself and a guest. The Director's suite had been dry for years. After a frantic search, a breathless staff presented the boss with the drinks, no doubt shaken and stirred. 
 Robert M. Gates, then a rising officer at the Central Intelligence Agency, happened to witness this scene, and he describes it with elan in "From the Shadows." The episode, he eventually realized, had been a preview of the impulsive, damn-the-torpedoes operating style that would derail Casey, gravely damage the C.I.A. and rock the Reagan Administration.
For a man who spent a lifetime producing dispassionate Government memorandums and reports, Mr. Gates unexpectedly has a storyteller's eye for anecdote and idiosyncrasy, and a flair for recounting history. As an intelligence analyst, White House aide and ultimately Director of Central Intelligence himself, Mr. Gates had a ringside seat for the last two decades of the cold war. He has put the proximity to good use in this often entertaining, frequently self-serving but always thoughtful account of the United States' long effort to contain the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gates provides a vivid chronicle of Washington personalities and policy conflict, as well as an extensive discourse on the demise of the Soviet Union. He reopens one of the epic disputes of the cold war, namely whether the C.I.A. misestimated Soviet military and economic strength in the 1970's, then misread the signs of collapse in the 80's.
As the author of many of those intelligence assessments, Mr. Gates predictably concludes that the C.I.A.'s work was sound, and prescient more often than not. But he introduces enough information, much of it newly declassified, to let readers see the record for themselves. Alas, a lot of the declassified material turns out to be so equivocal that it is hard to tell what the C.I.A. really thought.
Mr. Gates has an annoying habit of employing one-word sentences, his chronology of events is a bit jumbled, and his account of the fine points of Soviet politics can be hard to follow without an advanced degree. His boyish enthusiasm becomes cloying, and there is a Panglossian sheen to his treatment of esteemed colleagues like George Bush. But these are distractions, not disabling flaws. For the most part, Mr. Gates delivers a tart, revealing look at the inner workings and subterranean spy games of five Administrations, beginning with Richard Nixon's first term. Mr. Gates left Government service at the end of the Bush Administration.
Until his contested 1991 nomination to become the Government's chief intelligence official, which the Senate confirmed after bitter debate, Mr. Gates was little known by most Americans. He quickly withdrew from consideration for the same post in 1987 after his selection to succeed Casey was caught in the quicksand of the Iran-contra scandal. But Mr. Gates was never more than a step or two from the center of power. He was the deputy national security adviser to President Bush and the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence in the latter years of the Reagan Administration. Before that he shuttled between jobs at the White House and the C.I.A as a senior analyst of Soviet affairs. It says something about the cold war insularity of Washington that Mr. Gates did not set foot in the Soviet Union until 1989.
William Casey, understandably, occupies a central place in "From the Shadows." Mr. Gates proves to be a skilled portraitist, capturing the eccentricity, ideological fervor and boundless arrogance of the man who fathered this country's not-so-covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Mr. Gates makes an unconvincing case that Casey knew little of Oliver North's clandestine efforts to assist the contras after Congress banned lethal aid, and he concludes that Casey knew nothing about the diversion of money from secret arms sales to Iran. Along the way, Mr. Gates insists he did not know about the diversion himself.
But Mr. Gates is under few illusions about Casey's contempt for Congress and disdain for any outside check on C.I.A. operations. He reports that Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, once complained to Casey in the Reagan years that money had dried up for a worthy covert project in Poland. The next day, according to Mr. Gates, a man appeared uninvited at Mr. Brzezinski's office and handed him a briefcase stuffed with $18,000 in cash.
In his exhumation of the Soviet Union's and America's cold war policies, Mr. Gates maintains that unyielding American pressure, including the Reagan military buildup, speeded the collapse of Communism. He is not the first to make that argument, and the connection was undeniable. But in the end, economic and political deformities in the Soviet system, and long-suppressed nationalism in the provinces, destroyed the Soviet Union.
Mr. Gates came under fire at his confirmation hearings in 1991 for reportedly twisting intelligence assessments to exaggerate the Soviet threat and later to belittle Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms. He rejected the charge then, and tries now, with reasonable success, to demonstrate that he did not enforce ideological conformity at the C.I.A. He acknowledges that he underestimated the political reforms and foreign policy shifts made by Mr. Gorbachev after 1987, but defends earlier estimates that Mr. Gorbachev's economic reforms would fail and that the Soviet leader was not initially prepared to alter Soviet domestic or foreign policies after assuming power in 1985.
These views often left Mr. Gates in dissent as Mr. Reagan and his Secretary of State, George Shultz, did diplomatic business with Mr. Gorbachev. In retrospect, it seems clear that Mr. Gates was slow to recognize Mr. Gorbachev's commitment to change, and reluctant to see Moscow as anything other than an implacable foe.
"From the Shadows" may not quite live up to its subtitle as the ultimate insider's story, but it is one of the better, more readable memoirs of the cold war.

THE ANATOMY OF PREJUDICES
By Elisabeth Young-Bruehl.
 632 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 Harvard University Press. $35.
Elisabeth Young-Bruehl is a distinguished biographer of Hannah Arendt and Anna Freud. Her new book represents a considerable departure: a psychological and historical analysis of the four prejudices that have dominated American life and reflection in the past half-century -- anti-Semitism, racism, sexism and homophobia. 
 "The Anatomy of Prejudices" is as much a study of the way prejudice has been thought about as it is of prejudice itself. Ms. Young-Bruehl takes a dim view of the social scientific literature on the subject, which, rather like Bob Dole's political support, she describes as a mile wide and an inch deep. Social psychologists and sociologists are charged with two fundamental mistakes: treating all prejudices as if they were one, and treating them as essentially cognitive -- matters of learned and conscious aversion to people regarded as different.
Against the social scientists, Ms. Young-Bruehl argues that anti-Semitism, racism, sexism and homophobia differ in their internal logic (or illogic) and, more important, that they are deeply rooted in character structure and the unconscious. Accordingly, she finds the most convincing evidence about prejudices not in the questionnaires and projective tests favored by social scientists but in the writings of psychoanalysts, philosophers, novelists, critics and historians. Above all, she finds it in the writings of the victims of prejudice themselves.
At the heart of her analysis lies an identification of the different prejudices with the three character types described by Freud in his essay "Libidinal Types": the obsessional, the hysterical and the narcissistic. Anti-Semites, she argues, are obsessional characters. Their fears are grounded in anal fixations and overdeveloped superegos. Typically, they imagine the Jew as dirty and aggressive, and their greatest anxiety is penetration from the rear (as in the Germans' characterization of defeat in World War I as a "stab in the back").
Racists, by contrast, are hysterical characters. Their hatred of blacks is based on genital fantasies (the black male as sexual athlete and rapist, the black female as whore). Ignored by social scientists, the unconscious sexual bases of white racism have been laid out most incisively, she argues, by its victims, including Frantz Fanon, James Baldwin, Malcolm X and Cornel West.
She views sexism as a narcissistic disorder. Superficially it holds that women are inferior to men, but in the unconscious it rests on a denial of sexual difference. Indeed, Ms. Young-Bruehl contends that sexism originates in the idea of the "phallic mother," a mother, in other words, who is genitally male and whom the sexist bigot is unwilling to relinquish.
Homophobia (by which Ms. Young-Bruehl usually means prejudice against gay men rather than lesbians) is presented as the most intricate of the prejudices. Its central manifestation, a dread of effeminacy, is "the continuation of sexism by other means" -- again the denial of difference, in this case of the feminine within. But apparently there are also obsessional homophobias, resembling the fear of pollution and anal violation associated with anti-Semitism (here belong opposition to gay people in the military and overwrought anxieties about child molesters), as well as hysterical homophobias, where gay men are hated (and envied), in the manner of blacks, because of their presumed sexual athleticism. Occasionally Ms. Young-Bruehl's typology becomes improbably specific, as when she suggests that the 1992 antigay initiative in Oregon was obsessional (because it was inspired by fear of homosexuals infiltrating the schools), while the comparable initiative in Colorado was hysterical (because it focused on housing discrimination and aimed to keep gay people, like blacks, in their place).
Reactions to Ms. Young-Bruehl's analysis will depend on readers' tolerance for or aversion to Freud -- whom Frederick Crews and others have pronounced dead but who seems to have a bottomless capacity to resurrect himself. Her interpretations boast the familiar psychoanalytic virtues of richness, nuance and complexity: they probe to a psychological depth appropriate to the intensity and irrationality of the ideas in question. But they can be criticized, as can most psychoanalytic interpretations, for lacking the sort of broad-based empirical support that social scientists require before a provocative hypothesis can claim the status of knowledge. If, for example, the phallic mother seems more a product of Freud's overheated imagination than a psychic reality open to demonstration, Ms. Young-Bruehl's entire analysis of sexism will be in danger of collapse.
Some will also complain that her sexual interpretation of white racism does scant justice to the social and economic realities that separate black and white experience in this country, realities that have no counterpart in the lives of Jews, women or gay people. One need not be a Marxist to believe that hostility to African-Americans is firmly grounded in fears of a criminal and potentially revolutionary ghetto underclass, which, when it looks for employment,
poses a direct threat to lower-middle-class whites. Envious fantasies about oversexed bodies may well be secondary to these more rudimentary concerns.
Ms. Young-Bruehl's interpretation of sexism as a denial of difference is likely to offend feminists at both ends of the political spectrum. On the one hand, so-called "difference feminists" see the error of sexism not as the denial of difference but as the unwillingness to appreciate what is uniquely feminine. On the other hand, theorists like Judith Butler (who does not attract Ms. Young-Bruehl's interest in "The Anatomy of Prejudices") contend that sexual differences are as much "socially constructed" as are gender differences. Such feminists will reject as "essentialist" the assertion, borrowed from the anthropologist and psychoanalyst George Devereux, that the division of humanity into males and females, anatomically and reproductively distinct, is "an irreducible fact" whose psychotic denial lies at the root of sexism.
The interpretation of homophobia, particularly the emphasis on fear of effeminacy, is the most persuasive of Ms. Young-Bruehl's four cases. Even those who doubt that sexual envy is at the heart of racism or that the denial of sexual difference is at the heart of sexism will very likely agree that homosexuals are hated because they trigger erotic anxieties, above all the bigot's fear of his own homosexual desires. The critic Leo Bersani has analyzed homophobia as a defense against the idea that anal intercourse gives gay men access to the terrifying extravagance of female sexuality -- that it threatens, as Ms. Young-Bruehl also insists, to abolish the difference between the sexes.
Sometimes Ms. Young-Bruehl brands as prejudices views that should more properly be treated as matters of political opinion. One need not be a hysteric to oppose affirmative action or a narcissist to oppose abortion. Nor is anything gained by imputing sexism to a scientist like Edward O. Wilson, who argues that differences between the sexes are the result of sociobiological evolution. Such aspersions mar what is otherwise a judicious, even generous treatment of the thinkers with whom she disagrees.
By anchoring prejudices in the unconscious, Ms. Young-Bruehl might seem to offer a counsel of despair. What is to be done about such intractable psychic formations? "The Anatomy of Prejudices" contains no sustained discussion of the way out. Sometimes she speaks about the importance of education, the preferred antidote of the social scientists, whose analyses she otherwise finds so superficial. But she seems to think the best hope lies in action, including political action, on the part of the victims. Thus she commends gay people for coming out of the closet and, in organizations like Queer Nation ("We're here, we're queer, get used to it" ), for confronting their oppressors. But is there any comparable response to so intimate and often invisible a prejudice as sexism (a prejudice directed, after all, against one's mother, wife and daughters) or so socially rooted and comfortable a prejudice as racism (whose main victims reside far away and lead dangerously exotic lives)?
Still, as an analysis of the sources of prejudice, "The Anatomy of Prejudices" is bold and profound. Along with Theodor Adorno's "Authoritarian Personality," Hannah Arendt's "Origins of Totalitarianism," Gordon Allport's "Nature of Prejudice" and Gavin Langmuir's "Toward a Definition of Antisemitism," it is one of the rare studies to explore this vexed topic with the conceptual ambition and passion it deserves.

Democracy's Discontent America in Search of a Public Philosophy.
 By Michael J. Sandel.
 417 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
 The Belknap Press/
 Harvard University Press. $24.95.
Fourteen years ago, a young aspiring political theorist, Michael J. Sandel, published a book that justifiably made his name. Called "Liberalism and the Limits of Justice," it was a razor-sharp thumbnail critique of the liberal theorist John Rawls. Its central argument was that liberals who based their political theory on the supremacy of individual rights were presupposing an individual who existed prior to his country, community and family, someone whose political and moral choices were completely free of the encumbrances and entrapments of human loyalties. But where were such people to be found? Not even in the Harvard faculty lounge, Mr. Sandel had the temerity to suggest. 
 The popular term for this critique of rights-based liberalism became "communitarianism." Communitarians argued, against liberals, that citizens, far from existing prior to the society or the state, were rather the creations of their political and cultural environment. These citizens had loyalties that made their choices complicated, and sometimes not choices at all. Occasionally, indeed, they understood that their rights should give way before the goods their society aspired to -- goods they had come to regard as inseparable from their own sense of self. If politics failed to address that self, it was a curiously estranged politics, incapable of inspiring loyalty or commitment. So instead of rights, communitarians preferred to talk about goods; instead of interests, they talked about virtues; instead of procedures, they talked about goals.
Fourteen years later, Mr. Sandel has written a book that argues -- well, exactly the same thing. The language is a little different: for communitarianism, read "civic republicanism." Also new this time are two things: Mr. Sandel has elegantly detailed the American origins of the politics he advocated in the first book; and he has tacked on an analysis of our current sense of discontent to suggest that his civic republicanism is in some way a solution.
Both additions raise as many questions as they answer, but they engage nonetheless. "Democracy's Discontent: America in Search of a Public Philosophy" is, like "Liberalism and the Limits of Justice," beautifully and mildly argued, in the rhetorical style of a sedated Barry Scheck. Mr. Sandel conveys ideas with patient lucidity, tiptoeing up to notions that might truly startle, only to pull back at the brink. "Democracy's Discontent," then, is a model of the gently engaging polity Mr. Sandel has always wished we lived in. (Disclosure: I studied political theory with him when I was a Harvard graduate student, and was one of the many teaching fellows in two of his popular undergraduate courses.)
The book's strength is historical. For the largest part, Mr. Sandel takes us back through the texts of American constitutional history, and detects in many of the arguments that did not win an alternative politics to the one that is now ascendant. Take religious liberty. He reminds us that the notion that the Government should be strictly neutral on religion is of relatively recent origin. Religious neutrality was not established by the Supreme Court until 1947; the First Amendment's strictures on establishment of religion were not designed to apply to the states, and at the time, six of the thirteen had an established religion. Maryland required belief in God as a condition of public office as recently as 1961. So when liberals tub-thump about Jefferson's "wall of separation between church and state," and describe all their opponents as beyond the constitutional pale, they would do well to calm down. They might even take a moment to see the costs of stripping public life of any religious dimension whatever.
Mr. Sandel's philosophical take on history, however, does more than nudge us out of our contemporaneity. He shows, through close readings of Supreme Court decisions, how philosophical conceptions of the person changed -- from a premise that an American will inherit a belief in God, for example, to one in which Americans are viewed as people whose religious faith is chosen like desserts at a restaurant. Faith is slowly reconceived as a matter of radical choice -- not a complex, changing but essential aspect of a person. And as Mr. Sandel puts it, in a reference to a 1985 decision by Justice John Paul Stevens, "Not all religious beliefs can be redescribed without loss as 'the product of free and voluntary choice by the faithful.' "
Mr. Sandel does some equally diligent historical digging to show how arguments about goods were just as prominent as arguments about rights in a variety of historical controversies: the debate over industrialization in the late 18th century; the free labor versus wage labor debates of the mid-19th century; even the civic liberalism of Robert F. Kennedy in the late 1960's. Throughout, American history is, in Mr. Sandel's telling, a story of the tragic loss of civic republicanism -- the notion that liberty is not about freedom from government, but about the capacity for self-government, which alone makes the practice of freedom possible.
But there's something a little glossed-over in this account. Not how civic republicanism lost, but why. It was surely not, as Mr. Sandel shows, merely because of a fickle group of Supreme Court Justices. The answer, for Mr. Sandel, seems to be part contingent, part economic, part philosophical. But he never really grapples with the most obvious explanation: the increasing cultural diversity of all Western societies, the growing isolation of individuals from their backgrounds, the fast-expanding porousness of most people's minds to the shock and interest of others. That is why, surely, the strictures against public religion ultimately tightened -- not because a few Justices were atheists, but because more and more Americans could not conceive of their citizenship as implying a set of religious assumptions, or because, when they did, they disagreed about which ones. And when one entertains this idea, the history of America takes on a radically different hue. Perhaps procedural liberalism was not imposed upon Americans; perhaps, like any successful political theory, it emerged in order to reflect them.
Of course, many Americans have come to regret this; but like many regrets, this one springs from an understanding that it is irreversible. Mr. Sandel suggests otherwise. He argues that the empty center of liberalism was never inevitable, and that its pre-eminence today is the source of an unnecessarily destabilizing discontent. Well, maybe. But why was the First Amendment written in the first place, at the core of our understanding of a federal government? And why, one wonders, doesn't Mr. Sandel go whole hog and argue that the results of procedural liberalism should be reversed? In fact, he is strangely reticent on the question, never proposing, for example, to reverse the Court decisions on freedom of speech or religion. (What a stink that would make in the government department!) His final prescriptions, then, have a whimpering quality to them: social organizing, community-friendly architecture and fewer Wal-Marts.
Moreover, the assumption behind Mr. Sandel's dichotomy of cozy civic republicanism and alienating procedural liberalism is a phony one. The truth, of course, is that liberalism was conceived as a way to preserve some form of livable peaceful community. Perhaps it takes living in a 17th-century theocracy or a 20th-century dictatorship to appreciate how a forced community is, in fact, no community at all. And to see that contemporary attempts at a more binding politics -- from Robert Putnam's to Amitai Etzioni's -- can be cloying, and ultimately irrelevant, diversions from the rigors of constructing life together in modernity.
The problem with Mr. Sandel's second book, as with his first, is that its wistful critique of modern rights-based liberalism serves to convince the reader not only of the limits of liberalism but also of its destiny. His contribution is to remind us of what we lost long, long ago -- an easy sense of constitutive belonging, a citizenship that elevates without repressing. His failure is to pretend that this citizenship can be blithely resurrected, that law can still impose what society must now aspire to.

Think of the Laughs A Lab Could Cook Up

BYLINE: By James Gorman; James Gorman is deputy science editor of The New York Times and the author of "The Man With No Endorphins."

 BODY:
THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I CAN SEE
with Leon Lederman's plan to develop a prime-time television show about science -- something on the order of "L.A. Lab" or "N.Y.U. Blue" -- is that it wouldn't be a sitcom and he's not starring in it.
Lederman has no background in television, or film, or theater. He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1988, but he doesn't have an Emmy or an Oscar to his name. And while other producers have been busy taking meetings, Lederman has been discovering the muon neutrino, the neutral K-meson and the bottom quark. 
 He's also the director emeritus of the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Ill., and a recent pioneer in science education. None of this should be held against him, because he is also one of the funniest Nobel laureates in America, maybe the funniest.
Somehow, he got the idea that there should be more science on television. Not more shows like "Nova," but a weekly prime-time dramatic show. Lawyers, doctors and cops have shows; why not scientists?
He's serious. And his purpose is serious. Lederman is worried about the American public, and he wants to reach every last one of them. Not just the opera and molecular-biology audience that you get on public television, but the real down-in-the-couch "Unsolved Mysteries" crowd as well.
"We're riding a tide of anti-science," he says. The public grasp of complicated scientific and technological issues is "a recipe for disaster." So Lederman and other scientists want to try to get people to understand what science does, that it is a process of testing out ideas, of using reason, of trying to figure things out, not a remote voice of authority. "Science has to do with skepticism," says Lederman. "Science is tentative."
Somehow Lederman wangled $95,000 from the National Science Foundation's education branch and the Department of Energy. (Well maybe it's not that hard to figure out how.) He enlisted the help of the television producer Adrian Malone, who did "The Ascent of Man" and "Cosmos" -- good shows, both of them, but noticeably short on car chases. He and Malone have come up with a plan for a show about a research institute called GRALE (General Research at the Leading Edge).
I haven't seen any scripts; I just talked to Lederman and Malone. But what they're working on does sound an awful lot like regular television. Here's the setup: American industry, fed up with the failure of the Federal Government to boost science, has set up an interdisciplinary institution, supported by giant corporations, run by a charismatic dean and investigating the most basic, scary and cool ideas about people and the universe. Malone assures me that the show will include sex and violence, "but no car chases."
So far the project is in the talking stage, Lederman says, sounding like someone with a script in his pocket at a cocktail party. "We do have possibilities," he says. "We had a crack at Steven Bochco. The word was, he thought it was great but he doesn't do scientists."
To put this in scientific terms, Lederman and Malone have a working hypothesis, but they haven't persuaded anybody to finance the experiment. It's not often you get to point out a potential problem in the experimental protocol of a Nobel laureate, but this is one of those times. Leon and Adrian (get used to being addressed by your first names), you picked the wrong model for the television show. It should be a sitcom.
I'm not the first to suggest this, but since Lederman and Malone haven't changed tracks, yet, maybe they need convincing. Television drama errs in the direction of overstatement. Television comedy, on the other hand, veers toward understatement. Understatement is better. Think what "The Bob Newhart Show" did for psychotherapists, what "Cheers" did for bartenders, what "Seinfeld" has done for wastrels.
Furthermore, Lederman's talent as a storyteller is for humor. In his recent book "The God Particle," he has an imagined conversation with Democritus in the middle of the night at Fermilab. Questioning the ghost's obvious amusement at what he sees, Lederman says: "We don't need a Laughing Philosopher. At Fermilab, I tell all the jokes."
He's not the only funny scientist. Irreverence and humor are, in fact, tied to the virtues of science Lederman wants to trumpet, the skepticism and willingness to overturn accepted ideas. And why invent some giant multidisciplinary institute where people worry if their work will make the atmosphere catch on fire when you've already got Fermilab? What could be better than a sitcom set in a particle accelerator?
Imagine for a moment a scientific institute just west of Chicago set on 7,000 acres and built around a circular, underground particle accelerator four miles in circumference. The berm of earth covering the circle can be seen in satellite photos, as can the moat of cooling water around it. Inside the ring is a restored prairie, with trumpeter swans and sandhill cranes in rainwater ponds. Nearby a herd of buffalo grazes on the institute's grounds. Once a year the scientists at the institute have a buffalo dinner, and once a year they have a ceremonial run around the accelerator. It takes them a half-hour or so. The particles travel at near the speed of light.
THE DIRECTOR IS A BRILLIANT, FUNNY experimental physicist. He likes to claim Stonehenge is an ancient particle accelerator that, accounting for inflation, cost $8 billion. Of that, $5 billion was for labor. ("The rest was for ropes.") He is no deracinated television invention. He is a Jewish atheist who graduated from City College in the 1940's, like several other Nobel laureates in physics, and has a compelling mixture of street smarts, erudition and irreverence. Throw in competing geniuses, a bowling alley and a concert hall, arguments about coffee, chess, music, a little sex -- and the desire of each of many very smart people to win a Nobel Prize and become a revered raconteur who runs a scientific institute -- and you've got a sure winner.
Lederman could probably do better than this. After all, he knows more about Fermilab than I do. And he's a genius. Even more important when it comes to television and other forms of mass communication, he's not proud. "If I had a friend who could do skywriting," he said, "I'd try that." Even if the television show does work out, he has other plans: "We're thinking of getting on cereal boxes." He also mentions McDonald's place mats. And he's serious. I think.

Some New Looks at Old Mother-and-Child Themes

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS BRAFF 

 BODY:

"Mother and Child: A Contemporary View"
 Arlene Bujese Gallery, 66 Newtown La., East Hampton. To May 30. 324-2823.
Sentiment is the expectation in a mother-and-child theme show. Yet it is curiosity about the variety of interpretations here that quickly becomes the dominant feeling in this potpourri of styles and ideas. 
 Helen Meyrowitz's powerful charcoal drawing of a broad-winged bird that hovers over a nest of her birdlets depicts maternal instincts in nonhumans, for example, while an eerily distorted all-white Renaissance-inspired Madonna by Ronald Stein puts vibrant tension into a usually serene subject.
Maternal caring mixes with geography and current events in several instances. A smiling, adoring Haitian mother is totally absorbed with her baby in Ann Chwatsky's photographic closeup, but the child seems completely fascinated by the camera. In Amel Emric's documentary photographs of Bosnian families, tenderness and smiles are noticeably absent. Instead, a tough, tired resignation prevails, even among the youngest children.
These, and a dozen or so other pieces, are among the show's strengths. To some extent the overall impact is diluted, however, by works that are less interesting in comparison.
One highlight, Alice Neel's drawing "Poverty in Spanish Harlem," from 1947, is the earliest example and one that contributes the important metaphor of food-serving to a survey dealing with maternal nurturing. Rendered in the genre spirit of social description, its psychological observations and folksy style have held up well. Another early anchor, Alfonso Ossorio's 1950 drawing of a mother and child woven into a dense surface scheme, links to the artist's chapel series and adds a note of strong spiritual tradition.
Perimeters for the show are so broad that even the embryonic prebirth phase of the mother-and-child relationship is present in depictions of pregnancy by several artists, including Larry Rivers and Tino Nivola.
Memory, and the edgy problem of grasping and defining its accuracy and boundaries, is central to Pam Erickson Davis's wall sculpture that features two baby photographs of the artist shown with her mother on a brick stoop. The images are enclosed within a shrinelike form fashioned from clay imitations of the brick steps.
The theme's potential in nonrepresentational art is explored, too, in abstract examples that use paired forms as metaphors for humans. Eric Ernst's boldly colored "They Say She Looks Just Like Her Mother" is one example that stands out.
 
Margaret Kerr: The Brick Years, 1986-1996
 Guild Hall Museum, 158 Main St., East Hampton. To June 9. 324-0806.
There is a good overview here of the way Ms. Kerr treats bricks as a material that can be coaxed towards a variety of artistic expressions. As might be expected, formal sculptural compositions are important to her experimentation, but her range includes rug configurations that connote prayer rituals, brick dust handled as a painterly element, brick powder shaped into humorous Pop objects and installation pieces that carry a specific emotional message. This sizeable exhibtion comes as part of the Best-in-Show award, which Ms. Kerr received in the 1993 edition of Guild Hall's annual member's show.
The installation pieces (sometimes arranged on slabs or pedestals) provide a substantial and largely successful test of how far Ms. Kerr can travel with her chosen material. "Memorial," a mountainous pile of black grosgrain banded bricks, builds its effective metaphor for lost lives by showing the brick symbols as irregularly heaped and no longer capable of a role in establishing order. In another metaphoric installation piece, subtitled "For My Mother," old branded bricks form sequential columns, as if they were presenting a progression of life's episodes.
Along with these cerebrally engaging pieces, the show's strongest works are the wall pieces formed by repeated geometric units arranged in gridlike, yet frequently dynamic schemes. It is actually the first in the series, the 1988 "Shadows From Old Fires," that emerges as most notable. It balances the rigidity of its border of angled brick facets with more ephemeral, two-dimensional, brick-dust-on-paper echoes of the diagonal design in each of 21 central squares. Nicely demonstrated, too, is the role that cast shadows have in creating additional repeats of the main angular form. Blending the structural and the painterly sets up a vibrant interplay.
Brick dust's potential for soft edged, misty, abstract textural effects is explored in other examples. These emphasize nuances and underscore the role of varying tonalities and surface textures in Ms. Kerr's approach.
 
Charles Waller
 Morgan Rank Gallery, 4 Newtown La., East Hampton. To May 28. 325-7615.
Wit and a facile imagination have brought Mr. Waller considerable success in the 20 years since he finished art school, and his drawings have appeared in newspapers and magazines here and abroad. His feeling for embellishment and fantasy, plus his sense of the satirical, are strong ingredients in the recent explorations of large three-dimensional wall pieces that are shown here for the first time.
The careful crafting of a well-trained artist sets these found-object assemblages apart from the untutored expressions that have obviously inspired their style and their use of recycled materials. Everything presents strongly, even if there is more than a hint of artifice in the folksy approach.
The humor comes across as sincere, nevertheless, even though a number of the puns are almost too clever for their pseudonaive delivery.
Observations of our life and times provide some of the sharpest pieces. "Inflation" is a huge green $3 bill that features a chunky can-faced George Washington, wearing an ascot of decoratively embossed pressed tin. The high-impact well-crafted "Guilt Trip" depicts a profile cranium in sections labeled with vices like sloth, envy and greed.
A flag-motif shirt links this figure to the show's "Americomania" title. The bird-headed bleading-heart figure inscribed "E Pluribus Unum" is a particularly successful example in this series.
As a boy growing up in various foreign lands in connection with his father's oil business, Mr. Waller was motivated to stress his American heritage and also to create his own playthings. Both background details clearly have a role in these new experiments.
"Boner" is perhaps the most winning toylike example, Its top hatted skeleton figure raises white-gloved hands in a vaudeville dance pose and nicely develops the balance between sophisticated fiction and playful street art that is generally characteristic of this work.

The Fine Art of Making (Movie) Mockery

BYLINE: By Brenda Maddox; Brenda Maddox, who lives in London, is the author, most recently, of "D. H. Lawrence: The Story of a Marriage."

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
THE SQUALOR OF RURAL Britain before designer kitchens had to be seen to be believed. This writer first saw it in the early 1960's at a rundown farmhouse where two Cambridge graduates had fled -- to escape the wicked city, have too many children and pretend to farm. Only one end of the long kitchen table was ever cleared for what passed for meals. The other end supported assorted clothing, agricultural implements, battered copies of The New Statesman and a child's potty.
On Sunday, as the assembled multitude sat down to dinner, a horse poked his nose through the door, and the mother of the family, finding herself a plate short for the apple crumble, reached for the cat's dish on the floor, rinsed it under the tap and filled it with the rest. 
 Luckily, the newly arrived American had been given "Cold Comfort Farm" as an orientation text, so there was no surprise. But it was equally clear that only in a book could Miss Flora Poste exist: a practical young Englishwoman who detests messes and, descending from London upon her unspeakable country relatives in darkest Sussex, succeeds in organizing them out of theirs.
Stella Gibbons's classic novel was her first, published in 1932 when she was 30. She wrote it, so legend has it, on the Underground, on daily journeys to and from work on various Fleet Street newspapers. Recently called by one critic (Julie Burchill in The Sunday Times of London) "very probably the funniest book ever written," "Cold Comfort Farm" was an instant hit in the England of George V, a time when debutantes were presented at court, contraception was for sophisticates and psychoanalysis was an exotic and ludicrous foreign import.
And now "Cold Comfort Farm," the movie, which opened to good notices in half a dozen theaters in the United States on May 10, is being introduced to a wider audience.
Turning a well-known book into a movie is fraught with peril. Very few make the transition successfully, often only at the price of total transformation. A complex story can become a simpler and more personal and pictorial one, as happened, one can argue, with both "Gone With the Wind" 57 years ago and "Sense and Sensibility" last fall. The obvious problem is the loss of the authorial voice. Passages of description that belong to the unseen narrator are either assigned to one of the characters to speak aloud, thus requiring them to know more than that character should, or are omitted altogether.
SATIRE COMPOUNDS THE difficulty. Mocking words do not make mocking pictures. Often the joke disappears entirely, as with John Updike's "Witches of Eastwick," or one is added where there was none before. The macabre humor of "Dr. Strangelove" emerged from a straight techno-thriller, Peter George's "Red Alert" (written under the pen name Peter Bryant).
"Cold Comfort Farm" makes little sense without the social context skillfully conveyed by the author's controlled ironic prose. The plot depends upon the unfeelingness of the English upper classes of the 1930's -- the revulsion from sentiment. Flora Poste is an ungrieving orphan of 19 whose education -- "expensive, athletic and prolonged" -- was bestowed by parents whom she hardly ever saw and whose sudden deaths of Spanish influenza left her with "every art and grace save that of earning her own living."
But the director John Schlesinger and the writer, the novelist Malcolm Bradbury -- making the film for the BBC and Thames Television -- faced an even tougher obstacle. "Cold Comfort Farm" is a literary satire. It parodies the kind of novel epitomized by D. H. Lawrence's "Rainbow," which romanticizes what Gibbons described with mock admiration as "nature at her rawest, in man and in landscapes." Flora aspires to become such a novelist and moves into a squalid farmhouse with her cousins, the rural Starkadders, not only to have a home but, she says, to begin "collecting material."
Florid style is relatively easy to parody on the printed page. Gibbons gets her spoof off to a magnificent start, with an effusive introduction to a friend, a writer of Literature, whose books "give me (in the midst of the vulgar and meaningless bustle of newspaper offices) joy." To help reviewers and others "who are not always sure whether a sentence is Literature or whether it is just sheer flapdoodle," she says that she has indicated her book's finer passages, as if in a Baedeker travel guide, with one, two or three stars. Thus Flora makes a two-star arrival in Sussex, as "dawn crept over the Downs like a sinister white animal. . . ."
At the denouement, as Gibbons pairs off her characters in unlikely combinations of town and country, she allows herself to mention Lawrence by name. Her intellectual Mr. Mybug, a Londoner who sees the countryside as a place rampant with sexual symbol, asks the Starkadder maid to be his wife on the ground that, "by God, D. H. Lawrence was right when he had said there must be a dumb, dark, dull, bitter belly-tension between a man and a woman, and how else could this be achieved save in the long monotony of marriage."
Mr. Schlesinger, whose many honors include Academy Awards for "Midnight Cowboy" and "Darling," knew what he was up against in tackling a literary satire. "The whole of this aspect of the film took quite a bit of thought and didn't happen immediately," he says in promotional materials issued upon the American release of the film.
When "Cold Comfort Farm" was shown on the BBC in January 1995, most critics felt that the parodic aspect did not happen at all. Flora's literary pretensions are illustrated, for example, by showing her writing on the train to Sussex, with a copy of "The Rainbow" bearing D. H. Lawrence's name conspicuously displayed in front of her. But does the audience get the point?
Like Evelyn Waugh and Charles Dickens, Gibbons relies on the verbal trick of funny names to show the absurdity of her characters. But the litany -- Ada Doom, Adam Lambsbreath, Mrs. Smiling, Dick Hawk-Monitor and cows named Aimless and Graceless -- is less funny uttered aloud. So is dialect. " 'Tes wickedness! 'Tes flying in the face of Nature!" cries the hired girl Meriam Beetle when Flora coolly explains the ways in which a young woman may avoid having a baby every year.
Mr. Schlesinger uses stars, too, but stars too bright for the caricatures they inhabit. The tragic face of Eileen Atkins suggests Clytemnestra more than it does Cousin Judith Starkadder. The formidable presence of Sir Ian McKellen overflows the caricature of her husband, Amos, part farmer, part fire-and-brimstone preacher to the Church of the Quivering Brethren. The comic actor Stephen Fry reeks of Jeeves rather than of Mr. Mybug, who is at work on a psychological study of Branwell Bronte to prove that he, not Emily, wrote "Wuthering Heights." And the large and luminous Joanna Lumley evokes Patsy Stone of "Absolutely Fabulous" far more than Mrs. Smiling, Flora's London mentor.
IT IS NOT SURPRISING, perhaps, that the most successful performance is by a relative unknown, Kate Beckinsale, as the improbable Flora. She manages to convey a young woman who, with her neat hair held firmly by a large bobby pin, is bossy but charming, righteous but sophisticated, helpless but omnipotent -- and above all absolutely certain that people will change their entire lives if spoken to slowly in a very clear voice.
The nearest cousin to "Cold Comfort Farm" among modern English novels may be Evelyn Waugh's "Scoop," a satire of Fleet Street journalists covering the Abyssinian War. It, too, contains similarly jarring Little Englander whiffs of xenophobia, even technophobia. A 1930's airplane, as in Gibbons's book, is used to comic effect. Yet its irony did not photograph well. In London Weekend Television's dramatization of "Scoop" in 1987, shown in the United States in 1990, the meticulously reconstructed aircraft and the breathtaking desert that stole the show, not the bewilderment of the young journalist, Boot, of The Beast.
"Cold Comfort Farm," as it now reaches movie screens in America, could well survive the loss of its satiric layer.
It is not clear whether the success of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" in the United States was owed to its sendup of the Church of England and the institution of marriage, or rather to its apparent portrayal of an England where the gentry still cavort under striped awnings in morning dress and top hats.
Is all of the current Austen mania a hunger for the sight of what Yeats called "leveled lawns and graveled ways," and for the diction and decorum that go with stately homes? Or is it a taste for the mordant economy of the English language, which can say a lot by saying little. If the second, then filmgoers may warm as well to the Starkadders as to the Bennets and enjoy a species of English family that looks like (in Flora Poste's words) "the Chamber of Horrors at Madame Tussaud's."
Schlesinger's movie certainly contains enough tuxedos, cigarette holders, marcelled hairdos and ballroom dancing to please the most avid 30's buff. But he hopes for more than that. Having already taken "Cold Comfort" to American festivals from Seattle to the Hamptons, he says hopefully that it plays remarkably well "with cinematically savvy audiences."
If it continues to do so when it moves to more theaters on Friday, he can bow his head with Flora over whom, at the end of "Cold Comfort Farm," the invisible but all-seeing narrator intones, "She had accomplished a great work; and had much to be thankful for."

HEADLINE: Sharp Divisions On Smoking Rules

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
REPUBLICAN leaders in the new Nassau Legislature appeared to be showing their emerging power last month when they won a three-month delay enforcing tougher smoking restrictions. The rules, due to take effect on July 1, have been postponed until Oct. 1.
But in taking on the writers of the rules, the County Board of Health, the Republicans locked horns with an independent agency that asserts a right to impose the rules without the consent of the Republican-controlled Legislature. 
 Both sides said they could settle the differences amicably and were eager to negotiate. But the seeds of a potentially divisive dispute seem to be planted.
The Board of Health was expected to vote on the delay when it meets on Tuesday.
The Republican legislators said that they supported strong restrictions, but that the rules should be the prerogative of elected officials rather than the appointed board. The legislators also raised questions about rules that they said were unfair to businesses and inconsistent with regulations in surrounding areas.
The restrictions, in some aspects the most stringent in the state, are intended to protect the public from second-hand smoke by requiring separately ventilated enclosed rooms for smokers in all public areas, including restaurants, work places, bowling centers, bingo parlors, movie houses, theaters, sports arenas and stores.
The rules also limit the space set aside for smokers at those sites and require that half of all hotel and motel rooms be permanently designated as no-smoking rooms.
The five-member board, which unanimously approved the rules on Jan. 22, said it agreed to the Oct. 1 date to let legislators express their concerns. The rules have also not received final approval from the State Health Department.
"We are more than willing to discuss with anybody, but what we will do as a result is something else," said Bruce A. Lister, the chairman of the board, who added that under the County Charter and state law the board did not need legislative approval to act.
The board said the new rules would "generally bring Nassau County law up to the level of protection provided in New York City and Suffolk County," where regulations are "more protective of public health" than those that Nassau and the state now have.
The board cited findings by the Environmental Protection Agency that tobacco smoke was a carcinogen that causes 3,000 lung-cancer deaths a year among nonsmokers and significant health problems for a far greater number of nonsmokers, with children most at risk.
Mr. Lister said the board held three hearings and deliberated for 18 months before its vote.
The Presiding Officer of the Legislature, Bruce A. Blakeman, Republican of Woodmere, said the delay would allow time for the State Legislature to enact statewide smoking ordinances. "Even if the State Legislature does not pass a law," Mr. Blakeman said, "it gives us an opportunity on the County Legislature to discuss with the board those things we feel are inconsistent. The objections are not based on whether the regulations are stricter, but whether they are fair. We would like to see something a little more consistent."
He said neither Suffolk nor New York City restricted smoking in hotels and motels. He said that New York City exempted restaurants with fewer than 35 seats from its regulations, but that Nassau did not. Restrictions in bowling centers in Nassau would also be tighter than in neighboring areas, he said.
Mr. Blakeman said he and other legislators asked the Board of Health in early January, immediately after the Legislature took office, to delay voting on the rules until the legislators had reviewed them. He said County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta had joined in the request.
But the board, "without notice, enacted sweeping changes" Mr. Blakeman said, adding that the vote fueled concerns that other agencies might enact rules that should be voted on by the Legislature.
Mr. Blakeman had initially proposed a moratorium, retroactive to Jan. 1, on new regulations from the Board of Health and some other agencies. Another group of agencies was to have been exempt.
Mr. Blakeman said that the proposal for a moratorium would be set aside while the legislators negotiate with the Board of Health.
The minority leader, Bruce Nyman, Democrat of Long Beach, said the postponement of the rules was unrelated to the Republicans' pressure. Mr. Nyman said the board had no other recourse because the State Health Department had not approved the regulations, not leaving enough time to notify business owners before July 1.
"The delay had absolutely nothing to do with the Republican threat of a moratorium," Mr. Nyman said. "It was based strictly on time constraints. Blakeman and some of his boys were angered that the Board of Health acted without checking with them first. And that is unfortunate, because the Board of Health is under no legal obligation to do that. That's what they fail to understand."
A spokesman for Mr. Gulotta, David Vieser, confirmed that Mr. Gulotta asked the Board of Health in January to delay the vote and that Mr. Gulotta was trying to mediate an agreement between the board and the Republican legislators.
Restaurateurs and other business owners said the restrictions were confusing, cut profits and imposed financial hardships on small businesses.
The president of the Long Island Hospitality and Tourism Coalition, Jerry Kusack, said the rules that the Suffolk Legislature approved in 1994 requiring separate ventilated rooms for smokers in restaurants had resulted in losses of profits of 15 to 30. Supporters of the regulations challenge those figures.
"It's hurting the small restaurants that can't afford the conversions," Mr. Kusack said. "Everyone is also afraid the law will be changed again a year from now."
The chief enforcer in Suffolk, Richard Meyer of the Health Services Department, said a few restaurants or other businesses had flouted the rules. Mr. Meyer said that as many as 400 of the 2,200 food establishments, including many diners, had designated separate smokers' rooms. Others, including fast food restaurants, simply banned smoking, he said.
"From the prospective of the fast-food franchises," Mr. Meyer said, "booth turnover is probably the greatest single economic interest they face. So the regulations were probably a positive for them."
In 1984, Suffolk enacted the most sweeping antismoking law in the country, when it required that at least 20 percent of the seating in restaurants be in no-smoking areas.
Since then mounting evidence about the dangers of tobacco smoke has led to a host of regulations by states and localities that far surpass the Suffolk law.
In Suffolk and New York City, where new rules took effect a year ago, elected officials imposed the regulations. In Nassau and Westchester, Boards of Health have imposed them. Officials said the differing approaches reflected county charters and established practices.
The state created local boards of health to enact health ordinances without political interference. "The theory is that health is so important to the public that it should not be subject to the winds of the political process," said Mr. Meyer.
But boards sometimes respond to opposition from elected officials and the public. In 1991 the seven-member Suffolk Board of Health set off a furor by considering a regulation to add fluoride to water supplies, an effort that lapsed.
 
Nassau's New Rules on Smoking
The state prohibits or strictly limits smoking in nearly all public indoor settings. The Clean Indoor Air Law prohibits smoking in elevators, auditoriums and theaters, as well as school grounds. Smoking is allowed in designated sections of restaurants.

HEADLINE: A School's Partners In Building Careers

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WHEN 17-year-old Joycelyn Gathers entered Career High School in New Haven four years ago, she had no idea what direction her life would take.
But an innovative program called Kids First, which is giving New Haven's 46 schools more autonomy while encouraging businesses to actively participate in educating students, Ms. Gathers got the chance to work as an intern at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A year and a half ago she was hired as a part-time paid employee in the hospital's billing department. 
 "I know what I want to do with my life now, and I really do owe it all to having the chance to volunteer and work at the hospital," said Ms. Gathers, who will graduate next month and is planning a career as an actuary or hospital administrator.
She said that volunteering in several different departments at Yale has provided her a good view of both medical and nonmedical career options. For her, she said, working in the nonmedical area was preferable.
New Haven's decentralized school approach allows principals, teachers and parents to play a much larger role in deciding what programs and curriculum are best for their particular schools. The approach also gives students job opportunities and training they never had before. In the works for about a decade, the program gained momentum last year with a $100,000 gift from the Rockefeller Foundation to develop new management models in four schools.
At Career High School, a magnet school that emphasizes health and business education, a business partnership with Yale-New Haven Hospital has opened the doors for students to one of the country's top teaching medical centers.
"It's a perfect example of what we mean by Kids First," said Amanda Bittle, a computer science and business education teacher at Career High who serves as its liaison to the hospital. "These are urban students who never could have gotten this kind of hands-on experience and up-close look at both the medical field and other hospital related fields. It's a program that we take a lot of pride in."
Ms. Bittle said the school's planning and management team determined that the hospital program was a vital one. Now each of the city's public schools has its own school planning and management team made up of teachers, parents, school staff members and students that plans and coordinates school activities and programs.
And in the years ahead these teams will be taking on a greater decision-making role over curriculum, personnel and even budget, as part of an effort to encourage on-site management, according to the New Haven School Superintendent, Reginald Mayo.
"We want to give educators who work right in the schools the chance to make the important decisions that impact their students," said Mr. Mayo. "This is the way education must go in the future, particularly in urban school districts where there are so many different needs in the different schools."
Mr. Mayo said that historically the New Haven Public School District -- Connecticut's third largest with 19,500 students -- has been rigidly married, like most districts in the United States, to top-down organizational structure, from the central office to the schools.
"We are determined to dramatically change that because we believe that when you give people more control, they take greater ownership and are more productive, responsible and accountable for what they are doing," Mr. Mayo said.
He said the district was using the Rockefeller Foundation grant to develop on-site management models in four schools, including Career High School, that will eventually be emulated by every public school in New Haven.
At the heart of the effort is a model developed by James Comer, director of the Yale Child Center, which encourages active parental involvement at every level of of school activity, planning and management teams in every school and mental health teams to deal with district-wide issues and individual student cases.
"The Comer model is perfect for the overall Kids First approach," said Lystra Richardson, a New Haven teacher who has sent the past three years studying Mr. Comer's model in school districts from Seattle to New Orleans. "The reason it is so critical for New Haven is that we have such a large number of poor and minority students," she said.
Ms. Richardson said that while educators have traditionally been well prepared to deal with the students in the middle and higher socio-economic brackets, most systems have not been equipped to help poor students and meet their needs.
"We've got to be better prepared to deal with students as they really are, not as we ideally think of them and want them to be," Ms. Richardson said. "Many students don't have enough to eat, can't afford decent clothes and are dealing with all the pressures at home and in their inner-city neighborhoods. These are things we've got to be cognizant of in an urban school system."
And because jobs are so vital to any student, school officials said, an important part of the Kids First program involves more than 30 school-business partnerships initiated by the city's Public Education Fund, a private nonprofit group spun off from the Community Foundation for Greater New Haven in 1991.
"The Kids First approach takes into consideration the entire development of the child, not just the academic component, but the social, the creative and career components as well," said Patricia Brett, executive director of the Public Education Fund. "The most important thing we can do for urban students is to show them the correlation between education and the quality of life. And I think with our 30 business partnerships we're doing that."
Teachers, parents and principals said that the approach helps students get a better-rounded education and provides them with a clearer vision of what they can do with their lives.
"I think our school system has taken on the most progressive approach of any urban school district in the country," said Sabrina Bruno, a parent with boys in the third and seventh grades. "They are really trying to develop ways to meet the needs of every single child," she said of the school system's central staff. "It's an ambitious and overwhelming task."
Ms. Bruno serves on her sons' school planning and management teams and on other local and state educational panels.
Ramona Gaticon, the principal at Beecher School, said that while change is a slow process, the approach is already paying off at her school, which stresses writing and the arts and maintains an active partnership with the United Illuminating Company.
"As we gain more and more autonomy and get the parents more involved in every aspect of their children's education, we are better able to meet the needs of our pupils," Ms. Gaticon said. "When we say Kids First," she added, "it's not just a slogan. We really mean it."

HEADLINE: Cash Shortfall May Lead to Short-Term Notes

BYLINE: By SUSAN BALL 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
FOR the first time, Westchester County is contemplating borrowing $30 million in revenue anticipation notes at the end of this year to cover an expected $16.5 million shortfall in cash flow.
With increasing delays in Federal and state budgets and reimbursements, as well as dwindling reserves, the county projects that it may need to issue the short-term notes, also called RAN's, in December. 
 "Our cash position has become tighter and tighter over the last few years," Finance Commissioner Eric B. Langeloh told the Citizens' Budget Advisory Committee recently. "We're laying out cash for mandated programs and not getting reimbursed in a timely fashion. If the trend continues we will be owed significant sums by the end of 1996. So we've put in the possibility of selling RAN's. The amount of money owed to the county for reimbursed programs that doesn't get to us by the last business day of December 1996 could amount to $16.5 million."
Mr. Langeloh said the county was confident that it could repay the notes by March 31, next year. Assuming an interest rate of 3.5 percent, the county would pay $350,000 in interest for the three-month period.
"If the pattern in Albany and Washington continues for another couple of years," Mr. Langeloh added in a telephone interview, "we might have to do it again."
Some critics said they were concerned that issuing the notes might indicate that the county is heading for financial trouble.
"In the history of public finance, the first signs of financial problems are in cash management-cash flow," said Joseph Rosenblum of Scarsdale, a member of the advisory committee. "The problem in reading the 1996 cash-flow projections is that the county is ending the year in a cash-deficit situation and says it is purely a timing problem. My concern is, Is that the case or is the county spending more revenues than are coming in?"
Mr. Rosenberg, who has worked in the public finance department of Moody's Investors Service and now directs municipal-credit research for an investment-management concern, continued: "If it's not just a timing problem, the county needs to cut spending or raise taxes. If there is indeed a problem, let's head it off now rather than be in serious trouble three years down the road."
John W. Mattis of Montrose, another member of the committee, said, "There is a definite cash outflow," referring to an analysis that showed that cash available in the general fund on Jan. 1 each year had dwindled -- to $1.6 million this year from $69 million in 1992.
"The problem with carrying over a $16.5 million deficit into next year is that they will have to make it up somehow in 1997 to get back to the status quo, plus having to pay back what they borrow," added Mr. Mattis, a financial planner.
The Budget Director, Joseph E. Phelan, said the increasing delays in reimbursements was the sole reason for the cash problem. Observing that 35.6 percent of county revenue was from property taxes, he said the other 64.4 percent was from other levels of government: 32.8 percent from Federal and state aid, 18.7 from sales taxes and 12.9 from other sources.
"On a $1 billion budget, $650 million comes from outside the county," Mr. Phelan said. "There's very little we can do until the state is ready to hand it down to us. Even the sales-tax schedule of reimbursement has changed. The state is holding on to it longer."
Robert E. Landry of White Plains, a accountant on the advisory panel, said the committee needed to know more about tracking the expenditures and reimbursements.
"That $650 million must be closely tied in to insure that all reimbursements do come in and that more than $650 million is not expended," Mr. Landry said. "You've got to have constant matching."
To complicate matters, the county operates on a January-to-December fiscal calendar, the state on an April-to-March calendar and the Federal Government on an October-to-September calendar.
The county, Mr. Langeloh said, has to make assumptions by January about what the state will do in April. Again this year, the state has not yet passed its budget for 1996-97, which was due last month. For years the county has borrowed money in January or February, in the form of tax anticipation notes, called TAN's, until it received tax revenues in May and October. Last year the county borrowed $75 million in tax anticipation notes. This year it is borrowing $100 million, to be repaid in December, along with $3.6 million in interest.
Mr. Langeloh said that in addition to the main problem of lagging reimbursements, a second factor is that the county has tried to keep taxes low, making budget cuts and switching to privatization.
Thomas J. Abinanti, Democrat of Greenburgh, a member of the Board of Legislators' Budget and Appropriations Committee, said he had asked for but had not received a breakdown of the amounts and when Federal and state aid arrives each year.
"We have to look at what we spend money on and when," Mr. Abinanti said. "If, in fact, we're suffering because the state and Federal Government are fouling things up, is there a better way for us to respond? And if it's not the state and Federal Government that's at fault here, then what are we doing wrong?"
Mr. Abinanti, who presented his concerns first to the Budget and Appropriations Committee and last month to the citizens' group, said another sign of trouble was that the county had switched the health insurance subfund, which had been in a separate account since December 1992, back to the general-fund cash flow at the end of 1995.
The opening cash-flow balance for 1995 was restated as $28.5 million, reflecting the infusion of $12.8 million from the insurance fund, "to complete the 1995 fiscal year in a positive cash position," Mr. Langeloh said in a memorandum responding to Mr. Abinanti. The fund was begun four years ago "for financial-reporting purposes only," Mr. Langeloh wrote.
But Mr. Abinanti told the advisory committee: "I just don't think we've managed this properly. I think things were done not on the basis of looking at cash flow, but more on the basis of what projects we should do and when, what taxes we should raise or not raise and other considerations. Nobody was looking at cash flow, except maybe a few experts, who might not have had the political power to say to the County Executive or to let the board know that we're having problems here. Then the Federal and state government gave them absolutely no room to maneuver."
Mr. Abinanti subsequently asked the Budget and Appropriations Committee to recommend changes in county practices "to insure that we do not lose our AAA bond rating, which is endangered by these financial shenanigans."
After obtaining the county's first-quarter 1996 cash-flow results in early May, the citizens' committee last Monday decided to ask the Finance Department for a concise explanation of the methods it uses to make monthly and quarterly projections of when it will receive state and Federal aid. "It is absolutely absurd to be reading cash-flow figures without supporting data," Mr. Landry said.
Observing that the county had projected that it would receive $5.9 million in state aid in February but actually received $10.4 million, George F. Hosey of Hawthorne, chairman of the citizens committee, said, "It would be helpful to see how $5.859 million was estimated and how it got to be $10.363 million."
The Board of Legislators set up the panel two years ago to review budget information and give the Legislators recommendations during the November-December budgetary process.
The nine-member committee, whose members have diverse financial and governmental backgrounds, now meets throughout the year.
Mr. Hosey said: "The committee comments on the new budget and monitors the existing budget. It also makes suggestions on reforming the process."

BYLINE: By LAUREL GRAEBER 

 BODY:

SALVATION ON SAND MOUNTAIN: Snake Handling and Redemption in Southern Appalachia
 By Dennis Covington. Penguin, $11.95.
The author's inquiry into a form of evangelical mysticism begins with the coverage of an Alabama minister's murder trial and ends with an examination of his own rural Appalachian roots. "It is a book of revelation -- brilliant, dire and full of grace," Lee K. Abbott said here last year.
 
 FOR EVERY SIN
 By Aharon Appelfeld. Translated by Jeffrey M. Green. Grove, $11.
The Holocaust figures frequently in the fiction of this author, who escaped from a Nazi labor camp when he was only a child. In this novel Theo, an adult survivor, seems to have lost his humanity in the concentration camp from which he was recently liberated. He pins his hopes on repudiation of his fellow victims, only to discover later the bond he and they share. In 1989 our reviewer, Francine Prose, praised the book's "seriousness of . . . purpose and its insistence on asking the most essential questions." The same questions are evoked in Mr. Appelfeld's TZILI, translated by Dalya Bilu (Grove, $11). The title character, a young dull-witted Jewish girl, manages to evade death through a mixture of luck and stoicism as German soldiers raze her town. "It is a highly original work, as much for the purity and austerity of its language as for the character of Tzili," Joyce Carol Oates wrote in the Book Review in 1983.
 
IN THE TIME OF THE AMERICANS: FDR, Truman, Eisenhower, Marshall, MacArthur -- The Generation That Changed America's Role in the World
 By David Fromkin. Vintage, $16.
Through a vigorous mixture of idealism and strength, the leaders profiled brought the United States out of isolationism and made it a powerful force for democracy, the author argues. The real hero of his narrative is Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose initiatives he greatly admires. David Fromkin "has a gift for seeing the world whole, and for packing complicated material into a few boldly stroked sentences," Richard Reeves said in these pages last year. F.D.R. is also at the heart of THE END OF REFORM: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War, by Alan Brinkley (Vintage, $14). The author maintains that his Administration lost much of its revolutionary clout when it abandoned Government intervention in favor of deficit spending. His account "exposes the practical and political logic of the deficit strategy," David M. Kennedy wrote here in 1995.
 
 A RIVER TOWN
 By Thomas Keneally. Plume, $12.95.
The setting is Australia at the turn of the century, where Tim Shea, an Irish immigrant shopkeeper, finds his attempts to be true to his own moral vision increasingly at odds with the community around him. Last year our reviewer, David Willis McCullough, said the story "is fired with the passion and hidden poetry that only a sure and experienced novelist can bring."
 
PAULA
 By Isabel Allende. Translated by Margaret Sayers
 Peden. Harper Perennial, $12.50.
The author gives a vivid account of her own life -- and of her child's dying -- in a memoir that was written as her 27-year-old daughter lay in a coma from a hereditary disease. Isabel Allende writes "with . . . irresistibly rhythmic prose, as if her narrative could distract death itself," Suzanne Ruta wrote in the Book Review in 1995.
 
THE DAY
 By Douglas Hobbie. John Macrae/Owl/Holt, $13.
The 24 hours in question are those of Thanksgiving, when Jack Fletcher accompanies his wife to Connecticut for her family's celebration. There he secretly mourns the suicide of Clare, his wife's sister and his former lover. "Mr. Hobbie's writing contains . . . a deep appreciation of the revealing details of human behavior," Maxine Chernoff said in these pages in 1993.
 
MAKING MOVIES
 By Sidney Lumet. Vintage, $12.
This is an insider's guide to how films are made, from the writing to the previews, with plenty of anecdotes drawn from this director's respected career. It is "a sane, even invaluable book," Roger Ebert wrote here last year. Also reissued is ROBERTO ROSSELLINI, by Peter Brunette (University of California, $16.95), a detailed examination of the 40-year career of the Italian director. "This book will surely become the standard reference for any filmgoer," our reviewer, Masolino d'Amico, said in 1987.
 
 TOBY'S LIE
 By Daniel Vilmure. Harper Perennial, $12.
There is much deceit here, from drug dealing to marital betrayal, but the deception that most concerns the hero is his concealment of his own homosexuality. The novel's "real accomplishment . . . is in depicting the emotional life of a teen-ager in all its colorful confusion," David Galef wrote in the Book Review last year.
 
 ROOTIE KAZOOTIE
 By Lawrence Naumoff. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $12.
Two women of the rural South -- one pugnacious and talkative, the other elegant and serene -- battle it out for the same man, switching roles in the process. The resulting novel is "a poignant piece of truth-telling about the most primal feelings," Rosemary Daniell said in these pages in 1990. Laurel Graeber

HEADLINE: For the Loft Movement, A Defining Moment

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI 

 BODY:
SOMEWHERE in the not-too-distant past, with a wink and a nod to the landlord, an unknown artist pushed a dolly loaded with large canvases -- or crates full of photographic equipment or, perhaps, a block of raw material clenching an unborn sculpture -- onto the freight elevator of a dank, deserted factory in lower Manhattan. And then, after unloading onto one of those expanses of floor where a platoon of poorly paid workers had once toiled, she or he bedded down for the night.
That mythic artist could not have known that night, three or four decades ago, that the seed of a significant transformation in the city's life style had been planted; that, in a period of fiscal turmoil when little housing was being built, desolate and foreboding factory districts would, in time, become vibrant, even chic, residential communities. And all that -- spurred by a tendentious band calling themselves loft pioneers -- would evolve without massive public investment. 
 Now the loft movement is at a defining moment, political officials and real estate executives say, a moment calling into question the city's longstanding policy of providing rent regulation and other protections for those original loft dwellers who created neighborhoods with their own sweat and money; a moment asking whether, in a market increasingly dominated by affluent buyers, there will still be a place for the struggling, renting artist. It is also a moment with implications for tenants in the more than 1.1 million rent-regulated apartments of New York City and State.
"If I didn't have this space, I would have to leave New York," said Vernita Nemec, a collage artist who pays "under $500" for an 1,100-square-foot loft above an audio store on Canal Street, the decor of which, she freely admits, is of the early yard-sale school. "This place is an artwork in progress," she said.
"It's an interesting phenomenon," said Ms. Nemec, who has lived and worked in the loft since 1972. "We made this property valuable and now they want to get us out."
Specifically, Article 7c of the state's Multiple Dwelling Law, the so-called loft law, is coming up for renewal -- or not -- by June 30. And while the loft sector of the housing market is small, the coming vote in the State Legislature is viewed by landlord and tenant advocates alike as a precursor to the struggle over general rent-regulation laws that expire in June 1997. "There is a fundamental ideological debate going on about the role of government in housing," said Andrew Scherer, author of "Residential Landlord-Tenant Law in New York" (Lawyers Cooperative Publishing, 1995), a reference guide. "And while the loft law is a relatively small area within that bigger picture, the outcome of the conflict over whether to renew the law will be seen as an initial battle in the bigger war over the future of rent regulations."
Thomas Berger, president of the 400-member Association of Commercial Property Owners, which represents landlords of lofts that have converted to residential use or are in the process of doing so, agreed that renewal of the loft law "creates precedent for all rent-regulated properties."
Mr. Berger contends that the loft law has erected barriers to conversion. "I would like to see it eliminated, unless a reasonable one can be passed, which is not very likely," he said. "Unless the Legislature comes up with a revision that makes it possible for owners to obtain financing and make a minimal profit, then we are better off without it."
The loft law, enacted in 1982 and renewed for four years in 1992, legitimized existing residential tenancies in commercial buildings and allowed only limited rent increases until the owners brought their buildings up to code. If the Legislature does not renew the law, tenants could lose those protections, leaving open such volatile issues as whether rents should be subject to regulation or the open market and even whether tenants could be evicted.
The debate comes at a time when the loft market is percolating, when once fallow neighborhoods are lined with fascinating, trendy and dear boutiques. It is a time when an innovative industry dependent on proximity to artists -- the so-called new media -- has taken root; a time when, behind century-old cast-iron facades, the well-to-do have created grand spaces, some even evocative of faraway places. And it is a time when the pioneers, the original renters, are feeling the squeeze.
"I've been here since 1976, my whole life is here," said Judy Stevens, who lives with her 14-year-old daughter, Sara, in a former button and snap factory on Franklin Street in TriBeCa, paying $549.50 a month.
Ms. Stevens built the interior walls for the 1,200-square-foot space, installed much of the plumbing and some of the electric lines. Leading to the platform where Sara sleeps are wooden stairs Ms. Stevens found on a nearby sidewalk, a hand-written note saying, "Take Me!" tacked to them. "If it goes to fair market," she said, "I'll have to think what other state could I live in and be an artist."
If she had to leave, said Ms. Stevens -- who runs children's play groups to surmount struggling-artist status -- she would sorely miss a certain small-town sensibility rare in the big city. "I was diagnosed with colon cancer last year," she said. "The community came to my aid, big time. I had a $5,000 deductible, and somebody just paid it. I would walk out the door and there would be food and flowers right there. They looked out for my daughter.
"The image I had was a barn-raising," Ms. Stevens said. "My barn burned down and they all helped me rebuild."
Less than a mile to the north, on Prince Street, in an elegant co-op they have owned for two years, Laurence and William Kriegel live with their children, Maxence, 7, and Margaux, 5. Arriving at their 13-room penthouse is like entering a country estate in the south of France. A delicately wrought iron gate opens into expansive rooms with thick walls and arches reminiscent of a monastic cloister. A carved-stone fountain from a French village plaza graces the dining room.
"The goal is to have a house so that you feel you are on vacation," said Mrs. Kriegel, a native of Brittany. "From the arches, you get the feeling everything is sweet, more gentle."
Still standing, though empty, in the Kriegels' rooftop garden is the building's old wooden water tower, its four stanchions now circumscribing the walls of the master bathroom, with its large oval tub, medieval-style chair and arched windows. Eventually, Mrs. Kriegel said, the interior of the water tower will serve as a circular den with windows onto the city's skyline.
And how much did the Kriegels pay for their home? "Enough," Mrs. Kriegel said.
Whatever the price, there is no doubt that the loft market is strong. "I don't know how anyone in this industry has time for anything but real estate and a bit of food," said Jan Hashey, a loft broker for the Ambrose-MarElia Company. "Brokers and sellers put shocking prices on units and, surprisingly, they are flying off the market. They flatter each other into a fantasy that's coming true."
Ms. Hashey cited as "a dramatic example," a building on West 15th Street where, in 1980, a 4,000-square-foot apartment would sell for $200,000 to $300,000 for a whole floor, "and now they are getting $700,000 for half a floor." A 5,000-square-foot loft in the Flatiron District that sold for $1.1 million six months ago, Ms. Hashey said, "now would go for $1.5 million, easily."
The trend is apparent in a comparison of annual sales surveys conducted by the Real Estate Board of New York. According to reports from 20 brokerage firms, there were 29 co-op loft sales below 34th Street in 1993, 64 in 1994 and 98 last year. Prices per square foot ranged from $104 to $308 in 1993, $61 to $319 in 1994 and $111 to $360 last year.
Helene Luchnick, a vice president with the brokerage firm of Douglas Elliman who specializes in loft conversions, said, "For the first time since the 80's, there are entire buildings being converted."
Mrs. Luchnick knew of three buildings, two in TriBeCa and one in SoHo, with a total of 88 apartments currently on the market. The asking prices range from $290,000 for a two-bedroom loft on 17th Street to $1.995 million for a three-bedroom duplex penthouse on North Moore Street in TriBeca. Another 160 apartments in six buildings are scheduled to come on the market by the end of the year.
"There has never been this much product on the market at one time," Mrs. Luchnick said.
Mark Jennings, a partner in a leveraged-buyout company, bought his 3,000-square-foot loft on Mercer Street, with its similarly sized roof garden, two years ago. "I'm from Texas, so I need a lot of space," Mr. Jennings said. "I'm used to yards and dogs and photosynthesis." Below the broad skylight in his 16-foot-high ceiling, a full-grown palm tree stands. A red Flying A gasoline pump from the 40's fills one corner, near the soapstone and steel-hooded, glass-enclosed fireplace with its wraparound view from almost anywhere in the apartment.
Mr. Jennings paid $800,000 for the loft and invested $300,000 more in renovations. It was recently reappraised at $1.25 million.
Profitability notwithstanding -- or, more likely, overriding such concerns -- there are difficulties confronting developers who convert factory space to residential use. Any conversion must comply with Federal and local laws on access for people with disabilities. "You would have to install an elevator to meet the specifications," said Stephen M. Raphael, a lawyer who specializes in loft conversions. Many factory buildings do not have adequate rear yards to meet the city's fire, safety and air requirements, so it may be necessary to remove parts of the building. Leftover industrial contamination must be eliminated.
"I looked at a building that had been a clock factory," Mr. Raphael said. "Remember those luminescent dials? Radium and mercury got into the floors. We passed on the building."
Then there is the Brac tax -- an acronym for the Business Relocation Assistance Corporation. In the 1960's and 70's, when there were still 800,000 manufacturing jobs in the city, planners were concerned that loft conversions would chase out factories. The Brac tax financed a program to help companies relocate within the city.
"You could pay $11 a square foot and, in any event, only be allowed to convert two-thirds of the building to residential use," Mr. Raphael said. For a 100,000-square-foot building, the Brac tax might be $737,000. "Could be a deal breaker," Mr. Raphael said.
Calling the tax "anachronistic," Mr. Raphael said, "Clearly, there haven't been tenants for these spaces for years." Manufacturers prefer low-rise buildings in the other boroughs, he said, where there is less need for elevators, taxes are lower "and the only problem is you can't go around the corner to Barnes & Noble for a cup of cappuccino."
For the loft pioneers in particular, conversion has historically engendered bitter contention with landlords over the process of bringing a building into code compliance and making other improvements. "Commonly, these buildings required plumbing, electrical work, ventilation for kitchens and bathrooms," said Chuck DeLaney, a founder of Lower Manhattan Loft Tenants, a tenants' group. "Some buildings required sprinklers, smoke detectors a second means of egress for fire purposes."
All residential buildings have to have a parapet around the roof, Mr. DeLaney said. "And, for taller buildings, if there is a ladder and scuttle entrance to the roof it has to be replaced by a stairway and bulkhead building," he said. "That's to protect a fireman."
The pioneers often paid for those renovations, including improvements like sanded floors, construction of interior walls and installation of appliances, then entered legal combat over who was responsible for those changes and who would ultimately be compensated when the original tenant moved.
The loft law established, among other things, a timetable under which an owner had to bring a building into code compliance and be granted a residential certificate of occupancy. It set forth the obligations of both owners and tenants. And it created the Loft Board, with the power to adjudicate rent disputes, hardship appeals from owners and questions arising over that thorny issue of who should benefit from improvements made by a tenant who was vacating.
Despite those conversion problems, the loft wave has far from crested.
According to Mr. DeLaney, who is the tenant representative on the Loft Board, studies commissioned by the board indicate that there are about 3,500 loft buildings in the city -- those with open floors, high ceilings and no internal load-bearing walls -- each with an average of six apartments. Of those 3,500 buildings, 820 are registered as interim multiple dwellings, meaning they contained at least three residential units in 1982 and were, therefore, covered by the loft law. Currently, 302 of the 820 registered buildings have completed the required renovations, while the others are still in the conversion process.
There are also between 300 and 500 loft buildings, Mr. DeLaney estimates, that are now either fully converted to residential use or are mixed-used buildings, but are not covered by the loft law because they were legally converted by developers before tenants moved in.
Besides the long established loft districts of SoHo, NoHo and TriBeCa, real estate officials say, an enclave has taken root in Chelsea, and there are seedlings in Dumbo (Down Under the Manhattan Bridge Overpass) in Brooklyn, Long Island City and Astoria, Queens.
"It's starting to happen all along the old industrial West Side," said Emanuel Tobier, a professor of economics and planning at New York University.
"Over the next decade, it will complete its process," Dr. Tobier said. "There will still be the odd factory making things that hurt when you drop them on your foot, but, for the most part, there will be people living in these lofts and working in the new knowledge industries, image industries, information-based industries" -- the so-called new media.
At Columbia University, a team of urban planning students under the direction of Prof. Elliott Sclar is writing a report on the future of SoHo that, among other things, wonders about the wisdom of not renewing the loft law.
"The loft community is rapidly changing," Dr. Sclar said. "They call it Disneyfication, meaning a lot of trendy stores, tchotchke dealers, bars open until 4 in the morning. Some galleries have left because they feel they are being treated like museums, with tourists coming in dripping ice cream."
Dr. Sclar was asked why, with loft neighborhoods becoming increasingly profitable, protection should be extended for that original group of about 7,500 artists.
"The whole new-media phenomenon is intimately connected with the city having a concentration of creative people," he said. "This is an engine of economic development in and of itself. They have to be in areas where they can bounce off each other. And it's not just the new media. It's high-end manufactured goods, like furniture, that derive their value from design content."
Dr. Sclar contends that the city "cannot cavalierly assume that striving for maximum property taxes in the short run is going to create a viable economy in the long run."
Perhaps with that in mind -- and, perhaps, with the realization that tenants in 1.1 million rent-regulated apartments are eligible to vote in next year's mayoral election -- the Giuliani administration has proposed that the Legislature renew the loft law while eliminating its adjudicatory body, the nine-member Loft Board. It calls, instead, for creation of an Office of Loft Legalization with a director to be named by the Mayor. The city also proposes, among other things, extending the timetable for owners to bring a building into code compliance and limiting the right of tenants to withhold rent when a building is out of compliance.
Mr. DeLaney opposes the board'selimination "because there is so much dispute between owners and tenants about how to efficiently bring these units up to code that I think it's important that both sides have direct input into the process."
Mr. Berger of the owners' association reluctantly prefers that the board be retained. "I'm afraid of eliminating the Loft Board because it would concentrate power in the hands of one person," he said. "I would like to see both of them eliminated: no Loft Board, no Office of Loft Legalization."
The chairman of the Assembly Housing Committee, Vito J. Lopez, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said his committee was considering a bill that "supports the concerns being advanced by the loft tenants, including preservation of the board and the right to withhold rent from owners who are out of code compliance."
His counterpart in the State Senate, Vincent L. Leibell, a Republican representing parts of Westchester, Putnam and Dutchess Counties, said the city's proposal would be "a starting off point for our discussions with the Assembly and the Governor's office, but I do not perceive that the legislation, as submitted by the Mayor, would be that which is finally enacted."
Saying that he could not yet give details of his position, Senator Leibell declined to "make that linkage" between the loft law and prospects for renewal of all rent regulation next year. "I'm looking at this as it stands on all fours by itself," he said.
The man who first navigated the treacherous shoals of an uncharted course in housing regulation, Carl Weisbrod, wonders whether there might be a way to balance the contesting forces.
"I think there's a danger in freeze-framing neighborhoods, and there's a certain inevitability to market forces," said Mr. Weisbrod, who in 1982 served as the first chairman of the Loft Board and is now president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "But there should be some way that the pioneers, who really created dynamic new communities, can still be rewarded for the increased value their sweat equity brought to these neighborhoods."

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
With Faster Commute, Hope for Downtown Revivals

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
A 40-YEAR-OLD promise for direct commuter-train service from parts of northern New Jersey to midtown Manhattan finally will be realized next month, bringing with it a potential spurt in downtown revitalization efforts by some towns along the line.
Midtown Direct, as the new service is called, was made possible by a $69 million rail link in the Kearny meadows financed through state funds. The rail link allows trains from the Morris & Essex Lines of N.J. Transit to go directly in to Penn Station, instead of ending in Hoboken, where riders now transfer to PATH trains. 
 The new link is expected to shorten the round-trip ride to midtown and back by 30 to 40 minutes a day, according to N.J. Transit, overseer of the state's train and bus systems.
The transit agency also expects the service to increase daily ridership to 18,500 from 13,000 over the next two years and indirectly increase property values on one- and two-family single-family homes. It will be available on weekdays beginning June 10 and on weekends after Labor Day.
N.J. Transit estimates that 1,500 new parking spaces will be needed to accommodate the rise in ridership. To that end the agency, working with some towns along the rail line, has invested close to $5 million in additional funds to improve stations and expand parking.
Thomas Marchwinski, director of travel forecasting at N.J. Transit, said "a major new train service, like a new highway, has the potential of changing commuting patterns," and gives more flexibility to home buyers and businesses in choosing where to locate.
And that, planners say, could stoke economic development -- a concept that is consistent with the State Development and Redevelopment Plan. The plan encourages growth in the areas where roads, utilities and mass transit are in place and discourages it in less developed areas
A report by Mr. Marchwinski also showed the new service could raise property values of homes in the 20 towns with stations along the Morris & Essex Lines by an average of 2.2 percent, or $4,200 for the home priced at the median of $190,900.
Residential brokers in towns along the line, particularly those in Essex and Union Counties, say that by providing speedier, no-transfer access to midtown Manhattan the new service will help attract buyers, some from out of state.
"What we have been fighting for years is the loss of customers who are relocating to the metropolitan New York area and work in midtown Manhattan to communities in Westchester County or Fairfield County, where the commute by rail is faster and easier," said Thomas G. McDonough, chairman of the education committee for the Summit, New Providence and Berkeley Heights Board of Realtors. The board serves Summit in Union County and surrounding towns in Essex and Morris Counties.
T HE new service will help make the area "more competitive," he added, noting that an easy commute ranks among the top three factors that buyers consider when moving to an area, after community and schools.
Roy Scott, owner of Re/Max in Village Square, a real estate firm in South Orange, agreed. "A shorter commute," said Mr. Scott, "is another major plus for the village, which is the first suburban westbound stop on the line." He said the line already had drawn attention to the community, which is now undergoing a downtown revitalization, from young professional couples and families from New York City, as well as from residents of urban areas in Hudson County such as Hoboken and Jersey City.
One is Eliott Saltzman, who moved to a five-bedroom English colonial in South Orange from a two-bedroom co-op in Park Slope, Brooklyn, three months ago with his wife, Dorit Tabak, and their two children. He is a vice president of account services for a graphic-design company in Midtown Manhattan; his wife is a self-employed graphic designer who works from home.
"The new service, which will reduce my commute to 30 minutes, played a large part in my decision to buy here," said Mr. Saltzman, who describes his new home as "the next Westchester." There is also "a real opportunity" for home values to appreciate, he added.
Barbara K. Sacks, the South Orange Administrator, said the rail link was also "a big impetus" to the revival of the village's 10-block central business district. It began its rejuvenation effort two years ago and signs of new life are apparent.
In that time, for example, a string of seven previously vacant stores tucked under the elevated train platform on Sloan Street have been renovated and converted into a 13,000-square-foot retail strip by Lokko Motive Inc., said Carey B. Heller, a principal of the South Orange development company.
His company bought the lease on the stores from N.J. Transit, which owns the shops, and agreed to improve and market them.
"The transit link is what brought me here," said Mr. Heller, adding that it also led to longer lease agreements with tenants. He said that he expected a 40 percent rise in ridership to 900 commuters using the station, increasing sales in the stores below. Mr. Scott leased one of the Sloan Street shops.
Ms. Sacks said a broader redevelopment plan, being drawn up by the village's planning board and expected to be approved by its Board of Trustees this summer, will build on that momentum. The plan envisions transforming other underutilized sites around the train station into a neighborhood of residential retail, hotel, office and entertainment space. There are also plans for such public improvements as widening sidewalks, adding landscaping and new lighting and improving parking. Among other things, Ms. Sacks said, the village would work with N.J. Transit on building a parking garage with up to 600 spaces over either a movie theater or atop 10,000 square feet of retail space. She said elements of the plan, to be implemented over five years, would depend on the market.
Officials in Morristown also view the new service as a boost to the continued revitalization of their central business district. "Any transportation improvement is a plus in making Morristown a more attractive place to live and work," said Ted Goodman, its planning director.
The current ride from Morristown to the 33d Street PATH station in Manhattan takes about an hour and 15 minutes. The new service to Penn Station will take 56 minutes, for a saving of 19 minutes, according to N.J. Transit.
He said the town and the Morristown Parking Authority were working with a private developer to bring 125 market-rate residential rental units to the district "to get more people on the streets" at night and support more shops.
A S now planned the apartment complex, called Chancery Square, will rise on two existing parking lots for a total of 360 cars that is three blocks west of the train station on Cattano Avenue; the lots are owned by the parking authority. The project will comprise two six-story L-shaped rental buildings with a two-level parking garage for 400 cars at the rear, said Michael I. Barry, a vice president at the Applied Companies of Hoboken, the developer.
"The market now relies on folks who live and work in and around Morristown, but the rail link could help broaden it to tap people who work in Manhattan," said Mr. Barry, noting that the one- and two-bedroom apartments at Chancery Square will be marketed to young professionals. Monthly rents for the apartments, expected to be ready for occupancy by 1998, are to be $950 to $1,400.
In the Union County community of Berkeley Heights, the Sterling Properties Group of Livingston is building Station Court, 65 rental apartments on Sherman Avenue South, 100 yards from the train station and close to shopping.
"The new rail service will add to the appeal of the project," said Joseph Forgione, a Sterling principal. Monthly rents for the one- to three-bedroom units is $850 to $1,200; 13 of the units are reserved for families with low- and moderate-incomes.
"What we are selling," said Mr. Forgione, "is convenience."

HEADLINE: Sleepless In Secaucus

BYLINE: By DEBBIE GALANT 

 BODY:
CALL them the Morning Warriors. At 6:15 A.M. three times a week, the eight men, aged 48 to 80, report to the Montclair Y.M.C.A. for an exercise class, then gather for coffee afterward.
On a typical night, they get an average of five hours of sleep -- like 1 of every 6 New Jerseyans. 
 You might think that people who set the alarm for 5 A.M. to get up for a workout are exercise fanatics. What they are really fanatic about is time. Sure, they could exercise at lunch, but what if a business meeting came up?
"You have no excuse at 6:15 in the morning," said one of them, Judge Richard Newman. "The only excuse is waking up." And what about people who sleep until 7:30? Quentin Gualtier, 80, put it this way: "I think they're lazy."
In Jersey City, Eleanor Buckner, a researcher in her 30's who has suffered from insomnia since childhood, is often falling back to sleep just as the Morning Warriors are rising. The slightest sound will wake her in the middle of the night and keep her up for hours. Like the morning exercisers, she too exists on four to six hours of sleep. But unlike them, she greets the morning grudgingly. "If I don't have to get up, it really hurts to get up," she said. And what about people who wake at 5 A.M. to exercise?
"I think they're nuts."
Webster's calls sleep "a natural periodic state of rest marked by the suspension of consciousness." Shakespeare called it the "balm of hurt minds" and the "chief nourisher in life's feast." But one thing is certain: we don't get enough of it.
A poll by the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University, released last month, found that a quarter of the 804 New Jerseyans surveyed have trouble sleeping -- twice the national average. They get an average of 6.7 hours of sleep a night, the lowest figure ever reported in a large-scale survey, according to Dr. Raymond Rosen, director of the Comprehensive Sleep Disorders Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick. (The national average, which has been declining for years, is about 20 minutes more.)
A particularly alarming finding in the survey, financed by the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, is that 17 percent of New Jerseyans sleep five hours or less a night. (And they could be driving next to you on the turnpike, or at the controls of your commuter train.)
"There's a tendency in this society to shortchange the amount of sleep we get," Dr. Rosen said. "What's behind that is a basic cultural stereotype that sleep is wasted time."
 
In the Densest State, Too Many Things to Do
Of course, the trend toward sleeping less has been firmly in place for about a century, and for that you can blame a famous New Jersey inventor who himself slept less than four hours a night. It was not until Thomas Alva Edison invented the incandescent light bulb in 1879 that it became easy for people to stay up late. As A. Alvarez writes in "Night" (W. W. Norton, 1995), "Before electricity was harnessed, artificial light was expensive and only the leisured rich could afford the luxury of being up and doing during the hours of darkness."
Now we all can be up and doing, and probably are. And many other things besides the availability of a cheap, reliable source of artificial light contribute to pervasive sleeplessness. In today's post-industrial economy, time -- as opposed to labor or capital -- has become the scarcest commodity.
"The emphasis in our society is entirely on productivity," said Dr. Rosen. "People often equate sleeping longer with being lazy." In a frenetic race to cram 28 hours into a 24-hour day, many people either go to bed later, set their alarms earlier or toss in bed while they worry about all they have to do tomorrow.
In New Jersey, where living 10 miles from work can mean an hour's commute, time is in particularly short supply. "Certainly, New Jersey's the densest state in the nation," said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers and an early riser himself.
Other characteristics of life in the Garden State also militate against a good night's sleep. Expensive housing, for example. "The extremely high cost of living either forces people to move further out or to work longer hours, or work multiple jobs," Dr. Hughes pointed out.
Any of those things can cut into sleep time, but certainly those who juggle two jobs are among the most sleep-deprived. Patricia Moore-Taylor, the receptionist at the J. W. Pierson oil company in East Orange, is herself a candidate for the sleep deprivation award. Aside from her full-time job answering phones, she works as a bridal consultant, planning nuptials and sewing wedding gowns into the wee hours.
During wedding season -- which stretches from April through September -- Ms. Moore-Taylor stays up stitching well past midnight, sometimes as late as 4 A.M. "I'm like this for four or five weeks, then sometimes it catches up to me," said Ms. Moore-Taylor, a single mother who needs the extra work to help pay the bills.
Then there's Larry Kinder, who holds down not two but three jobs: in the weight room at the Montclair Y, as a private personal trainer and working a late shift at the post office. Mr. Kinder regularly goes to bed around 12:30 A.M. and wakes up by 4 so he can get in a 90-minute workout.
"I am, I guess, a workaholic," he admitted, laughing. "I don't need that amount of sleep. Rather than lay around in bed, I'd rather get up and be productive." But Mr. Kinder insists that he's in tiptop shape, never gets colds and survives on so little sleep because of a healthy diet that omits red meat, salt, sweets and alcohol. Neither he nor Ms. Moore-Taylor drinks coffee.
Sleep experts would argue that people like these are kidding themselves, that steady sleep deficit is wearing them down both physically and mentally. But Mr. Kinder and Ms. Moore-Taylor at least have the satisfaction of accomplishing a lot. They are almost certainly luckier than the uncounted insomniacs, many of whom toss and turn the nights away.
Here again, economic pressures may also play a significant role. Dr. Silvio Zappasodi, a University of Medicine and Dentistry professor who is medical director of the Sleep Disorders Laboratory at Kennedy Memorial Hospital in Stratford, Camden County, recalls a recent patient, "a middle-aged woman, working two jobs, under considerable financial stress" whose chief complaint was insomnia.
Although the official diagnosis in such cases is "sleep adjustment disorder" -- or trouble sleeping in response to a temporary crisis -- Dr. Zappasodi thinks what's really happening is that corporations under competitive pressure are transferring their economic stress to their workers.
Corporate downsizing -- a villain in so many other stories -- takes its toll in sleep, too. Many workers now have to do the work that was once shared by two or three employees, while at the same time worrying that they'll be the next to go. "It engenders an almost pervasive anxiety," said Dr. Zappasodi. While downsizing is, of course, a national problem, New Jersey takes a disproportionate share of the burden because, as Dr. Hughes of Rutgers notes, "New Jersey is one of the epicenters of corporate America."
A 55-year-old computer professional from Metuchen who fears being downsized herself (and would speak only on condition of anonymity for precisely that reason) says she thinks stress about work is part of what is causing her to wake up in the middle of the night. She says she now does the work of two-and-a-half people: "It's like the cake is burning, the baby's crying and somebody's trying to set your porch on fire."
But the fear of losing her job, at an age that most employers consider quite unattractive, is worse. "I think that the employment picture is so lousy," she said, "that many people are strung out and that sleep disorders are going to pop up everywhere."
Few people lead more fast-paced lives than the denizens of Wall Street, many of whom live in New Jersey. Most are expected to arrive at work between 7 and 8 A.M., and many travel frequently. Helane Becker, who follows airline stocks for Smith Barney and lives in Short Hills, often burns the candle at both ends. After getting her children to bed, she'll stay up until midnight or 1 A.M. to work; then it's up by 5:30 to exercise and head to the city.
"I usually live with just a slight headache all the time, or I'm just exhausted," she admitted. "I'll collapse on an airplane. Pass out cold."
A Wall Street research director who lives in New Jersey is praying for the connection that will finally allow his train to go directly into Manhattan. But direct train or no, getting to work on time is an imperative on the Street. This executive once had to dismiss an employee who couldn't get to work in time for the daily morning meeting, when analysts give the sales and trading desks their newest stock picks. "You have to be there for show time," he said. "We had to get rid of her. She was a night person."
There are some careers -- like being a morning-drive radio reporter -- that would require wacky hours in any part of the country. But doing it here is even more stressful, argues John Montone, a reporter for WINS, who rises between 3:30 and 4 A.M. "Less than an hour after I get up, I'm sort of hurtling along at 65 miles an hour," he said. "I've ended up in the middle of housing projects at 4 o'clock in the morning when people are still out and angry."
James Pierson, an oil company executive who is a member of the Montclair morning exercise group, agrees that the tempo of life here doesn't favor a concept like rest. "There's a very fast pace that we're caught up in. We're not a laid-back group of people," he said. "In this neck of the woods, if you're laid-back and sweet and kind and like to lollygag, you get run over."
 
Nodding Off at 65 M.P.H.: Sins of the Sleep-Deprived
The laid-back may indeed get run over -- especially by fast-track people who aren't getting enough sleep. Among the things that concern sleep doctors most is the combination of drowsiness and heavy or complicated machinery, which can magnify even the smallest mistake. Some of the most dramatic industrial accidents in recent memory -- the nuclear reactor mishaps at Chernobyl and Three Mile Island, the chemical leak in Bhopal, India, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill -- all took place on the overnight shift.
Closer to home was the February crash of two New Jersey Transit trains that killed two engineers and one passenger. That happened after one engineer had worked the night split shift, and was asked to work an extra hour during morning rush hour. Jeff Maclin, a spokesman for New Jersey Transit, insists that the engineer's hours were well within legal limits, and points out that "split shifts in general are industry practice."
Nonetheless, and without conceding that sleep deprivation had anything to do with the accident, New Jersey Transit has eliminated the night split shift on the Bergen line. (Night split shifts are still utilized on two other lines, one serving Atlantic City and another that ends in Port Jervis, N.Y.)
While only 2 percent of New Jersey highway injuries and fatalities are directly attributed to falling asleep at the wheel, Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the State Division of Highway Traffic Safety, says that number probably doesn't capture many cases; drivers don't always own up to nodding off. The National Sleep Foundation estimates that 4 percent of traffic crash fatalities result from drowsiness, and in a Gallup survey last year, 31 percent of the people polled admitted to having fallen asleep at the wheel.
Equally alarming, the National Transportation Safety Board estimates that 58 percent of single-vehicle accidents among heavy truck drivers and 31 percent of truck fatalities are caused by fatigue. With the busiest roads in the nation, and a high concentration of both truck drivers and shift workers, these statistics paint a truly scary picture. (To combat the problem, the state has begun installing rumble strips on highway shoulders to help jolt drifting drivers awake.)
 
Recharging the Batteries Of Body, Mind and Soul
Death and destruction aside, a world of walking zombies is arguably a less pleasant place to live. It is hard to imagine that tempers are not shorter, and the stresses of modern life not amplified, by a failure to get sufficient rest. Dr. Rosen compares non-REM sleep -- periods when the sleeper doesn't dream -- to "recharging the body's batteries" by replenishing certain chemicals and hormones that are depleted during the day. It is probably safe to say that people take better care of their laptops and cellular phones than of their own bodies.
And during REM -- rapid-eye-movement -- sleep, it is the mind's batteries that recharge. People who are deprived of REM sleep have "memory problems, attention problems, even psychotic symptoms," said Dr. Rosen. While many people still dismiss dreams as so much Freudian drivel, dreaming remains one of the most enduring and intriguing facets of being human.
"We believe that dreams are important," Dr. Rosen went on. "Dreaming is one way in which the mind goes about working on certain problems. It's been called a form of parallel processing. It's another way that the mind uses to work on certain conflicts or issues."
Dreaming is only one of many mysteries in the still young field of sleep science. (REM sleep was not even discovered until 1953, the same year as DNA.) Since then, there has been a proliferation of sleep laboratories in which patients are hooked up to machines that are essentially lie detectors, measuring mind and body activity while they sleep. Chris Blackman, a technologist at the sleep lab at Robert Wood Johnson, can point to a chart and show you exactly when someone begins sleeping, or dreaming. "Once you're hooked up, you can't fool us," he said.
Research into the chemical aspects of sleep is flourishing, too. Scientists have recently discovered that antidepressants can sometimes aid insomniacs. At Robert Wood Johnson's sleep center, doctors are testing a new fast-acting sleep inducer, Zaleplon, which leaves no trace, or hangover effect, the next day. And perhaps nobody is more interested in the neurochemistry of sleep than the Army, which is developing a sleep management system to enable combat units to refresh themselves with the scientific precision now reserved for ballistics.
New research is also focusing on the use of light, both natural and artificial, to treat sleep disorders. And advocates for people with sleep disorders -- call them insomniactivists -- plan a "Sleep Walk" on Washington on May 29 to demand more Federal money for research and better treatment for sufferers.
It has been only a little more than a century since the invention of the light bulb. Up until then, people slept and woke to the rhythms of the sky. For most of human history, midnight was, literally, the middle of the night -- not time to watch Letterman or Leno. The 20th century, then, may ultimately turn out to be one gigantic social science experiment in sleep deprivation, and 1990's New Jersey may be seen as a laboratory of overextended consciousness.
At least that's the view of the insomniac in Metuchen. "We keep on pressing the envelope when it comes to sleep, and then we wonder why we're all screwed up," she said. "You can't fool Mother Nature."
 
Wide Awake? It Could Be Serious
If you have consistent trouble falling or staying asleep, have trouble staying awake during the day or have unusual movements or behaviors during sleep, you may need treatment for a sleep disorder, according to the Comprehensive Sleep Disorders Center at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital. Here are some symptoms, common and less common:

 **Taking 30 minutes or longer to fall asleep on most nights.
 **Waking three or more times during the night and taking 15 minutes or longer to go back to sleep.
 **Waking an hour or more before your scheduled wake-up time on most mornings.
 **Feeling tired after seven hours of sleep or more.
**Having trouble staying awake while driving, at work or in social
situations.
 ** Loud snoring on most nights.
 **Frequent morning headaches.
 **Uncontrollable body movements like jerking or kicking before or during sleep.
 **Regular sleepwalking, sleep-talking or night terrors.
 **Repetitive nightmares, or acting out dreams in a forceful or violent manner.

Stories That Change Lives

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
It was a literary salon of sorts, with a roomful of scholars discussing the story "Eveline," by James Joyce. Their voices rose and fell as they examined the heroine's choices in life. They spoke of continuity and change, family loyalty and the need to take risks.
But unlike most students of literature, none of these men or women could read above a fifth-grade level. They were part of a program called People and Stories/Gente y Cuentos, which brings literature to teen-agers and adults who might never experience it otherwise. Last month, when a White House committee praised 218 commmunity arts programs around the nation in a report titled "Growing Up Taller," it was the only New Jersey project mentioned. 
 The New Jersey Council for the Humanities runs the program with an annual budget of $30,000, taking it to schools, libraries, churches, homeless shelters and prisons. Groups meet once a week for two months, reading short stories and discussing them with a trained coordinator. They are encouraged to compare the stories to their own lives, to connect with the characters and with other program members.
The stories are chosen for their brevity -- they cannot exceed 10 pages -- and their relevance to the lives of the readers, many of whom are black and Hispanic. Recent selections have included Tillie Olsen's "I Stand Here Ironing," Langston Hughes' "Thank You Ma'am" and Grace Paley's "A Conversation With My Father."
Sarah Hirschman, a Princeton resident who has studied literature for much of her life, developed the program while she was living in Cambridge, Mass., in the early 70's.
"My friends in academia said it would never work," Mrs. Hirschman said last week. "They thought it crazy to expect people who had never read anything before to read high literature."
But the experiment was a success, and in 1974, after Mrs. Hirschman had moved to New Jersey, she started a People and Stories program at a Trenton church. Seven years later, a grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities helped her organize programs in Florida, Massachusetts, New York, Texas and Puerto Rico.
In 1985, when the New Jersey Council for the Humanities started providing funds, Mrs. Hirschman started the first English-language program in Princeton. Patricia Andres, a Lawrenceville resident who is a doctoral candidate in English at Rutgers University, became the co-director in 1993, and People and Stories has since expanded to 22 programs in cities and suburbs around the state. Many groups are multigenerational, multicultural or both. At the Somerset County Jail, the program has become so popular that prisoners are choosing it over television.
Mrs. Hirschman is hoping to expand the program to reach more teen-agers, substance abusers, parents who lack basic literacy skills and women who are making the transition from welfare to work. She is hoping for a budget of more than $100,000 a year, a sum that could not come entirely from the humanities council, which has a budget of just under $1 million and supports a number of projects.
People and Stories is different from most literacy programs because it uses stories instead of textbooks. The focus on discussion, rather than reading and writing, encourages participants to offer their thoughts and opinions, Mrs. Hirschman said.
"People who haven't heard themselves speak in public about complex subjects learn to feel better about themselves," she said. "And since the stories don't lend themselves to cliches, they really delve into their souls instead of giving stock answers."
Mrs. Hirschman said the program's main goal is introducing disadvantaged people to literature and showing them how it reflects their lives. But it also develops critical thinking skills, self esteem and respect for cultural and economic differences, she said.
"Metaphor cuts across economic and educational levels," Mrs. Andres said. "It erases our differences, because we're responding at a spiritual level."
That does not mean every story has a transforming effect. There are class clowns who crack jokes at the characters' expense. There are daydreamers who stare at the floor and mumble when questioned. But for the most part, the group members listen intently while a story is read, then jump into discussion. Their comments are often as funny as they are thoughtful.
But in the end -- and this is the key to the program's success, Mrs. Hirschman says -- the discussion inevitably turns to the participants' own lives, taking on the air of a group therapy session. One group met in Trenton last week to read "American History" by Judith Ortiz-Cofer, set on the day President Kennedy was killed. The members, who are recovering from substance abusers, offered their memories of the assassination. They also dissected the main character, an Hispanic teen-ager who lives in a housing project and suffers the effects of prejudice.
"You put yourself in the character's shoes and use their story as a lesson," said one member, Dwight Townes. "If it touches you in a certain way, it can change your life. It can lift you up."

HEADLINE: GOVERNMENT;
Celebrations and Concerns at NJN's Silver Anniversary

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
Kent Manahan has been a news anchor on the New Jersey Network for 20 of the station's 25 years, and she doesn't think its mission has changed since NJN went on air in a converted bowling alley in a Trenton suburb in 1971.
"The mission has always been to inform and educate the people of New Jersey," said Ms. Manahan, who has lived in the state most of her life. "And I think that remains the mission today." What has changed is the technolog, she said. 
 Through programs devoted primarily to political, economic and cultural issues in New Jersey that out-of-state television stations ignore in favor of crime and disaster news, the state's only public broadcasting station is "one of the components helping to give New Jersey an identity," she said.
In honor of its silver anniversary, NJN has made big plans for the end of this month. They include the premiere of its documentary "Domestic Violence: Faces of Fear," narrated by Diane Sawyer, on Tuesday at 9 P.M. and a gala fund-raiser on Wednesday to honor its supporters.
But the celebrations are tempered with concern about the future. State support has been drying up and now represents only 30 percent of NJN's operating budget. Competition from commercial and cable stations is increasing, and many viewers are still unaware of NJN despite its professionalism, resulting in traditionally low ratings.
"There is a void it fills," said Prof. Cliff Zukin, who teaches political science and mass media at the Eagleton Institute of Rutgers University, "but it could fill it even more if it had the resources and could promote itself more."
In January 1969, the state Legislature passed enabling legislation, and on April 5, 1971, NJN went on the air in a Ewing Township bowling alley where rain sometimes came in through the roof. Since 1993, headquarters has been a modern, roomy five-story building on Stockton Street in Trenton, built specifically for the station.
From 1971 to fiscal year 1989, direct state support rose from $2.5 million to $10 million. By fiscal year 1995, the amount had dropped by 43 percent, to $5.7 million. This fiscal year, with an operating budget of $13 million, NJN received $4.8 million. It will lose 21 percent of that in the next fiscal year when the subsidy drops to $3.8 million.
As a result, operating hours have been cut in recent years, and five news division staff members were laid off. There are now seven full-time and two part-time reporters, although Bill Jobes, the director of news and public affairs, says he can raise the total to 16 if he counts anchors and three producers who sometimes fill in as reporters.
The 6 P.M. newscast, featuring Ms. Manahan, was cut two years ago from an hour to a half-hour. It is rebroadcast at 7:30 and 11 P.M., but on major stories the tape can be topped with live coverage.
Nevertheless, NJN, one of the leading producers of local programming in PBS, continues to increase its public affairs programming. It has expanded business coverage, added an anti-violence beat and examined the criminal justice system. Its local and state election coverage has consistently drawn high praise, and Mr. Jobes calls it "a hallmark" of NJN's programming.
"What has changed over the past 16 years I've been here," said Mr. Jobes, a veteran print and television journalist, "is that more commercial stations have shown an interest in New Jersey, but that is a valuable barometer of how you're doing." He added, "Competition is good."
More competition may be on the way. In March, a new cable station, News 12 New Jersey, started in Edison. Affiliated with The Star-Ledger of Newark, it is aiming to provide around-the-clock coverage to two-thirds of the state.
Prof. Stephen Salmore, also of the Eagleton Insitute, said NJN was hurt by its position on the dial. It appears on all New Jersey cable systems and UHF, but people seem to have trouble finding it, he said. On UHF, NJN is Channel 52 in Trenton, 23 in Camden, 58 in New Brunswick and 50 in Montclair.
Elizabeth G. Christopherson, the executive director of NJN, and chief executive of the nonprofit foundation that raises money for it, said the challenges were formidable, but that's about as negative as she gets. Using the upbeat personality that made her a successful fund-raiser as vice president for institutional advancement and public affairs at Bloomfield College and as chairwoman of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts for several years, she has helped to raise donations by 16 percent since coming to NJN in June 1994.
"We feel we've had some admirable successes in fund raising and from new revenue opportunities and some prudent fiscal management," she said in her NJN office.
Those opportunities include an arrangement she made in September to receive $4.3 million over eight years for letting the TV Food Network use its slot on Time Warner's cable system in New York City.
Another is the agreement she made in March to lease NJN's excess microwave transmission capacity to Atlantic Microsystems, which operates wireless cable television systems in New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia, for $3.6 million over 10 years.
And last year's NJN fund-raising dinner, only its second, brought in $400,000 and won the station a PBS national development award.
Ms. Christopherson senses that NJN is attracting more viewers. A special A. E. Nielsen survey showed that in February 1.7 million New Jersey households tuned into the news for at least a quarter-hour during the month. That's about 18 percent of the New York and Philadelphia markets.
Another gauge of success, she said, is the number of educational programs that NJN has offered to teachers and students through satellite, computer or conventional broadcast. They have ranged from adult literacy programs to working with colleges to provide a two-year degree through televised courses.
Professor Zukin said that when he conducted focus groups of occasional viewers from Bergen and Mercer counties in February, he found each was impressed with the substance of newscasts. All felt they had learned something about the state from watching NJN, he said.
"Both groups were extremely laudatory," he said. "There was nothing negative."
Professor Salmore, who praised Ms. Manahan and her colleagues as savvy New Jersey reporters, said NJN may have more clout than its ratings would indicate because it is watched by a high number of opinion-makers like politicians, teachers and students of government.
"It probably doesn't have an impact on public opinion," he said. "But it does on informed opinion."

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
An Eclectic Group, Overlooked but Sizzling

BYLINE: By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
WITH more than 3,000 stock funds on the market, it is not surprising that some good ones fly under the radar.
But it is worth the time to search out tomorrow's winners, especially because many of the more popular ones are slamming the door shut on new investors. 
 In their seventh annual list of forgotten funds, the fund researchers at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago present a handful of overlooked stock funds that they call real winners. Each of the five funds manages less than $150 million. And each has built an excellent record -- at least five years -- under current managers.
The small sizes of the funds may be bad news for their sponsoring companies in collecting their annual fees, but investors can often benefit from the agility of these Lilliputians, the Morningstar analysts say.
This year's list is eclectic. Two are growth funds, one of which buys most of its stocks in its home state of Minnesota. There is a value fund that hoes the turf overseas. Rounding out the group are a fund that owns convertible securities and another that relies on market timing.
 
Going for Growth
 Ron Canakaris has run Enterprise Growth and its predecessor fund since 1980. He is a classic growth-at-a-price stock picker who seeks out companies with above-average long-term earnings growth but who won't pay too much. Growth stocks look particularly good now, he says, given the current investing environment, in which yields on long-term bonds are expected to be steady to lower and corporate profit growth is expected to slow.
He owns big stocks -- the average market capitalization in the portfolio is $25 billion -- and he holds on for at least two years. In all, 35 to 40 companies show up on the list. All are familiar. His favorites now are multinational consumer products and health care stocks, like Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer and Merck.
What is special about Mr. Canakaris is his ability to build an outstanding record with these familiar companies despite what the market does, Morningstar analysts say. Enterprise Growth carries a sales charge of 4.75 percent.
 
Mining in Minnesota
 The strategy is virtually the same at Mairs & Power Growth, but about three-quarters of the companies in its portfolio are based in Minnesota. That is home to George A. Mairs, who has officially run the fund since 1980 but who had a hand in its management before that. (It was begun in 1958 by the money management firm founded by his father in 1931.)
Like the Enterprise fund, the Mairs portfolio is a concentrated one, clustered in about 25 to 30 stocks. Once a stock makes it into the fund, it tends to stay there. Turnover averages a mere 5 percent a year, compared with about 80 percent for the average stock fund. The fund is available in nine states, including California and New York.
Why does it concentrate on Minnesota? Mr. Mairs cites a recent study that found that there were more publicly held businesses in the Twin Cities per person than in any other major metropolitan area in the country. "That indicates a strong entrepreneurial achievement," he said.
He has put incoming cash into health care stocks as the sector has corrected in recent weeks. These stocks now account for about a quarter of the fund. Two of the biggest are Medtronic and St. Jude Medical, both based in the Twin Cities.
 
Get Out the Calculator
 By contrast, Hotchkis & Wiley International uses a value, not a growth approach to picking stocks. Sarah Ketterer and Harry Hartford, co-managers of the fund, seek bargains overseas, mostly in the developed markets of Europe, Asia, the Far East and Canada.
The two use a bottom-up strategy, buying only those stocks that are high yielding by a complex formula. In Sweden, for example, where 10-year bonds are yielding 8.5 percent, they begin by adding three percentage points to compensate for equity risk. From this 11.5 percent figure, they take the reciprocal -- 1 divided by 0.115, which is 8.7 -- and make it the maximum for a stock's price-earnings ratio. So they consider only those Swedish stocks that are trading at no more than 8.7 times their anticipated earnings for the next year. The result is a relatively hefty yield of just under 4 percent.
The fund is diverse geographically, with its largest weightings in Japan, Britain and Hong Kong. Recent purchases include Nippon Fire and Marine Insurance and Arab Malaysian Finance.
The roughly 75 stocks in the portfolio tend to remain for a while, with turnover a low 25 percent a year.
 
 
Playing Defense
 Mitchell Cone describes his Franklin Convertible Securities fund as "a defensive growth-and-income fund." Mr. Cone, who is co-manager with Edward Jamieson, aims to capture at least 70 percent of the market's appreciation, but limits the portfolio's risk to less than half the market's. He does it by buying convertible securities.
Nearly all these convertibles are junk bonds, or below investment grade, so the portfolio carries considerable credit risk. Mr. Cone tries to limit that risk, in part, by buying issues with shorter maturities.
Over the last few months, he has been selling the issues most sensitive to interest rate changes and buying more cyclical ones from companies like Whirlpool and Cooper Industries, betting that the economy will pick up.
Investors pay a 4.5 percent sales charge to get into the fund.
 
Red Light, Green Light
 In a class by itself is Flex-Funds Muirfield, which Morningstar analysts call a market-timing fund. Robert S. Meeder Jr., the manager, prefers to call it a "defensively managed" one. He bases his movements in and out of the stock market on a model using factors like interest rate and monetary developments, price-earnings ratios, volume and investor sentiment.
When the model flashes green, he invests the money in other mutual funds; when it turns red, he moves it into bond funds or cash. Warning indicators started flashing about two months ago when the interest rate component turned negative, Mr. Meeder said, so he moved 20 percent of the fund into cash.
The balance is invested in 15 funds. The three largest are T. Rowe Price New Horizons, Founders Growth and Fidelity Advisors Equity Portfolio Growth. The big drawback to a fund of funds is two layers of expenses. The Muirfield fund charges 1.2 percent of assets to investors -- on top of the expenses charged by the underlying funds.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: LOWER EAST SIDE;
Vying to Recycle Essex St. Markets

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS 

 BODY:
With New York City trying to put forth its best image before the 1939 World's Fair, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia felt something had to be done about the pushcart peddlers that clogged Lower East Side streets, selling fish, vegetables and other merchandise.
His solution was to build them the Essex Street Markets, four architecturally undistinguished brick and concrete sheds that still stand today. And while two of the buildings are still in use -- one as an annex to New York Downtown Hospital, another as a produce market for nearby residents -- the other two are the focus of competing development proposals. 
 After several failed attempts at rehabilitation, the city's Economic Development Corporation is considering several ideas for developing one of the structures, Building B, at Rivington Street, including locating a Dunkin' Donuts bakery, a live-poultry market and a fast-food court there. And neighborhood groups have competing hopes for Building D, just south of Delancey Street: business leaders, for one, say it is perfectly suited for a major retailer, like Filene's Basement or Nordstrom's, that would draw desperately needed foot traffic to the area's ailing retail merchants.
"Retail means more jobs, more tax revenue and more business for everyone in the area," said Eugene Golombek, director of the South Manhattan Development Corporation, who thinks the one-story building should be replaced with one three stories tall.
But the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, on Orchard Street, looks at Building D and envisions a new visitor's center to attract tourists from Ellis Island and the Statue of Liberty, especially if Congress approves a bill to make the museum, like the island and the statue, an affiliate of the national park system. Tourists would then spend money nearby, the president of the Tenement Museum, Ruth Abram, said.
"The merchant community is a big part of the neighborhood," Ms. Abram said. "But I'm not sure how much business a retail use in that building would throw off. I think we would draw a significant amount of traffic."
The city Economic Development Corporation has the final say on the future of the buildings, and since the structures are zoned for food-related use, other uses would be subject to lengthy zoning review. An E.D.C. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the agency is leaning toward food-related uses for both buildings. "Food uses are what they're zoned for, so that's what we're considering," he said.
Closing the door to retail worries merchants like Bob Levy, whose family-owned business, Harris Levy linens, recently celebrated its 102d anniversary in the neighborhood.
"We need something unique in the Essex Street markets, something that will get shoppers excited again," Mr. Levy said. "If the city doesn't think big, we probably won't be making it to our 200th anniversary."
The head of Economic Development Corporation, Charles Millard, said the project's viability was paramount: "We don't want to have to come back three years from now and still be at square one." ANDREW JACOBS

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Will Tax Break for Schooling Pass a Congressional Test?

BYLINE: By LEAH BETH WARD 

 BODY:
AN estimated one million employees whose companies paid for their continuing education had an unexpected tax problem in 1995. Because Congress let a tax provision expire at the end of 1994, the educational benefits that employees received last year were treated as taxable income and showed up on their W-2's.
So a worker in the 28 percent tax bracket who received the maximum benefit of $5,250 paid an extra $1,470 in taxes. 
 Congress is considering whether to reinstate the so-called educational assistance benefit, and if it makes the benefit retroactive for 1995, workers can get a refund by filing an amended return. On Tuesday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved legislation containing a provision to reinstate the benefit, retroactive through last year.
Of course, all the unpleasantness and extra paperwork required for a refund could have been avoided had Congress not allowed the law to expire on Dec. 31, 1994. It seems that Congress has a blind spot when it comes to the program. The benefit's favorable tax status has expired at least seven times in the last 18 years; each time, it was reinstated retroactively. Some companies, assuming the provision will be renewed, don't bother to put the amount of the benefit on employees' W-2's.
While there are no reports that anyone suffered Internal Revenue Service penalties as a result, tax consultants, lobbyists and employers are tired of the problem.
"We've been through this so many times, it's such a mess," said Sheldon Steinbach, general counsel for the American Council on Education in Washington.
Complicating matters this time, the measure to reinstate the benefit, found in Section 127 of the I.R.S. code, may become part of the controversial legislation to raise the minimum wage. And that legislation is not likely to enjoy a quick ride through Congress.
Blaise Kah, a tax expert in the Cincinnati office of Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm, said many companies had figured out that they could avoid the uncertainties over Section 127 by using other sections of the I.R.S. code. These provisions, which do not expire, allow the employer to deduct the cost of providing job-related training as a business expense; the cost is not considered income for the employee.
"The only difference between it and Section 127 is that the training or schooling must be job-related. And if it is, why should an employer go to the trouble of all the paperwork of 127, not to mention the political uncertainty?" Mr. Kah said.
Most of the 800 member companies of the Arizona Employers Council in Phoenix have done exactly that. Bill Dahlberg, human resource adviser for the organization, said: "Why create a tax issue for the employer and the employee? You never really know what Washington is going to do."
But partisans of Section 127, including President Clinton, say its broader scope is at the heart of an educated society and a more stable work force. Paying for a secretary, for example, to pursue a college degree in an unrelated field like engineering or computers or even art history is one way for companies to keep good employees, according to the Associated Industries of Florida, an employer group of 6,000 companies.
Jacie Osborne, 47, of Denver, a single working mother who has used the educational assistance benefit to attend college, said she would not return to school until the benefit was renewed. Ms. Osborne, an investment specialist who has worked for U S West for 14 years, is about a year away from a bachelor's degree in business and economics at Regis University in Denver. She said she hoped to own her own business someday.
She dropped out temporarily last year because of family needs. When she decided to return, the benefit had expired. Ms. Osborne says she cannot afford the taxes on the benefit.
"Hopefully, things will go our way in Congress," she said. "I appreciate what U S West has done for me, but the Government is making it extremely difficult for me to finish my degree."
