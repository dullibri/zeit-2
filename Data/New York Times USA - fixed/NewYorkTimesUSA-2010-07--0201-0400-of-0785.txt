HEADLINE: The Meek Emerge As the Mighty Fall

BYLINE: By EDWARD HADAS and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

 BODY:
The poor are teaching the rich a lesson. It used to be that the world's less developed nations were the problem children -- giving plutocrats too much power while running irresponsibly large budget deficits and failing to overcome deep internal imbalances. Now, rich countries look like the new poor.
 Start with trade. China and middle-income commodity exporters have most of the biggest trade surpluses while the world's richest large economy, the United States, still runs the biggest deficit. With surpluses come financial clout and funds for investment. Deficits lead to dependency and, eventually, industrial weakness. 
 Fiscal deficits are too high everywhere, but after the financial crisis of 2008 the rich are in far worse shape than the poor. Deficits in developed economies like the United States and Britain have jumped by 7.7 percent of G.D.P., close to twice the 4.2 percent rise in middle-income countries, according to the International Monetary Fund.
 And rich-country governments are finding it hard to summon the political will to reduce those outsize deficits. Leaders know they have a problem but can't bring their people -- and sometimes their political allies -- along with them. President Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy are among them. That's a big contrast to the strong and popular governments in countries such as Brazil.
 Finally, rich countries seem unable to agree on what they stand for. America's culture wars define its politics. There are sharp disputes about the future of the European Union and the euro. Japan is forever searching for its role in the world. Poor countries have their fights, but much less doubt in their overarching goal of getting richer.
 Sure, there are exceptions. Many poor countries, such as Thailand, are struggling. And some rich ones, including Germany, are doing relatively well despite the economic turmoil surrounding them. But the global balance does seem to have shifted.
 This shouldn't be too surprising. People in developing countries want more wealth, and are learning from those who amassed it before them. As for the cultural malaise of the already rich, almost two millennia after the Roman Empire started its decline, the jury is still out on what exactly went wrong.
 Exxon's Long Hedge
 Exxon Mobil Corporation's $31 billion hedge is way out of the money. Gas prices have tumbled since the company agreed to pay that amount for the gas producer XTO. That doesn't make the deal a bust. A carbon tax might make the XTO purchase look smart, but Exxon benefits for as long as Congress twiddles its thumbs.
 To his credit, Exxon's chief executive, Rex W. Tillerson, has made little attempt to mask the grim economics of the natural gas market. If anything, these have worsened since December when Exxon broke a decade-long deal fast to buy XTO. Since then, the already depressed gas price has fallen nearly another 20 percent. The very technical success of drillers uncovering growing quantities of shale gas is proving their financial undoing.
 The Congressional failure to place a price on carbon, a move that promised to catapult demand for clean-burning gas, is a bigger worry still. Exxon's own number-crunchers assume a $30-a-ton price for carbon over the next 10 years, leading electric utilities to ditch coal for natural gas. Since December's XTO deal, however, what minimal Republican support existed for a climate bill has nearly disappeared. With unemployment so high, both political parties seem hesitant to push a bill that might be accused of destroying jobs. So it may be years before XTO contributes to Exxon's industry-beating return on equity.
 Yet Mr. Tillerson may not be too perturbed. XTO represents a fraction of Exxon's business. The heads of Exxon's other carbon-spewing businesses are unlikely to be praying for climate legislation. The company's downstream and refining business already has lost over $200 million since the start of 2009 and a price on carbon would likely add to the pain.
 What's more, the XTO bet doesn't need to pay off any time soon. Unlike fast-gushing deepwater oil, XTO's shale wells will last for 40 years at current rates of production. By holding on to leases as cheaply as possible and drilling in the most promising wells, Exxon can keep shale businesses from being too much of a drain. EDWARD HADAS and CHRISTOPHER SWANN

HEADLINE: Dance New Amsterdam Faces Possible Eviction From Its Home

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
Dance New Amsterdam, the large dance space in Lower Manhattan, faces possible eviction on Wednesday from its city-owned home at 280 Broadway because it owes more than half a million dollars in rent, Catherine Peila, the executive director, said Wednesday. ''With the high rent and the recession, we didn't earn enough money to pay the rent,'' Ms. Peila said in an interview. ''The arts community should really be revved up: we serve 8,000 students, we employ 250 people a year, and we moved to Lower Manhattan to revitalize the area.'' In a statement released Wednesday, the organization, founded in 1984, said it wanted to maintain its mission of teaching dance, commissioning choreographers and presenting performances. It is seeking a meeting with Fram Realty, which leases the building for $68,945 a month, and with city agencies to work out an agreement for lower rent to match current market rates and for a nonprofit tax abatement, Ms Peila said. A representative of Fram Realty could not be reached for comment. Over the years, Dance New Amsterdam has presented Mark Morris, Urban Bush Women and the South African troupe Sduduzo Ka-Mbili/Juxtapower (with Charmaine Trotman, above), among other artists.

HEADLINE: After a Ruinous Fire, Open for Business Again in Queens

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
A little more than four months ago, a faulty boiler in a furniture store ignited a fire that raged for hours in Jackson Heights, Queens, destroying eight mom-and-pop shops in a squat landmark building at the corner of 37th Avenue and 84th Street. By the time firefighters tamed the flames, all that was left was charred wood and fallen bricks.
 Salvage workers recovered a box with 18 hundred-dollar bills in it from the register of a party favors store, and they rejoiced. At least something had been saved, one of them said at the time. But it turns out the bills were fake, good luck charms that the store's owner, Maria Solano, had been handing to her customers since the dawn of the new year, she said. 
 ''I had to start all over again, from scratch,'' Ms. Solano, 54, said last Thursday from her party store, Lalita. She reopened it in May in a space no bigger than a sports car, in a store that also houses a travel agency, a hair salon, a clothing shop and a spa. 
 Four of the businesses ravaged by the fire on Feb. 13 have reopened, which is a measure of victory for their owners and for a community that rallied behind them. Neighbors held fund-raising parties for those who were left unemployed, and Daniel Dromm, the local City Council member, organized workshops and held a meeting with the city's Department of Small Business Services to help the business owners get back on their feet.
 Still, the going has been tough, in part because it has been hard for small businesses to survive in a gentrifying neighborhood like Jackson Heights, where the price of commercial space has shot up in recent years, forcing many old-timers to close shop. (In an interesting twist, one of the burned-out businesses, Colony Wine and Liquor, will reopen next month in the space that had housed Cavalier Restaurant and Lounge, a neighborhood institution, for more than 50 years. The restaurant shut down in February because of a sudden spike in rent.)
 A block from the fire scene, at the corner of 37th Avenue and 86th Street, the furniture store where the flames ignited reopened under a new name. Across the street, Jose Diaz, 28, reopened Willo Barber Shop last month in a formerly vacant store. ''My clients are starting to come back, but it's still slow,'' Mr. Diaz said.
 Meanwhile, the lot where the fire broke out remains vacant, a hole in the ground still littered by debris. On June 3, the property's owner, Yin Hu of Wenzhou Realty LLC in Flushing, filed for a permit to build a six-story building with 45 apartments, commercial space and a community room at the site, but the Department of Buildings turned down the application, raising several zoning objections. Ryan Fitzgibbon, a spokeswoman for the department, said the main issue was that the proposed building exceeded the floor-to-area ratio allowed for the area, or the dimensions permitted under local zoning laws.
 Residents expect that Mr. Hu will reapply. Opponents of putting a big building in the heart of Jackson Heights' historic district, on a strip mostly occupied by single-story brick structures built in the 1800s, are circulating a petition in case he does. The petition says that ''moving forward with the owner's plans would have a damaging effect on the historic aesthetic of the neighborhood, deprive many dwellings of sunlight, increase traffic, decrease parking and exacerbate overcrowding in schools and local playgrounds.''
 Councilman Dromm said that Jackson Heights had ''many unmet needs, like a youth center.'' He said he had reached out to Mr. Hu to see if a compromise could be reached on the scale of his plans, but ''he really doesn't seem to want to cooperate.'' Mr. Hu did not return messages left for him at his office.
 Katie Musselwhite-Goldsmith, a mother of two young children whose apartment overlooks the fire scene, has helped organize the petition. She said that more than 300 people have signed it and she expects that many more will do it in the coming days as copies have been spread across several local businesses, including a dry cleaner, a coffee shop and a wine store.
 ''Our neighborhood is overcrowded as it is. There are waiting lists for kindergarten classes, and we have very little green space,'' Ms. Musselwhite-Goldsmith said. ''We don't need a big building in our midst.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Claims From Jobless At Lowest Since May

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits dropped sharply last week, a sign that layoffs could be slowing. 
 First-time requests for jobless aid dropped by 21,000 to a seasonally adjusted 454,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. The decline takes claims to their lowest level since early May, erasing the increases of the last two months. 
 Still, claims have fluctuated wildly in the last several weeks and have not dropped below January levels. Elevated unemployment claims, along with last month's weak jobs report and a struggling housing market, have economists worried that the recovery is slowing.
 ''While the report is good news, it would need to be followed up by several more weeks to suggest a pickup in hiring,'' Julia Coronado, an economist at BNP Paribas, said in a note to clients.
 Even as first-time claims fall, the number of unemployed Americans receiving benefits is dropping sharply because their aid is ending.
 Benefits were cut off for about 350,000 people in the week of June 19 because Congress left for a weeklong recess without extending federal jobless aid.
 The Labor Department estimates that about 1.7 million have lost benefits as of last week, after extended unemployment insurance expired in late May. Those numbers could reach 3.3 million by the end of the month if Congress doesn't pass an extension when it returns from recess.
 During the recession, Congress added up to 73 weeks of extra benefits to the 26 weeks typically provided by states. But Senate Republicans have blocked efforts to continue those extra benefits, citing concerns over the deficit.
 Jobless claims might have been higher if General Motors had gone ahead with its traditional summer shutdown. Many autoworkers file claims for unemployment during that time. But the company has said that it will skip the shutdown this year, potentially lowering claims over the next several weeks.
 Initial jobless claims have been stuck near 450,000 all year, after dropping steadily last year from a peak of 651,000 in March 2009.
 The tally of people continuing to claim benefits fell by 224,000, to 4.4 million, the department said. But that doesn't include 4.6 million other people who received extended benefits paid for by the federal government in the week ended June 19, the latest data available.

HEADLINE: Europe Resumes Sharing Financial Data With U.S.

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER; Eric Lichtblau contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- The European Parliament on Thursday moved to mend a rift with the United States as it approved restarting a program to track financial and bank transfers that the United States says is vital to its effort to fight terrorism.
 When the Parliament voted to suspend the system in February, it cited unease in Europe over the way personal data was used by companies and by governments. 
 But the United States warned that suspending the program left a security gap, and on Thursday United States officials praised the resumption. President Obama said that the program had resulted in more than 1,500 investigative leads to European allies in the past nine years. 
 Stuart Levey, under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told reporters on a conference call that the program was ''a highly valuable counterterrorism tool. Even if the transaction at issue is just a few hundred dollars or hundred euros, it still provides us with the kind of concrete information that we are able to then share with our allies,'' he said. 
 He said he expected to see ''full restoration'' of the program on Aug. 1. 
 Under a revised agreement, the European Union won assurances from the United States that any requests for information would be evaluated by the European police agency Europol, and that European Union citizens would be able to complain in United States courts or government agencies if they suspected that their data was incorrect or wrongly used. 
 Mr. Levey acknowledged that details still needed to be worked out, particularly about the work of a European Union official who would monitor how the information on financial transactions was used during counterterrorism investigations. But Mr. Levey said that nothing in the revised agreement would compromise its effectiveness. 
 Without the program, the United States can still rely on agreements on mutual legal assistance with countries to seek the data. But that process of gathering the information is a good deal more cumbersome. 
 Mr. Levey said that the arrests by the Norwegian police of three men suspected of having ties to Al Qaeda on charges of preparing terrorist attacks, possibly in Britain and the United States, were partly a result of the use of the system based on information the United States had at the end of last year. He gave no further details. 
 For nearly five years after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, American counterterrorism officials at the Treasury Department and the C.I.A. had secret access to vast reams of financial data through a high-level agreement with the cooperative, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, known as Swift. 
 American analysts used the data to examine tens of thousands of banking transactions in an effort to detect possible financing for terrorist activity. The program fell into a somewhat untested area of data collection law and was run outside the American court system; the Bush administration claimed the authority for it partly through the president's emergency economic powers. 
 Disclosure of the program's existence in 2006 by The New York Times and other news media organizations set off protests in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the United States, over what critics charged were privacy violations and possible illegality. A few cases of abuse and improper searches were also reported. Although a small portion of the transactions involved Americans' banking records, most of the activity focused on Europe and other targets overseas, as analysts sought to follow chains of suspicious money movement in an effort to trace how terrorists were raising their funds. 
 Whether and how the program should continue has been the subject of diplomatic tussling between the United States and its European allies. Along with related issues like United States access to passenger flight data from European flights, the program became a key test of the balance between national security and civil liberties. 
 Mr. Obama said ''this cooperative course is another example of how we can work with our European partners to prevent terrorism and simultaneously respect the rule of law.''
 The new agreement, he said, ''reflects significant additional data privacy safeguards but still retains the effectiveness and integrity of this indispensable counterterrorism program.''
 Europeans and Americans have been struggling for years to set the right balance between protecting privacy on the one hand, and fighting terror on the other, and they still could clash in coming months over policies that raise similar issues. 
 Questions about sharing bank data arose in 2006, when it emerged that a Belgian cooperative responsible for routing about $6 trillion daily among banks, brokerage houses, stock exchanges and other institutions had provided information about transactions involving thousands of Americans and others in the United States in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 Some members of Parliament remained firmly opposed; the result of the vote on Thursday was 484 votes in favor, 109 against and 12 abstentions. 
 Rui Tavares, a member from Portugal, protested that ''big political groups have caved in to the American lobby and decided that it is now acceptable to transfer 90 million pieces of data per month'' to United States authorities. 
 But Sophie in 't Veld, a Dutch member of the European Parliament, and the legislator who helped lead efforts to block the agreement in February, voted in favor on Thursday, largely because the agreement included a pledge eventually to end bulk transfers of data to the United States from the European Union. 
 Even so, Ms. in 't Veld acknowledged that the agreement could be open to legal challenge because of possible conflicts with European standards of data protection. 
 One of the next battlegrounds between the European Union and the United States over privacy is likely to focus on the passenger records used by airlines that may include names, addresses, phone numbers, itineraries and credit card numbers of passengers. 
 The information was initially gathered for commercial purposes but is increasingly being used to combat crime as governments on both sides of the Atlantic have expanded their powers of surveillance in favor of safeguarding against attacks. 
 Giving passengers a way to challenge the sharing of their personal data in United States courts is a key demand of privacy advocates in Europe -- though it is not clear under what circumstances passengers would learn that their records were being misused or were inaccurate. 
 American and European officials would be ''well advised to listen to what the European Parliament wants in order to get a 'yes' at the end of the road in terms of passenger rights,'' said Ms. in 't Veld, who is the legislator coordinating the issue for the chamber and who helps lead the influential parliamentary committee that oversees civil liberties.

HEADLINE: Fresh Perspective On Familiar Pop Master

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Inspired by mundane images, Roy Lichtenstein managed to create art that has become the stuff of legend: illustrations of advertisements for things like foot medication, hot dogs and BB guns, not to mention his signature reinterpretations of comic book images. The work of Lichtenstein, who died in 1997, has been studied and studied again, exhibited in museum retrospectives and galleries, like the show of still lifes now on view at Gagosian in Chelsea. It seems impossible there is anything new left to see. 
 But the Morgan Library & Museum, in its continuing effort to embrace the 20th and 21st centuries, has unearthed a group of black-and-white drawings never before shown together. Made between 1961 and 1968, these are not quick doodles done as preparatory drawings for paintings; they are finished drawings large in scale, many about three feet wide and two or three feet high. 
 ''There are a finite number of them, fewer than 60 that exist, and we have tried to get all of them,'' said William M. Griswold, the Morgan's director. Loans for the show, ''Roy Lichtenstein: The Black-and-White Drawings, 1961-1968,'' opening Sept. 24, have come from museums in the United States and abroad as well as from private collections. 
 While she was organizing the show, Isabelle Dervaux, the Morgan's curator of modern and contemporary drawings, was able to locate some of the advertisements, catalogs and clippings that were Lichtenstein's inspiration. She said she found the material in archives, including those of the Lichtenstein Foundation and of his longtime dealer, Leo Castelli. Some of the material will be included in the show. 
 Ms. Dervaux also worked with the Morgan's conservator to discover more about Lichtenstein's technique. They tried, for instance, to recreate his Benday dots of newsprint using a kind of ink called tusche ink. ''We did a lot of experiments,'' she said, ''including trying to make the dots with a liquid tusche, but it became too runny.'' They discovered that from 1963 on Lichtenstein used a lithographic rubbing crayon. 
 Before that he used a handmade, perforated stencil to make small irregular and unevenly spaced dots because he wanted to preserve the crudeness of the commercial images he was imitating. But in 1962 he bought a perforated industrial screen, which was more precise. 
 While his inspirations might have been lowbrow, like romance or superhero or war comics, he used materials of the highest quality, creating drawings on the finest sheets of watermarked artist's paper. 
 The contrast between many of the compositions and their inspirations shows that Lichtenstein did not simply copy what he saw but often reworked images. For ''Keds,'' a 1962 picture based on an advertisement for Sears, Roebuck & Company, Lichtenstein gave greater emphasis to the geometric pattern on the sole of the sneaker. And in ''Bratatat'' and ''Jet Pilot'' -- two drawings taken from war comics that depict a pilot in his cockpit -- he honed in on the pilot's helmet and oxygen mask. 
 ''Roy Lichtenstein'' will be on view at the Morgan from Sept. 24 to Jan. 2 and then travel to the Albertina in Vienna. 
 A HOME FOR GRACES
 Since the Metropolitan Museum of Art reopened its majestic Greek and Roman galleries in 2007, the centerpiece of the reimagined space has been the stunning marble sculpture ''Three Graces.'' While most visitors have probably assumed it belongs to the museum, this second-century copy of a Greek work has been on loan from an anonymous collector since 1992. 
 This week the Met announced that after long negotiations it was able to buy -- with the help of numerous trustees and friends -- the ''Three Graces'' for a price it would not disclose. Experts familiar with the work say it has been valued at somewhere from $12 million to $15 million, although the museum was likely able to negotiate a lower price. 
 ''We like loans to come to us as gifts, but sometimes we have to take other steps,'' said Thomas P. Campbell, the Met's director. ''It's fair to say that this is one of the finest pieces of Roman sculpture to come on the market in several decades.'' Had the Met not been able to strike a deal, the sculpture would have probably headed to auction. 
 Provenance is often a problem with antiquities, but in this case, Mr. Campbell explained, the museum knows where the sculpture has been since 1892, when it was discovered in Rome by accident during construction work. It entered the collection of the Italian collector Joachim Ferroni, and after his death, in 1909, it belonged to Ercole Canessa, a celebrated Italian dealer. 
 In 1915 the Italian government decide to allocate a special exhibition area for Canessa's collections in the Italian pavilion of the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. The ''Three Graces'' has been in the United States ever since (probably sold through Canessa's New York gallery at first) and owned by a succession of New York collectors. 
 NEW RUINS
 The replicated remnants of a classical column -- the romantic remains of an ancient ruin -- surrounded by debris including a sword, helmet and the body of a dead swallow will take over the Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at Fifth Avenue and 60th Street, in September. The work of the British artist Ryan Gander, ''The Happy Prince'' is an installation commissioned by the nonprofit Public Art Fund, which presents art around New York City. 
 Fashioned from reinforced concrete, the installation was inspired by Oscar Wilde's children's story ''The Happy Prince,'' the tale of a gilded statue of a prince who befriends a swallow. The bird dies at the prince's feet, and the prince is toppled from his perch. 
 ''Ryan Gander is an artist who I have been following for a while now,'' said Nicholas Baume, the Public Art Fund's director and chief curator. ''Although he's had a significant career in Europe, he is not as well known here.'' 
 But that is about to change this fall. Not only because of the Public Art Fund's commission but also because the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum is planning a site-specific installation, on view from Oct. 1 to Jan. 9. It will be the third entry in its contemporary art series ''Intervals.'' 
 In the installation visitors to the museum's Aye Simon Reading Room, off the second level of the Frank Lloyd Wright rotunda, will encounter debris very different from the kind that makes up ''The Happy Prince.'' This work explores the failed friendship between the artists Piet Mondrian and Theo van Doesburg, collaborators who severed ties in 1924. Mr. Gander has imagined them crashing through a Wright stained-glass window with fragments of glass over books about Wright's life.

HEADLINE: European Plane Maker Submits Bid for U.S. Tankers

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company submitted an 8,800-page bid on Thursday for a $35 billion Air Force tanker contract amid tensions over whether European subsidies would give it a cost advantage over Boeing. 
 Boeing, based in Chicago, plans to file its bid Friday, and the Pentagon will pick the winner under a formula that amounts to a shootout over the lowest price. 
 The bids are being submitted about a week after a panel of the World Trade Organization ruled that Airbus had received subsidies -- in the form of loans from European governments at below-market interest rates -- to build its commercial airplanes.
 That ruling has fueled calls by Boeing's political supporters for the Pentagon to add to the Airbus bid price the estimated value of the subsidies on the Airbus A330-200 -- the model on which the EADS tanker is based.
 But Ralph Crosby, the chairman of EADS North America, said Thursday that Boeing supporters were ''wasting a lot of time trying to derail a process because their airplane is inferior.''
 Mr. Crosby said the A330 had beaten Boeing's 767 in the commercial jet market because it was more modern and efficient.
 The Pentagon has said its main concern is to get the best deal. 
 The companies have fought over the contract, for 179 planes, for several years. The contract could eventually be extended to cover 400 to 500 planes worth $100 billion.
 EADS, which owns Airbus, and Northrop Grumman won a similar contest in 2008, but government auditors overturned the award because of problems with how the bids were judged. 
 Northrop dropped out of the partnership earlier this year, saying it did not see how the larger, and normally more expensive, Airbus plane could win against the Boeing tanker, which would be based on the midsize 767 jet. 
 EADS decided to go forward on its own after the Pentagon extended the deadline and President Obama promised Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, that the bidding would be fair.
 The W.T.O. ruling, which is subject to appeal, concluded that Airbus would have been a ''much weaker'' company with enormous debts without the low-interest loans from European governments. It added that, without the aid, the A330-200 ''could not have been launched when it was without significantly higher costs.''
 Airbus executives are hoping that the W.T.O. will find that Boeing also benefited from subsidies when it rules on a countersuit filed by the European Union. W.T.O. officials said Thursday that an interim ruling in that case, which had been expected on July 16, would be delayed until September.
 The chief executive, Thomas O. Enders, called the delay a disappointment but said he remained confident that it would show that Boeing had received billions of dollars in illegal subsidies. 
 Given the economic troubles, the other big issue is jobs. Boeing asserted that it and its suppliers on the tanker would provide 50,000 jobs in the United States. 
 EADS, which said it would assemble its tankers in Alabama, maintained that it could supply almost as many.
 Mr. Crosby said that if EADS, which now builds its tankers in France, won the contest, it would begin doing the final assembly in Mobile on the fourth tanker.
 Sean O'Keefe, the chief executive of EADS North America, said cheaper operating costs in Alabama could also enable EADS to lower its price. He said EADS would also gain efficiencies by building commercial freighters in the new Mobile plant. This would also represent a beachhead in the commercial market that Boeing would like to prevent.

HEADLINE: Public and Private: Restoring a Montana Spring Creek

BYLINE: By VERLYN KLINKENBORG

 BODY:
A couple of weeks ago, I walked along a spring creek in the upper Madison Valley, just south of the town of Ennis, Mont. As my guide, Jeff Laszlo, explained, the creek is one of the unnamed tributaries of the Madison River, fed by innumerable springs along the valley's rich bottomland. The creek meanders for miles before it reaches the Madison, gaining water, providing spawning grounds for fish and invaluable wetland habitat for birds. I looked on in disbelief, because the section we were hiking -- nearly eight miles of cold, clear waters -- did not exist before 2005.
 Or rather, it existed until 1951, when Jeff Laszlo's grandfather dewatered this section of land by digging canals to draw the water along the edge of one of the alluvial benches that define the Madison Valley. His purpose was to move water to other sections of his ranch and to improve the grazing. In the narrow agricultural logic of the time, his ditches made a certain economic sense. And if it seems strange that his grandson would undo all that work 60-some years later, Laszlo notes that he is simply obeying a different economic logic -- one that considers increased biodiversity to be one of the ranch's most important assets. 
 Restoring this stream was not simply a matter of diverting the water back into its old channels. It was an intensely collaborative process, involving more than a dozen state, federal and private partners -- including the United States Department of Agriculture, the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, the local power company, PPL Montana, and the Trust for Public Land. 
 And it was a major construction project, requiring the precise engineering of new streambed and shallow backwaters and the careful laying and planting of new bank sod and willows. Photographs of the construction show an almost nightmarish scene -- excavators hard at work in what looks as much like the digging of those old canals as the restoring of a stream.
 But wherever I looked, I saw only nature, even in sections of the stream that were restored just last year. The speed with which this habitat -- aquatic and terrestrial -- has altered itself has surprised nearly everyone. 
 Within weeks, trout began to move up from downstream, and they are now abundant. Water temperatures in the stream have dropped significantly, and daily variation in temperature has decreased. The subterranean water table has risen, and bird populations have greatly increased and, more importantly, diversified. Aquatic insects are again proliferating. 
 The hope is that this restoration will serve as a model for landowners farther downstream -- and, indeed, wherever wetland habitat can be restored. The critical point -- one that Laszlo emphasized repeatedly -- is that the restoration could never have been accomplished without the collaboration of private and public partners. It has been a test not only for him and the organizations and agencies that have worked with him. It has also tested conventional assumptions about the proper use of public money -- which was, in this case, used to help restore private land without providing public access. 
 But the new spring creek on this ranch, though a private fishing stream, serves many public purposes. It is a wild hatchery for trout that move downstream to the Madison River, a public river. It is a nesting and feeding ground for birds that use these wetlands only seasonally. And it acts as an enormous sponge, retaining and releasing water critical for generating power much farther downstream. 
 The real beauty is that from the bench above this creek, where a large band of curlews was feeding, I couldn't tell that man had been at work -- not in the past five years and not in 1951. And neither could the birds and the fish.

HEADLINE: Biggest Defaulters on Mortgages Are the Rich

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD; Carol Pogash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
LOS ALTOS, Calif. -- No need for tears, but the well-off are losing their master suites and saying goodbye to their wine cellars.
 The housing bust that began among the working class in remote subdivisions and quickly progressed to the suburban middle class is striking the upper class in privileged enclaves like this one in Silicon Valley.
 Whether it is their residence, a second home or a house bought as an investment, the rich have stopped paying the mortgage at a rate that greatly exceeds the rest of the population.
 More than one in seven homeowners with loans in excess of a million dollars are seriously delinquent, according to data compiled for The New York Times by the real estate analytics firm CoreLogic. 
 By contrast, homeowners with less lavish housing are much more likely to keep writing checks to their lender. About one in 12 mortgages below the million-dollar mark is delinquent.
 Though it is hard to prove, the CoreLogic data suggest that many of the well-to-do are purposely dumping their financially draining properties, just as they would any sour investment.
 ''The rich are different: they are more ruthless,'' said Sam Khater, CoreLogic's senior economist.
 Five properties here in Los Altos were scheduled for foreclosure auctions in a recent issue of The Los Altos Town Crier, the weekly newspaper where local legal notices are posted. Four have unpaid mortgage debt of more than $1 million, with the highest amount $2.8 million.
 Not so long ago, said Chris Redden, the paper's advertising services director, ''it was a surprise if we had one foreclosure a month.''
 The sheriff in Cook County, Ill., is increasingly in demand to evict foreclosed owners in the upscale suburbs to the north and west of Chicago -- like Wilmette, La Grange and Glencoe. The occupants are always gone by the time a deputy gets there, a spokesman said, but just barely.
 In Las Vegas, Ken Lowman, a longtime agent for luxury properties, said four of the 11 sales he brokered in June were distressed properties.
 ''I've never seen the wealthy hit like this before,'' Mr. Lowman said. ''They made their plans based on the best of all possible scenarios -- that their incomes would continue to grow, that real estate would never drop. Not many had a plan B.''
 The defaulting owners, he said, often remain as long as they can. ''They're in denial,'' he said.
 Here in Los Altos, where the median home price of $1.5 million makes it one of the most exclusive towns in the country, several houses scheduled for auction were still occupied this week. The people who answered the door were reluctant to explain their circumstances in any detail.
 At one house, where the lender was owed $1.3 million, there was a couch out front wrapped in plastic. A woman said she and her husband had lost their jobs and were moving in with relatives. At another house, the family said they were renters. A third family, whose mortgage is $1.6 million, said they would be moving this weekend.
 At a vacant house with a pool, where the lender was seeking $1.27 million, a raft and a water gun lay abandoned on the entryway floor.
 Lenders are fearful that many of the 11 million or so homeowners who owe more than their house is worth will walk away from them, especially if the real estate market begins to weaken again. The so-called strategic defaults have become a matter of intense debate in recent months.
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two quasi-governmental mortgage finance companies that own most of the mortgages in America with a value of less than $500,000, are alternately pleading with distressed homeowners not to be bad citizens and brandishing a stick at them.
 In a recent column on Freddie Mac's Web site, the company's executive vice president, Don Bisenius, acknowledged that walking away ''might well be a good decision for certain borrowers'' but argues that those who do it are trashing their communities.
 The CoreLogic data suggest that the rich do not seem to have concerns about the civic good uppermost in their mind, especially when it comes to investment and second homes. Nor do they appear to be particularly worried about being sued by their lender or frozen out of future loans by Fannie Mae, possible consequences of default.
 The delinquency rate on investment homes where the original mortgage was more than $1 million is now 23 percent. For cheaper investment homes, it is about 10 percent.
 With second homes, the delinquency rate for both types of owners was rising in concert until the stock market crashed in September 2008. That sent the percentage of troubled million-dollar loans spiraling up much faster than the smaller loans.
 ''Those with high net worth have other resources to lean on if they get in trouble,'' said Mr. Khater, the analyst. ''If they're going delinquent faster than anyone else, that tells me they are doing so willingly.''
 Willingly, but not necessarily publicly. The rapper Chamillionaire is a plain-talking exception. He recently walked away from a $2 million house he bought in Houston in 2006.
 ''I just decided to let it go, give it back to the bank,'' he told the celebrity gossip TV show ''TMZ.'' ''I just didn't feel like it was a good investment.''
 The rich and successful often come naturally to this sort of attitude, said Brent T. White, a law professor at the University of Arizona who has studied strategic defaults.
 ''They may be less susceptible to the shame and fear-mongering used by the government and the mortgage banking industry to keep underwater homeowners from acting in their financial best interest,'' Mr. White said.
 The CoreLogic data measures serious delinquencies, which means the borrower has missed at least three payments in a row. At that point, lenders traditionally file a notice of default and the house enters the official foreclosure process. 
 In the current environment, however, notices of default are down for all types of loans as lenders work with owners in various modification programs. Even so, owners in some of the more expensive neighborhoods in and around San Francisco are beginning to head for the exit, according to data compiled by MDA DataQuick. 
 In Los Altos, Los Altos Hills and the most expensive neighborhood in adjoining Mountain View, defaults in the first five months of this year edged up to 16, from 15 in the same period in 2009 and four in 2008.
 The East Bay suburb of Orinda had eight notices of default for million-dollar properties, up from five in the same period last year. On Nob Hill in San Francisco, there were four, up from one. The Marina neighborhood had four, up from two.
 The vast majority of owners in these upscale communities are still paying the mortgage, of course. But they appear to be cutting back in other ways. The once-thriving Los Altos downtown is pocked with more than a dozen empty storefronts in a six-block stretch.
 But this is still Silicon Valley, where failure can always be considered a prelude to success.
 In the middle of a workday, one troubled homeowner here leaned over his laptop at the kitchen table, trying to maneuver his way out from under his debt and figure out the next big thing.
 His five-bedroom house, drained of hundreds of thousands of dollars of equity over the last 13 years, is scheduled for auction July 20. Nine months ago, after his latest business (he has had several) failed in what he called ''the global meltdown,'' the man, a technology entrepreneur, said he quit making his $9,000 monthly payments. 
 ''I'm going to be downsizing,'' he said. 
 The man spoke on the condition of anonymity because, he said, he did not want his current problems to interfere with his coming reinvention. ''I'm a businessman,'' he explained. ''I have to be upbeat.''

HEADLINE: Lower East Side Tale, Refracted Nine Times

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Heaven knows the tired old New York art world could use a fresh story or two. This summer it gets one, secondhand, in ''Lush Life,'' a big and unusually ingenious group show spread over nine galleries, all but one on the Lower East Side.
 Assembled by two independent curators, Omar Lopez-Chahoud and Franklin Evans, the show was inspired by the Richard Price novel ''Lush Life,'' the 2008 best seller that doubled as a Raymond Chandleresque police drama and a picaresque homage to the Lower East Side, a neighborhood that was long an immigrant enclave and is now, increasingly, a yuppie playground.
 Mr. Price's story takes place almost entirely within its bounds, which extend from, roughly, Houston Street south to Canal, and from the Bowery to the East River. The nine gallery shows -- at Sue Scott Gallery, Y Gallery, Collette Blanchard Gallery, Lehmann Maupin, Salon 94 Freemans, Invisible-Exports, Scaramouche, Eleven Rivington and On Stellar Rays -- correspond to the nine chapters of the novel, and work in each refers, sometimes specifically, to the book's plot. 
 On an early fall night in 2002, with the emergency mood induced by 9/11 still in the air, a young white man, a waiter in a local upscale bar-restaurant, is shot and killed on Eldridge Street in a mugging attempted by an even younger black man from nearby public housing. The killer runs off, and the rest of the book is basically about the hunt for him by a hard-boiled but ruminative police detective from the neighborhood precinct.
 Needless to say, other street-soiled characters enter the picture, as do images of bars, drugs, bereaved families and interrogation rooms. Along with repeated displays of racial conflict and police politics, there's a quasi-mystical apparition, a soupcon of sex and the constant presence -- as an active personality more than as a passive backdrop -- of the neighborhood itself and its stratified histories.
 The show at Sue Scott, ''Chapter 1: Whistle,'' serves, superbly, as a scene setter. It opens with a short film by the Danish artist Nanna Debois Buhl about the Lower East Side, with Jacob Riis's century-old photographs of subhuman poverty accompanied by the bland words of a contemporary tour guide.
 And seen in the context of the novel, other works take on specific narrative dimensions.
 A 2005 abstract painting by Joanne Greenbaum, with its linear webs, can be imagined as a bird's-eye map of the area, with Alice O'Malley's blurry, beautiful shots of bars and shops bringing us down to ground level. David Kramer has equipped the gallery with a functioning bar, and a piece by Derrick Adams -- stacked photographs of a black male head ornamented with silver brickwork patterning -- can be taken as a reference to the low-income housing that surrounds relentlessly gentrifying terrain.
 A rumored appearance of the Virgin Mary in a Rivington Street deli -- in reality nothing more than an accident of condensation on a freezer door -- makes for one of the novel's more sardonic early episodes. And it is neatly suggested here by Judi Werthein's video of her own projected ''live'' figure of the Virgin created in Spain in 2006.
 The show wraps up with an installation by David Shapiro of drawings, small sculptures and found objects spread out on a tarp like a sidewalk display, and with a wall sculpture by Justen Ladda: a narrow lozenge of polished cedar called ''Blue-Red Night Mirror,'' which can, with a little imagining, be taken as a blood-tinged reflection of the noirish ''Lush Life'' world.
 If none of the other shows now open -- the one at Eleven Rivington makes its debut on Thursday -- offer as many point-for-point correspondences with the novel as this one does, there are still plenty of direct allusions to it.
 For example, the dialogue-intensive book's long second chapter is taken up primarily by the marathon police grilling of a co-worker of the victim who is initially suspected of the shooting. The chapter's real subject, though, is a broader one: the slipperiness of truth. Although it is pretty clear that the man is innocent, the intersection of his own self-centered fears and the need of the police to nail a perpetrator keeps the illusion of his guilt in play.
 The corresponding exhibition, ''Chapter 2: Liar,'' at On Stellar Rays, alludes to the mistaken interrogation in an amusing video of polygraph performance by Carol Irving and in a bulky Ezra Johnson painting that consists of the words ''Large Doubt.'' But the pieces by other artists -- Tim Davis, Scott Hug, Elisabeth Subrin -- touch on more generic truth-suspending elements, like addiction, money and celebrity, that not only swim through the book but are shaping the new Lower East Side.
 At barely five pages, the novel's third chapter, ''First Bird (A Few Butterflies),'' is one of the shortest. In it the young killer, Tristan, sneaks back to his family's apartment after the murder and lies in bed listening to the cries of birds at dawn, a sound at once comforting and disturbing.
 And the show at Invisible-Exports expands rather than merely illustrates the novel by pushing the bird imagery hard: in Nicholas di Genova's ballpoint-pen drawing of freakish winged creatures; in Karen Heagle's fantastic painting of vultures picking over fruit; and in Dana Levy's ghostly video of live doves flocking and fluttering in a museum gallery filled with stuffed bird specimens.
 It's easy to read in Ms. Levy's video a visual metaphor of physical death and the migration of souls, which together form a theme of the book's fourth chapter and of the exhibition ''Let It Die'' at Lehmann Maupin. Robert Beck has assembled the equivalent of a memorial street shrine outside the door. Ink drawings of skeletal figures by Nina Lola Bachhuber and a tiny painting of a bedroom immolation by Amy Longenecker-Brown command the space inside.
 The single most interesting work here, though, is Tommy Hartung's brilliantly edited video ''The Story of Edward Holmes,'' which starts out as an adventure story of a white man exploring exotic lands and goes on to flaunt and scramble racial stereotypes and make value-freighted categories like savagery and civilization seem indistinguishable.
 Race and racism loom large in Mr. Price's book, and his handling of them is problematic, not as purposefully incendiary as Tom Wolfe's take in ''Bonfire of the Vanities'' but still cartoonishly reductive. And here again, the show complicates and improves on the book.
 In ''Chapter 5: Want Cards, '' at Y Gallery (a minute basement space on a 1980s East Village model) Rudy Shepherd's bust-length paintings of black men refer to mug shots of a kind found on so-called want cards but are still personable portraits. In a crazy-quilt installation at Collette Blanchard of photographs by Robin Graubard, almost all taken on the Lower East Side, drugs and alcohol are social levelers: everyone, black and white, looks equally wasted.
 In Chapter 7 of the novel Tristan is finally identified and arrested, and his gun, the murder weapon, feverishly sought throughout the book, is recovered. It is also there in the matching show at Salon 94 Freemans in the form of a stretched-out sculpture by Robert Lazzarini. But the saga isn't over. The killer is a juvenile, a status that precludes a life sentence and reduces his potential prison time to a term calculated in the title of the book's penultimate chapter: ''17 Plus 25 Is 32.''
 This is also the title of the Chapter 8 show at Scaramouche, where art imaginatively speculates on the past and future of this character, as the book does not. With its spectacularly savory New York dialogue, the novel is stylistically addictive but purely as a narrative it has distinct limitations. Page by page it has the buzz of a ready-to-go film script. But it also has a pat Hollywood ending, with anodyne doses of redemption spread all around, short-circuiting whatever moral complexity the story might have had.
 Art is, or can be, expert at creating complex stories, particularly moral dramas, of a kind that push beyond being mere eye candy for the investing classes. This is not to say that ''Lush Life,'' the exhibition, can't be enjoyed or understood without a knowledge of ''Lush Life,'' the book. The show may lose a level of impact if certain narrative cues are missed, but it will still get you walking the streets of a neighborhood that is, with continuing transformation, both a threat and a promise, a morality tale in itself.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Filings Improve, and Investors Tally a Third Day of Gains

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The latest weekly jobs report on Thursday propelled stocks for the third day this week, building on gains that analysts hope will be sustained after corporate earnings season begins.
 After a strong opening and then a pullback, the market found its footing late in the afternoon and kept the momentum going until the close. 
 In some ways, it was the absence of bad news that buoyed stocks. But the market also advanced on a better-than-expected report on first-time jobless filings and a jump in share prices for the retail stores that topped forecasts for June sales. 
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 120.71 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,138.99. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.94 percent, or 9.98 points, to 1,070.25, and the Nasdaq composite index was up 0.74 percent, or 15.93 points, to 2175.40. The three indexes are now up at least 4 percent for the week.
 On Wednesday the stock market staged its biggest rally since May as investors bought blue-chip shares near their lowest levels this year, but some questioned whether the increases of the last few days constituted a sustainable rally.
 Mixed reports among retailers for sales in June also injected a note of caution into the markets. Over all, sales for retailers in June rose 3.1 percent, though disparities were sharp among stores and sectors. 
 ''I think it is a snapback,'' said Doug Roberts, chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research Institute. ''I think it is too soon to say the correction is over. There was so much negative news, and for the first time you had jobless numbers looking better.''
 Quincy Krosby, a market strategist for Prudential Financial, said that while the markets have ''been begging for a data point signifying that the trajectory on employment is positive,'' jobless filings need to establish a pattern of decline to help ease concerns about a double-dip recession.
 ''Today's numbers point to a much more cautious consumer who is grappling with a very stubborn employment backdrop,'' Ms. Krosby said of the retail sales report. 
 The market momentum also lifted technology and financial shares, which had been drags on the market for much of the day. Materials, consumer staples, industrials, energy and telecommunications sectors rose more than 1 percent. Eastman Chemical rose $2.07 to $56.24. Reynolds American rose $1.46 to $55.42. McDonald's rose $1.71 to $69.02.
 The yield on the 10-year Treasury note returned to 3.03 percent, from 2.98 percent Wednesday. The price fell 14/32, to 103 31/32.
 European shares were higher, aided by news from the International Monetary Fund, which increased its 2010 world growth forecast to 4.6 percent from 4.2 percent in April and raised its estimates for the United States and China.
 The FTSE 100 in London rose 1.8 percent or 90.63 points, while the DAX in Frankfurt was 0.71 percent higher. The CAC-40 in Paris rose 1.57 percent.
 At least for the day, European markets appeared to deflect the uncertainty that has been hanging over them from the sovereign debt crisis.
 The head of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, expressed cautious optimism that Europe's debt crisis was easing and that the economy in the euro zone was growing faster than expected. 
 He spoke at a news conference after the central bank kept its rates steady for another month.
 Greece took a major step forward in overhauling its debt-plagued economy by forcing through, in principle, a pension bill that would substantially cut the cost of Greece's welfare state by increasing the retirement age and slashing benefits. Investors and analysts are looking to the coming earnings reporting period to gauge how major corporations are faring and how they affect their expectations. ''Another strong day of gains could probably mean the market has made a bottom,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist for Avalon Partners.
 ''With the advent of earnings, which I think for the most part will beat market expectations, and guidance remains key as well, I think with that in focus this market certainly could regain the status of a summer rally,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Pride and Prejudice of 'Local'

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
PORTLAND, Ore. -- Eric Bechard is perfecting the new provincialism. 
 At his restaurant in the nearby wine country, he strives to serve beef and produce only from farms he has visited. The ling cod he caught when he took his 10-year-old daughter fishing off the Oregon coast? It made the menu. The rustic shelves in his kitchen were, naturally, reclaimed from a nearby barn. 
 Yet some say Mr. Bechard went too far the night he came to blows over a pig. ''Somebody,'' he said later, ''needed to be held accountable.''
 More later on the brawl. Suffice it to say, it was more than just a food fight: Portland is confronting the contradictions that come when keeping it local makes for global success. 
 As the city's corner coffee shops, indie bands and handmade bicycles have gained national and international renown, becoming -- gasp -- brand names, cries of corporatism have followed them. 
 In another city, it might seem a quaint debate. Not here.
 ''How do you maintain quality and get to a size where you can sustain yourself?'' asked Charles Heying, a professor at Portland State University and the author of ''Brew to Bikes: Portland's Artisan Economy,'' to be published in November, locally and on recycled paper. 
 Portland ranks high nationally for its rate of entrepreneurship, as measured by things like self-employment and the number of small businesses. Even during the recession, some local independent restaurants and manufacturers have increased sales and opened new outlets. 
 While other states lost workers, Oregon's labor force grew because people kept coming. The livability crowd led the way: young, white, well-educated people drawn to an outdoor -- and local -- lifestyle. 
 ''We get people who self-select,'' said Joe Cortright, a longtime economist here. ''And there's no fervor like the converted.''
 That does not mean the local economy has figured out how to absorb the stream of newcomers: the Portland area's unemployment rate was 10.2 percent in May, compared with 9.7 percent nationally. 
 In its song ''Portland Sucks,'' the local band White Fang pokes profanely at everything from the city's joblessness to its self-obsession and sometimes counterintuitive rigidity, from ''angry vegans'' to outspoken disciples of do-it-yourself (''DIY'') culture -- localism in the extreme.
 ''Being elitist about it is kind of counterproductive,'' said Erik Gage, 21, the band's lead singer, who noted that he loves living in Portland. ''You can argue about it, but I think one of the most important things about localism is getting along with the locals.''
 If you can figure out who they are.
 Duane Sorenson, who founded Stumptown Coffee Roasters in Portland in 1999, is originally from another coffee capital, the Puget Sound region of Washington. Stumptown, named for one of the city's early nicknames, now has cafes in Seattle, New York and Amsterdam. Predictably enough, it has lost a few fans in Portland as it has expanded.
 ''I don't even go to Stumptown,'' said Paul Sykes, who makes bike fenders and bottle holders out of wood. ''I go to a more local place.''
 Not that Mr. Sykes opposes growth. Most of his business comes from the Internet.
 ''I sell these things all over the world,'' he said of his products. ''That's the only way I can make any money.'' 
 It was against this push-pull between big and small, profitability and livability, ambition and identity, that a pig prompted punches the night Cochon 555, an exclusive national culinary contest, came to Portland.
 Before things got ugly that night, the pigs' pasts were a concern for several people attending the event. ''Misrepresentation!'' they chanted in the back of the room at the Governor Hotel. Mr. Bechard was the most passionate among them.
 For Mr. Bechard, it came down to this: never should a pig from Kansas or Iowa have even been entered in the contest; it only made it worse that the Iowa pig won. After all, there are Red Wattle heritage pigs raised right here in Oregon. The chefs who competed work in Oregon, and most promote locally produced food.
 ''I get there and I get the flier and I'm immediately sickened because I'm seeing 'local,' 'sustainable,' 'local farms,' 'local chefs,' 'local wine,' '' Mr. Bechard recalled, ''and then two of the pigs are from Kansas and Iowa? I'm looking at my friend and he said, 'Eric, just let it go.' ''
 Many hours and drinks and insults later, witnesses told police Mr. Bechard was the aggressor when he encountered Brady Lowe, the event's Atlanta-based organizer, outside a bar. Words were hurled and fists flew. The police came, firing Tasers and pepper spray. 
 Mr. Lowe, who said his leg was fractured in the fight, said Mr. Bechard ''missed the big picture'' of Cochon 555.
 ''To grow you need to bring in ideas from the outside or you're just living in a closed community,'' he added.
 This year Cochon 555 is using heritage breeds, pigs raised with care by select small farms rather than by huge slaughterhouses. 
 Jason Barwikowski, the chef at Olympic Provisions, won the Portland contest by reducing the Iowa pig to ravioli, niblets and banh mi sandwiches. Mr. Bechard has plenty of critics. They say that he can be volatile and pretentious and that his stand for local pork made little sense. Mr. Bechard says the pig fight has created a teachable moment for how to live locally.
 He says he is trying harder than ever to do just that -- just no longer in Portland. A year ago he opened a restaurant called Thistle, 40 miles southwest, in the rich agricultural and winemaking region surrounding McMinnville.
 Mr. Bechard says his goal is to eventually run the restaurant solely with food from surrounding Yamhill County. Every local connection he makes and every local dollar he spends, he believes, strengthens his ties to the economic and political future of the place he lives. He says that kind of a commitment makes a place, any place, better.
 One of Thistle's suppliers, Manuel Recio, a former advertising executive who decided to become a vegetable farmer several years ago, said Mr. Bechard should not have gotten into a fistfight. Yet, he also told of Portland chefs who blend imported strawberries into desserts whose ingredients are misleadingly labeled as locally grown. He said Mr. Bechard had a point.
 ''It was great to finally have someone call people out on it,'' Mr. Recio said.

HEADLINE: Vietnamese Hoard U.S. Dollars as a Hedge Against Inflation

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD

 BODY:
HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam -- The Ha Tam jewelry shop here sells foreign currency the way a filling station sells gasoline. So it was only seconds after pulling in on his motorbike that Quan Phan had swapped a fistful of Vietnamese dong for a neat stack of $100 bills -- United States $100 bills, to be precise.
 ''Vietnamese people always want to have dollars,'' Mr. Phan, an engineer, explained before rejoining a rush-hour swarm of motorbike commuters. He said he routinely converted part of his salary into greenbacks.
 Developing countries -- and these days even developed ones like Greece and Spain -- constantly strive to retain the confidence of fickle foreign investors. Vietnam has a slightly different problem. Its government is struggling to restore faith among domestic investors like Mr. Phan. 
 What Vietnamese fear is not that their government has developed an Athenian affinity for deficits and debt. Hanoi's deficits are relatively modest, and it has not been in international financial markets long enough yet to rack up any serious i.o.u.'s. What makes them nervous is the suspicion that the governing Communist Party will do anything to hit its economic growth target before a party congress early next year, even if that means letting inflation get out of control.
 To hedge against that possibility, Vietnamese have been vacuuming up gold and United States currency. So many dollars have been scooped up, in fact, that the country's central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam, is at risk of running out, analysts warn. Any shock, like a double-dip global recession that hurts exports or foreign investment, and Vietnam could find itself without enough dollars to pay for crucial imports like fuel, they say.
 ''The question mark at this point is whether the dollars will come in,'' said Ngiam Ai Ling, director of Asian sovereign ratings at Fitch Ratings in Singapore, which warned in March that it might cut Vietnam's rating, already below what the agency deems investment grade.
 Since 1986, when Vietnam adopted its ''doi moi'' program of economic liberalization -- commonly translated as ''renovation'' -- it has been taking grudging steps toward rejoining the global economy. President Bill Clinton lifted the United States trade embargo in 1994, and the government in Hanoi signed a landmark trade pact with the United States in 2000, allowing it to export to America. In 2007, Vietnam was admitted to the World Trade Organization.
 Those efforts have yielded results. In 2008, Vietnam sidestepped the global recession, growing 5.3 percent and pulling its gross domestic product per capita above $1,000 while keeping incomes more evenly distributed than in the United States. 
 But the balance-of-payments predicament is only the latest of several hard knocks the country has endured as a traveler on the bumpy free-market road, and policy makers learning to use capitalist tools to navigate often find themselves reaching instead for more familiar Communist ones.
 ''They're moving away from a system of controls and directives toward a system based on market-based instruments,'' said Benedict Bingham, the International Monetary Fund's resident representative in Hanoi. But the landscape is shifting as they do. ''The economy has shifted toward more faster-moving, private sector behavior. That has made macroeconomic management more complicated.''
 Analysts and executives say Vietnam needs to do more to remove the state's unsteady hand, primarily by privatizing state-owned industries to stimulate more efficient improvements in infrastructure. 
 ''The country doesn't even have enough electricity,'' said Adam Sitkoff, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hanoi. ''It doesn't have adequate infrastructure in any category.'' Inflation, meanwhile, has been the all too common side effect of Vietnam's emergence. A recurring feature of the Vietnam War, hyperinflation returned in the late 1980s and early 1990s with an investment boom that followed doi moi. Now any new sign of it sends the public scurrying for more dollars, creating a vicious cycle that pushes the dong down and pushes prices even higher.
 In the last two years, the Vietnamese currency has fallen 15 percent amid such concerns. The local version of the television game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' offers a top prize of 120 million dong -- a potential windfall equivalent to only $6,300. The result is what economists refer to as the dollarization of Vietnam's economy. Things as varied as hotel rooms and cameras are priced in dollars.
 Where do all those greenbacks go? Many go into low-yielding dollar deposits at banks. But another portion -- no one knows how many dollars circulate in Vietnam -- gets stashed at home.
 Safes are a popular household item in Vietnam. A recurring crisis for the Vietnamese, therefore, occurs every time the United States Treasury changes the security features on large American bills, and money-changers reject older varieties.
 High savings are a feature of Asian economies, one that economists say helps to perpetuate global trade imbalances and may have been a factor in the global crisis. Like other economies in the region, Vietnam is also a big exporter, the world's second-largest exporter of rice and coffee. And like many of its neighbors, it fixes the official exchange rate of its currency against the dollar.
 But Vietnam is still at such a comparatively low level of development that it has to import many of the manufactured goods it needs to keep growing. And while it exports oil, it has to import refined products for fuel. As a result, the country runs a net trade deficit.
 So while other Asian nations accumulate dollars to keep their currencies from rising, Vietnam has been shedding dollars to keep the dong from falling and thereby worsening inflation, even though letting the dong depreciate freely would make its exports even cheaper.
 Vietnam was one of the few economies to avoid the global recession, but by the end of last year it was clear that Asia as a whole was recovering quickly and that Vietnam was back to the races. With inflation resurging, the government faced new downward pressure on the dong.
 In November, the central bank raised interest rates to quell inflation. And, unable to pull the dong's street value back up to the official exchange rate, it lowered the official rate so it could stop selling dollars at what amounted to a discounted rate. In February, it lowered the official rate again.
 The dong has stabilized somewhat now, and credit growth has cooled. But Vietnamese investors and analysts remain skeptical that the situation has entirely stabilized, largely because efforts to control inflation are accompanied by statements from Hanoi supporting faster economic growth.
 Early next year, the Communist Party is scheduled to hold its 11th National Congress, a major period of political jockeying, analysts say. For government officials, they say, achieving growth targets is an important test. Last month, Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung predicted that G.D.P. would not only reach the government's target but exceed it.
 Yet the central bank's efforts sometimes seem to be at cross purposes. While it has imposed a 1 percent ceiling on dollar savings accounts to discourage demand for the currency among its citizens, it is also trying to buy dollars to buttress its own reserves, said Ms. Ling at Fitch.
 ''Fundamentally, our concern is that Vietnam is a command economy,'' she said. While the central bank has not released current figures for reserves, Fitch estimates that they have fallen to less than two months' worth of imports. Economists normally recommend at least three.
 ''That's a weak number to play with,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Pity The Poor C.E.O.'s

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Job creation has been disappointing, but first-quarter corporate profits were up 44 percent from a year earlier. Consumers are nervous, but the Dow, which was below 8,000 on the day President Obama was inaugurated, is now over 10,000. In a rational universe, American business would be very happy with Mr. Obama.
 But no. All the buzz lately is that the Obama administration is ''antibusiness.'' And there are widespread claims that fears about taxes, regulation and budget deficits are holding down business spending and blocking economic recovery. 
 How much truth is there to these claims? None. Business spending is indeed low, but no lower than one would have expected given widespread overcapacity and weak consumer spending. Business leaders are feeling unloved, but giving them a group hug won't cure what ails the economy.
 Ask the Obama-is-scaring-business crowd for some actual evidence supporting their claim, and they'll tell you that business spending on plant and equipment is at its lowest level, as a share of G.D.P., in 40 years. What they don't mention is the fact that business investment always falls sharply when the economy is depressed. After all, why should businesses expand their production capacity when they're not selling enough to use the capacity they already have? And in case you haven't noticed, we still have a deeply depressed economy.
 Historically, there has been a close relationship between the level of business investment and the ''output gap,'' the difference between the economy's actual output and its long-run trend -- which means that there's nothing surprising about low investment now, given the fact that the output gap is hugely negative. If anything, it's surprising how well business investment has been holding up.
 Alternatively, we can look directly at measures of unused business capacity. Capacity utilization in industry is up over the past year, but still far below historical norms. Vacancy rates at industrial and retail properties are at historic highs. Again, given that businesses have plenty of idle structures and machines, why should they be building or buying even more?
 So where's the evidence that an antibusiness climate is depressing spending? The answer, supposedly, is that this is what you hear when you talk to entrepreneurs. But don't believe it. Yes, when you talk to business people they complain about taxes, regulations and the deficit; they always do. But the Obama's-socialist-policies-are-wrecking-the-economy chorus isn't coming from businesses; it's coming from business lobbyists, which isn't at all the same thing. Read the report on the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in the latest Washington Monthly: peddling scare stories about what Democrats are up to is a large part of what organizations like the chamber do for a living.
 Or read through the latest survey of small business trends by the National Federation for Independent Business, an advocacy group. The commentary at the front of the report is largely a diatribe against government -- ''Washington is applying leeches and performing blood-letting as a cure'' -- and you might naively imagine that this diatribe reflects what the surveyed businesses said. But while a few businesses declared that the political climate was deterring expansion, they were vastly outnumbered by those citing a poor economy.
 The charts at the back of the report, showing trends in business perceptions of their ''most important problem,'' are even more revealing. It turns out that business is less concerned about taxes and regulation than during the 1990s, an era of booming investment. Concerns about poor sales, on the other hand, have surged. The weak economy, not fear about government actions, is what's holding investment down.
 So why are we hearing so much about the alleged harm being inflicted by an antibusiness climate? For the most part it's the same old, same old: lobbyists trying to bully Washington into cutting taxes and dismantling regulations, while extracting bigger fees from their clients along the way.
 Beyond that, business leaders are, as I said, feeling unloved: the financial crisis, health insurance scandals, and the catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico have taken a toll on their reputation. Somehow, however, rather than blaming their peers for bad behavior, C.E.O.'s blame Mr. Obama for ''demonizing'' business -- by which they apparently mean speaking frankly about the culpability of the guilty parties.
 Well, C.E.O.'s are people, too -- but soothing their hurt feelings isn't a priority right now, and it has nothing at all to do with promoting economic recovery. If we want stronger business spending, we need to give businesses a reason to spend. And to do that, the government needs to start doing more, not less, to promote overall economic recovery.

HEADLINE: Smartphone Patent Suits Challenge Big Makers

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
NTP, a patent-holding company best known for prying a settlement of more than $600 million from the maker of the BlackBerry, is now suing the other big names in the smartphone industry: Apple, Google, Microsoft, HTC, LG and Motorola.
 The suits, filed late Thursday afternoon in federal district court in Richmond, Va., charge that the cellphone e-mail systems of those companies are illegally using NTP's patented technology. 
 The round of litigation against leaders in the smartphone hardware and software market is the latest step by NTP to assert that its intellectual property is the foundation of modern wireless e-mail systems and that major corporations are infringing with impunity. Its critics have said that NTP has consistently inflated the importance of its innovations and that it is the very model of a patent troll, a company that produces no product or service other than licensing demands and lawsuits.
 NTP and Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, fought in the courts for years, with NTP fending off most legal challenges. Indeed, R.I.M. settled with NTP in 2006, a few months after the Supreme Court refused to hear the Canadian company's appeal. The $612.5 million pact included a perpetual license for R.I.M. to NTP's technology.
 The potential payday for NTP in the current litigation is uncertain. It could be as much as several hundred million dollars, legal experts say. But it could be far less because technology and product designs change quickly and recent smartphone e-mail systems may well have been designed with an eye toward avoiding NTP's patents.
 The companies named as defendants in the suits declined to comment.
 But whatever the outcome in the latest suits, NTP has already altered the patent economy, legal experts say. Big technology companies, they say, no longer ignore sizable patent clusters in their field, but go looking for them. R.I.M., by contrast, first learned of the NTP infringement claim in a letter in 2000, when the Virginia company tried to persuade R.I.M. to license its technology.
 NTP was founded in 1992 by an engineer and inventor, Thomas J. Campana Jr., and Donald E. Stout, a lawyer. Its initial patents grew out of work that Mr. Campana, who died in 2004, had done in 1990 for AT&T for relaying messages from a computer to a wireless device -- a pager or a cellphone. His collection of patented technology covers wireless e-mail and the design of radio antennas used on mobile devices.
 He never did commercialize his technology. But the NTP claim is that despite all the work done by others in the field, Mr. Campana was indeed the creator of wireless e-mail. And NTP, a private company owned by about 30 investors, is wielding those patents in its new lawsuits.
 ''Every infringer is now on notice,'' said Ron Epstein, counsel to NTP. ''They are going to have to deal with this instead of trying to wait it out.''
 The NTP patents expire in 2012.
 In recent years, big companies have increasingly turned to patent-buying groups like Intellectual Ventures, RPX and Allied Security Trust, a nonprofit organization. These groups essentially provide big companies with insurance against lawsuits on the patents they hold or license, in return for fees or investments.
 The R.I.M. case, said Robert P. Merges, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, proved to be ''a major milestone in the evolution of the patent ecosystem,'' spurring the adoption of tactics to reduce the risk of huge payouts.
 The United States Patent and Trademark Office also conducted a lengthy re-examination of NTP's patents. That process winnowed the company's portfolio of legally valid patents.
 But last December, the patent office's board of appeals ruled that 67 of NTP's patent claims in four patents were valid, including three claims that R.I.M. was found to have infringed. NTP filed a petition with a federal appeals court to overturn other patent claims that the patent office rejected.
 A previous group of suits, filed by NTP in 2007 against several telecommunications carriers, was stayed pending the outcome of the patent review. The companies sued in the carrier suits included AT&T, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and Verizon Wireless. Those cases have not yet been settled or come to trial.
 A few companies other than R.I.M. have licensed NTP's mobile e-mail patents, including Nokia and Good Technology.

HEADLINE: Some Advocates Question Cuomo's Support of Gay Rights

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
As a landmark gay marriage bill hurtled toward an uncertain vote last year, New York's Democratic leaders scrambled to corral support. Gov. David A. Paterson delivered impassioned speeches, Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand headlined a giant rally and City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn shuttled back and forth to Albany to lobby lawmakers.
 But the state's most popular Democrat, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, was all but invisible.
 He was asked by those pushing for the measure to call three wavering senators. He never spoke with two of them, their aides said, and did not reach another until after the senator had voted -- against the bill. 
 ''He left a message,'' said a spokesman for Senator Joseph P. Addabbo Jr., a Democrat from Queens, who finally spoke with Mr. Cuomo after the vote.
 In the end, none of the three senators supported the bill. 
 Mr. Cuomo, 52, appears poised to succeed the most pro-gay rights governor the state has ever had, at a pivotal moment in the debate over same-sex marriage, and with gay men and lesbians exercising increasing influence within the state Democratic Party. 
 But a review of his record in and out of government, and interviews with dozens of those who have worked with him, reveal a fraught relationship between Mr. Cuomo and gays and lesbians dating to the 1970s, when he entered New York politics.
 Over a 30-year career in public life, Mr. Cuomo has been slow to take on gay-rights battles or display leadership on key issues, advocates for gay rights say. His handling of same-sex marriage, they say, is telling: He did not publicly support it until he ran for attorney general in 2006 -- eight years after Eliot Spitzer said he favored it and 12 years after Mr. Paterson did so.
 As a result, many gay leaders are quietly expressing skepticism about the depth of his commitment, even as they accept, with lockstep resignation, his likely ascent as governor, and try to ingratiate themselves with his political operation. 
 ''He plays catch-up on our issues,'' said Libby Post, who founded Empire State Pride Agenda, the influential gay-rights group that pushed for the same-sex marriage legislation last year. ''I don't think his heart is really there. He does not have a record you can look to.''
 Of course, Mr. Cuomo's approach to gay issues may reflect some simple political realities: Gay groups are unlikely to abandon him for his Republican rival, Rick A. Lazio, who opposes same-sex marriage. And taking a more restrained position on gay issues may help Mr. Cuomo as he seeks to attract independents and voters upstate, where polling shows there is more opposition to allowing gay men and lesbians to wed.
 Still, his uneasy history with gay leaders reflects some of the baggage that Mr. Cuomo carries from decades of political battle, even as he seeks to re-introduce himself to the electorate. 
 Those close to Mr. Cuomo described his support for gay rights as longstanding and genuine, even as they acknowledged that he had kept a low profile on the subject. 
 In his understated way, aides and friends said, he has advanced gay causes by appointing gay men and lesbians to key positions and, as attorney general, cracking down on two companies accused of discriminating on the basis of sexuality. He has frequently sought the counsel of gay elected officials like Ms. Quinn. And he has made clear, since announcing his candidacy for governor in May, that he supports same-sex marriage.
 ''Andrew has grown over the years to see the validity of our struggle, and is prepared to be a strong ally,'' said Virginia M. Apuzzo, a gay adviser to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, Andrew's father, in the 1980s. The attorney general declined to comment for this article, or to discuss specific incidents from his past, but allowed a few advisers and friends to speak about him. 
 In interviews, these people pointed to Mr. Cuomo's personal relationships with gay people as a measure of his understanding of their struggles. 
 Charles Myers, an investment banker in the city, who struck up a friendship with him a decade ago, recalled Mr. Cuomo's enthusiasm -- and calls of congratulations -- when he learned that Mr. Myers and his partner planned to start a family by adopting children. As Mr. Myers's family grew to include four children, Mr. Cuomo conveyed his frustration with the legal obstacles that Mr. Myers and his partner faced. ''For him, it's deeply upsetting that friends of his don't have the same rights as he does,'' Mr. Myers said.
 Whether his record on gay issues will play a significant role in the coming election is unclear. With voters frustrated about the economy and angry at Albany, the gubernatorial hopefuls are likely to be judged largely on their competence and crisis management.
 Part of the complexity of Mr. Cuomo's relationship with gay men and lesbians stems from his unusual entry into politics.
 Unlike the early political experiences of most candidates for office, Mr. Cuomo's unfolded in public, starting when he was a teenager. He joined his first campaign at age 19, when his father ran for mayor against Edward I. Koch in the 1977 Democratic primary. 
 It was a campaign that heavily shaped the younger Mr. Cuomo's reputation among gay advocates: a bitter, intensely personal race pitting an Italian Catholic from Queens (Mr. Cuomo) against a Greenwich Village Jew (Mr. Koch). Commercials for Mario Cuomo emphasized that he was ''a family man,'' in contrast to the unmarried Mr. Koch.
 As the race entered its final weeks, supporters of the senior Mr. Cuomo plastered predominantly Italian sections of Brooklyn and Queens with posters that declared, ''Vote for Cuomo, not the Homo.'' 
 Both Cuomos denied being involved in or aware of the posters' creation -- claims that gay advocates, and Mr. Koch himself, found difficult to believe.
 Mr. Koch said he had accepted an apology from the younger Mr. Cuomo for the tone of that race. But asked recently in an interview if he believed that Andrew Cuomo had nothing to do with the homophobic posters, Mr. Koch said: ''I honestly don't know. I'd like to believe it. But I don't know.''
 During his father's run for governor in 1982, Andrew Cuomo served as campaign manager and participated in tense negotiations with gay advocates, whose support his father was quietly courting. 
 In return for their endorsement, several gay leaders insisted on publishing a newspaper advertisement trumpeting the commitments that they had extracted from the Cuomo campaign, including his agreement to issue an executive order prohibiting discrimination against gay employees in state government. 
 Even as the elder Mr. Cuomo said he would issue the order, his son worried that publicizing the deal would alienate more conservative religious voters, those involved in the campaign said.
 ''We had great difficulty getting the Cuomo campaign to agree on the wording of an ad,'' recalled Andrew Humm, a longtime gay-rights advocate. They were told, Mr. Humm said, that ''Andrew was the problem.''
 When the senior Mr. Cuomo signed the executive order in 1983 -- a major milestone for the gay community -- Andrew Cuomo seemed intent on playing it down to blunt any backlash.
 Allen Roskoff, a gay state employee who pushed for the measure, recalled a telephone conversation at the time with the younger Mr. Cuomo, who asked for his reaction to the executive order. Mr. Roskoff, who did not think the measure went far enough, told him, ''It's terrible -- it's not worth the paper it was written on.''
 ''Good,'' Mr. Roskoff recalled Mr. Cuomo's saying. ''I'm going to have the Jewish press call you. Say the same thing to them.'' 
 Ms. Apuzzo described Andrew Cuomo as ''protective of his father and what it would mean for him to be in dialogue with us.'' 
 ''Andrew never stood in the way,'' she recalled. ''But to be honest, I never felt that he was the best advocate on the issue, at the time.'' 
 The uneasy relationship did not improve in 1984, when Andrew Cuomo oversaw Walter F. Mondale's presidential campaign in New York State. Gay voters had rallied around Mr. Mondale, who had signaled his support for allowing gays to serve in the military. Then the Mondale campaign unexpectedly wavered on the issue, infuriating several New York delegates, who threatened to withdraw their support. 
 Kenneth Sherrill, a Mondale delegate at the time, and now a professor of political science at Hunter College, recalled that Mr. Cuomo viewed those upset by the issue as a nuisance. 
 His message, Mr. Sherrill said, was, '' 'Why the hell are you bothering me with this?' It was dismissive.'' He added: ''The most charitable thing you can say is that Andrew viewed it as being a hot-button issue that ought not be engaged for fear of electoral consequence.''
 It appears Mr. Cuomo's most sustained contact with the gay community occurred when he served at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which had taken a role in providing housing for those dealing with AIDS. During the period he was secretary, from 1997 to 2001, the agency more than doubled housing money for people with the disease, to $258 million from $110 million.
 At the same time, his staff encouraged gay organizations, which had rarely received federal housing money, to apply for grants to open community centers. One such center, in Greenwich Village, received $75,000 in grants from HUD while Mr. Cuomo was secretary. Julian Potter, a deputy who worked under Mr. Cuomo, called the outreach to gay groups ''real and significant.'' 
 Mr. Cuomo's profile as attorney general has largely been shaped by his efforts in a few areas: his pursuit of corporate crime, the student loan industry and online sex offenders. He is lesser known for his work on civil rights. 
 In the last two years, however, lawyers on his staff took action against an adoption agency that refused to work with same-sex couples and a major retail chain that showed a pattern of discrimination against transgender job applicants. (The adoption agency stopped operating in New York; the retail chain agreed to a series of reforms.) And after Governor Paterson required state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages performed out of state, the attorney general's office successfully defended New York against several lawsuits.
 Gay advocates praised the office's handling of the cases, but greeted them with caution: the attorney general's office is required to defend the state when it is sued. The real question, they said, is how aggressively Mr. Cuomo will defend their right to marry if, as most of them predict, he becomes governor next year.
 ''People change over 30 years,'' said Mr. Roskoff, the president of a gay Democratic political club that has backed Mr. Cuomo for governor. ''We anticipate he will follow through with his promises.''
 Mr. Cuomo's aides defended his efforts on behalf of the marriage bill last year, and explained that they were reluctant to involve themselves in a campaign that was largely led by Mr. Paterson, at the time a potential rival in the governor's race. 
 Mr. Cuomo seems acutely aware of the apprehension some gay leaders are feeling. A few weeks ago, he spoke at a $500-a-person fund-raiser for his campaign held by prominent gay supporters, including Mr. Myers. As the crowd of financial executives and political operatives sipped wine at the St. Regis Hotel, Mr. Cuomo assured them that passing a gay-marriage bill ''is a priority for me.''
 Unsatisfied, a few guests pressed him for details. Exactly how, one of them asked, would he do it? 
 But he offered scant detail: ''I will get it done,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Election to Replace Byrd Gets Official's Approval

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- West Virginia's attorney general has determined that Gov. Joe Manchin III can call a special election this year to fill the vacancy created by the death of Senator Robert C. Byrd, clearing the way for a contest in November to fill the remaining two years of Mr. Byrd's term. 
 Mr. Manchin, who has said he prefers a special election rather than appointing someone to serve through 2012, said he would ''speak with the state's legislative leadership immediately to determine how we will further proceed in order to reach a conclusion to this matter.'' Mr. Manchin is a Democrat, as was Mr. Byrd.
 The governor has expressed interest in running himself. He sought the legal guidance from Attorney General Darrell V. McGraw Jr. after the West Virginia secretary of state initially determined that no special election could be held this year since the state had already conducted its 2010 primaries. That would mean that someone appointed by Mr. Manchin would hold the office for longer than two years, a period the governor and other state officials say is too long without a vote.
 In the interim, the governor is expected to appoint someone to fill the seat until November. Senate Democrats would like that decision to come soon because they are eager to return the party's majority in the Senate to its 59-seat level as they try to resolve several partisan impasses regarding an overhaul of financial regulations and unemployment benefits among other issues. 
 In his ruling, the attorney general also said the governor had the authority to determine the circumstances of the special election, including setting filing deadlines for candidates. 
 The opinion said the governor should try to maximize participation by potential candidates and the public.

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO; Obama on the Tightrope

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Standing on a sparkling clean factory floor, with a fleet of battery-powered trucks behind him, President Obama on Thursday confronted a challenge: how to reconcile the grim reality of 9.5 percent unemployment with the necessity of defending his economic policies in a midterm election year.
 He resolved it by blaming Republicans -- and crediting himself. The nation is climbing out of a ''vicious recession,'' Mr. Obama said, the result of ''a decade of irresponsibility.'' He ended on an upbeat note, predicting, ''We're going to emerge stronger than we were before.'' 
 That imagery -- a bleak past under former President George W. Bush, a rosy future that has yet to materialize -- is the theme Mr. Obama will rely on as he seeks to preserve Democratic seats in a tough political climate. White House officials say the president will present voters a stark choice, one he laid out later Thursday at a fund-raiser for Robin Carnahan, the Democratic candidate for the Senate in Missouri.
 ''It's a choice,'' he said, ''between the policies that got us in this mess in the first place and the policies that are getting us out of this mess.''
 But making the case that his policies are ''getting us out of this mess'' may be easier said than done, especially in an economy that isn't cooperating. Several economic indicators, most importantly tepid job growth, point to a far weaker recovery than Mr. Obama had hoped for, and some economists say the picture may worsen.
 ''He's correct that a recovery has begun,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, who has advised Democrats. ''But the unfortunate thing is that the recovery is losing momentum, the rate of growth is slowing. From a raw political perspective, the hope for incumbents was that even though the economy was still tough, that all the trend lines would be moving in the right direction. At this point, that looks less likely.''
 So Mr. Obama is walking a fine line, making the case to voters that if they just stick with him, things will improve, even as he tries to ensure that political ownership of the downturn rests primarily with a predecessor who left office nearly 18 months ago.
 ''It's our responsibility now,'' said David Axelrod, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, ''but let's be clear about how we got into the mess we're in. Cleaning up the mess is our responsibility. Creating it was theirs.''
 Thursday's trip to Missouri was part of a two-day swing that will also take the president to Las Vegas, where he will again talk about the economy and campaign for Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic leader, who like Ms. Carnahan is facing a tough race. 
 At the fund-raiser for Ms. Carnahan, the president invoked what is turning out to be one of his favorite election-season analogies, likening Republicans to teenagers' learning to drive a car.
 ''Now, if your teenager drives into a ditch -- your car -- bangs it up. Got to pay a lot of money to get it out. What do you do?'' Mr. Obama asked at the fund-raiser, drawing chortles from the crowd. ''You take the keys away. 
 ''These folks drove the economy into a ditch, and they want the keys back. And you've got to say the same thing to them that you say to your teenager: You can't take the keys back, because you don't know how to drive yet.''
 Still, the White House knows the president must do more than just blame Republicans, who with support from Tea Party activists are forcefully making the case that the administration has done little more than squander taxpayer money and create a more bloated and intrusive government.
 If Mr. Obama wants to retain his party's majorities in Congress, he must persuade voters that his policies -- in particular the $787 billion economic recovery act he signed into law shortly after taking office -- are having a positive effect. 
 That is one reason Mr. Obama spent Thursday morning touring Smith Electric Vehicles, a maker of battery-powered trucks. The company received a $32 million grant under the recovery act, and is using the money to sell its vehicles at a steep discount to some of the country's best-known companies, like AT&T, Coca-Cola and Frito-Lay, with the hope of generating long-term business. 
 Standing on the factory floor, with the trucks arrayed around him, Mr. Obama declared that he expected energy investments to generate 700,000 jobs over the next few years.
 Mr. Axelrod said voters could expect to see more such visits as the election nears. ''He was standing in an exhibit of what a positive vision can do in terms of creating jobs,'' Mr. Axelrod said, ''and we're going to continue to highlight the way forward.''
 Whether the message is getting through to a deeply skeptical public remains an open question. The public is ''hypersensitive'' to news about the economy, said Andrew Kohut, the president of the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan group in Washington that tracks public opinion. 
 In a Pew survey last month, 33 percent of respondents said the recovery act had improved the nation's job situation. But nearly twice that many -- 60 percent -- said it had not. 
 ''So far he's gotten nowhere convincing people that his big programs have worked,'' Mr. Kohut said. ''You get only a third of the public, and it's mostly Democrats, who think the stimulus has done something. It's kind of a show-me mood.''

HEADLINE: Court Rejects Moratorium on Drilling in the Gulf

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; David Winkler-Schmit contributed reporting from New Orleans.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court on Thursday turned down the Obama administration's effort to enforce a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.
 A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled shortly after a hearing in a lawsuit filed by companies that claim they are being financially crippled by the suspension of drilling.
 The Interior Department said the moratorium was necessary because of the uncertainties about the cause of the BPoil well blowout in April, a shortage of response equipment and a need to write strict new drilling rules. The moratorium was struck down by a lower court on June 22 by a federal judge who found it arbitrary and economically ruinous to industry. 
 The appeals court found that the Interior Department failed to show the federal government would suffer ''irreparable injury'' if the moratorium is lifted while it appeals the trial court's decision.
 A senior administration official said earlier Thursday that the Interior Department would immediately issue a new moratorium if it lost the court case. Those new regulations, revising the earlier suspension, could come as early as Friday. 
 In the afternoon hearing, industry lawyers urged the court to uphold the lower court ruling striking down the moratorium. ''People are being put out of jobs,'' said Carl D. Rosenblum, a lawyer representing Hornbeck Offshore Services, a Louisiana firm that provides goods and services to offshore drilling and pumping platforms. ''Rigs are leaving the gulf, and going to foreign waters.''
 Government lawyers responded that the suspension of drilling was justified. Michael T. Gray, a Justice Department lawyer representing the administration, said Congress gave the Interior Department the authority to take such actions to protect the environment and worker safety. 
 Hornbeck and a dozen other oil industry companies brought the suit last month, claiming their livelihoods were threatened by the federal drilling ban. They were supported by Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and other local officials around the Gulf Coast.
 Mr. Jindal said outside the courtroom on Thursday that the oil spill had already ruined Louisiana's seafood industry and dampened tourism throughout the region. The drilling ban, he said, is costing thousands of Louisianans their jobs.
 Judge Martin L. C. Feldman of United States District Court in New Orleans agreed with the oil industry in a ruling handed down on June 22, saying that the federal moratorium was overly broad. He said the suspension of drilling was punitive to companies with good safety records and not supported by fact or history.
 The administration's order halted 33 exploratory drilling projects and suspended new permits, but did not affect more than 3,000 platforms already in production.
 Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy group, reported on Thursday that two of the judges on the appeals court panel, Jerry E. Smith and W. Eugene Davis, both appointed by President Ronald Reagan, had represented the oil and gas industries while in private practice. Judge Smith's clients included Exxon Mobil, ConocoPhillips and Sunoco. Judge Davis represented a number of companies involved in offshore drilling and other oil field operations.
 Judge Davis's 2008 financial disclosure reports listed $2,000 to $30,000 in investments in gas and oil concerns; Judge Smith had none.
 The third judge on the panel, James L. Dennis, appointed by President Bill Clinton, had investments in at least 18 energy companies valued at between $31,000 and $300,000, the group found. Judge Dennis sold a stake in Transocean, the company that was drilling the well under contract to BP, in 2006, according to financial disclosure reports compiled by the group.

HEADLINE: Despite a Rare Pedigree, Plan for Affordable Housing Collapses

BYLINE: By ZUSHA ELINSON. 
zelinson@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
The deal was brokered recently in private by an unusual team of rivals, including one of San Francisco's most prominent developers and a vociferous housing activist. The result, by all accounts, was unprecedented: an estimated $50 million for affordable housing in the city each year.
 One developer who participated in the negotiations, which took place over the last six weeks in a City Hall annex, described the agreement as a ''once-every-50-years alignment of the planets.''
Last week, however, the ambitious deal -- which would have provided financing for affordable-housing projects, and would also have helped developers by subsidizing an affordable-housing requirement -- came apart after running into opposition from an unlikely source: Mayor Gavin Newsom, the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor.
 The scuttled initiative, which has not been publicized, left a trail of bitterness and recrimination, much of it directed at Mr. Newsom, whose own aides had helped broker the deal. Three participants who were involved in the discussions said they understood that Mr. Newsom was reluctant to support what amounted to a new tax as he makes a run for statewide office. 
 ''We came up with a plan that addressed a critical need,'' said Calvin Welch, the housing advocate who helped broker the deal. ''But the only thing that's critical to Gavin Newsom is becoming lieutenant governor.'' 
 Mr. Newsom, in an interview earlier this week, denied that politics played a role in his decision. The mayor said that he had tentatively supported the initiative, which would have been put before voters in November, as a ''serious shift in the way we deal with affordable housing'' but that proponents had failed to generate the kind of broad support necessary to gain approval.
 ''I'm just a convenient excuse right now,'' Mr. Newsom said.
 The crumbling of the innovative housing initiative underscores a tumultuous relationship between Mr. Newsom and the Board of Supervisors over several new tax measures its members have proposed -- as Mr. Newsom campaigns for a statewide office, according to people who participated in meetings about the deal. 
 The talks, which were spurred by the recession's crippling effect on new housing, began in May, several months after Mr. Newsom proposed a stimulus package to get development projects restarted.
 Mr. Welch, the housing advocate known for his caustic criticism of gentrification, came to the negotiations seeking a fixed stream of financing for affordable housing, which has largely dried up during the recession. 
 One of city's largest nonprofit developers, the Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation, has suspended four big projects for low-income families because of a lack of financing.
 Oz Erickson, the chief executive of the Emerald Fund, one of the largest developers in San Francisco, came to the negotiations seeking a break from the city's requirement that developers designate at least 15 percent of all new units to below-market-rate housing. 
 Mr. Erickson argued that the cost of ''inclusionary zoning'' -- a policy he and Mr. Welch had hammered out in the 1990s, the last time they worked together on legislation -- was too burdensome for builders in a recession.
 ''Right now, it's terribly difficult to get any financing, and the affordable-housing component is a significant charge,'' said Mr. Erickson, whose condominium projects include One Rincon Hill and the Bridgeview Tower.
 During the meetings, according to several participants, Mr. Welch thundered about the urgent need for affordable housing, according to participants. As he held forth, Mr. Erickson continually worked his fingers over his ubiquitous HP 12c calculator, crunching the numbers. 
 Gabriel Metcalf, executive director of the San Francisco Urban Planning and Research Association, a moderate public policy institute, said negotiators reached ''an agreement that would've solved both problems.''
 The complicated deal would have substantially raised the transfer tax -- the tax paid when property is bought or sold -- for any building over $875,000. For example, the transfer tax on a home sold for $1.1 million is currently $8,250. With the proposed increase, it would have been $12,650. 
 That money would have gone into a permanent fund dedicated to affordable housing: Half would have been used for affordable-housing projects, and the other half would have gone to ease the burden on developers by subsidizing the affordable-housing requirement.
 The mayor said it was a political rarity for these two rival factions to work together.
 ''These are strange bedfellows, and they don't always agree,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''What was intriguing was that there was a willingness to work this through.'' 
 The negotiations took place in the Mayor's Office of Housing, two blocks from City Hall, and were mediated by Doug Shoemaker, the office's director.
 Mr. Newsom acknowledged that some of his top aides supported the deal. In the end, he said, he did not believe the measure had enough broad support to succeed. Notably, efforts to placate groups representing landlords and Realtors failed.
 ''Folks were so consumed with getting something on the ballot for November,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''But in order to do this we have to build a broad coalition, and, with respect to my friends in the room, they're not the whole city.''
 But Mr. Welch and others familiar with the negotiations said the politics of the moment also weighed heavily. Since announcing earlier this year his entry into the race for lieutenant governor, Mr. Newsom has continued to oppose raising taxes, most recently a series of measures put forward by progressive members of the Board of Supervisors.
 Mr. Newsom's electoral success in November -- and perhaps beyond -- will depend in part on his ability to broaden his appeal to voters outside San Francisco.
 ''The mayor's office sponsored the whole thing, and ultimately the mayor could have stepped up to make it happen,'' said Lou Vasquez, a developer with Build, Incorporated, who was in the talks. 
 ''The mechanics seemed to be working out,'' Mr. Vasquez said, ''but the politics seemed to get in the way.'' 
 Last week, with Mr. Newsom still withholding his support, the deadline to place the affordable-housing measure on the November ballot passed quietly -- with the public unaware of the potential deal.
 There is now one other proposal from the Board of Supervisors intended to raise money for affordable housing, but it does not have the support of the mayor, the developers or their friends. Sponsored by Supervisor Chris Daly, who has been trying for years to get a permanent source of affordable-housing money, the measure is headed for the ballot in November.
 Mr. Newsom said he hoped this idea for a permanent source of financing came back -- whether or not he was in office.
 ''We were up against a deadline, and it wasn't ready,'' Mr. Newsom said. ''This idea is not dead.'' 
 His hopes were echoed by Mr. Metcalf, Mr. Welch and others who had tried to make the deal. But they said it had been a rare moment when everything seemed aligned: a recession hurting housing activists and developers enough to bring them both to the bargaining table.
 ''I personally will work to try to put this deal together again,'' Mr. Metcalf said, ''but you never know when your window of opportunity for social change will open, and you never know when it will close.''

HEADLINE: The Best and the Brightest

BYLINE: By KEVIN WALSH and MATTEO PERICOLI. 
Kevin Walsh is the author of ''Forgotten New York: Views of a Lost Metropolis'' and the co-curator of '' Forgotten City Lights,'' a coming exhibition at the City Reliquary museum. Matteo Pericoli is an illustrator.

 BODY:
Until the 1950s a wide variety of lampposts stood along New York streets, from cast-iron Gilded Age masterpieces to humble Depression-era wood beams -- a 1934 city catalog listed 76 styles. But in the wave of postwar urban renewal, the city embarked on a wave of consolidation, trading its diversity for a monoculture based on stark octagonal aluminum poles anchored to the ground by plain boxes. Fortunately, a few of the old lampposts survived, and in recent years they've been joined by a small army of newly cast replicas. In addition, the Department of Transportation continues to commission new designs; recently, it introduced a sleek and shiny model in Downtown Brooklyn. As the city's lamppost culture comes back to life, it's worth taking a look at some of the iconic forms that illuminated New York's past.
 1. Fulton, Fulton Mall, Brooklyn 
 The latest lamppost is cylindrical and unusually tall, with a sharply curving post ending in a pair of high-intensity sodium vapor lamps which burn bright yellow. Unlike other luminaires, these are actually part of the post, so there shouldn't be the unsightly mixing and matching that defaced past designs. Their jet-age lines are reminiscent of the lampposts installed around Kennedy Airport in the early 1960s; these used a diagonal shaft planted at a 45-degree angle to the street.
 2. Type 1BC Bishops Crook, Canal and Lafayette Streets, Manhattan
 The Bishops Crook was one of the first modern lamppost designs, going up around 1900. The 1BC electrified posts, installed in the 1910s, paid subtle homage to the gas lamps that preceded them: they were designed with ladder rests, of the kind lamplighters would use on their morning and evening rounds. This charming ornamentation disappeared in later models. Only a handful remain, all in Lower Manhattan.
 3. Curved-Mast Post, South Street near the Downtown Manhattan Heliport
 Aluminum lampposts with octagonal shafts began replacing wrought-iron designs in 1950, but it was a gradual takeover -- in the early 1960s, the oldies were still lighting the streets in force. They fell rapidly afterward, though. The first generation of ''octa-poles'' had a curved mast with a bracket, like the one shown here. The design lasted only a few years; posts with a straight single mast soon took over -- though on wider streets, they sported two masts supported by a bracket.
 4. Type G Corvington, Extinct
 Beginning in the early 1910s, long-masted wrought-iron posts were placed on wider thoroughfares. There were many variations on this basic design: longer or shorter arms, different scrollwork, a range of luminaires, or light fixtures. In the 1980s, the Department of Transportation began lopping off the Corvington's pendant luminaires and attaching brighter sodium vapor lights, which may have made the streets safer but clashed with the rest of the post. In recent decades, replica Corvingtons have been sprouting along major avenues around town.
 5. Donald Deskey, Fifth Avenue and West 42nd Street, Manhattan
 While most lampposts were designed by anonymous engineers, this species came from Donald Deskey, who also designed the Crest toothpaste tube and the interiors of Radio City Music Hall. The first Deskeys were installed on Broadway and Murray Street in 1958, just off City Hall Park. It wasn't until the early 1960s, though, that production got cranking and they were installed by the thousands all over the five boroughs. Their dominance was short-lived -- production and installation stopped after 1980, and the city is letting them die out; when one fails, it's replaced by a different model, giving Fifth Avenue a catch-as-catch-can appearance.
 6. Woodie, Belt Parkway ramp to Laurelton Parkway, Queens
 When Robert Moses built parkways like the Grand Central and Belt, they were lighted by large and small versions of this wood post, with incandescent bulbs hanging from their arms. But when they started failing in the 1970s, the Department of Transportation replaced them with more conventional metal designs. By the 1990s wood posts had become very rare indeed, and on the Belt Parkway today, one -- and only one -- remains.

HEADLINE: A Chicago Company Puts Its Stamp on Man U

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN

 BODY:
James Warren is a columnist for the Chicago News Cooperative.
 The visitors might be mobbed in Buenos Aires, Moscow, New Delhi, Nairobi and Beijing. But the world-famous players may go largely unnoticed in Chicago next week, which by no means belies a local firm's shrewd move to form a distinctly global alliance.
The guests are players for Manchester United, perhaps the planet's most famous sports team. Consider the potency of the New York Yankees and the celebrity of individual stars like Derek Jeter. Multiply that dozens of times, and you've got Man U, a quasi-United Nations of all-stars led by a legendary coach, Scotsman Sir Alex Ferguson. 
 By some estimates, the team has more than 300 million fans worldwide. There are 1.1 billion homes in 227 nations with access to its games; a core of 88 million who watch them weekly during their long season; a Web site with 60 million views a month, with 70 percent from outside Britain; and jersey sales exceeding 6 million a year, with 2.2 million licensed and the rest bootlegged.
 They will arrive here on the heels of the World Cup finale Sunday in South Africa, in support of Aon, a 36,000-employee, Chicago-based company that operates in 120 countries. Most Chicagoans don't really know what Aon does -- it's a risk manager, the No. 1 insurance and reinsurance broker in the world -- even if they know the name adorns a famous, white-granite-clad skyscraper. (A big competitor is Willis Re, whose name now adorns an even taller building we all know.)
 ''Aon'' will be emblazoned across the Manchester United jersey for the next four years in what has been reported -- neither side will confirm -- to be a roughly $125 million deal. As Phil Clement, Aon's global chief marketing officer, said on Thursday, ''This is a significant event in bringing our brand together and putting Aon on a global stage.''
 Aon is candid about how it has not yet ''pierced into one of the most recognized brands,'' as Mr. Clement put it, even if it is top dog in its industry and a player in the civic and political life of Chicago. ''That's what we're trying to do,'' he said.
 The company had spent several years trying to come up with a sponsorship vehicle to put it on a global stage in a cost-effective way. It came up dry.
 Then American International Group, ensnarled by a liquidity crisis, federal bailout and disputed bonus payments to executives, did not renew its sponsorship deal with Manchester United. Yes, in the middle of A.I.G.'s public relations disaster, Man U was wearing its logo.
 The team was already plotting a better jersey deal, studying companies with a desire to expand in emerging markets, notably in China and India. It singled out such firms and sent their chief executives a fancy package with a formal pitch brochure -- and a mock Man U jersey with the company's logo.
 Nobody knew who else had been solicited. But Aon knew that its marketing and branding needed more cohesion. Sponsoring bullfighting, auto racing, dog sledding and dragon-boat races was nice but didn't do the trick. A soccer deal could help unify an amalgam of hundreds of smaller companies assembled by Patrick G. Ryan, Aon's founder and retired executive chairman.
 Aon did its homework. It could pool much of its existing sponsorship money and double the impact of all its existing marketing efforts via a Man U deal, according to an internal assessment shared with executives. Beyond marketing efficiency, it said, Man U would assist recognition in ''our greatest growth markets like China, Korea, India, the Middle East and Latin America.''
 The assessment conceded that ''in these high-growth emerging markets the Aon brand is not yet established.'' Further, ''we are not yet to our marketplace what Goldman Sachs is to investment advisory services, Accenture is to technology services and outsourcing, and McKinsey is to consulting.''
 But a critique of the impact on sales, return on investment and the increase in A.I.G.'s own business and recognition as a result of a Man U link led to an against-the-grain decision to invest big in a recession.
 So even if you don't recognize Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, Nemanja Vidic, Edwin van der Sar or Ji-sung Park ambling about town at the start of a United States tour -- they'll practice at cozy Toyota Park in Bridgeview -- rest assured that they now have a primal Chicago connection.

HEADLINE: Toasts, Trout and Handshake Deals

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
SUN VALLEY, Idaho -- Gulfstreams and Falcons. Buffett and Brin. Angling for trout and ice skating to ''Bad Romance.'' 
 Yes, this must be Camp Mogul. 
 Each July, billionaires and mere multimillionaires flock here, to the shadow of the Pioneer Mountains, and ride in soft-leather comfort along Dollar Road to mingle and be rich and maybe, just maybe, cut a deal. 
 And so this week, like the swallows of Capistrano, the private jets returned again, bearing a Who's Who of Wall Street financiers, Hollywood types and technorati to the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference. 
 By all accounts, the moguls are happier campers this year than last, when the financial crisis was a not-so-distant memory. Like ordinary Americans, many returnees remain anxious about the fragile state of the economy and the up-and-down financial markets. 
 But that doesn't mean a mogul can't have some fun. Over there, Warren E. Buffett is relaxing over lunch as skaters on the rink pirouette to the strains of Lady Gaga. And look, by the bar -- isn't that Harvey Weinstein? Yes, with Terry Semel of Yahoo. And there goes Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, saying how much he hoped LeBron James would join the Knicks (he won't). The trout, browns and rainbows, are rising on Silver Creek. Just about every bike in town is rented out. 
 Still, the business of Sun Valley is business. For the past 27 years, the conference, hosted by the boutique investment bank Allen & Company, has been the place where blockbuster media deals have been planned and plotted. Last year, it was NBC Universal-Comcast. This year, people arrived buzzing that Walt Disney might be shopping ABC. Robert A. Iger, the head of Disney, promptly dismissed the talk. 
 So far no deal, mega or otherwise, has emerged, though plenty of executives have ducked into conference rooms for private chats. There isn't a cloud in the Idaho sky, but there are plenty hanging over the economy -- more than enough to make a deal maker nervous. 
 Many executives here have spent the last two years shepherding their companies through the Great Recession. And, for the moment, they seem reluctant to gamble on a transformative deal. Still, every time executives are spotted in a tete-a-tete, people start talking. What were Mark Zuckerberg and Eric E. Schmidt chatting about as they ducked into that Infiniti? And who was with Mr. Buffett at lunch?
 Executives like Gregory B. Maffei, the chief executive Liberty Media, said small, less-risky deals may be all that is in store in the immediate future. Gordon Crawford, regarded as one of the media world's savviest investors, told reporters that he does not foresee ''a lot of growth'' for many of the industries represented here. Mr. Maffei and John C. Malone, chairman of Liberty Media, both sounded concern over forthcoming tax increases and the nation's mounting debt. 
 Not that moguls are talking much to reporters. One of the first rules of the most talked-about media conference in the world is, well, don't talk to the media. Security, always tight, is particularly heavy this year. The dozen or so journalists covering the event were herded behind the red velvet ropes. 
 Still, star gazers had plenty to watch. One by one the private jets began rumbling into tiny Friedman Memorial Airport on Tuesday, where the lines of cars waited to ferry travelers to the expansive Sun Valley Resort for four days of panel discussions, tennis and skeet shooting.
 There were many familiar names. Barry Diller of IAC/InterActiveCorp, Rupert Murdoch of the News Corporation and Henry R. Kravis of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts all made it. So did the Google troika of Sergey Brin, Larry Page and Mr. Schmidt, as well as Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook.
 But there were also fresher faces like Mark Pincus of the social game maker Zynga, and Jack Dorsey, the creator of Twitter. 
 Not everyone was from Hollywood or New York or Silicon Valley. Lee Hsien Loong, the prime minister of Singapore, was present this year. Gen. David H. Petraeus is scheduled to appear on a panel on Saturday.
 Yet other regular attendees, like Howard Stringer of Sony, Mel Karmazin of Sirius XM Radio and Sumner M. Redstone of Viacom, were no-shows this year. And one of the biggest names on the invitation list, Steven P. Jobs of Apple, had not arrived as of Thursday afternoon. 
 But many of the high-powered attendees did not come alone. As usual, many bring their spouses and children. The children were chaperoned by an army of local youths. Like their parents, they had plenty to do: rafting, miniature golf and, in light of the World Cup, soccer. As their parents clinked glasses on the lodge's patio Wednesday night, the children queued up for ice cream, and for skates to use at the adjoining ice rink. After all, moguls can't have all the fun.

HEADLINE: Training for Leading Roles

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
''Tap the skin,'' Kristin Linklater tells the two dozen or so students who face her on the stage of the Miller Theater at Columbia University. ''Now tap your leg. Walk. Tap. Walk. Tap.'' 
 ''Now tap your own buttocks,'' she instructs, and ripples of laughter spread across the stage. ''Remember what I said earlier: tension in your buttocks makes you stupid.''
 ''Oh come on, do it!'' she urges the most reluctant tappers. ''Don't be self-conscious.''
 But being self-conscious was precisely the point for some of the 50 fellows at the World Economic Forum who came to New York this week to explore how theater and the arts can help them, say, someday run an international conglomerate or a finance ministry. 
 ''It gets you out of your comfort zone,'' Arthur Wasunna, one of the global leaders in training, said of the class. 
 Over five days at Columbia's campus in New York, the fellows have taken courses on voice, breathing, rhetoric and improvisation as part of a novel collaboration between Columbia and the forum, an international foundation probably best known for sponsoring an annual gathering of movers and shakers (the political, rather than the physical, kind) in Davos, Switzerland. 
 The three-year fellowship program is based in Geneva and combines work and studies. It has been operating since 2005, but this is the first time an arts component has been part of the curriculum. 
 The Columbia sojourn is the result of a meeting in Davos between Gilbert Probst, the managing director and dean of the fellowship program, and Carol Becker, dean of Columbia's School of the Arts. The idea was to teach the fellows -- who hail from 40 countries and range in age from 26 to 36 -- the techniques that actors employ to hold an audience's attention.
 ''Leaders shape followers' perceptions,'' Mr. Probst said. ''That is what actors do. And what is it that great actors have? A presence.''
 A second aspect of the week's activities, Ms. Becker said, is to ''see art and culture as a vital force for social change.'' 
 Ms. Linklater, a theater arts professor at Columbia who helped arrange the schedule, said that the idea of ''taking the stage, owning the stage and sharing the stage was a metaphor for playing the game of life.''
 ''These are very brainy people,'' she said after her class. Her aim is to get them to use the entire body and not just words to express themselves. ''Embodied speaking and thinking is very potent,'' she said.
 Compared with her regular roster of students, the forum fellows had ''enormous inhibitions,'' Ms. Linklater said. '' 'You mean I have to shake my actual butt?' '' she said. ''It's not very intellectual.'' 
 Ultimately, she added, they were all very curious and willing. 
 During a brief lunch break, Mr. Wasunna, a tall, thin Kenyan who works on combating corporate corruption worldwide, said: ''I found it very valuable. You have to project yourself in public.''
 In a classroom across the street from the Miller Theater, a second group of fellows similarly let go of their inhibitions with Andrea Haring, a vocal coach. Grunting and stretching, students were arranged in circles, throwing imaginary colored objects at one another: an orange baseball, a jagged fire-engine red boulder, a hot pink feather.
 Colors bring out emotional expressiveness, Ms. Haring explained; each color connects to a different vowel sound. ''Zoooooo,'' she rumbled in a deep voice, originates in the pelvis and legs and is a dark, earthy brown. ''He-uh,'' leafy green, comes through the mouth, and expresses searching curiosity. ''Reeee,'' delivered in a silly, high-pitched trill, is white and pours from the top of the head like confetti. 
 In the next class, Ms. Haring said, she planned to relate that day's lesson to Shakespeare's text.
 A student, Arturo Franco, a Mexican who tracks developments in Latin America, acknowledged that ''this is not the norm in our fellowship program.'' (On Sunday the group is scheduled to travel to Philadelphia to take classes at the Wharton School of Business.)
 ''If there are two sides to the brain,'' Mr. Franco added, ''we tend to be left-sided -- economists, engineers. This allows you to explore the other side, the other self.'' 
 Politics surfaced during another class, taught by Brent Blair, in a way that some members of the World Economic Forum, which is primarily supported by large corporations, might not have anticipated. Mr. Blair, the founding director of the Applied Theater Arts program at the University of Southern California, trained with Augusto Boal, the Brazilian director who created Theater of the Oppressed, an international movement, based on the work of the radical Brazilian theorist Paulo Freire, that seeks to empower poor and oppressed people through socially conscious theater.
 ''Theater of the Oppressed holds a mirror up to nature and then invites the audience to take a hammer and break the mirror and come up and replace the action onstage,'' Mr. Blair explained to his class. In doing so, ''they are rewriting their lives.''
 Eliot Lee, a fellow from South Korea who networks with businesses and other organizations in Asia, asked about the danger of instigating ''change purely for the sake of change.''
 Mr. Blair, referring to Freire's philosophy, replied that liberation must be directly connected to critical thinking, not blind action, adding, ''In Theater of the Oppressed, the answers are far less important than the questions.''
 At one point he asked the class to move about and fill a space without leaving open any path for him to walk through. When the group members started plotting their movements, Mr. Blair laughed. ''I've been teaching this for 15 years, and this is the first time a group has tried to plan out a strategy,'' he said. 
 Later he asked the students to take on the role of an oppressed person or an oppressor, and to improvise a dialogue. Ms. Linklater watched from an orchestra seat. 
 ''Yes, it's political, but it's also hugely theatrical and transformative,'' she said, ''It makes you think. I felt we needed provocation.''
 After class, Mr. Lee said the exercises ''opened a little room in myself to think about the intentions of other people,'' to understand what may be motivating them.
 ''I don't think the politics were the issue,'' he added. ''It's about understanding ourselves and expressing our thoughts.''
 Matthew Miller, an American who deals with public and private partnerships in the Middle East, agreed. ''I might not necessarily celebrate his politics,'' he said of Boal, ''but I think I could check that at the door to learn something.'' 
 Or as Ms. Haring might say, ''He-uh!''

HEADLINE: Exports Hit Record in China, As Trade Gap Surges 140%

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
China's trade surplus for June widened to the highest level this year and exports for the month climbed more than expected, hitting a record. The gains add pressure on the government to let the nation's currency appreciate after a report from the United States Treasury said the currency, the renminbi, ''remains undervalued.'' 
 The trade gap rose 140 percent, to $20.02 billion, compared with a year earlier, the customs bureau said on its Web site on Saturday. That compares with the $15.6 billion median estimate of 24 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Exports surged 43.9 percent compared with a year earlier and import growth moderated for the third month, rising by 34.1 percent.
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said Thursday that he would ''closely and regularly'' monitor the pace of the renminbi's appreciation after China said it was scrapping a two-year peg to the dollar and allowed a 0.8 percent gain in the last three weeks. Policy makers in China, the world's biggest exporting nation, may be reluctant to move too quickly as Europe's sovereign-debt crisis threatens external demand just as the domestic economy is slowing.
 ''The Chinese government may still be willing to allow the yuan to appreciate as long as exports expand at a reasonable pace,'' Xing Ziqiang, an economist in Beijing at China International Capital Corporation, said before the release. 
 The value of outbound shipments rose to a record $137.4 billion last month, the customs bureau said. The previous high was $136.68 billion in July 2008, before the global financial crisis deepened. The 43.9 percent expansion compared with the median 38 percent forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 24 economists.
 Imports climbed to $117.4 billion, the third highest this year. The 34.1 percent gain compares with the median forecast of 35.4 percent in the Bloomberg survey.
 China took a ''significant step'' last month when it began to allow markets to drive its currency higher, the Treasury Department said in a report to Congress released on Thursday, after postponing the release in April. It's not yet clear whether the policy shift will correct the renminbi's undervaluation, it said.

HEADLINE: Restoring A Hallowed Vision

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
''We're going to show that there is a different day in America -- that working people are sick and tired of the bosses getting million-dollar bonuses and the workers getting the short end of the stick.''
 -- Bob King 
 In April 1968, the same month that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis, where he had gone to support striking sanitation workers, the president of the powerful auto workers' union, Walter Reuther, traveled to Memphis to give the strikers critically needed financial support.
 The sanitation workers were black. In his biography of Reuther, Nelson Lichtenstein noted that the check he handed over to the strikers was the largest outside contribution that they would receive. Some officials at the United Automobile Workers headquarters in Detroit were taken aback. ''But Reuther forged ahead,'' Lichtenstein wrote, ''offering an impassioned defense of interracial solidarity.''
 Three-thousand delegates to the U.A.W. convention later that year heard Reuther say: ''We laid $50,000 on the line to demonstrate we meant business. Who helped us back in 1936 and 1937 when we were being beaten up and shot at, when our offices and our cars were being blown up by the gangsters hired by the corporations? 
 ''Who helped us? The coal miners ... the clothing workers ... as long as I am identified with the leadership of this great union, we are going to extend a hand of solidarity to every group of workers who are struggling for justice.''
 Reuther believed that solidarity and a commitment to social and economic justice was the very essence of the union movement. If you want to hear a heartfelt restatement of those beliefs for the early 21st century, a period in which the union movement is in great distress and the living standards of working people have seriously declined, listen to the soft-spoken new president of the U.A.W., Bob King.
 ''My view of the labor movement today,'' he said in an interview, ''is that we got too focused on our contracts and our own membership and forgot that the only way, ultimately, that we protect our members and workers in general is by fighting for justice for everybody.''
 The fundamental issue is that ''every human being deserves dignity and a decent standard of living,'' he said, ''and the whole point of the labor movement is to help make that happen.''
 In Mr. King's view, the fight to organize workers and improve their wages and benefits is important, but it's part of a much broader effort to improve the lives of individuals and families throughout the country and beyond. He is a believer in cooperative efforts and shared sacrifice, and is unabashedly idealistic as he outlines what can only be described as a new activism on labor's part.
 He promised his members last month that the U.A.W. would be marching and campaigning and organizing -- for jobs, for a moratorium on home foreclosures, for civil and human rights and against the mistreatment of immigrants, and for peace.
 ''The Tea Party has been more vocal than we've been,'' he said. ''There is something wrong with that picture.''
 This is not the way that prominent leaders in any segment of our society have spoken for a long time. The pragmatists and cynics, who have gotten a stranglehold on the culture, will scoff. But the pragmatists and cynics, with their hubris and half-baked ideologies, have handed all the wealth of the nation to a favored few and left the rest of the society a ragged mess.
 It's no accident that the great progressive successes of the labor movement, the civil rights movement, a variety of other social justice movements, and the emergence of a vast and thriving middle class all converged in the early post-World War II decades. 
 But the counterattack from the right, with its assaults on labor, its outlandishly regressive tax policies, its slavish devotion to corporate power and its divide-and-conquer strategies on racial and ethnic issues all combined to halt the remarkable advances of ordinary working people.
 All you have to do now is look around at what the right has wrought.
 Bob King has a vision that draws upon the lessons of that postwar period, starting with the basic right of workers to organize if they wish without being terrorized by employers. It was the fact that workers were organized in the auto and other manufacturing industries that sparked the creation of a large middle class in America. Those well-paying union jobs allowed working families to buy a home, to put their children through school, to build better lives.
 The wages from those jobs fueled the consumer demand that powered America's economic success.
 Even as he looks toward the future, Mr. King is trying to remind us of what went right in the past.

HEADLINE: High Speed for the Sparsely Wired

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM

 BODY:
Government stimulus spending is a contentious issue right now in Washington. But the $7.2 billion in the last stimulus package for extending high-speed Internet access is just beginning to be spent, and the beneficiaries could not be happier.
 Cynthia K. Wegener and her husband, owners of a farm and horse-breeding business in western Kansas, will be able to upload a photograph of a horse to show a potential buyer in seconds, not the 20 to 30 minutes they now need with dial-up service. ''I just cannot begin to tell you how frustrating it is to do anything with it,'' she said.
 And in remote Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta in Alaska, with limited Internet access, the program will bring more fundamental changes, expanding the health care options, for example, to allow doctors in Anchorage, 400 miles to the east, to see patients via videoconference. 
 ''This is the first time in my 25 years in health care where technology has a direct impact,'' David P. Hodges, the chief information officer for the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation. ''It sure gives you a new perspective on what you do for a living.'' 
 The types of Internet activities that most Americans take for granted -- watching videos, downloading songs, social networking -- are out of reach for millions of homes across the United States. These people -- many in poor, rural pockets -- either have outmoded dial-up Internet service or have no affordable high-speed service. Sometimes the nearest high-speed connection is at the local library, 10 miles away.
 The $7.2 billion plan in the last stimulus package was approved without significant debate. The program is intended to extend broadband service to what is known as the ''middle mile,'' which can connect to institutions like schools and hospitals, and the ''last mile'' -- homes and businesses -- that big Internet providers have bypassed because the expected revenue was too small to justify the big investments needed. 
 For some of the beneficiaries, the program will mean the difference between isolation and being connected to the rest of the world. ''If you don't have a high-speed Internet connection, it's almost impossible to get anything done anymore,'' said Martin Cary, vice president for broadband services at GCI Communication Corporation of Alaska, the largest Internet provider in the state. 
 Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said the extension of Internet service was a significant moment in communications. ''Extending broadband in rural America is as important to jobs and growth in the 21st century as extending electricity was in the 20th century,'' he said.
 So far, more than 200 projects have been awarded about $3 billion in grants and loans from the program's administrators -- the Agriculture and the Commerce Departments -- mostly to small carriers. The stimulus law requires that all the money in the program be allocated by Sept. 30. Even so, many remote homes will still not get high-speed access.
 For those who will be connected, there are some mixed feelings. While most seem impatient for the greater access and many businesses are eager to attract new customers, some are concerned about the unintended consequences of their new connections. 
 James W. Rowh, for instance, who owns an organic farm and natural foods store not far from the Wegeners in Norton, Kan., is wary that the Internet will lure his customers away. ''You can find pretty deep discounts online,'' he said. ''There are only 3,000 people in this town. When you start losing people to the Internet, it's going to have an effect on your bottom line.'' 
 Even the small companies that have been awarded the grants and loans to extend the broadband fiber lines and build the microwave towers are aware that once they do all the work and sign up the customers, the big carriers may move in with lower rates and lure their business away.
 ''Typically, when we go into a town, competition will come on our heels,'' said H. Rusty Irvin, the chief executive of StratusWave Communications, a small carrier in Wheeling, W.Va. ''The Verizons and Comcasts may target that area for deployment.'' 
 The company won a $1.5 million loan and a $1.4 million grant to provide wireless service to three West Virginia counties in rural Appalachia.
 Bjorn Jones, a librarian in Salinas, Calif., an hour south of Silicon Valley, said that while the Web offered access to a seemingly limitless array of educational resources, it was also a source of mindless entertainment. ''If broadband is contextualized within a library, then you are creating learning opportunities,'' he said. ''Without a plan, it's going to be just kids watching YouTube.''
 The greater Salinas Valley, whose residents are mainly Hispanic immigrant farm workers, has limited high-speed Internet access mainly because of the expense of laying fiber optic lines. The surrounding mountains and beach make extending lines especially challenging for neighboring Santa Cruz County. Officials said they realized the need for additional fiber lines in April 2009 when the entire county, including its emergency services, lost the Internet for 21 hours after vandals cut cables miles away. 
 The joint application with Santa Cruz County, Monterey County and San Benito County to extend access was rejected by the Commerce Department in the first round and officials are awaiting word on the second round. (The rejection was not all that unusual; the department received 1,885 applications in the first round and awarded only 82 grants.)
 While the stimulus program will reach hundreds of rural areas in all 50 states, there are people like R. Mark Fair, who lives in Leicester, N.C., in the mountains northwest of Asheville, who will not be helped. Mr. Fair and his neighbors have been trying unsuccessfully since 2006 to persuade AT&T to replace their dial-up service.
 ''I go online every day for e-mail,'' said Mr. Fair, an electrical engineer. ''I can generally get around those O.K., but when it comes to online meetings and file transfers, it's really frustrating.''
 In Elon, N.C., Chad Sowers said he had exhausted his options for a reliable and fast connection, even offering to pay $2,000 toward that goal. He works in information technology, and he and his wife, a registered nurse, both need high-speed Internet for continuing education, he said. They also want their children, 9 and 12, to have access for their schoolwork. ''Broadband is no longer a luxury,'' Mr. Sowers said.
 In a statement, Clifton Metcalf Jr., an AT&T spokesman, said, ''We've taken efforts to still deliver the benefits of broadband to these customer locations, such as through our satellite-based broadband service, which reaches the vast majority of rural markets in our 22 states.'' 
 Since many of the new broadband recipients live in isolated, rural areas or are poor, the F.C.C. is proposing that money from its Universal Service Fund, which subsidizes telephone services for high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools, libraries and rural health care providers, be expanded to broadband services. The fund receives its money from a monthly fee of about $2.78 a household -- the fee is part of the telephone bill -- and is expected to disburse $8.7 billion this year.
 ''The biggest challenge is converting a fund that's been focused for a very long time on telephones to one focused on broadband communications as quickly and as efficiently as possible to make sure we can extend broadband to rural America,'' Mr. Genachowski of the F.C.C. said. 
 Alaska is the largest recipient of rural health care Universal Service Fund subsidies, and the Yukon-Kuskokwim Health Corporation is the largest recipient in the state, with $1.5 million in 2008. 
 Mr. Hodges, of the health corporation, said many of the 48 villages it served did not have running water or roads between villages because they were on unstable tundra. ''We can't put in telephone lines,'' he said, ''and there are environmental issues because you don't want to damage the tundra.''
 Mr. Hodges said his network of telepsychiatry through microwave and satellite would expand with the federal funds. The health corporation, which has a dearth of health professionals, offers behavior health services from psychiatrists in Minnesota, Seattle and Anchorage, he said. 
 ''We're now able to increase the amount of time we spend with a patient,'' he said. ''We're not limited by the lack of daylight in the winter and when planes because of weather can come in. We've taken those barriers out of the equation.''
 As for Mrs. Wegener, the horse breeder, she said she believed she was losing money by having to drive her horses to auctions as far away as North Dakota and Nebraska to be seen by potential buyers. The Internet could change that, she said. ''We would love to sell them off the farm and not haul them anywhere.''

HEADLINE: 'Daddy, Are We Rich?' and Other Toughies

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
There is nothing like an inquisitive child to make you realize just how complicated the topic of money is. That's what I ended up thinking after my 4-year-old daughter a few weeks ago stomped her feet, turned red and demanded to know why we did not own a summer house.
 It might have been funny if it hadn't totally knocked the wind out of me. My wife handled it better, noting that if we had spent money on a second home, our daughter wouldn't have been able to go to the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival this year or on a beach vacation. My wife also pointed out that it was generous of our friends to share their weekend home.
 But it reminds me that while it may be possible to dodge the subject of money in polite adult company, there is no denying children and their often relentless follow-ups. Children ask tough questions -- whether their families are rich, why they can't have an iPod Touch like their friends do. So below you'll find an introduction to five of the most difficult questions. 
 There are many more where these came from, and we'll be discussing them one by one in a series of posts on our Bucks blog this weekend and for the rest of the month. Please join us there to improve upon anything you see below or to suggest new questions.
 HOUSEHOLD INCOMEHow much money do you make? As with any financial question, your first response ought to be, ''What made you think of that?''
 Your children may not be looking for a number, especially if they're young and have no context for five- or six-digit figures. They may just be worried about running out of money or wondering why you don't live in a mansion.
 Also, asking the nature of the inquiry gives you time to compose yourself if you're rendered speechless or haven't prepared for this query.
 Brent Kessel, a financial planner in Pacific Palisades, Calif., and the author of ''It's Not About the Money,'' says he believes that most questions about salary spring from the schoolyard. ''There is so much comparison going on there,'' he said. ''Who is best looking? Who is most popular? And money just plugs right into that system. Who has the richest parents?''
 He has not yet answered his oldest child's question directly. Why not? ''The honest answer is my own fear about my son sharing it with his friends and it creating pain for them or emotional shame for their parents,'' he said. ''Why is Brent telling my kid that he makes that much? Does Brent's ego really need to rub it in?''
 Indeed, the problem with disclosure in this context is that many younger children will immediately tell someone (or everyone). And the automatic social reflex is often a flash of shame among people who hear the number and make less, Mr. Kessel noted, or arrogance among those who make more. Who truly wants to put others in either situation?
 If older children persist with their questioning, try instead to use this as a lesson in budgeting. Gary Shor, a financial planner with the American Economic Planning Group in Watchung, N.J., breaks down household expenses like mortgage payments, electricity and food costs. He and his wife help their children add other discretionary items to the list.
 ''They then get a sense of how much income someone needs to support this lifestyle,'' he said. ''We then discuss occupations that bring in that kind of income and the path to that career.''
 A RICH LIFE Questions about income are often about something larger: Are we rich? But younger children are often merely trying to figure out a definition of the term. So you could start by suggesting one, reminding your children that they are rich if their family loves them and that they are better off in many ways than much of the world's population.
 This may not work as well for teenagers, who care mostly about whether they have as much stuff as their friends. Susan Beacham, who lives in Lake Forest, Ill., and runs the educational company for children Money Savvy Generation, invited her 16-year-old daughter to sit in on a financial planning meeting with her and her husband.
 And her daughter's observation at the end of that first meeting? ''She said she learned that if you want to live it up later, you can't really live it up now,'' she said. In other words, if you want to be rich one day, you may have to sacrifice now.
 THE MOST TOYS Younger children, however, may not grasp the idea of delayed gratification when asking why the family doesn't have a second car or take nicer vacations.
 Jonathan Katz, a father of five in Clayton, Mo., answers simply: the family is saving money so the children won't have to borrow to pay for college. ''They seem to accept this, perhaps because it tells them they are the beneficiaries,'' he said.
 Given a particular request to return to a beloved but expensive vacation spot, David Blackburn of Montclair, N.J., stole a lesson from kindergarten class, where his son had been learning about bar charts.
 The two sat down and sketched out some things the boy was familiar with, including one week's allowance ($1.25), a Lego set ($20) and sushi for the family ($60). But a night for four at the Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., was so expensive that it required a few extra pieces of paper to graph it in proportion. ''His eyes got big,'' Mr. Blackburn said. ''And he asked a lot less about going to Mohonk.''
 CUTTING BACK When families must make do with less, children may not be able to grasp the bigger picture, or they may be frightened by it.
 So how best to handle it when they ask why they can't do things or go to places that they could just a few months ago? ''Money is very abstract to kids, and you have to make it concrete,'' said Ms. Beacham. ''Yes, mom lost her job, but it doesn't mean we won't have groceries. It may mean we won't eat out.''
 With older children, you might involve them, letting them choose where to scale back or asking for help planning a vacation that costs half of last year's. ''A lot of parents just try to take care of it for them,'' Ms. Beacham said, simply making arrangements without consulting the children or explaining the decisions.
 THAT SUMMER HOME While my wife and I managed to placate our daughter, those of you who own second homes may be faced with far more complicated questions from older children.
 Doug Garr, who lives in Manhattan, said that once his son was old enough to understand that the family had two homes, his son suggested giving one to a homeless person. ''His logic was sound,'' Mr. Garr recalled. ''Why should we live in two homes when so many live in none? I had no answer for that one.''
 Or your child may wonder why you have twice the home you need. Kevin Salwen and his wife were so taken by their daughter's conviction in this particular matter that their family of four decided to sell their 6,500-square-foot home. They bought a new one less than half the size and are giving away about $850,000, more than the price difference between the homes.
 And what if your child gets an idea like that? If you're not ready to uproot, encourage them to think of other things they can give. ''We never encourage anybody to sell their house,'' said Mr. Salwen, who wrote a book with his daughter called ''The Power of Half'' about the family's experience. ''That was just the thing that we had more than enough of. For others it may be time, or lattes or iTunes downloads or clothes in their closet. But everyone has more than enough of something.''

HEADLINE: Weighing the Possibility Of Bankruptcy for BP

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
With pockets as deep as BP's -- its assets are worth more than $260 billion -- the possibility that it might be forced to seek bankruptcy protection because of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill is considered remote by many industry experts.
 But what if the company's plan to contain the spill in the next several days does not work, and other efforts to stop the gushing oil also fail? If that were to occur, the worst-case projections of some experts, if they came to pass, would strain the ability of any company to pay, said Robin K. Craig, associate dean for environmental programs at the Florida State University College of Law. 
 Professor Craig said that if the oil hit the Gulf Stream and was carried by currents to East Coast states, Cuba and other Caribbean nations, and possibly even Britain, lawsuits could quickly mount to levels even BP could not handle.
 ''My bet is that BP will finally go bankrupt from the tort liability and the environmental liability,'' she said. ''Hypothetically, a bluefin tuna farmer in the Mediterranean could end up with a claim against BP.''
 Even those who find it unlikely that BP will seek bankruptcy protection believe it is likely that the company has to at least consider it as a possibility, in light of spiraling environmental costs, economic claims and the unpredictability of American juries. 
 ''They've got a duty to their shareholders and others to consider every possibility,'' said Samuel J. Gerdano, the executive director of the American Bankruptcy Institute. ''It's not a matter of panic, it's not a matter of irrationality. It's a coldhearted and clearheaded consideration of options.''
 A BP spokesman, Max McGahan, declined to comment on ''hypothetical'' questions. The company has said from the start that it has the resources to meet the economic challenge, including strong cash flow and billions of barrels of oil in proven reserves. 
 A previously unreleased memorandum by the Congressional Research Service outlined ways that a bankruptcy filing by BP could disrupt the cleanup and compensation. 
 The letter, prepared in response to questions from Senator Thomas R. Carper, Democrat of Delaware, stated that economic and environmental claims would fall into line behind the company's secured creditors as ''nonpriority, unsecured claims,'' leaving much of the continuing cost of cleanup, in all likelihood, to the federal government. With a judge's approval, the company's assets could even be sold and its liabilities left behind. 
 Government officials are pursuing contingency plans as well. The United States Department of Justice sent a letter to BP last month requesting at least 30 days' notice of ''any planned or contemplated events going forward that may involve substantial transfers of cash or other corporate assets outside of the ordinary course of business'' by BP -- the kinds of actions that might precede a bankruptcy filing. 
 The House of Representatives has passed a bill, introduced by Representative John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, that would limit BP's options in bankruptcy and bolster the rights of those with economic claims. 
 Under the proposed law, the sale of ''significant'' assets in bankruptcy related to a maritime incident could take place only with the approval of at least half of those holding claims for economic loss, or a determination by a judge that the company would still be able to pay claims.
 Many experts who have looked at the financial strength of BP said its ability to handle enormous liability claims should not be underestimated.
 Loretta Cross of the accounting and consulting firm Grant Thornton, who evaluates the assets of energy companies in bankruptcy, noted that the company's proven oil and gas reserves alone were worth $220 billion at today's prices, and that assets and equity that could be readily sold added another $40 billion. 
 ''That's just some of their assets,'' she said, adding that the company's debt is a relatively low $35 billion, leaving plenty of room for borrowing. 
 Ms. Cross also said BP could not afford the cost to its reputation that it would suffer in bankruptcy. 
 In the international arena, she said, ''it has an implication on how your business partners may treat you, and the credibility they may give you'' in future dealings. 
 If anything, worries that BP might unravel have eased in recent weeks, as the company has made steady progress on relief wells and announced the $20 billion settlement fund.
 ''Their agreement to do the trust was when I said, 'There's not ever going to be a bankruptcy here,' '' Ms. Cross said, because the fund serves as an alternative to the lawsuits that are massing against the company.
 Kenneth R. Feinberg, the administrator of the $20 billion fund to address economic losses from the spill, recently said in an interview on Fox News that a BP bankruptcy would be a ''disaster for the people in the gulf'' and is ''not an option.''
 Ian Williams, a bankruptcy lawyer at the firm Bryan Cave in Britain, was adamant that bankruptcy was out of the question.
 ''BP does not need to reorganize its business because it is solvent,'' he said, adding that the global importance of the company and its stock made it ''too big to fail.''
 A plaintiff's lawyer in New Orleans, Stuart H. Smith, said he had watched BP carefully for signs that it was moving to protect assets in bankruptcy. 
 ''My concern level is now less than it was,'' he said. Along with the creation of the Feinberg fund, which he said showed a commitment to stay the course, he added, ''We've done more homework -- they are a very deep, deep company.'' 
 Still, he said, the main concern remained the well itself. 
 ''Until it stops leaking,'' he said, ''nobody knows what the damages are.''

 BODY:
Athens, Ga.
 ONE of the saddest lessons of this recession is that the United States has no adequate response for rising long-term unemployment. Contrast this with our policy for combating inflation: the Federal Reserve can always reduce the money supply, no Congressional approval required. There isn't a comparable mechanism to create jobs or to protect the long unemployed, no contingency plan that kicks in whenever job losses continue to mount. 
 During this recession, the Fed has tried to fight unemployment by cutting interest rates, but cheap money that no one wants to borrow is not an employment policy. After all, few businesses want to expand and hire new employees, given weak consumer demand. And though priming the pump with government money is the best way to increase demand, Congress has been reluctant to spend enough to set the economy on the right course.
 Then there's the problem of unemployment benefits: Congress must vote on every extension and, with the latest impasse between Senate Republicans and Democrats, more than three million out-of-work Americans could lose their benefit payments by the end of the month. In the worst job market in decades, families won't have money to buy food and maintain health coverage, to keep up with mortgage payments and credit card bills.
 It wasn't always this way. In 1970, Congress passed the Federal-State Unemployment Compensation Act, which established an automatic trigger: whenever unemployment increased to a certain point at a national or a state level, benefits were extended by 13 weeks. 
 The costs of these benefits were shared by the states, which paid them out of their regular unemployment insurance accounts, and the federal government, which increased taxes by about $8 per worker. 
 In the '80s and '90s, however, Congress diminished the effectiveness of the program by eliminating the national trigger, raising the state triggers and altering the trigger calculations in such a way that they hardly ever took effect. As a result, unemployed Americans now have to wait and worry as lawmakers debate each extension. 
 Fortunately, there is a simple solution: set up a new trigger. Heather Boushey from the Center for American Progress and I have proposed that whenever a state's total unemployment rate rises above 6.5 percent or jobless claims increase by more than 20 percent, benefits should be offered for an additional 20 or more weeks. This program should be fully financed by the federal government, thereby alleviating states' burden during the recession.
 An automatic trigger would provide a tailored response to those states with the worst labor markets and eliminate the need for Congress to revisit this issue every few months. Most important, we could reduce some of the uncertainty for the jobless.

HEADLINE: Tainted Dairy Products Seized in Western China

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Two years after a national health scare over melamine-tainted milk products rocked China's dairy industry, inspectors in western China's Qinghai Province have seized 76 tons of dairy ingredients laced with the same industrial chemical, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday.
 The seizure appeared to involve products that had escaped a nationwide recall of dairy foods after the 2008 scandal, in which at least six children died and 294,000 others were sickened. 
 Inspectors in Gansu Province first discovered contaminated samples of milk powder brought to them for testing by a worker at the Dongyuan Dairy Factory in adjacent Qinghai Province. Qinghai officials later found that 64 tons of raw dairy products and 12 tons of finished goods were tainted with melamine, some at up to 559 times the legal maximum.
 Both the factory owner, Liu Zhanfeng, 54, and the production manager, Wang Haifeng, 37, were taken into police custody, Xinhua reported. Officials said most of the contaminated material was destined for Zhejiang Province, near Shanghai.
 Melamine, used in concrete, fertilizer and plastics, mimics protein in certain food-quality tests, and some Chinese manufacturers added it to ingredients used in infant formula, chocolate, pet and animal feeds, and other products to make them appear more nutritious. When eaten in sufficient quantity, however, melamine can cause permanent kidney damage.
 A year before the 2008 scandal, pet foods contaminated with Chinese-supplied melamine killed dozens of dogs in the United States and Africa and forced recalls of nearly 90 brands.
 In January, inspectors in southern China's Guizhou Province pulled dairy products out of local stores after discovering melamine in products shipped there from Shanghai and three other provinces. Xinhua reported on Friday that officials in Jilin Province, in northeastern China, had confiscated more than 1,000 packages of milk powder after finding tainted products in a market on June 22. Officials have since begun inspecting dairy plants across the region.
 In all the recent cases, the contaminated products appear to be leftovers from the 2008 recall. Inspections at that time found excessive melamine in the products of 22 dairy companies, or one in five dairy manufacturers.
 Government officials here vowed to crack down on food-safety violations in the wake of the 2007 and 2008 melamine cases, which damaged the reputation of Chinese food exports worldwide. The government ordered sweeping changes in food inspection last year, writing new rules and placing the existing patchwork of food regulatory bodies under a single authority, the National Ministry of Health.
 But food safety procedures still need improvement, and corrupt manufacturers and growers still use bribery and corruption to escape scrutiny.
 ''The Chinese government has enormously and effectively responded with new laws and new regulations, and tries to implement this as soon as it can,'' Rio Praaning Prawira Adiningrat, secretary general of the Public Advice International Foundation, said in a telephone interview. But the sheer size of the Chinese economy and the number of people ''makes it virtually impossible to check everything,'' he said. The foundation works in China on food safety issues. 
 Mr. Praaning praised the government's commitment and willingness to discuss its problems, adding, ''I think they are absolutely doing the best they can.'' 
 The melamine scandal erupted in late 2008, however, only after government officials suppressed word of widespread poisonings so as to avoid sullying China's international image during the Beijing Summer Olympics.
 On Wednesday, a newspaper in southern China reported that one father who started an online crusade for food safety after his child died from melamine poisoning had been sentenced to one year in a labor camp for ''re-education,'' a form of punishment often handed out to dissidents.
 The newspaper, the Guangzhou-based Southern Metropolis Daily, said that the father, Tang Lin, lost his 1-year-old son in August 2008 after the boy was poisoned by tainted infant formula made by the Sanlu Group, then China's biggest dairy products company. The company went bankrupt after the poisonings became public.

HEADLINE: With Its Economy Strong, South Korea Raises Rates

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Barring any surprises, interest rates in the United States and much of Europe look set to stay steady until next year. But in fast-growing Asia, the cost of borrowing has begun to creep up again. 
 South Korea on Friday became the latest country to raise interest rates from the lows of the financial crisis, joining a host of others in the region in gradually normalizing borrowing costs.
 The increase was slight -- the benchmark seven-day repurchase rate was nudged up by a quarter of a percentage point, to 2.25 percent -- but the timing surprised many analysts, who had not expected the Bank of Korea to act until next month.
 Less than 24 hours earlier, the central bank in Malaysia also staged a quarter-point rate rise -- its third this year -- again surprising observers, who had mostly forecast no further move for the time being. The overnight policy rate in Malaysia now stands at 2.75 percent.
 And the previous Friday, India announced an unexpected rate increase, its third this year. Vietnam, Taiwan, New Zealand and Australia also have started to return rates toward more normal levels, in Australia's case with a string of increases that started last October.
 Collectively, the moves are testimony to the region's economic strength.
 The Asia-Pacific region was spared major banking failures, and its governments and households are far less indebted than those in Europe and America. That, along with stimulus spending and sharply lower interest rates last year, allowed the region to escape the global downturn relatively unscathed, despite a sharp decline in exports as global demand plummeted in 2009.
 As a result, the region's developing countries could see growth of 9.2 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund's latest projections, published this week. That compares with 3.3 percent and 1 percent, respectively, for the United States and Europe. 
 South Korea last month raised its official growth forecast for 2010 to 5.8 percent, from 5 percent.
 Fast growth has brought inflation pressures, which the region's central banks are seeking to combat with their gradual rate increases.
 The Bank of Korea said Friday that although the economy was on track for solid growth, inflation threats were set to mount.
 ''Consumer price inflation has so far remained in a range of somewhat above 2 percent but a little below 3 percent,'' the central bank said in a statement accompanying its rate decision. But it added that ''upward pressures are expected to build continuously'' because of the continued upturn in economic activity.
 The bank pledged to maintain an ''accommodative policy stance'' to aid the economic recovery, but some analysts projected further small increases could be in the offing.
 ''Pending the release of further guidance, we are inclined to keep our call for an August rate hike, for now,'' commented Wai Ho Leong, a regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore, in a note, citing the central bank's apparent concern with inflation, and continued strong growth.

HEADLINE: Shares Post Biggest Weekly Gains in a Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The stock market ended its best week in a year with another gain on Friday as investors placed their last bets before the start of second-quarter earnings reports.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 59 points, or 0.6 percent. That gave the Dow its biggest weekly advance in a year, 5.3 percent. Broader indexes posted bigger gains. Trading volume was light, signaling that many investors were staying out of the market. But those who were trading appeared optimistic about the company reports that would be announced starting next week.
 Stocks also got a lift from news that China renewed Google's license to operate in the country. The renewal was in doubt because of a strained relationship between the company and China's government over censorship of search results. Shares of Google rose 2.4 percent. 
 News on the economy was not as upbeat. Inventories held by wholesalers rose in May for a fifth consecutive month, although sales dropped for the first time in more than a year. The government said wholesale inventories rose 0.5 percent and sales dropped 0.3 percent. It was the first drop since March 2009, when major stock indexes hit a 12-year low.
 But investors did not appear fazed by the inventories report. Instead, the market appeared to hold on to optimism fed by Thursday's report of a drop in the number of newly laid-off people seeking unemployment benefits. That report ended a string of bad news about the job market.
 ''It's time to determine if this is just a soft patch in the recovery or if it's the beginning of a second leg down. That's what the market is struggling with,'' said Dan Deming, a trader with Stutland Equities in Chicago.
 Earnings season starts with the aluminum producer Alcoa on Monday. The company's stock rose 2 percent ahead of its report. Other companies scheduled to release results next week include the banking giants JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America. General Electric and Intel are also scheduled to report earnings next week.
 Overseas markets rose after a surprise interest rate increase in South Korea was seen as a sign of confidence that the global economy would continue to expand. Central banks around the world, including in the United States, have kept rates at record low rates to stimulate growth.
 The Dow rose 59.04 points, or 0.6 percent, to 10,198.03. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.71 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,077.96, while the Nasdaq composite index rose 21.05 points, or 1 percent, to 2,196.45.
 For the week, the Dow rose 512 points, or 5.3 percent, its best gain since the week that ended July 17, 2009. After a holiday on Monday, stocks rose modestly Tuesday and jumped Wednesday after traders looked for stocks that were bargains after two weeks of selling. The Dow rose 275 points to move back above 10,000. The Dow added another 120 points on Thursday after the unemployment report.
 The S.& P. 500-stock index rose 5.4 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq gained 5 percent.
 Bond prices fell as stocks rose. The Treasury's benchmark 10 year note fell 6/32, to 103 25/32, and the yield rose to 3.05 percent from 3.03 percent late Thursday. 
 Crude oil rose 65 cents, to $76.09 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 Google rose $10.93, to $467.49. Alcoa rose 22 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $10.94, while JPMorgan climbed 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $38.85. Bank of America advanced 25 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $15.11. G.E. rose 12 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $14.95. Intel advanced 14 cents, or 0.7 percent, to $20.24.

HEADLINE: Share of College Budgets For Recreation Is Rising

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
American colleges are spending a declining share of their budgets on instruction and more on administration and recreational facilities for students, according to a study of college costs released Friday.
 The report, based on government data, documents a growing stratification of wealth across America's system of higher education.
 At the top of the pyramid are private colleges and universities, which educate a small portion of the nation's students, while public universities and community colleges, where tuitions are rising most rapidly, serve greater numbers and have fewer resources. 
 The study of revenues and spending trends of American institutions of higher education from 1998 through 2008 traces how the patterns at elite private institutions like Harvard and Amherst differed from sprawling public universities like Ohio State and community colleges like Alabama Southern.
 The United States is reputed to have the world's wealthiest postsecondary education system, with average spending of around $19,000 per student compared with $8,400 across other developed countries, said the report, ''Trends in College Spending 1998-2008,'' by the Delta Cost Project, a nonprofit group in Washington that promotes greater scrutiny of college costs to keep tuitions affordable.
 ''Our analysis shows that these comparisons are misleading,'' Jane Wellman, the group's executive director, said in an e-mail statement. ''While the United States has some of the wealthiest institutions in the world, it also has a 'system' of postsecondary education with far more economic stratification than is true of any other country.''
 Community colleges, which enroll about a third of students, spend close to $10,000 per student per year, Ms. Wellman said, while private research institutions, which enroll far fewer students, spend an average of $35,000 a year for each one.
 Undergraduate and graduate enrollments nationwide grew to 18.6 million students overall in 2008 from 14.8 million in 1998, an increase of 26 percent, the report said. Among all the sectors that make up American postsecondary education, public community colleges added the most students over the decade, growing to 6.3 million from 5 million.
 By comparison, enrollment at private colleges and universities grew to 2 million students from 1.8 million in the 10 years.
 Tuition, on average, increased more rapidly over the decade at public institutions than it did at private ones. Average tuition rose 45 percent at public research universities and 36 percent at community colleges from 1998 to 2008, compared with about 21 percent at private research universities.
 But the trend toward increased spending on nonacademic areas prevailed across the higher education spectrum, with public and private, elite and community colleges increasing expenditures more for student services than for instruction, the report said. 
 The student services category can include spending on career counseling and financial aid offices, but also on intramural athletics and student centers.
 ''This is the country-clubization of the American university,'' said Richard K. Vedder, a professor at Ohio University who studies the economics of higher education. ''A lot of it is for great athletic centers and spectacular student union buildings. In the zeal to get students, they are going after them on the basis of recreational amenities.''
 On average, spending on instruction increased 22 percent over the decade at private research universities, about the same as tuition, but 36 percent for student services and 36 percent for institutional support, a category that includes general administration, legal services and public relations, the study said.
 At public research universities, spending for student services rose 20 percent over the decade, compared with 10 percent for instruction.
 Even at community colleges, with their far smaller budgets, spending on students services increased 9.5 percent, compared with 3.4 percent for instruction.
 The study also said that the recession that began in the last months of 2008 had dramatically changed the economics of higher education, probably forever.
 ''The funding models we've created in higher ed are not sustainable,'' Ms. Wellman said. ''We ran up spending in the '90s and early 2000s to levels we can't maintain, and this is true not only in the elite privates, but in many of the public institutions, too.'' 
 Now, with private-college endowments battered and state legislatures slashing university budgets coast to coast, ''policy makers as well as university presidents and boards must learn to be better stewards of tuition and taxpayer dollars,'' she said. 
 The Delta Cost Project, founded in 2007, is governed by a three-member board and financed in part by the Lumina Foundation. The project says it ''focuses on the spending side of the college cost problem, how institutional spending relates to access and success, and ways that costs can be controlled without compromising quality.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 9, 2010, Friday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The headline with an earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that American colleges spend more on recreation than on instruction. The study showed that the share of spending on recreation was rising more quickly than the share of spending on instruction.

HEADLINE: Abortion In the Eyes Of a Girl From Dillon

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Seated at Tami Taylor's kitchen table, Becky Sproles wrenchingly lays out her dilemma: The only child of an embittered single bartender who gave birth to her when she was a teenager, Becky is faced with the prospect of recycling her mother's past and she doesn't know what to do. 
 Initially resolved to end her pregnancy, Becky -- played with a bracingly naive righteousness by Madison Burge on ''Friday Night Lights'' on NBC -- begins to doubt her choice. Is she seeking an abortion simply to counter her mother's example? What if she were capable, caring and present as a parent? What if, as an emotionally wounded 10th grader without resources living in Dillon, Tex., with its pageant of grim futures, she could defy sociological prediction? 
The tortured expression on Becky's face tells us how profoundly she would like this to be so and yet how clearly she foresees the bleaker reality. ''I can't take care of a baby,'' she tearfully tells Tami, matriarch to Dillon's lost youth. ''I can't.''
 With those words Becky decides to have an abortion. This took place on Friday's episode of ''Friday Night Lights'' and was remarkable -- abortions have been rare on serial television since the early '70s. But the effect was particularly resonant this week. On Monday Bristol Palin, America's most famous teenage mother, briefly appeared as herself on the ABC Family soap opera ''The Secret Life of the American Teenager,'' bringing greater attention to a popular series that for three seasons has performed didactic and soulless cheerleading for anti-abortion sentiments. 
 (Ms. Palin's purpose, as it happened, was to inform the show's heroine, a mediocre French-horn player, that she had been selected for an impressive summer music program in Manhattan because she was a teenage mom. Apparently, there are all kinds of paths to Juilliard.)
 For years, and especially since Ellen Page's sardonic young heroine decided to carry her baby to term in the 2007 film ''Juno,'' television has consistently leaned to the right on the subject of unwanted pregnancy. Often the woman confronting a difficult choice is spared having to exercise her will, thanks to the convenient plot device of a miscarriage, deployed as if to suggest that nature remedies ambivalence. Alternatively, she might forge ahead and have a baby, however unrealistically. This was the case when the driven Harvard-educated lawyer Miranda Hobbes, played by Cynthia Nixon on ''Sex and the City,'' proceeded to become a single mother, having shown no previous interest in family life. 
 In the most bizarre instance of revisionism on the issue, four years ago ''All My Children'' reversed Erica Kane's 1973 abortion, a milestone in television history when it occurred 11 months after the Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade. A character named Josh Madden learned that although Erica had initially conceived him, he had been kidnapped as an embryo and transferred to the womb of another woman by the obviously deranged doctor who had raised him. Fans were outraged, on one level because the story line was ludicrous, even by the measure of daytime television, and on another because the twist had gone a long way toward eradicating the show's progressive politics, and, in some sense, an entire era. 
 A year before Erica decided to abort her fetus to pursue her career, Bea Arthur's Westchester firecracker Maude Findlay famously decided on ''Maude'' to terminate a pregnancy during her fourth marriage. With the support of her husband, she realizes that, at 47, she is too old for night feedings. And while that might have supplied reasonable enough cause in 1972, it is easy to imagine an altogether different scenario unfolding today as legions of women endure hormone injections and huge expense to conceive a child in middle age. It is not merely the rise of evangelical Christianity that accounts for TV's altered mood, but the dramatic realignment of women's priorities since the most active days of the feminist movement.
 What was striking about the exploration of Becky's circumstance on ''Friday Night Lights'' was the extent to which the opposing view was depicted as obtuse and out of touch. Two years ago an anonymous young woman ultimately received an abortion on ''Private Practice'' but not before an hour of television had passed which felt less like drama and more like journalism -- sound, balanced and fair -- with all relevant moral positions respectfully represented.
 The writers of ''Friday Night Lights'' had something altogether different in mind. Becky's pregnancy had been the result of a one-time sexual encounter with Luke Cafferty, a well-intentioned football star and the son of struggling, religious cattle ranchers who have not always held his best interests at heart. When Luke's mother learns what has happened, her response is to say that Mary and Joseph thought they were in a tough spot too, at first. Luke bluntly corrects her: ''Becky and me are not Mary and Joseph.''
 ''Friday Night Lights'' chose to maintain its commitment, above all, to the world it renders -- and to its quasi-Marxist understanding that economics dictate everything. Dillon is a difficult place where improperly-cared-for children materialize one after another, week after week. In a subplot to Friday's episode, Vince, another gridiron prodigy, is forced to scramble around for money to pay for his mother's rehabilitation in the aftermath of a drug overdose, which leaves him begging her to stop and pay attention to him. Again and again, ''Friday Night Lights'' seems to remind us, as if in klieg lights, of the consequences of parenthood pursued by accident or default.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 14, 2010

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A television column on Saturday about a decision by a character on ''Friday Night Lights'' to have an abortion, and how the subject of abortion has been handled on other shows, referred incorrectly to the Roe v. Wade ruling, which established a constitutional right to abortion. The ruling was made by the Supreme Court; it did not involve ''passage,'' as with legislation.

HEADLINE: Tensions Over Illegal Immigration

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''The Constitution Trumps Arizona'' (editorial, July 8) offers sensible ideas for what the Obama administration should do to support immigrant rights in the absence of Congressional reform. Of even greater value would be declaring a moratorium on deportations until Congress chooses to act.
 Despite campaigning as a pro-immigrant reformer, President Obama and his administration continue to deport undocumented immigrants -- the vast majority of whom do not have criminal records or are low-level offenders -- at an unprecedented pace. This ''enforcement only'' strategy tears families apart, devastates communities, dishonors the vast contributions of undocumented immigrants and does nothing to fix a system that everyone agrees is broken. 
 By halting deportations, President Obama could lessen the daily terror felt by millions while showing Congress that if it won't act, he will.
 Michael Mandel Port Washington, N.Y., July 8, 2010
 The writer is an immigration lawyer.
 To the Editor:
 I hope that more people will come to understand the merits behind the lawsuit that was filed by the Justice Department against the Arizona crackdown on illegal immigration. Under our Constitution, no state has the ability to claim frustration and enact laws that pre-empt the federal government's prerogatives.
 This country fought the Civil War because individual states wanted to address issues differently from our federal government. Immigration law is not a state matter. It is handled by the federal government for many reasons, including its complexities and sensitive nature.
 Daniel Luna Fresno, Calif., July 8, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial describes Arizona's law as being ''pernicious'' and ''unjust.'' But most Americans would disagree. A New York Times/CBS News poll published on May 4 showed that 60 percent of the respondents felt that the Arizona law was ''about right'' or ''doesn't go far enough.''
 Arizona's law does not symbolize cruelty, but a long overdue reaction to the federal government's failure to protect the meaning of American citizenship.
 I am a Democrat and voted for President Obama, but if he pushes for amnesty for those who have violated our immigration and labor laws, I will not vote for him again.
 Karen Pollack Greenport, N.Y., July 8, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Many Churches, One Plea'' (news article, July 5): Faith communities across America provide critical human care to immigrants and their families. Churches and other religious organizations offer English classes, minister to detained immigrants, and support families and children struggling with prolonged separation from loved ones.
 Your article offers an important example of the faith community courageously becoming more active publicly in support of immigration reform.
 The consequences of a broken immigration system for communities and families are devastating -- costing lives, separating families, destroying futures and hurting our economy. President Obama's speech calling for immigration reform is a welcome step, but Congress and the administration must redouble their efforts to advance bipartisan solutions to overhaul the immigration system. As Lutherans, we stand with newcomers to this nation and the communities that welcome them.
 Linda Hartke President and C.E.O., Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service Baltimore, July 6, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Law in Arizona Is Causing Split in Border Talks'' (front page, July 7):
 Governors of Mexican states bordering the United States have echoed the criticism of Arizona's new immigration law by President Felipe Calderon of Mexico. These governors have decided to make their outrage known by boycotting the conference of governors from American and Mexican border states that would have been held in Phoenix. This boycott is shamelessly hypocritical.
 Mexico has a law regarding illegal immigrants within its borders that is very similar to Arizona's. Moreover, illegal immigrants from Central America are preyed upon by gangs and corrupt government officials while in Mexico, with little done by the Mexican government to protect them. Until Mexican officials are prepared to respect the ''fundamental rights'' of illegal immigrants in Mexico, they should refrain from lecturing American officials.

HEADLINE: A Compromise Allows Both China and Google to Claim a Victory

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA and MIGUEL HELFT; David Barboza reported from Shanghai and Miguel Helft from San Francisco. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from Sun Valley, Idaho.

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- The tense standoff that began in January with Google's unprecedented rebuke of China's Internet censorship rules appeared to ease on Friday with a compromise that might allow both sides to claim a partial victory. 
 Google said that Beijing agreed to renew the company's license to operate a Web site in mainland China, months after Google said it would stop censoring search results in China. Google's challenge of Beijing's authority, which followed a series of sophisticated online attacks which Google said originated in China, put into question Google's ability to do any business in the world's largest Internet market. 
 Google's chief executive, Eric E. Schmidt, said Friday that the renewal ''was the outcome we were hoping for.''
 ''We'll keep doing what we're doing, and they'll keep doing what they're doing,'' he said Friday at the Allen & Company media conference in Sun Valley, Idaho.
 The license, which China could revoke at any time, allows Google to keep its Web site, Google.cn, in China and continue operating some Internet services there. It also allows Google to continue referring users in China to its uncensored Hong Kong-based Chinese language search engine, at google.com.hk. 
 Hong Kong, a former British colony that is now a special administrative region of China, is governed separately from the mainland. Under the current setup in mainland China, users can conduct a Google search and see the results, but often they cannot open the links because they are blocked by the Chinese government. 
 ''This was an issue made to order for compromise,'' said J. Stapleton Roy, director of the Kissinger Institute on China and the United States at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ''It is good for China to have Google involved there, and it is good for Google to keep its footprint in China.''
 The renewal of Google's license came two weeks after the company was forced to change its approach of automatically sending Chinese search users to its Hong Kong-based site. Under threat from Beijing that its license would be denied, Google instead began displaying on Google.cn a link to the Hong Kong site that users could click to conduct searches.
 Forcing users to take that extra step could cost Google market share in China, where it trails behind Baidu, the local search engine. But China experts said that the approach represents a pragmatic balancing of interests that lets both sides get some of what they want. 
 Xiao Qiang, director of the China Internet Project at the University of California, Berkeley, said that Google won because ''they get their operating license. Chinese Internet users win because they can continue to access some Google services.''
 But Mr. Xiao said the Chinese government also would win, because while it forced Google to move its search service out of China and barred it from automatically redirecting users to its uncensored Hong Kong-based search engine, it also got to show its own people and the outside world that it was willing to balance economic issues and censorship.
 ''It is unprecedented for a private company to challenge Chinese Internet censorship,'' Mr. Xiao said. ''In the past, there would have been no doubt that the Chinese government would have punished Google.'' For the government, finding a way to keep Google in the country ''is a very calculated position that is good for China's long-term development and openness,'' Mr. Xiao said.
 While Google's stand against Chinese government censorship earned Google the good will of free speech and human rights advocates, it also came at a cost. 
 The compromise will allow Google to keep some of its business in China, but its position there may be weakened. In addition to potentially losing search traffic, Google could be hurting its ambition to expand into China's booming mobile phone business. Some phone makers and network operators are introducing phones powered by Google's Android software in China, but they have stripped out Google's mobile search service from the devices and replaced it with rivals like Baidu. Google, which makes its money placing ads linked to search results, could face a limited audience for mobile advertising.
 Google said in January that it was not willing to continue cooperating with Chinese censors after the hacking attempts on its databases and the e-mail accounts of some users. The company said at the time that it might have to shut down its search engine in China if the government insisted that the company continue to strip material that officials consider offensive or politically volatile.
 Many analysts were stunned by the moves and questioned whether Google was acting prudently in risking its spot in the world's largest Internet market.
 When the government insisted that Google continue to censor search results, the company tried to simply redirect users to the Hong Kong site. The change had little impact on Chinese users, who could still not access sites that the Chinese government censored. But it shifted the onus of censoring results from Google to China's filtering system, known as the Great Firewall of China.
 But Google's approach failed to appease Beijing, and Google was forced to modify it again late last month, by offering users a link on Google.cn rather than the automatic referral to the Hong Kong site. The move, though seemingly insignificant, apparently satisfied China.
 Renewal is required annually for Google's license, which officially expires in 2012.
 Even before the censorship issue came to the fore, Google was struggling in China to attain the same market dominance it has achieved in many other countries.
 The hottest Internet companies in China include Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba -- fast-growing local companies that are making huge profits.
 Google is not the only American giant that has had trouble in China. Yahoo and eBay have failed to gain significant traction here. And Facebook, Twitter and YouTube are blocked by the government.

HEADLINE: ILLEGAL WORKERS SWEPT FROM JOBS IN 'SILENT RAIDS'

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
BREWSTER, Wash. -- The Obama administration has replaced immigration raids at factories and farms with a quieter enforcement strategy: sending federal agents to scour companies' records for illegal immigrant workers. 
 While the sweeps of the past commonly led to the deportation of such workers, the ''silent raids,'' as employers call the audits, usually result in the workers being fired, but in many cases they are not deported. 
 Over the past year, Immigration and Customs Enforcement has conducted audits of employee files at more than 2,900 companies. The agency has levied a record $3 million in civil fines so far this year on businesses that hired unauthorized immigrants, according to official figures. Thousands of those workers have been fired, immigrant groups estimate. 
 Employers say the audits reach more companies than the work-site roundups of the administration of President George W. Bush. The audits force businesses to fire every suspected illegal immigrant on the payroll-- not just those who happened to be on duty at the time of a raid -- and make it much harder to hire other unauthorized workers as replacements. Auditing is ''a far more effective enforcement tool,'' said Mike Gempler, executive director of the Washington Growers League, which includes many worried fruit growers. 
 Immigration inspectors who pored over the records of one of those growers, Gebbers Farms, found evidence that more than 500 of its workers, mostly immigrants from Mexico, were in the country illegally. In December, Gebbers Farms, based in this Washington orchard town, fired the workers. 
 ''Instead of hundreds of agents going after one company, now one agent can go after hundreds of companies,'' said Mark K. Reed, president of Border Management Strategies, a consulting firm in Tucson that advises companies across the country on immigration law. ''And there is no drama, no trauma, no families being torn apart, no handcuffs.'' 
 President Obama, in a speech last week, explained a two-step immigration policy. He promised tough enforcement against illegal immigration, in workplaces and at the border, saying it would prepare the way for a legislative overhaul to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants already in the country. White House officials say the enforcement is under way, but they acknowledge the overhaul is unlikely to happen this year. 
 In another shift, the immigration agency has moved away from bringing criminal charges against immigrant workers who lack legal status but have otherwise clean records. 
 Republican lawmakers say Mr. Obama is talking tough, but in practice is lightening up.
 ''Even if discovered, illegal aliens are allowed to walk free and seek employment elsewhere'' said Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the senior Republican on the Judiciary Committee. ''This lax approach is particularly troubling,'' he said, ''at a time when so many American citizens are struggling to find jobs.''
 Employers say the Obama administration is leaving them short of labor for some low-wage work, conducting silent raids but offering no new legal immigrant laborers in occupations, like farm work, that Americans continue to shun despite the recession. Federal labor officials estimate that more than 60 percent of farm workers in the United States are illegal immigrants. 
 John Morton, the head of the immigration agency, known as ICE, said the goal of the audits is to create ''a culture of compliance'' among employers, so that verifying new hires would be as routine as paying taxes. ICE leaves it up to employers to fire workers whose documents cannot be validated. But an employer who fails to do so risks prosecution. 
 ICE is looking primarily for ''egregious employers'' who commit both labor abuses and immigration violations, Mr. Morton said, and the agency is ramping up penalties against them. 
 In April, Michel Malecot, the chef of a popular bakery in San Diego, was indicted on 12 criminal counts of harboring illegal immigrants. The government is seeking to seize his bakery. He has pleaded not guilty. In Maryland, the owner of two restaurants, George Anagnostou, pleaded guilty last month to criminal charges of harboring at least 24 illegal immigrants. He agreed to forfeit more than $734,000. 
 But the firings at Gebbers Farms shocked this village of orchard laborers (population 2,100) by the Columbia River among sere brown foothills in eastern Washington. Six months after the firings, the silence still prevails, with both the company and the illegal immigrants reluctant to discuss them.
 Farm worker advocates said the family-owned company, one of the biggest apple growers in the country, did not fit Mr. Morton's description of an exploiter. 
 ''The general reputation for Gebbers Farms was that they were doing right by their employees,'' said Matt Adams, legal director of the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. 
 The Gebbers packing house is the center of this company town, amid more than 5,000 acres of well-tended orchards, where the lingua franca is Spanish. Officials said public school enrollment is more than 90 percent Hispanic.
 Throughout last year, ICE auditors examined forms known as I-9's, which all new hires in the country must fill out. ICE then advised Gebbers Farms of Social Security and immigration numbers that did not check out with federal databases. 
 Just before Christmas, managers summoned the workers in groups. In often emotional exchanges, managers immediately fired those without valid documents. 
 ''No comment,'' said Jay Johnson, a lawyer for Gebbers Farms, expressing the company's only statement. 
 Many workers lived in houses they rented from the company; they were given three months to move out. In Brewster, truck payments stopped, televisions were returned, mobile homes were sold, mortgages defaulted. 
 Many immigrants purchased new false documents and went looking for jobs in more distant orchards, former Gebbers Farms workers said. But the word is out among growers in the region to avoid hiring immigrants from the company because ICE knows they are unauthorized. 
 ''Many people are still crying because this is really hard,'' said M. Garcia, 41, a former Gebbers packing house worker who has been out of a job since January.
 There was no wave of deportations and few families left on their own for Mexico. ''They are saying, what's going to happen to their kids?'' said Mario Camacho, an administrator in the Brewster school district. ''To those kids, this is their country.'' 
 After the firings, Gebbers Farms advertised hundreds of jobs for orchard workers. But there were few takers in the state. 
 ''Show me one American --just one -- climbing a picker's ladder,'' said Maria Cervantes, 33, a former Gebbers Farms worker from Mexico who gave her name because she was recently approved as a legal immigrant. 
 After completing a federally mandated local labor search, Gebbers Farms applied to the federal guest worker program to import about 1,200 legal temporary workers -- most from Mexico. The guest workers, who can stay for up to six months, also included about 300 from Jamaica. 
 ''They are bringing people from outside,'' Ms. Cervantes said, perplexed. ''What will happen to those of us who are already here?'' 
 Immigrant advocates said they are surprised and frustrated with Mr. Obama, after seeing an increase in enforcement activity since he took office. ''It would be easier to fight if it was a big raid,'' said Pramila Jayapal, executive director of OneAmerica, a group in Seattle. ''But this is happening everywhere and often.''

HEADLINE: The Winners And Losers Of 'Decision' Night

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
As an official position, ESPN has only the tiniest problems with its handling of the LeBron James Show.
 ''It was imperfect in different ways,'' said Norby Williamson, an executive vice president of the network.
 Williamson did not sound as if he regretted accepting Jim Gray to interview James. Gray, who acted as the packager of the show, was the James camp's preferred choice to interview James - and took an interminable six minutes to ask James the only question that truly mattered: which team would he sign with?
 ''You do wish it had happened quicker,'' he said, but added that ultimately, ''Your interviewer is in control.'' 
 Williamson defended waiting 22 minutes to get to the Gray-James interview; he said that what looked like a rehash of James chatter from previous hours of coverage - the already-stale, if accurate, report that James was likely headed for Miami - had not been seen by a lot of viewers tuning in at 9 p.m. Eastern time.
 ''Did we do a little more than we needed to?'' he said. ''Yeah, but maybe it's better than short-shrifting.''
 But as a pure ratings exercise, the hour-long program, though widely panned, was a success.
 The 7.3 overnight was nearly four times the rating of the previous all-about-LeBron hour of speculation.The rating got as high as a 9.6 from 9:15 to 9:30, the period when James actually said he was Miami-bound.
 The 7.3 is greater than anything ESPN has carried this year, except for N.F.L. games. More people sat on sofas watching James sit in a chair and talk about a decision than watched his last game in a Cavaliers uniform on May 13 - Cleveland's loss to Boston in Game 6 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. That game had a 7.1 rating.
 Even as Williamson denied any plan to rope in still more viewers by stringing along James's announcement - he entered the gym at the Boys and Girls Club of Greenwich at 8:47 p.m. - the truth is that there had been so much hype for this show that anyone who cared to watch knew it was going to be on at 9 p.m.
 Why would droves of interested viewers tune in at 8 when they knew the real show was from 9 to 10?
 Had Gray asked James the proper journalistic question - ''Where are you going?'' - at 9:03 instead of 9:28, the rating would not have suffered. And if it had, there would have been no downside. ESPN did not guarantee a rating to advertisers, opening the door for them to demand make-good ads if the rating fell short. ESPN donated the ad time so that James & Company could sell it to sponsors; the revenue went to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.
 The winners to emerge from ''The Decision'' include:
 TNT and ESPN/ABC -- The N.B.A.'s networks have a superteam in the Heat to televise; when their schedules come out next month, each will load up on Miami games and fight to carry the first Miami-Cleveland game. True, they will no longer want to show many Cavs games other than that one. Last season, TNT's 1.1 rating for its Heat games matched its season average for all games. ESPN's 1.3 rating for six Heat games was a shade above the overall 1.2. ABC had no Heat games last season, but the Bristol Empire will seek the maximium of six in 2010-11.
 Michael Wilbon, ESPN -- Wilbon conducted a long interview with James following Gray's teaser, and asked nearly every pertinent question. He smart and in command. The Q&A would have been even better had he followed up on why James had not called Cleveland owner Dan Gilbert before the program to say he had chosen Miami, or tweaked him on self-absorbed statements about his importance to Cleveland and his greatness.
 Dan Gilbert, Cavs owner -- His raw, emotional, nasty reaction to seeing James go to Miami was a jarring contrast to owners who communicate in corporatespeak and don't reveal their feelings when wronged. Plus, his anger sets the stage for a revenge-tinged marketing campaign to keep the Quicken Loans Arena full.
 The losers:
 ESPN -- By accepting the James team's offer of an exclusive in exchange for an hour of its time, it generated criticism that it was buying news. It is easy to argue that the value of its donated time equals a payment even if the ad revenue went to charity. ESPN should have rejected what it was being handed and followed the James news aggressively. If an exclusive arose from that, fine. Plus, ESPN now seems to have opened the door to elite athletes' trying to package critical career moves as exclusive TV extravaganzas. Williamson said he can't think of another athlete who would merit such treatment. Better to close that door now, ESPN, and never open it again.
 Jim Gray -- Gray was a hindrance to getting to the night's news. Instead of being as sharp as he was when interviewing Mike Tyson after he bit off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear, he wasted viewers' time. This will now enter the annals of Gray's worst interviews, alongside the one with Pete Rose in 1999, when he incessantly badgered Rose on the field before Game 2 of the World Series about his gambling in baseball after it was clear that Rose was not ready to confess.
 James, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade -- All believe they will win a championship as the stars of the Heat superteam. But all gave an irksome rote answer, ''It's not about the money,'' in describing their decision to unify as the biggest trio since the Pep Boys. In an economy like ours, when you're making $16 million a season, it is unseemly to proclaim purely competitive motivations just because you're not getting the maximum contract.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Make Social Security Pay, Today

BYLINE: By DONALD B. SUSSWEIN. 
Donald B. Susswein is a tax lawyer and former adviser on Social Security for the Senate Finance Committee.

 BODY:
Washington
 WITH the economy once again showing signs of weakness, many of the nation's leading economists and politicians have been calling for another round of stimulus spending. This week President Obama himself said repeatedly that more action is necessary to spur job creation and to help people looking for work. 
 The problem is, few voters trust Washington to pay back their big outlays; even fewer are confident that the same groups who benefit from today's stimulus will bear the costs of tomorrow's austerity. 
 Fortunately, there is a powerful fiscal tool that could address both problems: Congress could grant workers a temporary holiday from the forced savings program known as Social Security. 
 Under Social Security, nearly all workers pay for their own retirement benefits. The amounts withheld from a worker's paycheck, and paid by his employer, are effectively credited to an account established just for that worker. 
 The account is strictly on paper, of course; no actual investment is separately maintained. Even so, the tax payments essentially earn the equivalent of a small amount of interest. They are later converted, through a complex formula that emulates the workings of an individual retirement account, into a stream of retirement benefits. 
 As a result, the more you work and the more you earn in any year (up to an annual limit), the more retirement benefits you accumulate. If you take off four months without pay -- say for maternity leave -- you not only lose your salary for that period, you also reduce the growth of your Social Security pension. 
 To stimulate the economy now with no long-term increase in government debt, Congress should therefore temporarily exempt a portion of wages from the Social Security taxes imposed on workers; at the same time, those exempted wages would not be credited in computing that worker's future retirement benefits.
 For example, a 40-year-old earning $50,000 and paying annual Social Security taxes of about $3,000 could see those taxes cut to about $2,000. The added $1,000 in his paycheck, along with similar amounts for other workers, could be a huge stimulus to the economy.
 In the future, of course, there would be a price to pay: the growth in that worker's retirement benefits would be slightly reduced -- much as if he had taken off four months without pay. 
 But the emphasis should be on ''slightly.'' Because benefits are typically paid over decades, the cost of a temporary $1,000 tax cut would be spread over many years; it could amount to a reduction in annual pension benefits of less than $100. The holiday could even be limited to workers under the age of 55, to allow plenty of time for them to salt away a few extra dollars for retirement once the economy improves.
 Best of all, the costs and benefits would be matched to each worker. Those who get a pickup today would pay it back later on. This way, the Keynesians would get their stimulus, and the deficit hawks could sleep better at night.
 Social Security has been an astounding success in preparing American workers for retirement. But if we need workers to temporarily increase their spending, a holiday from that forced saving can get cash into the economy -- without draining it from the government's coffers.

HEADLINE: With Gloves Off, Obama Stumps for Reid

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- President Obama wrapped up a two-day campaign swing on Friday with a full-throated defense of his economic policies and a warm-hearted embrace for the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, a onetime boxer who is counting on the president to help him fight his way through a tough re-election race.
 ''When he first told me he was a boxer, he said, 'Barack, I wasn't the fastest, I wasn't the hardest-hitting, but I knew how to take a punch,''' Mr. Obama said. ''He knew how to take a punch, and Harry Reid became a pretty good boxer because he would simply outlast his opponents -- he had a stronger will, and I think that tells you something about the kind of person he is.'' 
 Mr. Reid is running for his fifth term, and this was Mr. Obama's second trip to Las Vegas to stump for him this year. Friday's speech at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas was the second side-by-side appearance for the two men this week. On Thursday night, Mr. Obama delivered a fiery endorsement for Mr. Reid at a packed fund-raiser that drew 3,000 people and raised $800,000. 
 There, the president took aim at Mr. Reid's Republican opponent, Sharron Angle, calling her out (though not by name) for referring to the $20 billion fund set aside by BP to reimburse victims of the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico as a slush fund. Earlier on Thursday, Ms. Angle's campaign had issued a statement calling the remark incorrect and saying there was ''some confusion'' about it, but Mr. Obama made clear he was not buying it.
 ''Her campaign puts out a memo saying, 'Well, she didn't mean that,''' he said, a tinge of sarcasm in his voice. ''They say there was some confusion. And I'm sure she meant 'slush fund' in the nicest possible way.''
 The event at the university Friday morning was far more subdued as the president addressed a polite crowd of about 600 business leaders, teacher and students in a clean, well-lighted auditorium. He used the speech to defend what he called ''those tough steps that we took'' -- steps that the administration knows are unpopular, like bailing out banks and auto companies -- and to make the case that his policies are turning the economy around.
 ''The question is, No. 1, 'Are we on the right track?' The answer is yes,'' Mr. Obama said.
 He also called on Congress to add $5 billion to a fund that provides tax credits for clean energy investment. ''My attitude, and Harry's attitude, is if an American company wants to create jobs and grow, we should be there to help them do it,'' Mr. Obama said. He said the tax credits would generate ''nearly 40,000 jobs, and the $12 billion or more in private sector investment it would trigger could create up to 90,000 additional jobs.''
 It was Mr. Obama's second speech in two days on the economy, as he seeks to convince anxious Americans that despite 9.5 percent unemployment, his policies are indeed turning the economy around. White House officials have settled on a catchphrase for Mr. Obama's message: they are casting the election as ''a choice between the economic policies that led us into the mess or the policies that are leading us out of the mess.''

HEADLINE: Film Society of Lincoln Center Replaces Its Director

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
In an apparent shake-up, the Film Society of Lincoln Center on Friday named a new executive director, Rose Kuo, replacing Mara Manus, the former executive director of the Public Theater who had been hired with some fanfare less than two years ago. 
 The society said in a statement that Ms. Manus would continue in a consulting role through July. The organization is in a period of significant growth, planning to open a dual-screen theater next year to go along with the Walter Reade Theater, which it runs.
 Ms. Manus was recruited in 2008 to shepherd the expansion and to enhance the society's profile. A former film studio executive, she had been credited with making the Public Theater financially stable in her six years there, as individual contributions to the organization tripled. The president of the Film Society, Daniel H. Stern, described Ms. Manus's hiring at the time as ''a really phenomenal match.''
 Her tenure at the Film Society, though, was almost immediately marked by discord. In her first year she fired 7 of the 42 employees, and 4 others resigned. Dismissed employees described her management style to the press as brusque and aloof. Meanwhile, suggestions that the society might cut some of the perks that traditionally came with membership drew complaints from members.
 Perhaps most important, fund-raising for the expansion seems to have stalled since Ms. Manus took over, which was just as the financial crisis hit. The society has so far raised $31 million of more than $40 million needed for the expansion. 
 The new center, to be named the Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, after a donor, will include two underground theaters, with 90 and 150 seats, as well as offices, lecture rooms and a restaurant-cafe. It is part of the redevelopment of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts.
 Ann Tenenbaum, the society's chairwoman, said Ms. Manus had ''stewarded us through significant organizational changes during a difficult period for all nonprofit organizations.''
 Ms. Manus did not return a call to her office on Friday.
 Ms. Kuo has a background that is largely in programming. For three years, she was the artistic director of AFI Fest, a film festival in Los Angeles organized by the American Film Institute. She has also been a programming consultant for the Los Angeles Country Museum of Art and for the Santa Barbara, San Francisco and Mill Valley Film Festivals. 
 Most recently, she founded a company, Festworks, which provides consulting to festivals, and she was a director of the Sante Fe Film Festival.
 A spokeswoman for the society, Sarah Rothman, said Ms. Kuo was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
 Richard Pena, the society's program director, said of Ms. Kuo, ''Her allegiance to filmmakers and film audiences is matched by her strong relationships with funders -- a critical attribute in these tough times.''

 BODY:
8 P.M. (TCM) FILMED IN MONUMENT VALLEY A night of movies from out West, all directed by John Ford, begins with ''My Darling Clementine'' (1946), which stars Henry Fonda (above with Cathy Downs) in a retelling of Wyatt Earp's feud with the Clantons after they steal his cattle and kill his brother. In the courtroom drama ''Sergeant Rutledge'' (1960), at 10, a black sergeant (Woody Strode) is accused of raping and killing a white woman. At midnight John Wayne plays a Civil War veteran in search of his niece, who was captured by American Indians, in ''The Searchers'' (1956). At 2:15 a.m. ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon'' (1949) follows a cavalry officer (John Wayne) as he tries to stymie an Indian uprising in the days before his retirement. In ''Stagecoach'' (1939), at 4:15 a.m., Wayne portrays a fugitive who hitches a ride on a stagecoach rambling through perilous Apache territory. 
 10:30 A.M. (13) RELIGION & ETHICS NEWSWEEKLY A profile of Lincoln Electric, an arc-welding manufacturer that has not laid off an employee for economic reasons for 60 years. Also, an interview with the ''Mutts'' cartoonist Patrick McDonnell, and an exploration of the moral implications of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill with Paul Root Wolpe, director of the Emory Center for Ethics at Emory University. 
 NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER'S OPEN MIND Evan Thomas, an editor at large at Newsweek, discusses ''The War Lovers: Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst, and the Rush to Empire, 1898,'' his new book about America's expansionist history.

Brown, former director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite who is the Republican opponent of Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada.
 7 P.M. (WE) YOU'VE GOT MAIL (1998) In this film by Nora Ephron, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play characters who fall in love over e-mail, unaware that they actually know (and dislike) each other professionally. In her review in The New York Times, Janet Maslin said the film was ''an inviting love story that entangles a man, a woman, a couple of computers and a New York neighborhood so picturesquely idealized that it feels like Paris.''
 8 P.M. (CBS) THE BRIDGE This two-hour series premiere follows Frank Leo (Aaron Douglas), a Toronto policeman, as he protests his fellow officers' working conditions by staging a walkout, then finds himself elected the head of the union.
 8 P.M. (Animal Planet) LAST CHANCE HIGHWAY Shelley, Curtis and their son, Cross, spot a starving dog on the side of the road.

To figure it out, the Doctor is forced to pass himself off as a normal human being, and even share a flat with Craig Owens (Mr. Corden).
 11:30 P.M. (IFC) AMERICAN PSYCHO (2000)Christian Bale plays the ax-wielding, self-obsessed power broker of Bret Easton Ellis's novel in this film adaptation directed by Mary Harron. In a review for The New York Times, Stephen Holden praised the film's depiction of the over-the-top consumerism of the prosperous New York of the '80s: ''In draining off the novel's fat, Ms. Harron has strengthened and clarified Mr. Ellis's angry satire of the greed-is-good decade and the confusion between surface and substance in so much of American life.''

HEADLINE: Beauty for the Palate And for the Eyes

BYLINE: By KARLA COOK

 BODY:
DAYS after visiting Uproot, I am thinking of fine things: the Riedel water glasses -- impossibly thin, delicate cylinders that reflect ambient light and make the liquid inside appear all the more desirable; the soaring wall of colored glass that feels churchlike and inspires attention to the meals; and finally, the food on the plates.
 That food is art. Anthony Bucco, whose finely tuned culinary sense worked wonders at both Stage Left and Catherine Lombardi in New Brunswick, daringly nudges central New Jersey along the path to high-tech, locally sourced, seasonal cuisine at Uproot in Warren. It's a kick. 
 Consider, for instance, the compressed mango that is part of a first course of house-cured organic salmon, bitter chocolate, pickled watermelon radish and kaffir lime salt. It had vivid hues and intense flavor, but a denser texture than the raw fruit. The mango had been prepared sous vide, the server said, meaning vacuum sealed.
 Or consider the simple, elegant first course of low-tech ricotta agnolotti, with its profusion of spring greens -- English peas and stray tendrils, fava and wax beans. Or a luscious side of poached veal marrowbone, split horizontally.
 Then there was the first course of stunningly green asparagus from Sheppard Farms in Cedarville, paired with prosciutto and a battered and deep-fried egg. It was audaciously simple, yet greater than the sum of its parts. And the sleeper hit -- a perfectly portioned and satisfying main dish of pan-roasted red snapper with sticky rice and baby bok choy in a ginger broth -- also approached perfection.
 I cannot neglect the mostly goat, completely delicious cheese plate, with offerings that had names including Up in Smoke (from Rivers Edge Chevre in Oregon) and Truffle Tremor (from Cypress Grove Chevre in California).
 This beautiful food is simultaneously grounding and exhilarating, even if the results are sometimes uneven at the seven-month-old restaurant, owned by Andrew and Catherine Farro. (Their son, Mark, a 2005 graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, is sous-chef.) It is in an upscale village-style shopping plaza, a rather soulless place that offers no clue to the soul inside.
 When food is this ambitious, even small flaws stand out. The bitter chocolate in the salmon dish, for example, was too sweet (though that minor lapse pointed up the citrus undertones of the kaffir lime salt). Likewise, an appetizer of sweet and succulent pan-roasted day boat scallops swam in a too-deep portion of pureed peas.
 Mr. Bucco's cool molded foie gras, a first course, skated a smidgen too close to dessert, with its sly play on P.B.& J. -- hazelnut butter, elderflower meringue and fried brioche and not quite enough of the sous-vide rhubarb cooked with orange zest and juice served alongside. And warm chewy-crusted rolls were better without the butter, which was shot through with honey and sea salt.
 Main courses were beautiful and delicious: meaty pan-roasted day boat halibut with celeriac, asparagus and mushroom butter; a washboard slab of slightly too salty pan-seared skate wing with artichoke, cauliflower and mousseron mushrooms; roasted Long Island duck with house-made duck sausage and charred Treviso radicchio; bacon-wrapped pan-roasted pork tenderloin with Niman Ranch pork belly and a tiny terrine of macaroni and cheese; and the most delicate, most refined version of comfort food -- a roasted, sliced sous vide/pan-finished chicken breast with a smattering of roasted vegetables, all drizzled with a tarragon jus at the table.
 As for sweets, the light banana tempura and the pineapple cheesecake were in keeping with the calibrated balance of Uproot, but best and most decadent were the house-made ice creams and sorbets. The chocolate and the pistachio leave you wanting more. Such excellence, especially in this economy, is something to celebrate and nurture.

 BODY:
AS the world economy struggles to recover from its various ailments, the international financial order is coming under increased scrutiny. Currencies and exchange rates, in particular, are getting a hard look. 
 Various pundits and politicians, including President Obama himself, have complained that the Chinese renminbi is undervalued and impeding a global recovery. The problems in Greece have caused many people to wonder whether the euro is a failed experiment and whether Europe's nations would have been better off maintaining their own currencies.
 In thinking about these issues, the place to start is what economists call the fundamental trilemma of international finance. Yes, trilemma really is a word. It has been a term of art for logicians since the 17th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, and it describes a situation in which someone faces a choice among three options, each of which comes with some inevitable problems. 
 What is the trilemma in international finance? It stems from the fact that, in most nations, economic policy makers would like to achieve these three goals: 
 Make the country's economy open to international flows of capital. Capital mobility lets a nation's citizens diversify their holdings by investing abroad. It also encourages foreign investors to bring their resources and expertise into the country. 
 Use monetary policy as a tool to help stabilize the economy. The central bank can then increase the money supply and reduce interest rates when the economy is depressed, and reduce money growth and raise interest rates when it is overheated.
 Maintain stability in the currency exchange rate. A volatile exchange rate, at times driven by speculation, can be a source of broader economic volatility. Moreover, a stable rate makes it easier for households and businesses to engage in the world economy and plan for the future. 
 But here's the rub: You can't get all three. If you pick two of these goals, the inexorable logic of economics forces you to forgo the third. 
 In the United States, we have picked the first two. Any American can easily invest abroad, simply by sending cash to an international mutual fund, and foreigners are free to buy stocks and bonds on domestic exchanges. Moreover, the Federal Reserve sets monetary policy to try to maintain full employment and price stability. But a result of this decision is volatility in the value of the dollar in foreign exchange markets. 
 By contrast, China has chosen a different response to the trilemma. Its central bank conducts monetary policy and maintains tight control over the exchange value of its currency. But to accomplish these two goals, it has to restrict the international flow of capital, including the ability of Chinese citizens to move their wealth abroad. Without such restrictions, money would flow into and out of the country, forcing the domestic interest rate to match those set by foreign central banks.
 Most of Europe's nations have chosen the third way. By using the euro to replace the French franc, the German mark, the Italian lira, the Greek drachma and other currencies, these countries have eliminated all exchange-rate movements within their zone. In addition, capital is free to move among nations. Yet the cost of making these choices has been to give up the possibility of national monetary policy. 
 The European Central Bank sets interest rates for Europe as a whole. But if the situation in one country -- Greece, for example -- differs from that in the rest of Europe, that country no longer has its own monetary policy to address national problems.
 Is there a best way to deal with this trilemma? Perhaps not surprisingly, many American economists argue for the American system of floating exchange rates determined by market forces. This preference underlies much of the criticism of China's financial policy. It also led to skepticism when Europe started down the path toward a common currency in the early 1990s. Today, those euro skeptics feel vindicated by the problems in Greece.
 But economists should be cautious when recommending exchange-rate policy, because it is far from obvious what is best. In fact, Americans' embrace of floating exchange rates is relatively recent. From World War II to the early 1970s, the United States participated in the Bretton Woods system, which fixed exchange rates among the major currencies. Moreover, in 1998, as much of Asia was engulfed in a financial crisis, Robert E. Rubin, then the Treasury secretary, praised China's exchange-rate policy as an ''island of stability'' in a turbulent world.
 Even the euro experiment is based in part on an American model. Anyone taking a trip across the United States doesn't need to change money with every crossing of a state border. A common currency among the 50 states has served Americans well. Europeans were aspiring for similar benefits.
 TO be sure, Europe is different from the United States, which has a large central government that can redistribute resources among regions as needed. More important, our common language and heritage allow labor to move freely among regions in a way that will always be harder in Europe. The United States of Europe may have been too much to hope for.
 Without doubt, the world financial system presents policy makers with difficult tradeoffs. Americans shouldn't be too harsh when other nations facing the trilemma reach conclusions different from ours. In this area of economic policy, as well as many others, there is room for reasonable nations to disagree.

HEADLINE: Arid Australia Sips Seawater, But the Drink May Be Costly

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
BRISBANE, Australia -- In Australia, the world's driest inhabited continent, early British explorers searching for a source of drinking water scoured the bone-dry interior for a fabled inland sea. One overeager believer even carted a whaleboat hundreds of miles from the coast, but found mostly desert inside. Today, Australians are turning in the opposite direction: the sea.
 In one of the country's biggest infrastructure projects in its history, Australia's five largest cities are spending $13.2 billion on desalination plants capable of sucking millions of gallons of seawater from the surrounding oceans every day, removing the salt and yielding potable water. In two years, when the last plant is scheduled to be up and running, Australia's major cities will draw up to 30 percent of their water from the sea.
 The country is still recovering from its worst drought ever, a decade-long parching that the government says was deepened by climate change. With water shortages looming, other countries, including the United States and China, are also looking to the sea. 
 ''We consider ourselves the canary in the coal mine for climate change-induced changes to water supply systems,'' said Ross Young, executive director of the Water Services Association of Australia, an umbrella group of the country's urban water utilities. He described the $13.2 billion as ''the cost of adapting to climate change.'' 
 But desalination is also drawing fierce criticism and civic protests. Many homeowners, angry about rising water bills, and environmentalists, wary of the plants' effect on the climate, call the projects energy-hungry white elephants. Stricter conservation measures, like mandating more efficient washing machines, would easily wring more water from existing supplies, critics say.
 Desalination has also helped dampen the enthusiasm for a ''big Australia,'' the previous, immigration-friendly government's projection that the country's population will rise to 36 million in 2050, from 22 million now.
 ''Big waste of money,'' said Helen Meyer, 65, a retired midwife in Tugun, the town where the northeastern state of Queensland opened a $1 billion desalination plant last year. ''It cost a lot of money to build, and it uses a lot of power. Australia is a dry country. I think we just have enough water for 22 million people. What are we going to do when we're up to 36 million?''
 The plant, sprawling across 15 acres next to an airport and near residential neighborhoods, provides water to Brisbane, the capital of Queensland, and other areas of southeastern Queensland, the nation's fastest-growing region. Despite technical problems that temporarily shut down the plant recently, it has been supplying 6 percent of the region's water needs and has the capacity to deliver 20 percent, said Barry Dennien, chief executive of the SEQ Water Grid Manager, the utility that oversees this region's water supply.
 The drought in this region lasted from 2000 to 2009, as the reservoir behind the largest dam, Wivenhoe, dropped to only 16 percent of capacity at one point. (On a recent visit, it was at 98 percent.) While it took the state authorities until 2005 to grasp the magnitude of the crisis, Mr. Dennien said, they moved quickly after that.
 Besides restricting water use and subsidizing the purchase of home water tanks to capture rainwater, the state spent nearly $8 billion to create the country's most sophisticated water supply network. It fashioned dams and a web of pipelines to connect 18 independent water utilities in a single grid. To ''drought proof'' the region, it built facilities for manufacturing water, by recycling wastewater, to use for industrial purposes, and by desalinating seawater. Production of desalinated water can be adjusted according to rain levels.
 ''When the last of the assets were coming online, it rained, as it always does,'' Mr. Dennien said, adding that the region now has enough water for the next 20 years.
 ''We've got a method of operating the grid that the next time any sign of drought occurs, we can just,'' he snapped his fingers, ''build something else or turn something else on, and we've got enough water supply.''
 Other cities are making the same bet. Perth, which opened the nation's first desalination plant in 2006, is building a second one. Sydney's plant started operating early this year, and plants near Melbourne and Adelaide are under construction.
 Until a few years ago, most of the world's large-scale desalination plants were in the Middle East, particularly in Saudi Arabia, though water scarcity is changing that. In the United States, where only one major plant is running, in Tampa Bay, officials are moving forward on proposed facilities in California and Texas, said Tom Pankratz, a director of the International Desalination Association, based in Topsfield, Mass. China, which recently opened its biggest desalination plant, in Tianjin, could eventually overtake Saudi Arabia as the world leader, he said.
 Many environmentalists and economists oppose any further expansion of desalination because of its price and contribution to global warming. The power needed to remove the salt from seawater accounts for up to 50 percent of the cost of desalination, and Australia relies on coal, a major emitter of greenhouse gases, to generate most of its electricity.
 Critics say desalination will add to the very climate change that is aggravating the country's water shortage. To make desalination politically palatable, Australia's plants are using power from newly built wind farms or higher-priced energy classified as clean. For households in cities with the new plants, water bills are expected to double over the next four years, according to the Water Services Association.
 But critics say there are cheaper alternatives. They advocate conservation measures, as well as better management of groundwater reserves and water catchments. ''Almost every city which has implemented a desalination plant has nowhere near maxed out or used up their conservation potential,'' said Stuart White, director of the Institute for Sustainable Futures at the University of Technology, Sydney. Even without restrictions, cities could easily save 20 percent of their water, Mr. White said.
 He said cities should practice ''desalination readiness'' by drawing plans to build a plant, but should carry them out only as a last resort in the event of a severe drought.
 Mr. Young of the Water Services Association said desalination in Australia costs $1.75 to $2 per cubic meter, including the costs of construction, clean energy and production. The prices are probably the world's highest, said Mr. Pankratz of the International Desalination Association, adding that desalination was cheaper in countries with less strict environmental standards. He said the cost at a typical new plant in the world today would be about $1 per cubic meter.
 Opponents of desalination say that a cheaper and environmentally friendlier alternative is recycling wastewater, though persuading people to drink it remains difficult and politically delicate. The SEQ Water Grid Manager, for instance, retreated from its initial plan to introduce recycled wastewater into its drinking reservoirs after it began raining.
 ''There's a stigma against recycled water,'' said David Mason, 40, a resident of Tugun. 
 ''But since there's only so much water in the world, and it's been through somebody's body or some other place over the past 250 million years, maybe it's not that bad. At least, it might be better than desalination.''

HEADLINE: The March of the Conversions

BYLINE: By HILARY STOUT

 BODY:
IN the hierarchy of tradeoffs that a Manhattan apartment buyer inevitably has to make, one in particular has reigned supreme: if you wanted prewar charm you were probably going to end up in a co-op.
 Although that is still the case, things are changing. Over the past decade or so, conversion to condominiums has become the preferred path for developers seeking to shift a rental building over to ownership.
 At this moment, a number of interesting and distinctive prewar buildings are being converted to condos. From 36 Gramercy Park East, a gargoyle-studded apartment house fronting a storied private park, to Devonshire House, an Emery Roth building in Greenwich Village, conversions are presenting buyers with a chance to escape the scrutiny of co-op boards while acquiring some modern conveniences along with that coveted old-fashioned detail (converted buildings usually go through extensive renovations). 
 Among the most elaborate conversion projects is the Apthorp, a massive limestone wedding cake that takes up a city block from Broadway to West End Avenue, between 78th and 79th Streets. This conversion has been troubled from the start, crippled by feuding partners, a feisty tenants association and the sinking economy. But in May, after three years of setbacks, the New York attorney general approved the conversion plans for the 102-year-old building, and cleared the way for closings to begin.
 Brokers say there is no question that most buyers prefer condos. The simple reason is that condos generally allow owners to do what they want with their apartments. Co-ops have far more rules and regulations. For example, many co-ops have strict limits on how long and how often shareholders can rent out their units -- if at all -- whereas condos have traditionally allowed long-term rentals or even investor-owned units.
 Of course, some buyers appreciate the control wielded by a co-op board over who lives in the building, as well as the fact that it can sanction or reprimand shareholders who have barking dogs, shrieking children or a tendency to give loud parties.
 However, as a result of the greater flexibility, and the fact that a board won't be sitting in judgment on the finances and character of prospective buyers, the resale value of a condo is perceived as greater. Buyers pay a premium for that -- about 10 percent to 20 percent more than for a similar co-op, brokers say.
 But while almost all new nonrental residential construction in the city has been condo for a couple of decades, the supply of prewar buildings remains overwhelmingly co-op. Iva Spitzer, an executive vice president of the Corcoran Group, estimates that about 13 percent of the residential buildings built before 1942 are condos, and the vast majority of the rest are co-ops. (She is currently working on six prewar condo conversions.)
 When Howard and Gayle Rothman decided to move to Manhattan from Stamford, Conn., last fall, they wanted a condo but figured they would eventually land in a co-op. Their wish list was specific and seemingly unattainable.
 To start with, Mr. Rothman said, they envisioned a place in ''a grand prewar building, not a run-of-the-mill one.'' Their hoped-for lobby and infrastructure would be newly updated; no window air-conditioning units for them. The building would be in a sought-after location, central Greenwich Village. Tall orders for a condo.
 ''When you look at all those variables, your possibilities are slim,'' acknowledged Mr. Rothman, who is in the commodities futures business. He expected that they would be apartment-hunting for several years.
 The search took only a few months. To their surprise, the Rothmans found a beautifully renovated three-bedroom apartment with 10-foot ceilings and large old-style windows in a condo, the 1928 Devonshire House at 28 East 10th Street. (The price: $3.475 million.)
 ''I just think that to have a condo, it has a greater appeal to more potential buyers,'' said Mr. Rothman.
 The conversion of Devonshire House began with its purchase by a developer in 2007, when the New York real estate market looked far brighter than it does today. As the economic climate worsened, the developers began to worry about their unfortunate timing.
 ''You think we weren't having heart attacks?'' said Susan Hewitt, the president of the Cheshire Group, a partner in the development team Devonshire Associates, which is sponsoring the condo. The team made what she called a ''scary'' decision to undertake a high-end renovation, not only upgrading the plumbing and electrical systems, but also redoing all the floors and putting in central air-conditioning, radiant-heat bathroom floors, millwork underneath the windows and detailed molding.
 ''As the market deteriorated,'' Ms. Hewitt said, ''we thought we'd be in the best position by selling the best possible product.''
 When the Devonshire House apartments finally went on the market last September -- at prices of $1.125 million to $5.2 million -- they sold fast, to the relief of the sponsors. Today, all of the available apartments are sold except the penthouse, Ms. Hewitt said.
 ''We hope to get more inventory in the fall,'' she added. That's because about half of the building's 100 tenants were in rent-stabilized or rent-controlled apartments, and thus had the legal right to remain renters if they chose not to buy their apartments. Ten of those renters have decided to take advantage of a 35 percent insider discount. The others remain renters, but the sponsor will try to buy some of them out.
 For a conversion to be approved, typically only 15 percent of a building's apartments have to be sold. While regulated renters get to stay put, market-rate renters are often nudged out of the building. Usually either their leases aren't renewed or the sponsor offers them money to leave before the lease comes due.
 At 845 West End Avenue, a classic Upper West Side prewar building with sprawling two-, three- and four-bedroom apartments, half of the tenants are rent-regulated. The attorney general recently approved the conversion, so the apartments have been on the market for three weeks. The rent-regulated tenants are in the midst of a 90-day ''exclusive period'' during which they are given the opportunity to buy at an insider's discount. Because of that delicate timing, Ms. Spitzer of Corcoran said she could not discuss the discount they were being offered.
 Meanwhile, 10 apartments at 845 West End are on the market, with prices ranging from $1.8 million to $3.665 million. Ms. Spitzer says she expects that eventually half of the building's 91 units will be for sale.
 As with Devonshire House, the building has been fully renovated with top-notch appliances and features, including marble bathrooms, granite kitchen countertops, radiant-heat floors, central air-conditioning and walk-in closets.
 A number of Upper West Side prewar buildings have gone through conversions in the past few years, including 610 West 110th Street, 220 West 93rd Street, and (currently) 314 West 100th Street.
 But in some neighborhoods prewar condo conversions are still rare. Among them is Gramercy Park, where 36 Gramercy Park East, a 1910 building with keys to the park, is a striking white Gothic exception. Everyone there, even market-rate tenants, has been offered an insider price.
 ''People are scraping together whatever they can,'' said Eddie Shapiro, the president of Nest Seekers International, the exclusive marketing agent for the building. ''We believe this building will have a higher percentage of inside purchasers than any conversion in recent years.'' He declined to disclose the amount of the insider discount.
 But though getting in on a condo conversion may seem like real estate nirvana, there are a few things that buyers should remember. For instance, condo rules are becoming more strict. ''It's not quite as carefree as it used to be,'' Ms. Spitzer of Corcoran said.
 ''Now condos are saying you maybe need to have your renter qualify before you can rent,'' she said, referring to approval by the condo board. ''And there may be limitations on the number of years you can rent. But in general, it's a freer situation.''
 And as with any purchase, you should also look at the building itself.
 ''You have to do your research,'' Scott Klein, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, said. The apartments may look beautiful, but what about the building's roof? And has the sponsor set aside a reserve fund for repairs?
 It is also essential to know how many renters a building has. Banks are more cautious about financing apartments in renter-heavy buildings, Mr. Klein said. That could present problems for resale or refinancing.
 And because conversions often have bargain-rent tenants living alongside multimillion-dollar buyers, ill will can spring up on both sides. Renters may feel like second-class citizens and resent the change to condo, whereas buyers may believe that their property values are affected by tenant-occupied units.
 ''There are some great tenants,'' Mr. Klein said, ''but the relationship to a property is different for a tenant than an owner.''
 The rules governing pre- and postwar condos tend to be similar. But some buyers believe that postwar buildings are better investments because they typically have more -- and nicer -- amenities, like health clubs, swimming pools and elaborate children's playrooms. Some brokers disagree, arguing that a prewar conversion often has more character.
 ''Postwar typically has more amenity space,'' Ms. Spitzer said, ''and if you're a view person you may want to go postwar because there are higher floors. But I think the opportunities are more unique in the prewar buildings.''
 Describing the extensive renovations that go into conversions, she said, ''When you buy into a prewar that is converting when you purchase, everything good is happening to this building.''

HEADLINE: Our Life, Between Sea and Oil

BYLINE: By MARTHA SERPAS. 
Martha Serpas is the author of the poetry collections ''Cote Blanche'' and ''The Dirty Side of the Storm.''

 BODY:
I WAS born and raised on Bayou Lafourche, 30 miles from Grand Isle, which is Louisiana's only inhabited barrier island and also the setting of Kate Chopin's 19th-century novel of maternal disorientation, ''The Awakening.'' But ''Frankenstein'' offers the more appropriate narrative lesson for the Deepwater Horizon disaster. Mary Shelley begins her story with the anti-hero Victor Frankenstein declaring his admiration for scientists who ''penetrate into the recesses of nature.'' Full of hubris, he ''pursued nature to her hiding places,'' bringing horror upon his family and community. He has no foresight, only the belief that ''maternal nature'' can be manipulated by unvetted technology. 
 Today, we are both the victims of such shortsighted overreach and culpable for its grim results. Despite our long experience with the delta's powerful waters, we misplaced our confidence in yet another industry claiming dominance over the Mississippi and the Gulf of Mexico. 
 Grand Isle suffered some of the earliest damage from the disaster. The oil moved slower than a hurricane, but granted less opportunity for experienced preparation. It moved faster than coastal erosion, which takes a football field of land every 45 minutes or 25 square miles a year. Bayou Lafourche, a major Cajun settlement, was once an important tributary of the Mississippi, but was cut off from the river by a dam in the early 20th century, depriving the vital wetlands of nourishment. What with nitrates flowing down the Mississippi, the leveeing of New Orleans and dredging by the oil and gas industry, my home, even if it escapes the crude, will sink into the gulf. 
 The Cajuns who live on Bayou Lafourche and elsewhere on the gulf have long exhibited resilience in the face of natural and manmade disasters. This fortitude is a legacy from their ancestors the Acadians, who survived persecution, banishment and years of deadly storms. 
 ''Acadian'' and ''Cajun'' are often used interchangeably, somewhat incorrectly. The Acadians were the 18th-century French Catholic settlers in Canada who named their colony La Cadie, after the Micmac word for ''land of plenty,'' and were expelled by the British in the Grand Derangement of 1755. They migrated primarily to Louisiana with the aid of Spanish land grants, and to Bayou Lafourche in particular after 1785. Their direct descendants are counted among Louisiana's Cajuns, but the community includes everyone who has assimilated the Acadian lifestyle -- an original cuisine, architecture, music, dance, language and religion, Cajun Catholicism. This amalgam includes descendants of Germans, Italians, Irish and other immigrants, as well as Native Americans and Africans. 
 Cajun culture embraces this diversity. Okra, introduced by West Africans, was added to gumbo. Statues of two Italian saints, Lucy (patron saint of Syracuse, in Sicily), and Valerie (protector against hurricanes), stand with France's Joan of Arc in Thibodaux's St. Joseph Co-Cathedral. Names like Anselmi, Allemand and Rebstock are considered as Cajun as Cheramie and Guidry.
 Many extended Cajun families, three or four generations, live in clusters of houses down the same lane. A third cousin might as well be a sister, and family extends to godparents -- marraines and parrains. 
 My family is Sicilian, German and Spanish, and for generations my relatives have taught, kept books, sold groceries, worked on boats and hunted and fished on the bayous. On Fridays in Lent, we went to crayfish boils. There is no better food anywhere than the boiled seafood and seasoned stews of true Cajun cooking. (I never ate anything blackened until I visited New York.) My English is inflected with Cajun French and odd French translations: I ''caught'' the bridge; I'll ''get down'' with you at the store; did the mail ''pass''? And the compliment often given subjects of photographs: ''Mais, you stayed so good!'' 
 The very elements of Cajun culture that distinguish it from a materialistic lifestyle -- an emphasis on living in the moment, independence, self-sufficiency and generous hospitality -- can often work against the people's best interests. The Cajun perspective is present tense; people come over and plans are put aside. Meetings are often scheduled as ''just come by.'' The drawback of such a view is that it's hard to raise concerns about future dangers like coastal erosion, or prioritize the risks of deepwater oil and gas drilling when those turn into today's paychecks. One of my friends, Trey, a diesel mechanic, says, ''People'll care when their feet get wet.'' 
 DOWN the bayou, pontoon and lift bridges act as major intersections. Boat traffic -- tug boats, barges and crew boats -- have the right of way. Ever since the first offshore well was drilled in the 1940s, the oil industry has had the right of way in Louisiana, dredging canals through the trembling prairie, spilling oil into the gulf and taking most of the profits out of state.
 On the other hand, the industry also employs hundreds of thousands; provides tax revenue for schools, levees and roads; contributes millions to ecological and cultural projects; and helps meet the country's voracious energy needs. If you are warm or cool, ride in a car or own something plastic, you've probably consumed something that passed through Louisiana's Port Fourchon, which supports 90 percent of deepwater rigs and 45 percent of shallow water rigs in the gulf.
 Unfortunately, the ledger doesn't balance. Trey says: ''I can see if we made a deal with the devil for our land. But show me the money!'' The formula for Louisiana's share of oil revenues is complicated, but our share is considerably less than that of other states. 
 In the late 1940s, coastal states argued with the federal government over their ''seaward boundaries'' -- the line inside of which states could claim 100 percent of oil and gas tax revenues. Earl Long's special assistant attorney general, Leander Perez, brokered a shortsighted deal with the Truman administration. He gave up any revenue from drilling beyond three miles in hopes that he would be able to push for a 100 percent share of a larger area of water. He believed oil production would never be profitable, or even possible, so far offshore, and his later legislative attempts to establish a three-league seaward boundary for Louisiana failed. While many other states get 50 percent of their oil revenue, Louisiana kept none generated outside six miles until a 2006 Congressional bill increased Louisiana's take to 37.5 percent on new leases with a larger overall share coming by 2017. 
 That is to say, we Louisianans have not always acted in our best interests. A ''doing something is better than doing nothing'' attitude (and hopes of national photo-ops) have some politicians calling for barriers made of sand berms and rock jetties, against the better judgment of many gulf coast scientists. Dredging sand from fragile barrier islands will take many months, and the berms may wash away in a single storm. Interrupting tidal flows with rock jetties could hurt marine and marsh life. 
 At the same time, most people down the bayou denounced the Obama administration's efforts to impose a drilling moratorium, which shut down 33 rigs, laid off many workers and cut the business of support industries. ''Don't further threaten our way of life while we have to deal with this mess,'' the message is. 
 One can understand the frustration. In the 1970s, companies were told to drill as much as possible, in the '80s, don't drill -- and so on. Hard work on the water is a core part of Cajun identity. In ''The BP Blues,'' a member of the Dirty Cajuns sings from an oil rig worker's point of view: ''I was stuck out here for seven more, watching everything turn black offshore. ...Tell the banker I don't want a loan. Send the lawyers back to where they from. ... Eleven of us lost our lives, just so you could get to work on time.'' 
 While much of the country bemoans the entire offshore project, local outrage is focused on BP's incompetence specifically and on the moratorium. Those who work in energy production in the gulf know that the sudden shift in economic and environmental balance must be accomplished slowly and with great care. 
 I once went canoeing down Bayou Lafourche with two filmmakers and Kerry St. Pe, an expert on coastal erosion. As we paddled between cypresses, mirliton vines, kingfishers, heron and a few of the estuary's other 735 species, Mr. St. Pe explained his hope for controlled Mississippi flow diversion and a pipeline sediment plan to rebuild lost land. ''No one can live here without the wetlands,'' he said. But he leveled no blame against the oil industry for the rapid erosion. That said to me, ''No one can live here without oil jobs either.'' 
 DOWN the bayou we are used to dealing with sudden adversity. We calibrate history by big hurricanes: Hilda, Audrey, Betsy, Camille. And the Great October Storm of 1893 that sent the survivors from Cheniere Caminada (between Fourchon and Grand Isle) migrating up the bayou, their numbers diminished by some 800. That painful loss was not enough to drive them far. Only five houses remained standing, and women, it is said, were saved from drowning when their long hair tangled in tree limbs. 
 My mother was pregnant with me when Hurricane Betsy hit Grand Isle in 1965. My family huddled in the hallway of my grandmother's house in Thibodaux, where they'd evacuated. My father and aunt went outside during the eye and cleared storm drains, my father staying out longer than anyone else thought wise. The house did not flood. No one had to escape to the roof. However, by a conservative estimate, there were over 1,000 square miles more of wetlands to absorb the surge in 1965 than there are now. Long before the storm I didn't mention, Hurricane Katrina, Lake Pontchartrain poured into the Ninth Ward. Lyndon Johnson showed up the next day, and Betsy is now retired as a storm name, too painful to be recycled. 
 Perhaps this in utero experience of Hurricane Betsy helps explain my Gulf Coast obsession. The marshes are sacred to me -- an interstice of what is life-giving and what brings death. They embody how fluid those distinctions can be. As a child, I remember going crabbing with my family at the end of summer and wearing the year's worn-out Keds to protect my feet from the sticky tar balls from oil spills. None of us thought too much about this. It was an accepted part of the beach, like thunderstorms. 
 I learned to scuba dive under oil platforms, artificial reefs supporting grouper, amberjack, lookdowns, tarpon, spadefish and barracuda. Often I'd dive down through the calm water's blue, light-streaked strata, and resurface in four-foot chop 20 minutes later. The gulf can turn even an intrusive structure into a powerful matrix of new life, and can also turn suddenly destructive. 
 When tankers sunk in the gulf during World War II and coated Grand Isle in oil, waves eventually washed the beaches clean. The gulf again will have to clean up and restore life as we, like Victor Frankenstein, have proved ourselves inadequate to the task. But we may not be around this time to see what that new life will look like. And in the meantime we should not exploit or even take for granted the gulf's restorative nature.
 The Louisiana flag features a Christian image called ''the pelican in her piety,'' plucking flesh from her own breast to feed her young. Some flags show three drops of blood near her beak. A few years ago, the Louisiana Legislature decreed all official flags must feature these marks of self-immolation. It's a destructive message in our context. Ecological self-sacrifice is not pious; cultural self-destruction is not our duty. 
 Neither should progress depend on the exploitation of others. What we can do is work with nature to rebuild some of the wetlands. We must treat with respect those who have labored to meet our country's demands for oil. That would call for humility before powers greater than ourselves and a more forward-thinking stewardship of the gulf region and the inextricable Cajun culture it nurtures.

HEADLINE: Celebrating South Africa and a Job Done Well

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Sandton, South Africa
 It is not every World Cup that ends with the chief executive quoting a poet. But then again, this has not been the normal World Cup. 
 On Saturday, a day before Spain and the Netherlands, two nations that have never won the World Cup, were to meet in the final, Danny Jordaan spoke of South Africa as the first African nation to hold the earth's most important sports event.
 His homeland has a word, Ubuntu, that means we are all interconnected, said Jordaan, who grew up under segregation, as a man of mixed ancestry. 
 This South African concept reminded Jordaan of Donne's Meditation XVII, which includes the words ''No man is an island.'' 
 For all the crassness of any World Cup, despite the private jets hogging the tarmac in Durban, keeping scheduled flights from touching down for the semifinal, there has been another side, dare we say idealistic, to this World Cup. 
 It was always meant as an instrument of ''nation-building, social cohesion,'' Jordaan said at a news conference in this gilded business enclave outside Johannesburg. Jordaan, who is of mixed Dutch and Khoi ancestry, was reminding everybody that the Nelson Mandela legacy had been present, although the 91-year-old patriarch had not.
 Africans ran the computers. Africans provided the security. Africans built the new stadiums. A woman operated a crane, Jordaan noted. He estimated that only one million of the 49 million citizens were able to attend matches, because of the scarcity and cost of the tickets. But as the host team, Bafana Bafana, was eliminated, he said that South Africans of all colors morphed into rooting for Ghana (against the United States) while others rooted for Brazil (who doesn't love Brazil?), and in the semifinals chose from among Uruguay or Germany or Spain or the Netherlands. They were fans. They could choose, just as they could walk into a shop or restaurant or polling place, which they could not do when he was young.
 Jordaan, 58, is an admirer of Mandela. He did not do time on Robben Island but did do time, of sorts. The first time he voted, Jordaan told me in 2008 in New York, he was elected to Parliament. Cool.
 He flicked away skepticism about the cost of the World Cup, whatever it is, but as he rushed to the plane that would take him to the third-place match in Port Elizabeth, he volunteered: ''There will be a huge post-World Cup blues on Monday. I hope they go to work.''
 If they have jobs. Unemployment is said to be 25 percent in this country. Many of the helpful and hopeful young people who got things right around stadiums in the past month told me they had no jobs when this was over. There is no evidence that World Cups and Olympic Games leave any legacy of jobs and stability, but Jordaan's premise is that people know South Africa better, as a place of business and pleasure and culture.
 Jordaan has heard it all in recent years, from grumps like me who asked him if the news media buses would run on time. On Saturday, he said, ''I would tell people, 'Just stay in your room and sulk.' '' 
 He has lived with speculation that South Africa would never get to hold these games because it could not build stadiums or sell tickets. The head of FIFA, Merry King Sepp Blatter, once blurted that he had backup nations, just in case. Recently, Jordaan told 702 Talk Radio in Sandton: ''We're moving to that stage of the tournament when teams begin to go home. But the first team to go home was team Plan B. They're not even here.''
 The British news media predicted mugging epidemics and forecast earthquakes in stable regions. Jordaan recently told The Mirror of England: ''I knew the critics had given up when stories started appearing that we had dangerous snakes in South Africa and that that could be a threat to the competition. People were saying they were so dangerous that one snake could kill off two teams. If that was all they had left to aim at us, I considered that to be them throwing in the towel.'' 
 South Africa has held the 1995 Rugby World Cup, when the host Springboks won and Mandela put on the green shirt. South Africa was also a co-host of the 2003 Cricket World Cup. But there is always the need to keep proving itself. 
 Yes, it is impossible to miss the heavy security that does, to a degree, turn every lovely suburban home into an island. At this stage, that is an economic problem more than a racial problem. But walking around Durban and Johannesburg, I realized how complex and evolving South Africa is. 
 ''People don't want to trust Africa,'' Blatter said two years ago. ''That is wrong. Africa has given so much not only to football but to the whole world. Someday, something should come back. So let's have this World Cup. Let's celebrate Africa. Why not?''
 Blatter has said some loopy things in his time, but he followed through on his talk about the ''moral responsibility'' to hold a World Cup in South Africa. Blatter did not quote John Donne, but Danny Jordaan did. In a World Cup of firsts, that seemed only right.

HEADLINE: Bank Bailout Is Potent Issue For Fall Races

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The vote in 2008 to bail out Wall Street was framed as the only way to avert an economic meltdown and relieve financial institutions of their most poisonous holdings. For many members of Congress, it turns out that the vote itself was toxic. 
 Nearly two years after Congress approved the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Bush administration's $700 billion program to rescue the banking system at a moment when it appeared close to collapse, lawmakers from both parties who backed it remain haunted by the vote. 
 Republicans for months predicted that a backlash against the Democrats' big health care law would be the defining issue in this year's Congressional campaigns. But the bipartisan TARP vote has become a more resonant issue in a year when anti-incumbent, anti-Washington sentiment is running strong. 
 Democrats who voted for the bailout -- which was championed by their own leaders along with President George W. Bush and Senator John McCain of Arizona, then the Republican presidential nominee -- are now facing attacks from Republican challengers on the campaign trail. Republicans who voted for it are being accused of promoting big government and fiscal irresponsibility by Tea Party candidates and other conservatives. 
 Emotions can run high over the subject. Lawmakers report being buttonholed over bailouts by confrontational constituents, and Senator Robert F. Bennett, Republican of Utah, was jeered at a party convention by people chanting ''TARP, TARP, TARP.'' 
 ''It became a litmus test of fidelity to free enterprise principles,'' said Representative Bob Inglis, a South Carolina Republican who was crushed in a primary last month partly because of his vote in favor of the plan. 
 While banks have paid back most of the money, and the bailout is widely credited with having helped to prevent a financial calamity, support for it has become among the biggest issues in the 2010 midterm elections, a powerful if simplistic way to attack what some see as government excess, misplaced priorities and a loss of trust between voters and elected officials.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, is facing a Democratic challenger who is trying to link Mr. Grassley's vote for the bailout to a pattern of support for bigger budget deficits. Senator Arlen Specter's support for the plan was one of the issues that helped drive him out of the Republican Party and into a Democratic primary in Pennsylvania that he lost this spring to Representative Joe Sestak -- whose own vote for the rescue is now under attack from the Republican candidate, Pat Toomey. 
 And in his own primary, Mr. McCain has been pilloried over his support for TARP by his conservative challenger, former Representative J. D. Hayworth. 
 ''It is part of a bigger narrative,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, a nonpartisan analyst for the Rothenberg Political Report. ''I don't think a general election is going to be won or lost based on that one vote, but I think it will be part of a bigger argument that candidates are going to make against those incumbents who voted for it. It has had more staying power than most votes.'' 
 Support of the bailout is a thread running through the campaigns of Republican Congressional incumbents who have lost in primaries so far this election cycle, and was also a factor in the defeats of three members of Congress in primaries for governor, including that of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas.
 Across the country, House and Senate challengers are hammering incumbents in both parties who voted for the bailout, in many cases lumping it together with the $787 billion economic stimulus plan passed months later under President Obama, as well as federal aid to automakers. 
 In Texas, Representative Chet Edwards, a 10-term Democrat, is facing a stiff challenge by Bill Flores, the former chief executive of an oil and gas company, who has assailed Mr. Edwards for his support of the bailout and also the continuing taxpayer subsidies for the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 ''Chet Edwards votes for every bailout and against ending any bailout!'' Mr. Flores wrote in an e-mail message to supporters, saying Mr. Edwards's position runs counter to his efforts to convince voters that he is a ''really a fiscal conservative.'' 
 Megan Jacobs, a spokeswoman for Mr. Edwards, dismissed the attacks. Referring to the Federal Reserve chairman, she said, ''Given Ben Bernanke's recent statement that TARP helped prevent our country from falling into a second Great Depression, if Mr. Flores wants to put sound-bite politics above the good of our country, that's a bad choice that will not work in Texas.'' 
 But the bailout issue is not a weapon just for Republicans taking on Democrats. On Thursday Robin Carnahan, the Democratic Senate hopeful in Missouri, criticized her Republican rival, Representative Roy Blunt, a former member of the House leadership, for his vote, calling him ''Mr. Bailout.'' She took the swipe at Mr. Blunt during her introduction of Mr. Obama at a fund-raiser, not mentioning that Mr. Obama also backed the plan when he was a senator and presidential candidate, as did her brother, Russ, a Democratic House member.
 In Utah, Mr. Bennett, who was denied his party's Senate nomination in his bid for a fourth term, was branded ''Bailout Bob.'' ''People would walk by my booth and say 'TARP, TARP, TARP, TARP!' But when you tried to talk to them about it, they did not know any of the details,'' he said in an interview. ''They confused TARP and the stimulus plan. They confused TARP and the omnibus bill. They confused TARP and the president's budget.'' 
 Mr. Bennett said he had had little luck trying to explain the details: that economists generally agreed that the rescue plan worked; that he voted only for the first $350 billion installment and not for the second half; that just $475 billion was disbursed and that most of that has already been repaid, plus interest. 
 The Senate approved the bailout measure on Oct. 1, 2008, on a bipartisan vote of 74 to 25. The House initially rejected the proposal, but under prodding from the White House and leading members of both parties, House members ultimately voted 263 to 171 for the bill, with 91 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in backing it; 108 Republicans and 63 Democrats voted no. 
 Several of the House Democrats considered most vulnerable this year opposed the plan, sparing them from attacks over the bailout though they are still criticized for being part of the Congress that approved it. 
 In Iowa, the Democratic Senate challenger, Roxanne Conlin, said that voters resented the government aid to big banks, and that she was working to portray Mr. Grassley as having supported big increases in the deficit, including the Bush tax cuts and the Medicare prescription drug benefit as well as TARP. 
 ''I did a 99-county tour, and in every single county the bailout came up,'' Ms. Conlin said. 
 Eric Woolson, a spokesman for the Grassley campaign, said Ms. Conlin's criticism was falling flat because the rescue plan proved successful and Iowa voters knew Mr. Grassley to be a fierce guardian of taxpayer money.
 Looking back, Mr. Bennett of Utah said he had no regrets. ''Knowing what I know now, absolutely I would vote for it again, even if I knew it was going to end my political career,'' he said. 
 Mr. Inglis said he realized it was a treacherous vote. ''I knew when I was voting for TARP that it could cost me the seat,'' he said, ''but you have to be willing to die on some political hill.''

HEADLINE: Finding A Refuge In Ginnie Mae Funds

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
IN the depths of the financial crisis in 2008, many real estate, stock and corporate bond investments plummeted. Some investors were able to find refuge in bond funds that held Treasury securities. But there was another haven: funds that invest in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae. 
 The 16 Ginnie Mae funds tracked by Morningstar returned an average of 3.35 percent in the second quarter and 8.47 percent in the 12 months through June. That comes after growth of about 6 percent last year, 6.6 percent in 2008 and 6.3 percent in 2007. 
 The Barclays Capital United States MBS Ginnie Mae Index, which tracks the market for the underlying securities in these funds, has produced positive returns every year since 1985, with the exception of 1994.
 Eager for steady returns that yield more than Treasuries, investors poured a net $5.8 billion into the 16 funds in 2008 and an additional $10.4 billion in 2009. That influx reversed five consecutive years of net outflows from 2003 to 2007, according to Morningstar.
 A big reason is that unlike Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have only the implied backing of the federal government, Ginnie Mae has an explicit guarantee, which has given many investors comfort in difficult financial markets. 
 Yet unlike Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by all three of these agencies are exposed to many of the vagaries of the mortgage market, especially the risk that investors will refinance their mortgages. As compensation, bonds backed by these agencies typically yield at least 75 basis points, or 0.75 percentage points, more than 10-year Treasuries.
 ''After what we saw in 2008, there was a good deal of concern about the mortgage sector, but it was focused on Fannie and Freddie, not Ginnie Mae, and people often don't make that distinction,'' said Ronald Reardon, co-head of the mortgage and agency team at Vanguard. ''You are earning a pretty good yield over Treasuries, which amounts to zero risk over Treasuries, and the fact that you're likely to earn that premium, that's the question people should think about.''
 The Federal Reserve's emergency operations during the financial crisis also provided a boost to Ginnie Mae funds. To stabilize the mortgage market, the central bank started buying mortgage-backed securities in late 2008, including some backed by Ginnie Mae. Through March, the central bank had soaked up about $1.25 trillion of the securities, helping to bolster demand and prices.
 When the central bank starts selling its mortgage-backed securities, as it plans to do eventually, Ginnie Mae funds could be hurt. But most fund managers say they don't expect that to happen anytime soon.
 ''Yes, they do want to sell them,'' said Bill Irving, who manages the Fidelity GNMA fund. But, he added, ''it'll be done over five years in an orderly way.''
 There is another, more traditional risk: significant moves in interest rates could affect the mortgages that are bundled into the securities held by Ginnie Mae funds.
 The basic calculus is this: As mortgage rates fall, homeowners are more inclined to finance their homes at lower rates. When that happens, the lenders -- in this case, the mutual funds -- that hold the expiring mortgages get their principal back, but forgo the chance to earn higher interest. When fund managers use the proceeds to buy more mortgage-backed securities, they often yield less than the securities they replaced.
 With interest rates near half-century lows, one might expect a surge in refinancing. But the credit crisis has forced banks to tighten their lending standards, making it harder for homeowners to refinance their mortgages -- another boost for investors in Ginnie Mae funds.
 Interest rates, though, are not the only variable when evaluating the chance that homeowners will refinance their mortgages. Gary Madich, the chief investment officer for JPMorgan Asset Management's fixed-income team in Columbus, Ohio, also checks the credit profile, collateral, ZIP codes and other features of the mortgages that are bundled into securities. This bottom-up approach is time-consuming but can pay dividends.
 ''This translates into very specific securities, typically at deep discounts or premiums,'' Mr. Madich said. ''When we feel like we have prepayment risk, we take great time at the security level to give us more stability. It is very different than managers who are just looking at coupons.''
 Either way, most Ginnie Mae funds yield only a few percentage points more than the inflation rate in most years. As a consequence, investors should look carefully at the fees that funds charge because they can wipe out much of a fund's net gains. 
 The Vanguard GNMA fund, with $37 billion in assets, is the largest Ginnie Mae fund, according to Morningstar. It has an expense ratio of 0.23 percent. The fund gained 3.43 percent in the second quarter and 8.3 percent in the 12 months through June. The Fidelity GNMA fund is the second largest, at $7.9 billion, and has an expense ratio of 0.45 percent. It gained 3.54 percent last quarter and 9.01 percent in the last 12 months. 
 The T. Rowe Price GNMA fund, with assets of almost $1.5 billion, has an expense ratio of 0.66 percent and gained 3.13 percent in the quarter and 8.31 percent in the last 12 months.
 FINANCIAL advisers say that investors seeking stability may want to include GNMA's in a diversified portfolio, being careful to offset the risk of a big sell-off in mortgage-backed securities.
 ''I have some clients in Ginnie Maes and would continue to recommend them even in this unstable credit market,'' said Edward Wolpert, a fee-only financial planner in Decatur, Ga. ''If there is a great need for stability of income, I'd recommend a mix of Treasuries, Ginnie Maes and corporate bonds rated A or higher.''

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Defend Social Security's Chief Actuary in Clash With Commissioner

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A rift has developed between the Social Security commissioner and the agency's chief actuary, causing members of Congress to worry about possible interference with the work of the actuary's office just as lawmakers begin hearings on the future of Social Security.
 In interviews and in letters to the administration, lawmakers said they relied on the actuary, Stephen C. Goss, for objective analysis of proposals to change Social Security. And they made clear that he should not be reassigned or demoted as Congress prepared for a re-examination of the program, now celebrating its 75th anniversary. 
 Two Congressional committees are scheduled to hold hearings on Social Security this week.
 As chief actuary, Mr. Goss helps write the annual trustees' reports on the solvency of Social Security, which pays $700 billion a year in benefits to 53 million people. 
 The reports, filled with facts and figures from Mr. Goss's office, are the starting point for debate on the program and its financial problems.
 Mr. Goss's responsibilities have suddenly increased. Leaders of a presidential commission seeking ways to reduce the federal budget deficit said they would rely exclusively on his estimates to measure the financial effects of proposals to overhaul Social Security.
 Lawmakers said they had learned of tensions between Mr. Goss, a civil servant who has worked at Social Security for 37 years, and Michael J. Astrue, the commissioner of Social Security, who was appointed by President George W. Bush to a six-year term that ends on Jan. 19, 2013.
 People close to Mr. Goss and Mr. Astrue said the disagreements involved personal chemistry, Social Security policy and the technical quality of Mr. Goss's work on disability programs -- not political ideology. 
 Relations have been strained since late 2008, when the two men clashed over the scope of the actuary's independence. Basically, aides said, the commissioner views Mr. Goss as a conscientious employee and agrees that he is free to make calculations and use data as he sees fit. 
 But, they said, in an effort to keep the agency out of politics, Mr. Astrue has sometimes tried to limit what Mr. Goss can say publicly about Social Security, and Mr. Goss has sometimes bridled at the restraints.
 By expressing confidence in Mr. Goss, lawmakers said, they hope to protect him.
 Representative Earl Pomeroy, a Democrat from North Dakota and chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said: ''Steve Goss personifies the meaning of public service. He is viewed broadly in the halls of Congress as a vital asset -- a trustworthy source for confidential and honest analysis on which Congress relies to make sound policy decisions. 
 ''While the recession has had devastating effects on other sources of retirement income, like private savings, investments and employer-provided pensions, Social Security remains strong,'' Mr. Pomeroy said, in part because lawmakers have relied on Mr. Goss's projections.
 Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and chairman of the Finance Committee, said: ''The Social Security actuary plays the critical role of providing the real numbers and straight facts about the program and its trust fund, which is why it's so critical for the actuary to be independent. For more than 30 years, Mr. Goss has produced valuable work trusted by members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.''
 Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said he shared that view. 
 In an interview, Mr. Goss said: ''My goal is to maintain the absolute independence and integrity of the actuary's office. We don't countenance any influence of any type on our assumptions or our prognostications. Our estimates may not always be right, but they will never be biased.''
 Mr. Astrue has expressed reservations about Mr. Goss's performance in annual evaluations that could be used to justify action against him, lawmakers said. 
 The commissioner has complained, on occasion, of insubordinate conduct by Mr. Goss, who insists that he is simply trying to preserve the independence and integrity of the actuary's office. 
 Mark Lassiter, a spokesman for Social Security, said he could not discuss confidential personnel matters. In a written statement, he said, ''Everyone, including the commissioner, appreciates the work Steve and his office do for the agency.''
 Like partners in a bad marriage, Mr. Goss and Mr. Astrue may be stuck with each other for a while. Under federal law, the chief actuary has an unusual degree of autonomy. The law says he shall perform his duties ''in accordance with professional standards of actuarial independence'' and can be removed from office ''only for cause.'' 
 The commissioner can be removed before his term ends only if the president finds ''neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.''
 The guarantees have never been tested. The degree of White House authority over the agency is also unclear, even to some government lawyers.
 Actuaries often run into difficulty because they can deliver an unwelcome analysis that carries great weight.
 In 2004, a furor erupted when lawmakers learned that a Bush administration official had threatened to fire the chief Medicare actuary if he provided Democrats with details of his cost estimates for a new prescription drug benefit. 
 Besides measuring the solvency of Social Security, Mr. Goss analyzes the cost of regulations developed by the Social Security Administration and legislative proposals drafted by the White House and members of Congress.

HEADLINE: A School Closing That Some See as Fiscal Responsibility, Others Racism

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN

 BODY:
BILOXI, Miss. -- It still looks like a happy, thriving school: child-size chairs in the cafeteria, yellow buses in the parking lot, a marquee sign that declares ''Tomorrow's Leaders Begin Here.''
 But unless things change before next month, this city is going to close its top-ranked school, Nichols Elementary, to save about $400,000 a year -- less than 1 percent of the school district's $50 million budget. Worse than that, say residents of the poor and largely black east side of Biloxi, the neighborhood is losing one of its chief sources of pride and cohesion. 
 The question of whether closing the school is an act of fiscal prudence or discrimination has become an explosive subject in Biloxi, reopening age-old racial divides. Nearly 90 percent of the school's students are black or Asian, while the four School Board members who voted in April for the closing are white.
 ''I simply cannot get my arms around it,'' said William Stallworth, the only black member of the City Council, who is lobbying the board to reverse its decision before classes begin on Aug. 11. ''What kind of city closes its best school?''
 The answer, says Paul A. Tisdale, the schools superintendent, is a city that endured a $5.5 million cut in state education financing and a $1.5 million decline in casino revenue. ''This is the Great Recession,'' he said. ''What do you do as a steward of taxpayer dollars?''
 Many Nichols supporters say they object to the lack of community input before the decision. They learned that the board was considering closing Nichols at the same meeting at which the board voted to do so -- and at which the board also revealed that it still had $10 million in savings, enough in theory to keep open the school for more than 20 years.
 In response, more than 1,200 Nichols parents and alumni of Nichols High School, an all-black school that used to occupy the site, have signed a petition calling for Mr. Tisdale's firing and raised $1,800 to hire lawyers to consider possible lawsuits. 
 They packed a recent City Council meeting, dressed in purple-and-gold T-shirts (the school colors) emblazoned with the message ''This is our prayer: Please Lord save our schools.''
 ''It's not the building,'' said Evelyn Clay, 67, a 1961 graduate of Nichols High whose granddaughter Ebony is a student at the elementary school. ''It's the heritage that the school brings to the community.''
 By all accounts, Nichols has an underdog story that most educators would salivate over. 
 Opened in 2004, the airy, red-brick school has only 248 students, nearly all of them poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches. When Hurricane Katrina hit, the school was filled with eight feet of water; it was closed for a year. 
 But this fall, when Mississippi ranked schools across the state, Nichols was the only one of Biloxi's nine public schools to earn the highest possible rating, Star School, based on student achievement. Nichols also won the state's top teacher award for 2010 and the city's top parent award. 
 ''For years, we've been told our schools weren't good enough, our buildings were too old and our test scores weren't high enough,'' Mr. Stallworth said. ''Now we've beat them by their own rules, and they're changing the rules on us.''
 Underlying much of the debate is what Mr. Tisdale, the superintendent, calls ''the R-word.'' Nichols is in a historically black neighborhood defined by bungalow houses, away from the city's casino and beach community. 
 The School Board opposes an often-proposed solution: busing students across town from wealthier, whiter neighborhoods to fill Nichols's half-empty classrooms. That is a double standard, say many black residents, who have seen their own children bused miles away.
 ''I won't bite my tongue -- it's racism,'' said the Rev. James Black, a Pentecostal preacher who has organized protests of the decision. He points out that Nichols was built for $9.5 million and was refurbished for millions more after Hurricane Katrina, but that schools built in the 1950s were being left open in white neighborhoods.
 The school system's response is that Nichols will close for demographic and geographic reasons, not racial ones. All of its students, its principal and most of its teachers will be transferred to Gorenflo Elementary School, a half-mile away and also predominantly black and Asian. 
 In part, the situation arises out of Hurricane Katrina. Since the storm, enrollment in east Biloxi elementary schools has decreased 45 percent, leaving vacant classrooms and duplicated resources, Mr. Tisdale said. In response, the School Board also voted in April to close two schools in mostly white neighborhoods, although that decision received little protest.
 Nichols supporters say they will fight until the school is reopened. But the most likely outcome, Mr. Tisdale said, is that the school will be rented to a local organization, perhaps a Boys and Girls Club. 
 ''I didn't take this job because I want to close schools,'' he said. ''But in my mind, is the door still open? It may be barely a crack.''

HEADLINE: Enigmatic Jobless Man Prepares a Senate Campaign

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
MANNING, S.C. -- On a blisteringly hot afternoon here, Alvin M. Greene talked in a perfunctory way about his improbable candidacy for the United States Senate. But his voice intensified with grievance when the subject turned to his short-circuited career in the Army, from which he was discharged in August involuntarily.
 Mr. Greene said the Army discriminated against him by not promoting him. And yet, he said, it promoted to the rank of major a man who would later be accused of shooting 13 people to death last year at Fort Hood, Tex.
 ''I didn't have one promotion in six-and-a-half years of active duty, full time,'' Mr. Greene lamented in an interview the other day at his father's house on the outskirts of this small town in the south-central part of the state. 
 ''I was born and raised right here in South Carolina, and I'm a true American,'' he said. ''That guy was Middle Eastern and had terrorist ties.'' 
 He was referring to Nidal M. Hasan, whose name he did not use. 
 Mr. Hasan was born in Virginia to Muslim Palestinian parents and is awaiting trial on 13 counts of premeditated murder; he has not been charged with terrorism.
 But in the solitariness of his den, with an overhead fan slicing through dead air, Mr. Greene sees a vast injustice.
 ''They didn't pit the world against the terrorist, they pit the world against me,'' he said. ''The foreign terrorist had it made, and I didn't.''
 In the course of a two-hour interview, Mr. Greene, 32, returned repeatedly to this subject, but he offered no help in deciphering its meaning. He declined to discuss why he might not have been promoted and why he was discharged involuntarily. Military records are private, and Mr. Greene said he would not make his public.
 But the interview offered a glimpse into the psyche of an enigmatic man who was catapulted from obscurity onto the national stage a month ago when he won the primary for the Democratic nomination for the Senate. He will face Senator Jim DeMint, a Republican, in November.
 The central mystery of how he captured more than 100,000 votes, or 59 percent, against a candidate who, unlike Mr. Greene, actually campaigned remains unsolved. 
 Top Democrats say Mr. Greene was put up to the race by mischief-making Republicans; others say he might have won simply because his name appeared first on the ballot. Mr. Greene says he won by ''hard work'' but cannot name anything he did.
 No evidence of fraud has surfaced. And on Friday, the State Law Enforcement Division, which was investigating Mr. Greene's finances, cleared him of any wrongdoing.
 It was trying to square how he could have afforded the $10,440 filing fee in March to get on the June 8 ballot when just a few months earlier he was apparently poor enough to be assigned a public defender to represent him on a felony obscenity charge.
 ''After a thorough investigation, SLED has concluded that there is no evidence of wrongdoing, criminal intent or deception to the court when Greene applied for a public defender last year,'' the agency said. It also determined that he paid for the filing fee with his own savings from the Army, as he has said all along. (The base pay for an E-4 in 2009 with at least six years of service was $2,219 per month.)
 He is still due in state court Monday on the obscenity charge, in which a student at the University of South Carolina said he showed her pornography and tried to go to her dorm room with her. Afterward, a relative paid the $500 fee to a bonding company for him to be released on $5,000 bail.
 But the dropping of the investigation is now the third hurdle that Mr. Greene has cleared on his way to the November election. 
 Last month, state Democrats reluctantly rejected a request to throw out the results of the primary. And earlier this month, Linda Ketner, an erstwhile Democratic Congressional candidate, dropped her bid to run for the Senate seat as an independent. 
 With the new ruling, Democrats are likely to be stuck with Mr. Greene at the top of the ticket, which could undermine their candidates for other offices, from governor on down. On the other hand, it could bolster whatever force was out there for him in the first place and enhance his candidacy, unorthodox though it may be. Polls still show, however, that Mr. DeMint is the heavy favorite, which is why no serious Democrat ran against him in the first place. 
 In the middle of the swirl, Mr. Greene is proceeding with his campaign and has now scheduled his first speaking event. It is set for July 18 at the Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church here in Manning. But mostly, he seems to sit in his den, watch television and answer the phone. He now has a rudimentary Web site, www.alvingreeneforussenator.com, which he did not have during the primary, and says he has a ''growing'' staff. 
 But Mr. Greene, who is unemployed and has no computer, would not identify anyone he has hired or say whether he or someone else created the Web site.
 The topic that animated him was what he said was unfair treatment against him in the Army, where he was a supplies specialist. Earlier, he had served in the Air Force and had security clearance to work in intelligence, but he said the Air Force also discharged him involuntarily.
 He acknowledged that the Army had demoted him from his rank of E-4 and cut his pay while he served at Camp Humphreys in South Korea in 2007 and 2008. He said his E-4 rank was restored last year while he served at Fort Riley, Kan. 
 While Mr. Greene has been cryptic about his reasons for running for the Senate, he hinted that he might have been motivated by anger at his treatment in the service. Asked if he had objected to the way he was treated, he said, ''The only way I can object is my campaign now, to get this country moving forward.''
 He would not comment on the obscenity charge, to which he has yet to enter a plea. But David Ross, deputy solicitor for Richland County, said that Mr. Greene had not been indicted and that the case had not gone to a grand jury. He is being represented now by a private lawyer, Eleazer Carter, who did not return phone calls. 
 Susan McCoy, the mother of the woman, Camille, now 19, who said Mr. Greene had shown her pornography, said she had sought $1,500 in restitution from Mr. Greene because of her daughter's subsequent move to a more expensive dorm.
 ''We were told by the solicitor's office that he was destitute, that he had said he had zero income and zero assets,'' Mrs. McCoy said. ''He can't have it both ways.''
 Mr. Greene, who receives unemployment benefits and has no health insurance, lives in the house he grew up in, which is owned by his father, James S. Greene, 81, who had been the assistant principal of the Paxville Training School. His mother, Claudette, who was a teacher, died when he was 11. His older brother, James, lives next door. 
 While his father was somewhat prominent, Mr. Greene is not.
 ''His election is the biggest mystery I've ever seen,'' said John Calhoun Land IV, a lawyer here and chairman of the Clarendon County Democratic Party. ''I think a conspiracy is far-fetched. But why would he spend a large portion of his net worth on a filing fee and running for office if he has no real plans to campaign?''
 Mr. Greene said that since his victory, he has received calls from all over the world, including from a publishing agent in New York and a screenwriter in California. If a movie is made, he said, he wants to be portrayed by Denzel Washington.

HEADLINE: Personal Approach to Platform

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
Alvin M. Greene's political platform is unconventional on some points -- he likes to think outside the box -- but he is quite serious about it. Many of his proposals resonate from his own life experience. Here are some of them: 
 ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE, Mr. Greene says the punishment should fit the crime; nonviolent, first-time offenders should be eligible for pretrial intervention programs to curtail time behind bars. (Mr. Greene does not have an arrest record, but he is facing an obscenity charge, which he will not comment on.)
 ''Fairness saves us money,'' he said in an interview. ''There are innocent people incarcerated. We spend more than two times of our taxpayer dollars on inmates than on students.''
 ON THE ECONOMY, he wants to produce Alvin M. Greene action figures.
 ''Another thing we can do for jobs is make toys of me, especially for the holidays,'' he told a British newspaper, The Guardian. ''Little dolls. Me. Like maybe little action dolls. Me in an Army uniform, Air Force uniform, and me in my suit.''
 ON HEALTH CARE, he opposes efforts to repeal the Obama administration's law.
 ''I am one of the 32 million Americans that don't have health insurance,'' he said.
 ON JOBS CREATION, Mr. Greene wants construction completed on an interstate highway from Michigan to the South Carolina coast.
 ''Those will create jobs in the short term,'' he said, ''and in the long term, they'll attract industry.''
 ON EDUCATION, his central idea for improvement is ''more parental involvement.''
 His parents, both of whom were educators, were involved with his learning, and he graduated from the University of South Carolina in 2000 with a degree in political science.

HEADLINE: The Desert War

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH. 
Robert F. Worth is the Beirut bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Just before dawn on Dec. 24, an American cruise missile soared high over the southern coast of the Arabian peninsula, arced down toward the dark mountains above the Rafadh Valley in Yemen's Shabwa province and found its mark, crashing into a small stone house on a hillside where five young men were sleeping. Half a mile away, a 27-year-old Yemeni tribesman named Ali Muhammad Ahmed was awakened by the sound. Stumbling out of bed, he quickly dressed, slung his AK-47 over his shoulder and climbed down a footpath to the valley that shelters his village, two hours from the nearest paved road. He already sensed what had happened. A week earlier, an American airstrike killed dozens of people in a neighboring province as part of an expanded campaign against Al Qaeda militants. (Although the U.S. military has acknowledged playing a role in the airstrikes, it has never publicly confirmed that it fired the missiles.) 
 Ahmed soon came upon the shattered house. Mangled bodies were strewn among the stones; he recognized a fellow tribesman. Scattered near the wreckage were bits of yellow debris with the words ''US Navy'' and long serial numbers written on them. A group of six or seven young men were standing in the dawn half-light, looking dazed. All were members of Al Qaeda. Among them was Fahd al-Quso, a longtime militant who is wanted by the F.B.I. for his suspected role in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 2000. The missile had struck in one of the most remote and inaccessible valleys on earth, in a place where Al Qaeda has been trying to establish a foothold. Quso was the local cell leader and had been recruiting young men for years. Ahmed knew him well.
 I met Ahmed several weeks later in Sana, the Yemeni capital, where he works part time as a bodyguard. By that time, Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch had claimed credit for a failed effort to detonate a bomb in a Detroit-bound jetliner on Christmas Day, igniting a global debate about whether Yemen was the next front in the war on terror. Yemen's once-obscure vital statistics were flashing across TV screens everywhere: it is the Arab world's poorest country, with a fast-growing and deeply conservative Muslim population of 23 million. It is running out of oil and may soon be the first country in the world to run out of water. The central government is weak and corrupt, hemmed in by rebellions and powerful tribes. Many fear that Al Qaeda is gaining a sanctuary in the remote provinces east of Sana, similar to the one it already has in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
 On the day I met him, Ahmed - a small, rail-thin man with a bony face - seemed still awed and a bit frightened by what happened in his valley. He was dressed in a tattered blazer and a futa, the patterned cloth skirt Yemeni men often wear. He sat on a sofa leaning forward with his hands on his thighs, glancing occasionally at me. We were in a small, sparely furnished office belonging to Ahmed's employer and friend Abdulaziz al-Jifri, who had given him permission to speak. It was evening, and in the room next door men could be heard laughing and chatting as they drank tea and chewed khat, the narcotic leaf Yemenis use to relax.
 ''We took the bodies under the trees,'' Ahmed continued in a quiet voice. ''One was from my tribe. He had just joined Al Qaeda, and that was his first night sleeping with them.'' He paused, and I caught a hint of defensiveness, perhaps also of anger, in his eyes. He seemed reluctant to stray from his narrative, but it was clear that he felt the bombing was an injustice. ''We knew they were Qaeda, but they were young, and they hadn't done anything, and they were locals,'' he said. ''They came and went at checkpoints, and the government didn't seem to care. So we dealt with them normally.. . .
 ''Later I took the bodies to the graveyard,'' he went on to say. ''Then I talked with Fahd's cousin about what we should do about him.''
 Within an hour, Ahmed said, the discussions expanded, and Ali al-Asowad, the aging sheik of the Abdullah tribe, was summoned from his house. The sun was rising over the arid brown hills around Rafadh and soon almost 100 people were sitting under the spreading boughs of an acacia tree for an emergency tribal meeting.
 Dozens of people spoke. Some were angry. Most people in the valley were related to the dead men or knew them. The victims had scarcely stood out in Rafadh, where everyone carried weapons and hatred of the Yemeni government was nothing unusual. What did it matter that they hated America and called themselves Qaeda? Some of the tribesmen also spoke in defense of Fahd al-Quso, who moved to the area in 2007. His grandfather had a house there, so he had a right to the tribe's protection. But others stood up and shouted angrily that Quso had put the whole tribe in needless danger by basing himself in their village; more American bombs might be coming soon.
 The people of Rafadh had decisions to make, ones that might soon ramify across all of Yemen's remote mountains and deserts and even half a world away in the Pentagon. What did Al Qaeda mean to them? Was it worth protecting? A bargaining chip to be used against a neglectful government? Or just an invitation to needless violence?
 SANA RESEMBLES A FORTRESS, not just in its architecture but in its geography. It is set on a high plateau, surrounded by arid, craggy mountains. At its heart is the Old City, a thicket of unearthly medieval towers and banded spires that stands out sharply in the dry desert air. This was the entire city until a few decades ago, its high walls locked every evening at dusk. Today Sana is a far more sprawling place, with Internet cafes and swarms of beat-up taxis and a sprinkling of adventure tourists. The Old City gates are mostly gone now, and although men still carry the traditional daggers known as jambiyas in their belts, they also wear blazers, often with cheap designer logos on their sleeves. Like other Arab capitals, it is full of policemen, and there are occasional checkpoints manned by bored-looking soldiers in camouflage uniforms.
 But Yemen is different. Beneath the familiar Arab iconography, like pictures of the president that hang in every shop, there is a wildness about the place, a feeling that things might come apart at any moment. A narcotic haze descends on Yemen every afternoon, as men stuff their mouths with glossy khat leaves until their cheeks bulge and their eyes glaze over. Police officers sit down and ignore their posts, a green dribble running down their chins. Taxi drivers get lost and drive in circles, babbling into their cellphones. But if not for the opiate of khat, some say, all of Yemen - not just those areas of the south and north already smoldering with discontent - would explode into rebellion.
 One morning in Sana, I discovered a crowd of people protesting in the stone courtyard outside the cabinet building. Many had shackle scars on their wrists and ankles. They came from an area called Jaashin, about 100 miles south of the capital. But some of them, I found, did not even know that Jaashin was in the Republic of Yemen. Their only real ruler was the local sheik, Muhammad Ahmed Mansour, who is, it turns out, a kind of latter-day Marquis de Sade. Mansour is also a poet, who earns extra license for his cruelties by writing florid odes to Yemen's president. Some pilgrims from Jaashin said they were imprisoned, shackled and beaten by the sheik - who maintains his own army and several prisons - after refusing to relinquish their property to him. I asked Ahmed Abdu Abdullah al-Haithami, a bent old farmer in a tattered green jacket, what country he was living in. He looked up at me with imploring eyes. ''All I know is that God rules above, and the sheik rules here below,'' he said. All of this, I later learned, was documented by Yemeni lawyers, who have been working on behalf of the people of Jaashin for years to little effect. As one lawyer, Khaled al-Alansi, put it to me, ''If you can't fight sheik Mansour, how can you possibly fight Al Qaeda?''
 Two thousand years ago, the area east of Sana held one of the earth's most prosperous kingdoms, a lush agricultural region of spices and fruits, fed by irrigation canals from a vast man-made dam. The Romans called Yemen ''Arabia Felix,'' or Happy Arabia. Today, the eastern region is an arid wasteland. Most people scrape by on less than $2 a day, even though they live atop Yemen's oil and gas fields. There are few ways to make a living other than smuggling, goat-herding and kidnapping. The region is also, chronically, a war zone. Tribal feuds have always been part of life here, but in recent years they have grown so common and so deadly that as much as a quarter of the population cannot go to school or work for fear of being killed. The feuds often devolve into battles with bands of raiders mowing down their rivals with machine-gun fire or launching mortars into a neighboring village. No one knows how many people die in these wars, but Khaled Fattah, a sociologist who has studied Yemen's tribes for years, told me that hundreds of victims a year is a conservative estimate.
 Every time I drive out of Sana I get an ominous sense of going backward in time to a more lawless era. As the city's towers fade in the distance, the houses drop away into level desert and occasional piles of construction rubble. The traffic thins out and consists mostly of pickup trucks carrying tribesmen with patterned cloth kaffiyehs tied around their heads. You pass the first of several checkpoints, where skinny soldiers in ill-fitting uniforms warily circle the car, looking for weapons or kidnapping victims. You pass towering, desolate mountains of black and brown igneous rock. Once you're out of Sana province, there are virtually no signs of the Yemeni state. Every able-bodied man seems to carry an AK-47 rifle over his shoulder; it's not uncommon to see rocket-propelled-grenade launchers. Only the oil and gas fields, hidden behind wire fences and vigilantly watched over by the Yemeni military, seem to merit the government's attention.
 Last year I expected to see at least a few government soldiers when I visited the ancient city of Shibam in Hadramawt, the vast eastern province where Osama bin Laden's father was born. A few months earlier, four South Korean tourists were blown up by a suicide bomber as they admired the view of Shibam from across the valley. I was a little nervous. ''Don't worry,'' my guide said, patting my shoulder as we walked up to the ridge where the Koreans died. ''Ever since the bombing they have put this place on high security.'' But when we got to the top of the ridge there was not a single soldier or policeman to be seen. We gazed out over the valley in silence. A sign stood nearby, showing a pair of binoculars and the words in English ''Discover Islam.'' As we began to leave, my guide smiled broadly and gestured at the sign. ''The Koreans - they discovered Islam,'' he said, giggling at his joke.
 Even in the capital, law and order often mean less than they do in other Arab countries. One afternoon I was having tea with Abdulaziz al-Jifri when a shot rang out nearby. I thought nothing of it; it might have been a firecracker or someone testing a gun. We were in the safest area of the city, a neighborhood called Hadda, where rich Yemenis and foreign diplomats have built an enclave in recent decades. But Jifri got up from the cushion where he was sitting to go see what happened. He came back 15 minutes later with a look of surprise on his face. A friend of the family, a wealthy tribal figure, had been shot dead a block away. The victim, Jifri explained, was walking up to the gate of his home when someone apparently shot him once in the head. There were no witnesses and no one even bothered to call the police, who are so corrupt and incompetent that most people view them as useless.
 ''There is no law in Yemen,'' Jifri said, shaking his head. We went on drinking tea and talking politics.
 By then, I had spent at least a dozen afternoons at Jifri's house. He was a unique figure: educated in Britain and Saudi Arabia, he was designated by his father - a wealthy businessman with political connections - as a liaison to the tribes in Shabwa and Marib, two of the main areas where Al Qaeda is said to find sanctuary. He is tall and handsome, with large, mischievous brown eyes and a knack for setting a room on fire with laughter. His family are sayyids, or descendants of the prophet Muhammad, and that gave them a special status in the caste like social hierarchy that prevailed until Yemen's republican revolution in 1962. Even now, the Jifris are trusted and respected like few other clans in rural Yemen.
 Jifri became my link to rural Yemen. There was no way for me to travel to Shabwa or Marib undetected, I was told. So day after day I would sit on a cushion beside him in the family's rectangular living room as various sheiks and relatives from those provinces arrived to sip tea, chew khat and talk until dark about what was happening among the tribes. It was there that I met Ali Muhammad Ahmed, along with others from the area around Rafadh, in Shabwa province, the valley where the cruise missile struck on Dec. 24. The Jifris themselves have a house in the Rafadh Valley.
 Rafadh, several hundred miles southeast of the capital, is in some ways typical of the areas where Al Qaeda found refuge in Yemen. It is set among dry mountains populated by baboons, there are no paved roads and cars must travel laboriously along dirt tracks that wind among the hills. There is no public water supply or electricity and no functioning school. The valley was largely peaceful during the 1970s and '80s, when the socialist government that ruled South Yemen - a separate country until it united with the north in 1990 - tried to eradicate tribalism. But since then Yemen's president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, has encouraged tribal practices, and the feuds have returned. Rafadh itself has been devastated by a tribal conflict that has raged for years, killing at least a dozen people and wounding many more in an area with only a few hundred inhabitants.
 Ahmed played a central role in the feud. In 2006, Ahmed's father and older brother were gunned down by men posing as customers at the father's market stall. Afterward, he told me, he drove the bullet-riddled bodies to the nearest police station to ask for justice. The police captain in charge waved him off dismissively, he said, telling him, ''You tribes are always causing trouble - deal with it yourself.''
 He did. Ahmed gathered five cousins and together they hunted down and shot two men they believe were among the killers and three other men who were sheltering them. The feud briefly threatened to escalate into a broader war. The government promised to mediate but failed to do so, and the feud grew with further kidnappings and clumsy army suppression. Many local people felt the government was largely to blame.
 It was then that Fahd al-Quso, the Al Qaeda figure, arrived in the valley. He had roots in the area but, perhaps more important, he was an outlaw to the Yemeni authorities, and that alone earned him a welcome in Rafadh. The United States wanted him in connection with the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole, which killed 17 American sailors. The Yemeni police arrested his younger brother, a tactic aimed at pressuring Quso to turn himself in.
 ''Fahd was a victim in the eyes of the tribes,'' Ahmed told me. ''They accepted what he said. People distrust the government here, so those who have problems with it will get sympathy.''
 Last summer, as Al Qaeda's Arabian branch began setting off alarms in Washington, Quso became more active, Ahmed told me. ''We saw lots of Al Qaeda guys coming and going from his house,'' Ahmed said. They tended to keep to themselves, refusing to give rides to others from the village.
 But the tribesmen of Rafadh continued to shelter Quso and his men and not just because of their shared hatred of the government. Quso had offered to supply teachers for the village school. Local families knew he was with Al Qaeda but welcomed the news for a simple reason: there were no teachers in the school at all. ''The people were saying, 'We would rather have our kids get an Al Qaeda education than be illiterate,' '' Jifri told me. After hearing about Quso's offer, Jifri went to officials in Sana and delivered a blunt message: ''Right now you have one Al Qaeda guy in Rafadh, tomorrow you will have 700.''
 Initially, Jifri said, the government refused to provide teachers, saying any town that was willing to accept help from Al Qaeda was beneath contempt. Finally, they relented.
 ''The government agreed to send 6 teachers,'' Jifri told me. ''Fahd brought 16.''
 WHEN PEOPLE TALK about the government in Yemen, they really mean one man: Ali Abdullah Saleh. Despite the country's many political parties - Islamist, Socialist, Arab nationalist - the country is run almost entirely by Saleh, and he runs it exactly like a sheik: using his own tribe as a power base and constantly making deals to head off his rivals. Saleh came to power in 1978; pictures of him at the time show a skinny young man in a military cap that looks too big for him, his eyes covered by aviator sunglasses.
 At the time, most of Yemen was still just emerging from isolation. In 1962 a group of military officers, inspired and aided by Gamal Abdel Nasser in Egypt, overthrew the xenophobic religious dynasty that, from its northern base, ruled much of Yemen for centuries. Some of the young officers hoped to modernize Yemen and make it more like other Arab countries. In the mid-1970s one Yemeni president, Ibrahim al-Hamdi, tried to tame the powerful tribal sheiks, extend the state's power throughout the country and unify with South Yemen, which emerged from British occupation in 1967. Yemeni intellectuals still talk about Hamdi with nostalgia. But the sheiks and their Saudi backers were not pleased. In October 1977, Hamdi was found riddled with bullets in his Sana home. The killers had thrown the bodies of murdered French prostitutes beside him to blacken his legacy.
 Saleh was not a man to make such mistakes. He fought in a tribal army as a teenager and then made his way up through the ranks of the military, impressing superiors with his ruthlessness and charm. He became a tank commander - a crucial skill at a time when tanks were a new and essential weapon. When Hamdi's successor, Ahmad al-Ghashmi, was blown up by a bomb hidden in a briefcase, Saleh was a compromise replacement. No one expected him to last long.
 Three decades later, Saleh retains a stiff, military bearing, with a strong jaw and glinting eyes. In person he conveys an impression of fierce pride and gruffness and the natural defensiveness of a man from a small tribe who fought his way up with no more than an elementary-school education. When I interviewed him in 2008, he seemed impatient and almost angry. His eyes darted around the room as he fired off commands to his aides in a guttural voice. He bridled at questions about the American role in Yemen. ''Arrogant,'' he said, staring at me, then adding disdainfully in English, ''Cowboys.''
 SOME SAY SALEH has lasted so long because, unlike his predecessors, he knew not to take on the tribes directly. ''Saleh survived by mastering the tribal game as no one else had,'' Khaled Fattah, the tribal expert, said. He did so in two ways. First, he coddled the big tribal sheiks, bringing them into the capital and building them large homes. He created a patronage network that grew substantially after Yemen began pumping oil in the 1980s, paying large sums to sheiks, military leaders, political figures and anyone who might pose a threat to his power. Much of Yemen's budget now goes into corruption and kickbacks - worth billions of dollars - that fuel this network, according to diplomats, analysts and oil-industry figures in Sana.
 Second, Saleh adopted what some Yemenis call ''the policy of management through conflicts.'' If a tribe was causing trouble, he would begin building up its rivals as a counterweight. If a political party became threatening, he would do the same thing, sometimes even creating a cloned version of the same party with people on the government payroll. ''The government plays divide and rule with us,'' Arfaj bin Hadban, a tribal sheik from Jawf province, north of Sana, said. ''If one tribe will not do what he wants, he gets the neighbors to pressure it. Sometimes it's money, sometimes it's weapons, sometimes it's employment for the tribesmen.''
 But in a sense, the key to Saleh's long rule - and to much of Yemen's modern history - lies just to the north in Saudi Arabia. The kingdom squats atop Yemen on the map like a domineering older brother with a rebellious sibling. Starting in 1962, the Saudi royal family viewed Yemenis' democratic aspirations with alarm and began paying hefty stipends to tribal sheiks throughout the country to reinforce its influence. Later, the Saudis began spreading their hard-line strand of Islam throughout the country, with help from some like-minded Yemenis. Hundreds of religious schools sprang up teaching Salafism, the puritanical sect that denounces all other sects as heresy. (The Saudi variant is usually called Wahhabism.) This was bound to be divisive in Yemen, where a third or more of the population were Zaydis, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.
 As the influence of the Salafists grew, Saleh formed close ties to jihadists and radical clerics like Abdul Majid al-Zindani, who is listed by the U.S. Treasury Department as a ''specially designated global terrorist.'' Saleh had a political motive: Salafists are mostly quiescent and preach obedience to the ruler (even if they call for violent jihad in other lands). That was an appealing trait in Yemen's complex social mosaic, where rivalries based on class, region, religious sect and lineage are endemic. But Saleh also knew that he needed the Saudis, who are widely believed to have arranged his accession in the first place.
 When I met him, Saleh seemed enraged that anyone should dare to criticize his methods. ''We have unified the country and brought stability,'' he told me. That is true. Saleh orchestrated the unification of north and south Yemen in 1990, and he has remained in power for 32 years. But even as he spoke, in June 2008, those achievements seemed to be unraveling. Zaydi rebels from the north - angered by Saleh's support for the Salafists - were gaining ground. In the south, a groundswell of economic discontent was rising and later became an open secessionist movement. The fact that Saleh is now trying to arrange for his son Ahmed Saleh to succeed him as president has alienated many tribal leaders and other allies, narrowing Saleh's power base. In the past year, as Al Qaeda began to mount more frequent attacks, he turned to some old friends for help, only to see them abandon him.
 One night in January 2009, Tareq al-Fadhli, a 42-year-old aristocrat from south Yemen, received a phone call from Saleh. Fadhli wasn't surprised: the Yemeni president is famously impulsive and has a habit of calling people late at night with urgent ideas or demands that are sometimes forgotten by daylight. But this one was unusual. Saleh wanted to convene all the old jihadis who fought against the Soviets in Afghanistan, Fadhli told me.
 ''He wanted us to make a dialogue with the new generation of Al Qaeda,'' Fadhli said. ''He said he wanted to arrange to send them abroad to Saudi Arabia and Somalia, and in return he would release the ones who were in prison.'' The released prisoners would stay in Yemen.
 It was a bold idea, to put it mildly. Saudi Arabia is Yemen's most important ally and had waged bloody battles to rid itself of homegrown jihadi fighters. But Al Qaeda, once a manageable problem, seemed to be running out of control in Yemen, and America was putting on the pressure. Saleh was desperate to find a way to rid himself of the militants, preferably without calling in American airstrikes or doing anything else that would alienate the radical clerics on whose political support he counted.
 Fadhli, who has mournful eyes and a distinguished face, was a natural intermediary and an old ally. As a young man, he fought for three years in Afghanistan, leaving only after he was wounded at Jalalabad. He had formed a close friendship with Osama bin Laden, whom he still remembers fondly. Later, when the socialists of southern Yemen rebelled in 1994, Fadhli formed a brigade of jihadists at the central government's request and helped put down the rebels. His friend bin Laden helped out, providing millions of dollars' worth of arms and hundreds of fighters who were hungry for another chance to kill godless socialists.
 After that, the former jihadis split. Fadhli, like many others, went back to civilian life, becoming a landowner in the south and an adviser to Saleh. He said goodbye to bin Laden in Sudan in 1994 and has not seen him since. But some veterans continued to preach jihad and to train in Afghanistan with Al Qaeda, which began to call for the overthrow of secular Arab regimes.
 The first real sign that the jihadis were a source of trouble at home came in 2000 with the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in the Yemeni port town of Aden on the southern coast. Seventeen American sailors were killed. A year later, after the Sept. 11 attacks, Saleh recognized that a major shift had taken place. Fearing that the United States might invade Yemen, he flew to Washington and pledged his support. At home, his security forces rounded up hundreds of former jihadists and jailed them en masse without charge. In November 2002, the C.I.A. used a Predator drone to kill Abu Ali al-Harithi, then the leader of Al Qaeda in Yemen, as he was driving in the desert east of Sana.
 Saleh knew his collaboration with the United States could make the jihadis turn on him. He was furious after American officials leaked word of their role in the Harithi assassination. Later, Saleh repeatedly denied the Americans permission to kill Al Qaeda leaders during Yemen's 2006 presidential election because he feared the strikes might harm his electoral prospects, according to one high-ranking Yemeni official. Saleh had struggled for years to find a compromise between the radicals and the Americans. He created an Islamic ''dialogue'' program to bring jihadists under the umbrella of the state, then abandoned it after several of its graduates returned to terrorism. Popular sympathy for the jihadist cause was still high, and in February 2006 Saleh suffered a deep embarrassment when 23 prisoners, many of them in Al Qaeda, escaped from a maximum-security prison in Sana. The authorities offered a preposterous explanation: the men tunneled out of their cell with spoons and table legs and emerged in the bathroom of a neighboring mosque. The truth, the high-ranking official told me, was that officers in the Political Security Organization arranged the escape. ''You have to remember, these officers used to escort people from Sana to Pakistan during the Afghan jihad,'' he said. ''People made relationships, and that doesn't change so easily.''
 By 2007, it was clear that a new and more dangerous generation of Al Qaeda militants was emerging. Unlike their predecessors, these men aimed openly to overthrow the Yemeni state and refused all dialogue with it. Many later claimed that they suffered torture in Yemeni prisons during long terms - usually without formal charges. Some of them had gone to Iraq and returned with valuable battlefield skills. The attacks grew bloodier and more frequent: a suicide bombing in July 2007 killed eight Spanish tourists; there were attacks on oil pipelines. In September 2008, suicide bombers in two cars struck the U.S. Embassy in Sana in a meticulously planned operation that left 10 Yemenis and all 6 attackers dead.
 Saleh tried to win the militants over through intermediaries. Nasser al-Bahri, a 35-year-old former driver for bin Laden, told me that he tried reaching out to the new militants. They refused, and he soon discovered he was on a ''death list'' of accused traitors. Several other former jihadists told me the same thing. ''I try to talk to these people,'' said Ali Muhammad al-Kurdi, another militant Islamist who fought in Afghanistan. ''They tell me, 'You are an agent.' '' Some of the older jihadists advised Saleh to immunize the state from attacks by Islamizing it. He briefly deployed a morality-police brigade, modeled on the notorious cane-wielding mutawa in Saudi Arabia. The attacks continued.
 Finally, in January of last year, Tareq al-Fadhli received his late-night phone call from the president. Saleh said he would release 130 Al Qaeda sympathizers right away as a good-will gesture and asked Fadhli to arrange the rest.
 Fadhli told me that he formed a committee of former jihadis and began traveling through the areas where Al Qaeda has found sanctuary - Marib, Shabwa, Jawf and Abyan provinces. ''The tribal sheiks cooperated with us everywhere,'' Fadhli told me. ''Whenever we found Qaeda members, we told them: 'The government wants you to turn yourself in, but it's O.K. We will guarantee your safety.' ''
 In the end, 20 people on the government's 60-most-wanted list agreed to stop fighting, Fadhli said. But the mediators never made any progress with Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the leader of Al Qaeda's Yemen-based branch, or his top deputies.
 A few months after the failed negotiation, in April 2009, Fadhli defected from the government, joining the southern secessionist movement. He told me that he was tired of hearing Saleh offer tempting deals to Al Qaeda while refusing to even talk to the leaders in the south, whose movement - rooted in claims of economic discrimination - is populist, secular and nonviolent.
 Meanwhile, the United States grew increasingly concerned about Al Qaeda's growth in Yemen and about Saleh's tendency to see it as a family problem, solvable through dialogue. Veteran jihadists were said to be coming to Yemen from Afghanistan and Somalia. Last summer, Gen. David H. Petraeus, then the overall commander of American military forces in the Middle East, visited Sana, and the number of American military trainers working with Yemen's counterterrorism forces quietly grew. In the fall, a select group of American officials met with Saleh and showed him irrefutable evidence that Al Qaeda was aiming at him and his relatives, who dominate Yemen's military and intelligence services. That seems to have abruptly changed Saleh's attitude, American diplomats told me. The Yemenis began to mount more aggressive ground raids on Al Qaeda targets, in coordination with the airstrikes that began in December.
 But the strikes and raids were a short-term tactic. The real problem was that Yemen, with its mind-boggling corruption, its multiple insurgencies, its disappearing oil and water and its deepening poverty, is sure to descend further into chaos if something does not change. Everyone has acknowledged this, including President Obama and a growing chorus of terrorism analysts. So far, the calls for action have yielded nothing. I spoke to a number of American officials in Washington and to a variety of diplomats at the embassy in Sana. They all told me the same thing: no one has a real strategy for Yemen, in part because there are so few people who have any real expertise about the country. No American diplomats travel to the provinces where Al Qaeda has found sanctuary. Even the Yemeni government has great difficulty reaching these places; often they have no idea whether airstrikes or bombing runs have hit their targets, because they dare not show up to check until days afterward.
 Officially, American policy in Yemen is twofold: using airstrikes and raids to help the Yemeni military knock out Al Qaeda cells, while increasing development and humanitarian aid to address the root causes of radicalism. In late June, the White House announced it was more than tripling its humanitarian assistance, to $42.5 million. But the numbers are still small given Yemen's need. And diplomats concede that they have not figured out how to address the central issues of poor governance, corruption and the economy. ''There is a huge amount of diplomacy that needs to be done and is not being done,'' Edmund J. Hull, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen from 2001 to 2004, said when I met him in Washington. ''It makes me uneasy to hear that we're not getting out to those remote areas. One way or another, we have ceded the initiative to Al Qaeda, and Al Qaeda is calling the shots.''
 AL QAEDA HAS a clear Yemen strategy. On Jan. 23, 2009, the group released a high-quality video clip on the Internet showing four men sitting on a floor, with a clean white curtain and a flag behind them. One of them was Nasser al-Wuhayshi, the group's leader, wearing a white turban, and one was Qassim al-Raymi, its military commander, clad in fatigues and a red-and-white kaffiyeh. Sitting alongside them were two new Qaeda commanders, both former detainees from the American prison camp at Guantanamo Bay.
 The video was a setback for President Obama, who had been inaugurated days earlier and had made a high-profile pledge to close Guantanamo - where nearly half the remaining inmates were Yemenis - within a year. But the real news was Al Qaeda's announcement that same month that it was merging its Saudi and Yemeni branches into a single unit: Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The new group incorporated a number of fighters from Saudi Arabia, where the government had cracked down fiercely on terrorist networks. It proclaimed a broad ambition: to serve as a base for attacks throughout the region and to replace the infidel governments of Yemen and Saudi Arabia with a single theocratic state.
 At the heart of this new effort was an unlikely leader. Wuhayshi is a tiny man, less than five feet tall. In videotapes he sits motionless, his pinched face blank, his small eyes expressionless. Raymi, the group's burly military commander, speaks passionately, his hands knifing through the air, his eyes full of righteous anger. By contrast, Wuhayshi seems almost catatonic.
 Yet Al Qaeda men treat him with deep veneration. ''When they see him, they kiss him on the forehead, like a great sheik,'' said Abdulelah Hider Shaea, a Yemeni journalist who interviewed Wuhayshi and other Al Qaeda leaders before the video's release. ''They all love and respect him.'' Shaea, who was blindfolded and driven out to a remote area for his interview, said Wuhayshi was laconic but quick-witted, with flashes of sarcastic humor and a remarkable ability to adduce Koranic verses to back up anything he said. Wuhayshi's authority seems to derive mostly from his long proximity to bin Laden, whom he served for six years as a private secretary in Afghanistan. ''During bombing raids, everyone else would scatter, but he would stay by bin Laden's side,'' Shaea said, echoing a story other Al Qaeda members told him about their leader. The founders seem to have been impressed: bin Laden's deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, issued a statement in November 2008 formally recognizing Wuhayshi as the emir, or prince, of Al Qaeda in the region.
 Shaea and others who have studied him say Wuhayshi appears to be modeling himself on bin Laden, who has always been more cerebral guide than day-to-day commander. Wuhayshi left Afghanistan in late 2001 and was arrested by Iranian authorities; they handed him over two years later to Yemen, which jailed him without charge. Little is known about his early life in Abyan province in southern Yemen. Personality aside, he seems to have much in common with Raymi, his fiery military commander. Both men come from ordinary families, studied at religious schools and fought in Afghanistan, according to Shaea and other Yemeni journalists. Both served time afterward in Yemeni prisons. And both were among the 23 militants who escaped from the central Sana prison in February 2006.
 The two men have also followed bin Laden's example in building an ever-more-sophisticated propaganda arm for Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, including frequent video and audio tapes and an Internet magazine, Sada al-Malahim (The Echo of Battles), that appears every two months or so. The magazine makes for bizarre reading, by turns chilling and poignant. The first page of one recent issue showed a colorful 1950s-style stock image of a hand that was mixing fluid in a chemical beaker, alongside a hand grenade and the headline ''Year of the Assassination.'' The authors are clearly familiar with the style of Western magazine journalism, and many articles are framed as regular features like View From the Inside and The Leader's Editorial. There are didactic items, with headlines like ''Shariah Is the Solution'' and ''Practical Steps Toward the Liberation of Palestine.'' But some of the articles are almost whimsical (''A Mujahid's Thoughts''), and there are sharp satires (''The Saudi Media on Mars''). Much of the content has an earnest, proselytizing tone, a bit like the ads that Western corporations publish to trumpet their civic responsibility. One recent article, for example, was titled ''Inside View: Why We're Fighting in the Arabian Peninsula.''
 Since it first appeared in early 2008, the magazine has grown steadily more polished, and the quality of its Koranic scholarship has improved, said Gregory Johnsen, a Yemen expert at Princeton University who has spent years tracking Al Qaeda in the region. Its content has mirrored the influx of Saudi militants into the group, including Said Ali al-Shihri, a former Guantanamo detainee who is now the deputy emir of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Perhaps the magazine's most frequent target for abuse is Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, who directs Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism efforts and has become heavily involved with Yemen's struggle with Al Qaeda. In August, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula came close to assassinating bin Nayef when a Saudi suicide bomber posing as a repentant member of the group was allowed into the prince's Jedda home and detonated a bomb. Bin Nayef was only lightly injured. Afterward, Sada al-Malahim published a lengthy defense of the tactic under the headline ''War Is Deception,'' citing Koranic verses that approve of deceit as a tool in times of war.
 The target audience for all this rhetoric is a bit of a mystery: Internet access is rare in Yemen, especially in the areas where Al Qaeda operates. There is evidence that the group may be aiming to win over members of the military or even the political elite (not an implausible goal, given the depth of sympathy for jihadism in Yemen). As for the broader public, one hint came in a video the group released last summer. The 18-minute video, ''The Battle of Marib,'' about a successful battle with the Yemeni military, pointedly emphasized the accuracy of Al Qaeda's casualty count. The narrator, Qassim al-Raymi, mocks the government for failing to acknowledge that seven soldiers were captured. The video then cuts to a government press conference, in which a spokesman stumbles badly in response to questions from journalists and refuses - just as Raymi said- to acknowledge the soldiers' capture. The video then returns to Raymi, who, facing the camera almost gloatingly, delivers his message: ''I call upon all Muslims to take their information from clear and correct sources, like the jihadi Web sites on the Internet.''
 It is far from clear how Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, based in remote and desperately underdeveloped areas, turns out such a slick product. Shaea, the Yemeni journalist who interviewed Al Qaeda's top leaders, told me he also met four members of the group's media arm in a room that was set up like a studio, with computers and other equipment. ''You could tell they were rich and well educated,'' he said. ''Some did not look like Arabs. They did not speak, so I wondered if they even spoke Arabic.''
 If Wuhayshi and Raymi want to recreate the original Al Qaeda in Yemen, they also seem to have learned from its mistakes. Starting in 2009, the group used its Internet magazine and intermittent videos to make increasingly passionate appeals to the people of Yemen - and especially to its tribes. The magazine echoed populist discontent about government corruption, unemployment and unfair distribution of revenue from Yemen's oil, much of which comes from the very areas where Al Qaeda is active. The articles often show a deep understanding of local concerns; one issue in 2008 included an anguished complaint about the government's mishandled response to a flood in the eastern province of Hadramawt.
 Al Qaeda's Afghanistan-based leadership reinforced the tribal message in early 2009, when Zawahiri issued an audiotape addressed to ''the noble and defiant tribes of Yemen,'' urging them to rise up against Saleh's government. ''Don't be less than your brothers in the defiant Pashtun and Baluch tribes,'' he said. ''Don't be helpers of Ali Abdullah Saleh. . . . Support your brothers the mujahedeen.'' At the same time, the group strove to marry members to tribal women and mediate tribal disputes.
 The reason for all this was simple: a global reaction was developing against militants acting in the name of Al Qaeda, largely because of their extreme and often indiscriminate violence. In Iraq, the local Al Qaeda branch alienated tribes that provided crucial support for them in Anbar province, paving the way for the American-backed ''awakening movement'' that threw them out. Wuhayshi and his men clearly wanted to prevent that from happening in Yemen.
 So far the most masterful piece of propaganda by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is still the ''Battle of Marib'' video. In it, Raymi tells the story of the Yemeni military's effort to destroy an Al Qaeda cell and capture Aidh al-Shabwani, a young militant with a lame leg whom one government official described to me as ''a sort of local Robin Hood figure.'' The raid was a humiliating failure. The army lost several tanks and armored vehicles to the guerrillas, who knew the local orange groves and deserts well. The Al Qaeda men took possession of a weapons convoy and captured seven soldiers, who were later released.
 The video's most striking feature is its anxious plea to tribesmen to resist payments and pressure from the Yemeni government and its Saudi and American backers. It starts off with an acknowledgment that the raid took place because of a ''betrayal'' by local tribal leaders. Then Raymi intones: ''How shameful it is that some sheiks allow themselves to become soldiers and slaves of Ali Abdullah Saleh, who is himself but a slave to Saudi riyals and American dollars. I say to these sheiks: be careful that you don't become a piece of chewing gum that a person enjoys for a short time and then throws away.'' After Raymi and another narrator describe the Al Qaeda victory, the second narrator offers a more refined formulation, noting that the seven soldiers' lives were spared: ''If you don't support the mujahedeen, then at least don't stand against them.'' Since then, the group has released a stream of statements and videos outlining its basic objectives: to recruit more followers, overthrow Saleh and use Yemen as a base to attack the Saudi monarchy and build an Islamic caliphate.
 AFTER THE DAWN cruise-missile strike on Rafadh, the open-air tribal meeting reached a conclusion. The elders decided that Quso and his Al Qaeda gang had become a threat to the tribes. Two deadly missiles had struck in less than a week; more might be coming. Tribal hospitality was one thing, and it was a shame that the five young men were killed. But the presence of Quso and his recruits was endangering everyone. They had to go. The elders deputized Ahmed and a fellow tribesman to evict them.
 Ahmed told me he sat in his pickup truck with Quso and spoke to him firmly: ''Are you satisfied? All of the people here have been living in the mountains, in the trees, for a week. Now we want you out, and don't come back unless you're alone.'' The Al Qaeda man said nothing. He seemed subdued and appeared to understand that he could not challenge the tribe's decision.
 Ahmed drove Quso out of the valley on a bumpy dirt track. As they drove, Quso contacted other Al Qaeda members in the area, and they picked them up one by one. Before long there were 11 men piled into the truck. Ahmed said he left them on the nearest main road and returned to his valley. A few days later, Quso came back. This time he was alone. As of mid-February, he still was living alone in his grandfather's house, according to Jifri, who visited him there.
 Not everyone has reacted to the airstrikes this way. In the neighboring province of Abyan, an airstrike killed dozens of people, most of them women and children, according to local witnesses. The civilian death toll created a groundswell of anger at the Yemeni government and the United States that was a boon to Al Qaeda recruiters, several local people told me. Ali al-Shal, an opposition member of the Yemeni Parliament who is from a village close to where the Abyan airstrikes took place, told me it was too dangerous for him to visit afterward. Ultimately he was able to visit, but only once and only by drawing on his family connections with local tribal figures. ''There was not much sympathy for Al Qaeda before, but the strike has created a lot of sympathy,'' he said.
 IN RECENT WEEKS, Al Qaeda has sounded more confident than ever, issuing threats and calls to arms, along with publishing its Internet magazine and introducing an English-language online magazine called Inspire. In May, a botched air raid led to the death of a tribal leader in Marib who was negotiating on the government's behalf with a local Al Qaeda leader, infuriating the local tribes and further eroding President Saleh's credibility. On June 19, four heavily armed men stormed the fortified headquarters of the Political Security Organization in the southern port city of Aden, freeing prisoners suspected of being Al Qaeda members and escaping unharmed.
 Before leaving Yemen, I traveled to Aden. Near the dilapidated oil refinery built by the British, I found the Quso family home, in a row of simple stone and concrete bungalows. Fahd's father, Muhammad al-Quso, was just walking up to the door as I arrived. He was an old man with a deeply lined face, dressed in a red-and-white futa and headdress. He walked with a cane. Inside the house he sat down heavily in an armchair and told the story of his son's life. It was a biography that matched many others in Yemen.
 Fahd was born in 1975, his father said, and grew up alongside four brothers and six sisters. He was a happy child and a good student at the local elementary school, called al-Saafir. But his parents wanted him to have some religion, so when he was 14 they sent him - along with some of his friends from the neighborhood - to a school up north called Dar al-Hadith. The school is famous as one of the first Wahhabi institutions in Yemen; John Walker Lindh was reportedly among the future jihadists who studied there. After he came home, he studied welding at the local technical school. But he decided not to work at the refinery, as his father had. When I asked about the accusations that his son took part in the bombing of the U.S.S. Cole in 2000, he winced and said he didn't believe it. He complained that the authorities had jailed him, and then later, after freeing him, jailed his brother-in-law for no reason. Finally, I asked Muhammad whether his son was a member of Al Qaeda, as the authorities claimed.
 ''No,'' he said, ''I don't believe this.'' He was silent for a long time, staring at the closed door of the house, which was illuminated at its edges by a bright rectangle of afternoon sunlight. Then he spoke again.
 ''He is a mujahid,'' he said, or holy warrior. ''He is fighting those who occupy Arab lands. He is fighting unbelievers.''

HEADLINE: Time To Wake Up, Sleeper Spy

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Some complained that they could not scrape up a single grapefruit or tangerine in the markets. Others pined for contact with friends in the West, which was off limits forever (the K.G.B. made absolutely certain of that). One recalled his dismay upon returning in the 1960s and visiting a Moscow factory: ''What a dreadful mess.'' Only a few years later, he dropped dead, as if he were never able to readapt to Soviet life.
 Like those before them, the sleeper spies who were deported to Russia last week in one of the biggest espionage exchanges in decades will probably miss the United States, picket fences and all. But what perhaps most distinguishes this affair from its cold war precursors is what awaits these Russians in their motherland. 
 Russia, in more ways than it may want to admit, has developed a desire for the suburban comforts of America. Anyone back here after a long sojourn may be surprised to discover that, at least in and around the major cities, you can often find almost anything sold in the New York metropolitan area. It is not just that many Soviet hardships have vanished. It is what has taken over: a rampant middle-class consumerism that feels very American.
 This is the new Russia that will have to win them over.
 If Richard and Cynthia Murphy (now exposed as Vladimir and Lydia Guryev) are homesick for Montclair, N.J., they can peruse the brochures for gated communities in the Moscow region. They might fancy Linden Park or Greenfield, or others with names right out of an American atlas, not to mention architectural touches that would warm the heart of any American striver.
 Remember the Murphys' hydrangeas, which became a symbol of the spy affair when a disbelieving neighbor remarked that they gardened like such ordinary suburbanites? Hydrangeas don't do so bad here, either.
 And it may be Moscow, but developers promote an important feature in these new houses -- central air-conditioning. American brands.
 In fact, the list of products that speak to the American middle-class lifestyle and have gained popularity in Russia is long. Procter & Gamble has one of its fastest-growing subsidiaries here, selling -- and widely advertising -- products like Tide, Pampers and Head & Shoulders.
 McDonald's and Starbucks continue to spread. So does Amway, that touchstone of American living-room marketing. Sales of its Nutrilite dietary supplements leaped 34 percent in 2009 in Russia from the previous year, despite the financial crisis.
 ''It used to be that these sleepers and spies were sent back and they were submerged into the gray Soviet reality after the bright West,'' said Sergei Chertoprud, a Moscow historian who studies the Soviet intelligence services. ''But now, these people today will be able to resettle not as intelligence officers but as average Russian citizens. Basically, they will be able to get what they had in the West.''
 Or maybe not. There is also the matter of political freedoms. It is not clear how much the faux Americans engaged in politics in the United States, but it is harder here to get your voice heard. While Russians no longer endure Soviet-type control, the Kremlin still dominates.
 And despite gains in the last decade, widespread economic inequality persists. Moscow, St. Petersburg and a few other cities are far wealthier than the rest of the land. So there is less opportunity for mobility.
 Many former spies in the Soviet era felt less deprived of goods -- they received more privileges than typical Soviet citizens -- than of connections to the lives they once had. The Soviet government was suspicious about their loyalties and kept them far away from foreigners and even foreign newspapers.
 The new arrivals will probably have it much easier. If Donald Howard Heathfield (now known as Andrey Bezrukov) wants to check in with his pals in the Boston area, he can conduct a video chat by walking into the nearest Internet cafe in Moscow. The F.S.B., the main successor to the K.G.B., may discourage him and the others from doing so, but it will be hard pressed to stop them, short of arresting them. The Internet in Russia is generally not censored.
 Anna Chapman, the 28-year-old whose attractiveness put her at the center of much media coverage, will have every opportunity to stay in the spotlight. Russian tabloids and Internet sites have shown as much interest in her as their counterparts in New York and London.
 ''They will be able to do whatever they want, without limits -- short of disclosing any intelligence secrets that they might know,'' said Pyotr Gavrish, editor of Razvedka (Reconnaissance), an independent magazine about the intelligence services. ''And Chapman, she has turned into this kind of media virus that shows no signs of stopping. In Russia, as abroad, there is no such thing as bad P.R.''
 ''This is a very new kind of spy situation, but one we are going to have to get used to,'' he said.
 While the former spies may not be jarred themselves, some have children, and they will be. It is unclear whether the children speak Russian (or even knew their parents were Russian).
 The Russian public education system can seem like a throwback. Public schools tend to be more academically rigorous than those in America, but they also rely more on rote learning and frown on individualism. Like the country in general, they are sometimes plagued by corruption, with educators demanding expensive gifts from parents for favorable treatment.
 ''The kids may experience culture shock,'' said Masha Charnay, 24, a freelance journalist who moved from Moscow to the Bronx at 13, and moved back here in 2008. ''My teachers here were extremely Soviet, and extremely corrupt. That is one of the reasons that I left Moscow.''
 Moscow does have several English-language private schools, which are largely for children of expatriates. But some Russians send their children, including some who were once abroad.
 For now, it seems as if the repatriates are in seclusion while intelligence officials question them. And then they will venture into a country that has changed rapidly in recent years. The question is whether the new face of Russia will be enough to allow them to forget the old days. Not everyone is convinced.
 ''I think that they will still have a lot of discomfort,'' said Aleksandr Kolpakidi, an intelligence historian in Moscow. ''They lived so many years in America. And we still have a massive number of problems here.''
 ''So, in the end, I think that they will want to go back. To America.''

HEADLINE: The Missing Mansion

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY. 
E-mail: streetscapes@nytimes.com

 BODY:
ALMOST everyone in New York knows the Frick Collection, at Fifth Avenue and 70th Street, and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, at Fifth and 91st, the pair of stupendous mansions built by the steel titans Henry Clay Frick and Andrew Carnegie. But their architectural majesty was only two-thirds of a ferric triad, the last the house of Charles M. Schwab, the Carnegie protege who became the head of United States Steel and then Bethlehem Steel.
Schwab had the most impressive site of the three, a full block overlooking the Hudson River, but it survived barely four decades. 
Born in 1862, Schwab at age 18 was a stake driver for one of the Carnegie steel mills, and at 21 chief engineer. In 1897, and only 35, he became the president of the Carnegie Steel Company, a part of Andrew Carnegie's steel empire in which Henry Frick was a partner.
Four years later, Schwab helped arrange the creation of the giant U. S. Steel Corporation. By this time Frick and Carnegie were bitter enemies, whereas Schwab remained devoted to Carnegie, whom he called the greatest steel man who ever lived.
Like Frick and Carnegie, Schwab migrated to New York from Pennsylvania, in his case in 1901. In the 1880s the common prediction was that the rich would jump from Fifth Avenue to Riverside Drive, creating a string of freestanding villas. But by the mid-1890s it became clear that the elite would continue to reside along the spine of Fifth Avenue.
Someone forgot to tell Schwab, because in 1901 he bought the block from Riverside to West End, between 73rd and 74th Streets; no one in Manhattan had yet acquired an entire block for occupancy. Schwab finished his 50,000-square-foot, 75-room house in 1905, with a gym, a bowling alley, a pool, three elevators and interiors in the styles of Henry IV, Louis XIII, Louis XV and Louis XVI.
The exterior, though, was what was singular, surrounded by a garden the size of a small park. The French architect Maurice Hebert created a chilly granite facade derived from the chateaus of Chenonceau, Azay-le-Rideau and, at the rear, Blois. On his letterhead, Hebert called himself a ''Specialist for Reproduction of Historical Exteriors and Classical Interiors.''
A critic writing in The Architectural Record in 1907 considered the Schwab mansion ''humdrum,'' a copyist's work that might have succeeded if the copyist had been faithful to the originals, instead of trying to improve on them. It was the apotheosis of French Renaissance architecture in New York -- just as the style was going out of fashion.
Schwab, however, never expressed anything but pleasure with his American chateau, although in 1925 a real estate broker claimed that he had been asked to sell the property for $3 million; the flight from big houses to apartment buildings had been under way for a decade.
Early in 1930 The New York Times reported that Schwab was about to lease the block to developers with plans for a 30-story apartment building. But in October a census-taker found Schwab at home with his wife, Eurana, and 20 servants, mostly English-born.
Schwab was not the typical hard-bitten steel executive, and considered himself a dreamer, often saying it was pure luck that he had wound up as one of the richest men in the country. He supported, at least at first, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's initiatives in the area of social security and unemployment insurance, telling The Times in 1932, ''Once working men were treated as machines; now they are treated like human beings.''
Both Carnegie and Frick had been dead for years in 1936, when Schwab asked New York City to buy his house as a mayoral residence, a suggestion Mayor Fiorello La Guardia flatly opposed. The Times described Schwab as ''extremely anxious to sell.''
In January 1939 his wife of more than 50 years died, and two months later he moved to a hotel. He died six months after that. In 1945 The Times reported that the mansion was listed with a city clearinghouse for housing ''to help relieve the shortage of apartments,'' and the next year the paper called it ''the white elephant on the mansion market,'' with real estate taxes of $60,000 per year.
Finally, in 1948 the Schwab mansion was very publicly demolished, succeeded in 1950 by the quotidian but efficient Schwab House, an 18-story apartment building.
How is it that the houses of Carnegie and Frick have survived, while Schwab's has vanished?
Frick had planned his house from the beginning as a museum, and had an art collection worthy of one, whereas Schwab built entirely for his own pleasure. The Carnegie house went to the Columbia University School of Social Work and then to the Cooper-Hewitt, but Schwab was trying to sell his house until the last.
There was also the ambition of Schwab's vision. Both his colleagues put up relatively restrained houses, although larger than most others. Carnegie took over about half a block, Frick about a third, but Schwab used an entire city block, leaving more than half of it open space.
The ebullient Schwab bet everything on bringing the Loire Valley to New York, but in the end his chateau was not so much out of place on the Hudson as out of step with the city.

 CORRECTION:
The Streetscapes column last Sunday, about a mansion on Riverside Drive built by the steel titan Charles M. Schwab, misidentified the educational institution that was affiliated at one point with a mansion on Fifth Avenue built by his contemporary, Andrew Carnegie. It was part of Columbia University, not Hunter College.

HEADLINE: Veteran Players Lobby U.S.G.A. For a Women's Senior Open

BYLINE: By KAREN CROUSE

 BODY:
OAKMONT, Pa. -- On a golf range last fall in Palm Harbor, Fla., a woman in a row of middle-aged professional players advanced the idea of trying to qualify for the next United States Senior Open, a tournament associated with men but technically not limited to them. 
 The symphony of pings and thwacks stopped, replaced by a chorus of ''Yeah!'' and ''Let's do it.'' 
 The golfers were members of the L.P.G.A.'s Legends Tour, meaning they were old enough to have grown up playing on boys' teams because there were no girls' squads, but at the same time young and idealistic enough to believe they will see the last gender barriers in golf crumble. 
 ''When you look at the list of championships that the U.S.G.A. runs, there's a championship for every population except for senior women professionals,'' the golfer Martha Nause said. ''People have been asking for years, 'Can we please have a U.S. Women's Senior Open?' '' 
 Nause, who won three events, including a major, on the L.P.G.A. Tour, became an agent of change that day on the range. She marked the 2010 Senior Open at Sahalee Country Club in Washington on her calendar, and as it happened, one of the qualifying sites was Nause's home course in Minnesota. 
 ''So I thought why not?'' she said. 
 Nause, 55, paid the $150 entry fee for last month's 18-hole event. When she appeared on the first tee, her playing partner asked why she was not competing in the Women's Senior Open. 
 Because there isn't one, she told him. His reply, Nause said, was, ''Well, there ought to be,'' which did not come across as magnanimous as it sounds. 
 ''I kind of sensed that he thought there should be one so I wouldn't be out there trying to take one of their spots,'' she said. 
 Nause shot a 79 and missed qualifying by seven strokes.
 ''I didn't come very close,'' she said, ''but I didn't come in last.'' 
 Nause, the men's and women's golf coach at Division III Macalester College in St. Paul, was the oldest competitor in this weekend's United States Women's Open at Oakmont Country Club, and to her great relief she did not come in last. 
 Joining her in the 156-player field were five other women who are at least 45, the minimum age for Legends Tour membership: Helen Alfredsson, Juli Inkster, Lorie Kane, Michele Redman and Sherri Steinhauer. 
 They continue to compete against players young enough to be their daughters because it beats trying to compete against men their age. And if they want to test themselves in a United States Golf Association competition, those are their only options. 
 The first time Amy Alcott, a member of the L.P.G.A. Tour and the World Golf Hall of Fame, broached the subject of a Women's Senior Open with a U.S.G.A. official, she said she was told there were not enough older golfers for a competitive field. 
 Alcott, 54, laughed. ''That was many, many years ago,'' she said in a telephone interview. ''A lot of us are now plenty old enough.'' 
 The men's United States Senior Open was first played in 1980, the same year the senior circuit now known as the Champions Tour was established. The success of that tour, fueled by the 51-year-old Arnold Palmer's arrival in 1981, has extended the careers of marquee players while launching the professional golf careers of a host of middle-aged Walter Mittys. 
 Alcott, who won the United States Girls Junior Amateur and the United States Women's Open, said a Women's Senior Open would increase the Legends Tour's visibility and provide middle-aged women with an incentive to keep their games sharp.
 ''You have to have a place to play,'' Alcott said. ''The players of my generation still want to play. The guys I grew up with, they've had a place to continue their careers. Why shouldn't we have the same opportunity?''
 She added: ''I understand that in this economy getting the support and sponsorship is not an easy thing. But the U.S.G.A. is the watchdog of golf. They need to do the right thing.'' 
 David Fay, the executive director of the U.S.G.A., said the organization had talked about adding a Senior Women's Open. 
 ''It's been discussed formally most every year,'' he said, adding: ''I imagine there will be one at some point, but there are a lot of factors to consider. We have a certain standard for our championships in terms of the quality of the course, in terms of a meaningful purse, in terms of presenting it properly. So you factor in all of that. Right now we're not there.'' 
 He added, ''You don't want to have a standalone event like having Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors go out and bat it around using vintage rackets.'' 
 Fay pointed out that the PGA had its senior championship decades before the U.S.G.A. introduced the Senior Open. 
 ''The PGA Tour was fully supportive of this because that was in the genesis of creating what's now known as the Champions Tour,'' he said, adding, ''Right now, the environment for women's professional golf at the older level, it's not truly a tour.'' 
 The Legends Tour, which Jane Blalock, a 27-time winner on the L.P.G.A. Tour, founded in 2001, runs from August to November. There are six tournaments on this year's schedule and Blalock, the tour's chief executive and president, said she was in discussions to add events and sponsors. 
 Blalock said she knew there was an audience for older women golfers because of the number of fans at a one-day event in Rochester -- featuring former greats like herself, Nancy Lopez, Sandra Haynie, Pat Bradley and Kathy Whitworth -- that was held the week of the 2006 Wegmans Rochester L.P.G.A. 
 ''They had 26,000 people show up,'' Blalock said. ''That was more than they had during the weekend.'' 
 More recently, at the L.P.G.A. Championship near Rochester last month, Lopez, 53, the Palmer of women's golf, attracted the largest galleries. With the youngest of her three daughters entering college this fall, Lopez is free, for the first time in two decades, to devote all her energies to golf. The desire is there, she said, but the opportunities are lacking. 
 ''I've been working my butt off hitting balls and working on my swing a little bit,'' she said. 
 Just think, Blalock said; if there were a Women's Senior Open, Lopez could be crowned champion by the U.S.G.A., a professional coronation that eluded her in 25 Women's Open appearances. 
 ''There's no doubt in my mind there will be a U.S. Women's Senior Open,'' Alcott said, ''because Michelle Wie is going to be 45 someday and it might tickle her fancy, like it would mine, to have an event to play.''
 In 2006, Wie made it to the final round of qualifying for the men's United States Open. Four years later, Nause tried to blaze her own trail. What if it hadn't grown cold and she had qualified? 
 ''I don't know if I actually would have played, to be honest with you,'' she said, sheepishly, adding, ''I'm not a rabble-rouser.''

HEADLINE: Killer Whales, Jazz Cats and Motor City Soul

BYLINE: By NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
School of Seven Bells
 This New York electro-pop band consists of identical twins, Alejandra and Claudia Deheza, and a compatible outsider, Benjamin Curtis, who, until recently, was better known as a member of Secret Machines. On ''Disconnect From Desire'' (Vagrant/Ghostly International), the group's intoxicating second album, that arrangement of personnel feels as crucial as a circulatory system, and about as unnoticeable. Most of these songs feature tandem vocals by the Deheza sisters, singing in a cool, high ether; the effect can suggest Stereolab, especially on ''Babelonia.'' But the sonic impression of the group ends up owing more to dream-pop bands like the Cocteau Twins (which of course involved no actual twins). The lyrics revolve around perception and expectation, fate and free will, with the occasional blush of poetic overstatement. (''The machine of will that shakes me constantly/Makes the silence behind me snarl like a swarm of bees.'') Now and then, though, the band unfurls a plain-spoken sentiment. There isn't likely to be a more graceful breakup song this year than ''I L U,'' or one more tersely affecting.
 Anthony Braxton and Gerry Hemingway 
 The saxophonist Anthony Braxton and the drummer Gerry Hemingway share a discrete chunk of the new-music timeline: From the early 1980s through the mid-'90s, when Mr. Hemingway was a member of Mr. Braxton's quartet. The two musicians hadn't worked seriously together for over a decade when they recorded some duo improvisations a few years ago at Wesleyan University, where Mr. Braxton enjoys a magisterial tenure. ''Old Dogs (2007)'' (Mode/Avant) gathers the music on four CDs, each conveying an on-the-fly formal coherence, and each otherwise distinct. (''Invention 8207AM,'' Disc 3, strikes me as the best of the batch. For now.) Mr. Braxton ranges broadly within the saxophone family, from B-flat contrabass to E-flat sopranino, and Mr. Hemingway supplements his drum kit with samplers, harmonica, mallet percussion and occasional vocals. Their output feels both sweeping and intimate, never glib, and rich with unfolding possibility.
 Dirty Projectors and Bjork
 Meticulous caprice has a safe harbor in the music of David Longstreth, the guitarist-singer-composer behind Dirty Projectors, and much the same could be said of Bjork, the offbeat Icelandic pop star. It seemed perfect, then, that those forces would converge for ''Mount Wittenberg Orca,'' a suite of songs inspired by whales, performed last year at the Housing Works Bookstore Cafe in SoHo. The suite is now available in a studio version at mountwittenbergorca.com, with proceeds going toward the support of marine protected areas, a cause that complements the songs. (''Here's a sharing orb of water,'' Bjork sings. ''We all call her our mother.'') Musically the EP builds on certain Dirty Projectors trademarks, notably the pinpoint-precise vocal arrangements carried out by Amber Coffman, Haley Dekle and Angel Deradoorian. Their hocketed-triplet arpeggios on ''When the World Comes to an End'' make up a feat that rattled in my head for weeks after the Housing Works premiere.
 Dwele
 This Detroit soul singer has earned some recent attention for his role in ''Power,'' the emphatic new single from Kanye West. His own current release, ''W.ants W.orld W.omen'' (E1), strikes a less defiant tone, beginning with a disclosure about alter egos and Gucci accessories (news flash: the two are closely related) and moving on to a mildly confused potpourri of seduction soundtracks and social critique. The title of the album reflects Dwele's attempt at a tripartite theme, but really it's all one trip, occasionally sweetened by a sympathetic guest turn: Slum Village on the recession-flavored ''How I Deal,'' Raheem DeVaughn on the self-explanatory ''Dim the Lights.'' The album's best feature is its loose, nearly improvisational feel, which is manifested both in the limber vocals and the Stevie Wonder-esque backing. But that feel is also a limitation, often translating as a lack of focus and a source of false confidence. ''I wish I made music that appealed to the masses/ Instead of writing lyrics that require poetic passes,'' Dwele half-raps early on. He doesn't mean it, but what difference would it make if he did?
 Barry Harris
 The bebop pianist Barry Harris communicates elegance and erudition in all that he touches, but he's also a decidedly old-school jazz foot soldier, committed to breezy wit and companionable slang. ''Live in Rennes'' (Plus Loin) finds him in excellent form at a festival in Brittany, France, last fall, not quite six weeks before his 80th birthday. He's working with what amounts to a good pickup rhythm section, and he's rummaging through his carry-on for repertory: songs by Thelonious Monk, Duke Ellington and Charlie Parker, with a few originals and songbook staples mixed in. The album nicely captures his blend of the casual and the courtly, including his banter with the audience. It's a document worthy of Mr. Harris, and an appetite-whetting prelude to his next trio engagement at the Village Vanguard, from July 20 through 25 (villagevanguard.com).

HEADLINE: Glimpses of Cuba And Its Paradoxes

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
After half a century of distrust and outright enmity, Cuba and the United States are separated by perhaps the widest 90 miles on earth. Our near-but-far, far-but-near relationship comes through repeatedly in the striking paintings, photographs and sculptures that make up ''Cuba Avant-Garde,'' the new show at the Katonah Museum of Art. 
 Subtitled ''Contemporary Cuban Art From the Farber Collection,'' this lively, wide-ranging exhibition bristles with artistic energy and cultural contradictions. 
 Equally exposed to the iconography of the Soviet Union and the United States, Cuban artists borrow freely from both. Eduardo Ponjuan Gonzalez and Rene Francisco Rodriguez Hernandez, who work in tandem as Ponjuan-Rene Francisco, illustrate this tension in ''Outside Cuba Inside,'' a 1993 oil painting that juxtaposes bright propaganda images from Russia (a cheery peasant woman from a Malevich painting) and America (Norman Rockwell's Rosie the Riveter), with Cuba symbolically caught in the middle.
 Irony would seem to be a birthright for artists who, steeped in a communitarian island culture, have become global art celebrities. On the one hand, they live under a repressive Communist dictatorship -- see the images Angel Delgado inked onto handkerchiefs in the 1990s, after being jailed for a scatological work of performance art. On the other, they currently operate in a kind of alternate economy, free to earn dollars by selling their work abroad. 
 The pieces in ''Cuba Avant-Garde'' were made between 1983 and 2004, a period of ferment not just in Cuban art but in Cuba. The flowering of an avant-garde scene in the early '80s was followed by the ''special period,'' the economic crisis -- and crackdown -- resulting from the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989. Many artists fled; many artists stayed. In both cases, the work in this show often reflects an almost obsessive investigation into what the exhibition catalog calls ''Cubanidad.'' 
 Evidence of Cuba's folk art traditions can be seen in the simple forms, basic colors and rural subject matter of Manuel Mendive Hoyo's ''The Sons of Water, Talking to a Fish'' (''Los Hijos del Agua, Conversando con un Pez''), a 2001 sculpture whose charmingly polka-dotted fisherman and huge open-mouthed fish commune in a small boat atop a rippling blue sea. For an American, it calls to mind Ernest Hemingway's Cuba-set novella ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' but in fact the work references the animism of an African-based religion to which Mr. Mendive adheres. 
 Fernando Rodriguez Falcon taps into the same traditions and naive style, but to more mordant and ironic ends. In ''Nuptial Dream'' (''Sueno Nupcial''), his 1994 series of carved and painted wood panels, a young Fidel Castro marries Our Lady of Charity of El Cobre, Cuba's patron saint. But the wedding is presented not as fact or myth but as the dream of Mr. Rodriguez's alter ego, a blind Cuban peasant who, like Mr. Mendive, lived through Mr. Castro's revolution. To Mr. Rodriguez, born in 1970, the revolution is ancient history, subject to re-evaluation. 
 Whatever their personal politics, both Mr. Rodriguez and Mr. Mendive have remained in Cuba. But their expatriate counterparts -- those taken out of the country as children and those living abroad by choice -- seem no less preoccupied with their homeland.
 ''The Raft'' (''La Patera,'' 2002), the show's emblematic work, reproduced on the catalog cover and on the Web, is a large-format watercolor by Armando Marino, who lives in Spain. Its red-and-white 1950s American auto body -- the kind that provided Havana with its taxi fleet -- is supported not by four wheels but by a crowded mass of barefoot legs. The image functions as both comedy and tragedy, offering homage to the Cuban population's resilience in the face of scarcity and sardonic comment on the dilapidated state of the country. 
 In his cryptic painting ''The Island Waits for a Signal'' (''La Isla Esperando una Senal,'' 2002), another exile, Jose Braulio Bedia Valdes, conflates the image of a rocky island with that of a man's head looking toward an onrushing ball of light. And Ruben Torres Llorca reflects on the dispersal of his generation of artists in the haunting ''What We Were Then, We Are No Longer'' (''Nosotros los de Entonces, Ya No Somos los Mismos,'' 1987), a mixed-media collage anchored by a 1981 photograph of artists, Mr. Torres included, who had shown their work in the seminal Havana exhibition ''Volumen I.''
 The Katonah exhibition, which originated at the Samuel P. Harn Museum at the University of Florida in Gainesville, also includes work that at first appears to have no specifically Cuban content, like Belkis Ayon Manso's richly textured, semiabstract 1996 collograph, ''Untitled No. 3'' (''Sin Titulo Numero 3''). 
 A closer look at the label shows that Ms. Ayon, who committed suicide in 1999, was inserting a female form into imagery representing Abakua, a secret, all-male society that dates to colonial times, when it came to Cuba from West Africa. With its sheer beauty, the print dispels the distance between the viewer and the artist; with its hidden meaning, undecipherable to an American, it makes 90 miles seem unbridgeable.

HEADLINE: A Big Kick for Spain

BYLINE: By CARLOS RUIZ ZAFON. 
Carlos Ruiz Zafon is the author, most recently, of ''The Angel's Game.''

 BODY:
HIS name is Paul, he has eight legs and he flaunts a flexibility that would put to shame the ethics code of any self-respecting investment bank on Wall Street. What's more, he's one of the stars of the World Cup blazing on zillions of TV screens around the world. Yet Paul has never set foot on a soccer field, never kicked a ball and to this day most of his running has been devoted to chasing lobsters. Paul, you see, is an octopus. 
 OctoPaul is, at present, an inmate at the Oberhausen aquarium in Germany, where he has entered the V.I.P. lounge of animal oracle lore due to the uncanny precision in his predictions on the outcome of crucial sports events. He works his magic according to a strict procedure: his caretakers introduce into his tank two boxes containing the flags of the opposing teams (and a mussel in each for him to snack on, post-decision). Then, while the world news media eagerly waits, OctoPaul, cucumber-cool and donning his trademark deep-thinking face, settles on one of them. 
 He deserves his own show in Vegas plus a cut of the action because, these days, the smart money is on Paul's side, whichever he chooses. Some claim his infallibility nears that of the pope, while others, enraged by his prophecies, have complained that Paul should be served in a garlicky sauce with potatoes and parsley. Recently, Paul did it again, correctly predicting that Spain, sporting her best team in many years, would defeat the stellar German team last Wednesday. 
 Spain's victory, won with a magnificent head strike from Barcelona's Carles Puyol, set a historical mark: for the first time the Spanish team has advanced to the World Cup final. Thousands and thousands of Spanish fans in dire need of good news have taken to the streets in joy. 
 Good news in Spain, as in most of the Western world, has proved scarce in recent times -- so, yes, we'll take any glimpse of the stocking we can get. But it's true: what sense of unity and positive energy Spaniards have experienced in the past few months, that rare feeling of ''getting it right,'' has come almost exclusively from our athletes, from Rafa Nadal's No. 1 tennis ranking and eight Grand Slam titles to Pau Gasol's recent triumph with the Los Angeles Lakers. Meanwhile, corruption scandals and somber economic signs and the farcical battles of everyday politics loom over perhaps too much circus and not enough bread. 
 I confess I was never a great soccer fan, yet in the last few days, seeing the sense of joy and passion the game is bringing to the lives of Spaniards looking to cheer for something or someone actually worth it, I've been following the World Cup and rooting for the team to crown what is already a job well done. Like a steamy summer romance, this euphoria cannot last long, but it sure is nice while it does. What the future will bring, maybe only Paul the Octopus knows. And by the way, Paul predicted Spain will win the final.
 Which brings me to ponder if such a wise and charming creature shouldn't be granted an amnesty and a return to the ocean. Or maybe it would be wiser to extend his contract and appoint him to higher responsibilities. Because when all the wonderful sound and fury of the World Cup has faded, it would be swell to have someone honest, decent and smart to point the way ahead. And these days, the more you look around, the more an octopus serving time in a German aquarium looks like a contender. 
 So, may the best win, and may that optimistic, hard-working spirit the Spanish team has displayed so far permeate other spheres of the country's public life that could use a serious kick. Perhaps that, beyond Sunday's chance at glory, should be the real goal. For once the game is over, all eyes must go back to the ball.

HEADLINE: Seeing The Forest For Its Hedges

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
FOR decades, some university endowments, pension funds and other big investors have put part of their money to work in the woods. They've bought large tracts of timberland, viewing them as an asset class separate from stocks, bonds and other forms of real estate.
 Jeremy Grantham, co-founder and chief investment strategist at GMO, the asset manager based in Boston, calls timber ''a perfect investment'' for someone with a time horizon of, say, 20 years or more. ''Timber is safer than stocks but not quite as safe as Treasury inflation-protected bonds,'' he said. ''And as long as the sun shines and the rain rains, trees grow.''
 Timber also acts as an inflation hedge. ''If you look at commodities, you find a pattern that all of them, except timber, had a declining real price up until 10 years ago,'' Mr. Grantham said. ''But standing timber has a long-term record of modestly rising prices.'' 
 Retail investors, for the most part, haven't been able to exploit the investment benefits of timberland because acquiring it has demanded too much money and expertise. A typical swath of Georgia pine or Maine spruce could sell for millions of dollars, and buying it required knowledge that couldn't be gleaned from typical investment books. A buyer had to understand land, lumber and even bugs, said Bob L. Izlar, director of the Center for Forest Business at the University of Georgia.
 After all, an insect infestation can destroy a stand of trees just as surely as a financial crisis can bring down a bank. 
 ''The mountain pine beetle has eaten 70 million acres of timber in Canada,'' Mr. Izlar said. 
 Lately, however, novices have been invited to play in the woods. Over the last three years, exchange-traded funds have been introduced that, in theory, provide easier access to the diversification benefits of timber. The Claymore/Beacon Global Timber Index E.T.F. and the iShares S.&P. Global Timber and Forestry Index fund buy securities like timber-related stocks and real estate investment trusts. 
 ''The traditional timber market had very high barriers to entry,'' said Steven A. Baffico, head of United States retail distribution for Guggenheim Claymore. Besides being costly and hard to understand, it required that investors lock up their cash. Unloading timberland can take anywhere from six months to two years, Mr. Baffico said. And if you want to enjoy the full benefit of your investment, you may have to wait decades for trees to mature.
 In contrast, an exchange-traded fund holding easy-to-trade stocks and REITs gives investors the ability to sell shares daily: it may lack larches and lodgepoles but compensates with convenience. Besides, companies in the Claymore/Beacon index, like Weyerhaeuser, often own ample acres themselves, Mr. Baffico said.
 ''Beacon measures the amount of timber ownership of the underlying companies,'' he added. ''We want a good proxy for the timber industry at large.'' 
 Experts are divided over whether E.T.F.'s can replicate timberland closely enough to serve as a substitute investment. 
 Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, likes the diversification that timberland investments bring: he said that the returns correlate less with, say, United States stocks than Western European stocks would. As a result, timberland might help to prop up the value of a portfolio during a bear market. 
 E.T.F.'s, by design, dilute that benefit, Professor Lo said. Someone like David F. Swensen, head of Yale's endowment and a pioneering timber investor, ''is buying actual forests and getting direct exposure to the asset,'' he said. ''E.T.F.'s don't do that, so they're changing the investment focus.''
 Because they own shares of companies, not just land and trees, E.T.F.'s are making bets on all timber-related sectors of the economy -- everything from papermaking to homebuilding. As a result, their long-term price performance could end up correlated more with stocks than with timberlands, Professor Lo said. 
 ''The jury is still out on whether E.T.F.'s can provide the kind of exposure to timber that David Swensen can get for Yale,'' he said. ''If they do, they could add value for investors.'' 
 J. Brian Fiacco, owner of Timberlands Strategies in Summerville, S.C., advises institutional investors on timber purchases, and has concluded that E.T.F.'s are not an accurate proxy for timberland. Too many of the companies that they hold no longer own much, if any, actual timber, he said. Consider International Paper, whose shares are owned by both iShares and Claymore Beacon. It sold the bulk of its timberland to focus on manufacturing, he said. 
 In addition to E.T.F.'s, investors can buy shares of timber REIT's. The United States has three -- Plum Creek, Potlatch and Rayonier -- and Weyerhaeuser is taking steps to become one. All four have substantial land holdings. For example, Plum Creek, based in Seattle, owns seven million acres in 19 states. 
 Although the REITs are closer to a timber pure play than the E.T.F.'s, they are still likely to be more correlated with Wall Street than with the woods, Mr. Fiacco said. So he is skeptical of using them to achieve diversification.
 INSTEAD, he advocates the old-fashioned path of just buying timberland. That's more expensive and time-consuming than buying a security, but may not be out of reach for some affluent people. ''You can own small tracts,'' he said. ''I have 58 acres right outside of Charleston. I also own 150 acres in the northern Adirondacks.'' 
 Timberland brokers and appraisers can help with the identification and evaluation of properties, and buyers can pool their funds with other people to reduce their risk, he said. A group of friends might form a limited liability corporation and buy a few hundred, or even a few thousand, acres. 
 To be affordable, the land would probably have to be a long drive from, say, New York City or Boston -- perhaps in the Adirondacks or rural Maine, he said. And as the trees grow, the land could produce a modest flow of cash through a hunting lease.
 ''It's both possible and practical,'' Mr. Fiacco said. ''Your timberlands don't have to be diversified. If you're a huge timberland investor, yes, the age and diversity of the trees and the region of the country -- all of that stuff matters. But the average investor, who already has a 401(k) and stocks and bonds, if they buy one tract of timberland, that's additional diversification.''

HEADLINE: Tesla May Get Some Company: The Supercar Goes Electric

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
INTRODUCED in New York in 1954, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL was a stunningly advanced machine, the first production car to trade a carburetor for fuel injection.
 Now, with the SLS AMG echoing the style of that original gullwing sports car, Mercedes may produce an electric version that could give the company environmental bragging rights. Mercedes is testing the prototype SLS AMG E-Cell, in which the standard model's 563-horsepower gasoline V-8 has been replaced with four electric motors, one powering each wheel, that spool up 535 horsepower and 649 pound-feet of peak torque. 
 Mercedes estimates a 0-to-60 time of four seconds flat for the electric SLS, just a few tenths slower than the gasoline version. Power is stored in a liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery; brakes capture energy and return it to the battery.
 Ola Kallenius, chairman of Mercedes's AMG high-performance division, said the company was considering a small production run for the SLS E-Cell.
 At a recent presentation for the car in Norway, a retired Formula One racer, David Coulthard, tested the E-Cell on an airstrip and public roads. His drive and commentary were documented on Web video. ''My first experience of an electric car,'' Mr. Coulthard said, emerging from the E-Cell with a grin. ''You will not believe the performance.''
 The E-Cell, along with cars like the new S400 hybrid sedan, shows Mercedes shifting more of its renowned technical resources toward increasing fuel economy and developing alternative propulsion systems. Mercedes, which has paid more than $300 million in federal fines since 1983 for falling short of fuel-economy standards -- thanks largely to its fuel-sucking AMG models -- has vowed to improve mileage and avoid the fines.
 Mercedes has not disclosed a potential price, driving range or top speed for the E-Cell, though the basics are easily surmised: it is likely to cost more than the gas model, with much less range and a lower top speed -- perhaps 120 miles per hour instead of 197.
 Audi may beat Mercedes to market: its E-tron, with an estimated 313 horsepower and a driving range beyond 150 miles, goes on sale in about two years. For now, the $110,000 Tesla Roadster remains the market's only high-performance electric car. Like the Tesla, the SLS E-Cell looks like catnip for early adopters with its enormous, silent power, no tailpipe emissions and no taste for fossil fuel. An electric SLS would also offer more luxury and more space for two people and their luggage than the tiny, bare-bones Tesla.

HEADLINE: Hayek: The Back Story

BYLINE: By JENNIFER SCHUESSLER. 
Jennifer Schuessler is an editor at the Book Review.

 BODY:
Last month, a funny thing happened on the way to the best-seller list. A 66-year-old treatise by a long-dead Austrian-born economist began flying off the shelves, following an hourlong endorsement from a right-wing television host better known for pumping political thrillers than for rocking political theory.
 The economist was Friedrich von Hayek, the book was ''The Road to Serfdom'' and the host was Glenn Beck, who compared Hayek's book to ''a Mike Tyson (in his prime) right hook to socialism in Western Europe and in the United States.'' As it happens, ''The Road to Serfdom'' -- a classic attack on government planning as an inevitable step toward totalitarianism, published in 1944 and kept in print since then by the University of Chicago Press -- had already begun a comeback of sorts. It sold 27,000 copies in 2009, up from about 7,000 a year before the inauguration of Barack Obama. But Beck's endorsement catapulted the book to No. 1 at Amazon.com, bringing a temporary end to at least one tyranny, that of Stieg Larsson. Since the program was broadcast on June 8, 100,000 copies have been sold. 
 That's an impressive number for an academic-press book, if a bit anemic compared with the 1.2 million views for ''Fear the Boom and Bust,'' a Hayek versus John Maynard Keynes rap video that went up on YouTube in January. (Kickoff line: ''Party at the Fed!'') But in fact ''The Road to Serfdom'' has a long history of timely assists from the popular media.
 When Hayek began formulating his ideas in the early 1930s, he was an emigre professor at the London School of Economics, watching events in both Europe and Britain with alarm. Like many others, Hayek was frightened by the rise of Nazism. He interpreted it, however, in an unorthodox way, not as the defeat of democratic socialism but as its logical culmination. Hayek started writing the book after World War II began, as a contribution to the war effort. Looking ahead, ''Hayek was also worried about what would transpire if the Allies won,'' as Bruce Caldwell puts it in his introduction to ''THE ROAD TO SERFDOM'': Text and Documents -- The Definitive Edition (University of Chicago, $17). In ominously titled chapters like ''The Totalitarians in Our Midst'' and ''Why the Worst Get on Top,'' Hayek laid out his case against ''socialists of all parties'' who he believed were leading the Western democracies into tyranny that mirrored the centrally planned societies of Germany and the Soviet Union.
 This theme, being taken up today by Beck and other antigovernment sorts, had a plausible basis at the time. Caldwell quotes a 1942 Labour Party pamphlet that declared, ''There must be no return to the unplanned competitive world of the interwar years. . . . A planned society must replace the old competitive system.''
 When it appeared in 1944, ''The Road to Serfdom'' received a courteous if mixed reception in Britain (where paper shortages limited the print run). Keynes, Hayek's friend and lifelong intellectual opponent, called it ''a grand book,'' adding, ''Morally and philosophically, I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it.'' George Orwell, more equivocal, conceded that Hayek ''is probably right'' about the ''totalitarian-minded'' nature of intellectuals but concluded that he ''does not see, or will not admit, that a return to 'free' competition means for the great mass of people a tyranny probably worse . . . than that of the state.''
 It was in the United States, however, that Hayek met with his greatest success -- and the most intense hostility. Rejected by several trade publishers, ''The Road to Serfdom'' was picked up by Chicago, which scheduled a modest print run. It got a boost when Henry Hazlitt, a prominent free-marketeer, assessing it on the cover of The New York Times Book Review in September 1944, proclaimed it ''one of the most important books of our generation,'' a call to ''all those who are sincere democrats and liberals at heart to stop, look and listen.'' The political scientist Herman Finer, on the other hand, denounced it as ''the most sinister offensive against democracy to emerge from a democratic country for many years.'' But the most important response came from the staunchly anti-Communist Reader's Digest, which ran a condensed version of the book in April 1945, with reprints available through the Book of the Month Club for 5 cents each. The condensation sold more than a million copies.
 Reading the book today, it's easy to see why Hayek's message caught on with a public divided over the New Deal, struggling with the transition from a regulated wartime economy and concerned about rising Soviet power. But unlike some of his champions in 2010, Hayek didn't oppose all forms of government intervention. ''The preservation of competition,'' he wrote, is not ''incompatible with an extensive system of social services -- so long as the organization of these services is not designed in such a way as to make competition ineffective over wide fields.'' This qualification, however, was left out of a comic-book version of ''The Road to Serfdom'' printed in Look magazine in 1945 (and distributed as a pamphlet by General Motors), which showed well-intentioned regulation giving way to more sinister forms of control. ''In an unsuccessful effort to educate people to uniform views,'' one caption read, '''planners' establish a giant propaganda machine -- which coming dictator will find handy.''
 While Hayek, who moved to the University of Chicago in 1950, built an ardent following of admirers (including Milton Friedman), his fame gradually waned. By the time he won the Nobel Prize in 1974 he was largely forgotten by the public and marginalized within his profession. In graduate programs in the early 1980s, the economist William Easterly recalled recently on his blog, ''Hayek was seen as so far right that you would be considered a nut to read him.'' (His sunny view of the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet probably didn't help.)
 Today, Hayek continues to inspire noisy ideological debate. In his recent book ''Ill Fares the Land,'' a passionate defense of the democratic socialist ideal, the historian Tony Judt writes that Hayek would have been (justly) doomed to obscurity if not for the financial difficulty experienced by the welfare state, which was exploited by conservatives like Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. The economist Paul Samuelson, in a reminiscence of Hayek published last December, was more dismissive still. ''Where are their horror camps?'' he asked, referring to right-wing bugaboos like Sweden, with its generous welfare spending. Almost 70 years after Hayek sounded his alarm, ''hindsight confirms how inaccurate its innuendo about the future turned out to be.''
 Hayek also cropped up in the recent controversy over the Texas Board of Education's new high school curriculum, which will now include him and Friedman alongside Adam Smith, Karl Marx and Keynes. In a post on The Times's Freakonomics blog, Justin Wolfers, a professor at the Wharton School, noted that a search of scholarly literature found Hayek, with a mere 1,745 references, lagging far behind Smith (25,626), Keynes (4,945), Friedman (8,924) and even Lawrence Summers (2,064). ''The message from the Texas Board of Education seems to be: If you can't win in the marketplace of ideas, turn to government institutions to prop you up,'' Wolfers wrote, adding sardonically, ''I don't think Hayek would approve.''
 Another blogger, redoing Hayek's count, tallied 9,385 citations. But intellectual legacies don't stand or fall on such bean-counting. Besides, Hayek, whose later work on the self-organizing nature of information has been influential far beyond economics, himself said ''The Road to Serfdom'' was more a ''political book'' than an economic one.
 But how relevant is the book to Glenn Beck's America? In his 1960 essay ''Why I Am Not a Conservative,'' Hayek observed, ''Conservatism may often be a useful practical maxim, but it does not give us any guiding principles which can influence long-range developments.'' Then again, his own strange road to best-sellerdom illustrates that a book's reputation can be determined not just by its contents but by the company it keeps.

HEADLINE: Til Death Do They Part

BYLINE: By KERRY HOWLEY. 
Kerry Howley is an arts fellow in the University of Iowa's literary nonfiction program. This is her first article for the magazine.

 BODY:
There are ways of speaking about dying that very much annoy Peggy Jackson, an affable and rosy-cheeked hospice worker in Arlington, Va. She doesn't like the militant cast of ''lost her battle with,'' as in, ''She lost her battle with cancer.'' She is similarly displeased by ''We have run out of options'' and ''There is nothing left we can do,'' when spoken by doctor to patient, implying as these phrases will that hospice care is not an ''option'' or a ''thing'' that can be done. She doesn't like these phrases, but she tolerates them. The one death-related phrase she will not abide, will not let into her house under any circumstance, is ''cryonic preservation,'' by which is meant the low-temperature preservation of human beings in the hope of future resuscitation. That this will be her husband's chosen form of bodily disposition creates, as you might imagine, certain complications in the Jackson household. 
 ''You have to understand,'' says Peggy, who at 54 is given to exasperation about her husband's more exotic ideas. ''I am a hospice social worker. I work with people who are dying all the time. I see people dying All. The. Time. And what's so good about me that I'm going to live forever?''
 The provenance of this disagreement remains somewhat hazy, as neither Peggy nor her husband, Robin Hanson, can remember quite when he first announced his intention to have his brain surgically removed from his freshly vacated cadaver and preserved in liquid nitrogen. It would have been decades ago, before the two were married and before the births of their two teenage sons. With the benefit of hindsight, Robin, who is 50 and an associate professor of economics at George Mason University, will acknowledge that he should have foreseen at least some initial discomfort on the part of his girlfriend, whom he met when they were both graduate students at the University of Chicago. ''I was surprised by her response,'' he recalls, ''but that's because I am a nerd and not good at predicting these things.''
 Robin is the kind of nerd who is very excited about the future, an orientation evident on his C.V., which lists published articles like ''Economic Growth Given Machine Intelligence'' (on why robots will give us growth rates ''an order of magnitude'' higher than we've currently got), ''Burning the Cosmic Commons: Evolutionary Strategies of Interstellar Colonization'' (on what behaviors we can expect from extraterrestrials) and ''Drift-Diffusion in Mangled Worlds Quantum Mechanics'' (it's very complicated). His enthusiasm is evident in the way he talks about these ideas, hands in the air, laughing amiably every time he brings up the distance between his own theories and those of the mainstream. If he is in a chair, the chair is moving with him.
 ''I'm just really terribly curious,'' Robin told me in January over Skype. ''Cryonics isn't just living a little longer. It's also living quite a bit delayed into the future.'' Peggy's initial response to this ambition, rooted less in scientific skepticism than in her personal judgments about the quest for immortality, has changed little in the past 20-odd years. Robin, a deep thinker most at home in thought experiments, says he believes that there is some small chance his brain will be resurrected, that its time in cryopreservation will be merely a brief pause in the course of his life. Peggy finds the quest an act of cosmic selfishness. And within a particular American subculture, the pair are practically a cliche.
 Among cryonicists, Peggy's reaction might be referred to as an instance of the ''hostile-wife phenomenon,'' as discussed in a 2008 paper by Aschwin de Wolf, Chana de Wolf and Mike Federowicz.''From its inception in 1964,'' they write, ''cryonics has been known to frequently produce intense hostility from spouses who are not cryonicists.'' The opposition of romantic partners, Aschwin told me last year, is something that ''everyone'' involved in cryonics knows about but that he and Chana, his wife, find difficult to understand. To someone who believes that low-temperature preservation offers a legitimate chance at extending life, obstructionism can seem as willfully cruel as withholding medical treatment. Even if you don't want to join your husband in storage, ask believers, what is to be lost by respecting a man's wishes with regard to the treatment of his own remains? Would-be cryonicists forced to give it all up, the de Wolfs and Federowicz write, ''face certain death.''
 Premonitions of this problem can be found in the deepest reaches of cryonicist history, starting with the prime mover. Robert Ettinger is the father of cryonics, his 1964 book, ''The Prospect of Immortality,'' its founding text. ''This is not a hobby or conversation piece,'' he wrote in 1968, adding, ''it is the struggle for survival. Drive a used car if the cost of a new one interferes. Divorce your wife if she will not cooperate.'' Today, with just fewer than200 patients preserved within the two major cryonics facilities, the Michigan-based Cryonics Institute and the Arizona-based Alcor, and with 10 times as many signed up to be stored upon their legal deaths, cryonicists have created support networks with which to tackle marital strife. Cryonet, a mailing list on ''cryonics-related issues,'' takes as one of its issues the opposition of wives. (The ratio of men to women among living cyronicists is roughly three to one.) ''She thinks the whole idea is sick, twisted and generally spooky,'' wrote one man newly acquainted with the hostile-wife phenomenon. ''She is more intelligent than me, insatiably curious and lovingly devoted to me and our 2-year-old daughter. So why is this happening?''
 The air of hurt confusion stems, in part, from the intuition among believers that cryonics is a harmless attempt at preserving data, little different from stowing a box of photos. Of the nonreligious white males who predominate in the ranks of cryonicists, many are software engineers, a calling that puts great faith in the primacy of information. ''If you have a hard drive on a computer with a lot of information that is important to you, you save it,'' says J.S., a 39-year-old cryonicist and software engineer who lives in Oregon and who will not allow his full name to be used out of fear that his wife would divorce him. ''You wouldn't just throw it into a fire. It's clear to me that memories are stored as molecular arrangements. I'm just trying to preserve the memories.''
 A small amount of time spent trying to avoid certain death would seem to be well within the capacity of a healthy marriage to absorb. The checkered marital history of cryonics suggests instead that a violation beyond nonconformity is at stake, that something intrinsic to the loner's quest for a second life agitates against harmony in the first.
 Back when Peggy and Robin were two broke Californians shivering in the Chicago cold, the university's law school used to play old movies for $1. They'd go watch a Cary Grant film and end up back at the dorms for a board game. He taught her to play backgammon; they spent chilly nights playing cards. ''Robin is very romantic,'' Peggy says. ''He used to leave notes in my dorm mailbox all the time, little poems and things, pictures he liked. I still have those.''
 Peggy was thinking about those notes because some siblings at the hospice where she works had just happened upon a cache of love letters written by their father before World War II, and read them aloud to their ailing mother. During my visit to the hospice earlier this year, families were gathered in their rooms and in the large common area, where the TV was on and a box of toys had been pushed aside to make space for a Christmas tree. Pets are allowed; so is liquor. Guests might spend some time chatting with a social worker like Peggy, but probably not much time, because the average stay is seven days.
 Peggy describes herself as not religious and ''definitely not a Christian,'' though she lacks Robin's surety that nothing lives on when the body dies. Her line of work has left her focused on managing the last days of life, partly by encouraging her charges to stop fixating on medicine. Families come from hospital to hospice obsessed with numbers: blood count, blood pressure, heart rate. ''Look at his face,'' she counsels. ''Does he look comfortable? It's very common-sensical, but it takes a lot of work to get people to let go of the hospital stuff.''
 A tour guide to the dying process, Peggy tells families what they will see and how best to reduce discomfort. Feet and hands will turn cold. Senses will fade, but hearing may remain sharp until the very end; telling secrets within earshot of an otherwise-unresponsive guest is ill advised. The muscles required to swallow will go limp in the throat, and the resulting sound will register as a rattle. In the interest of a smooth transition, families are asked to sign a form that says ''do not resuscitate.'' Very rarely, one doesn't, though to fail to do so is to violate certain philosophical leanings of a place very much oriented toward acceptance. ''The paramedics come in and they pound on the chest,'' Peggy says. ''It breaks bones, causes pain, it's serious trauma. That always feels like a failure. I didn't get through to this poor family.''
 The United States is not necessarily an easy place to take up the banner of letting go; we're likely to call it ''giving up,'' and there is of course no purer expression of this attitude than the pursuit of cryonics. Heads and bodies stored in steel tanks, awaiting the moment when medicine advances to the point where tissue can be repaired and bodies revived, are pointedly referred to not as remains or cadavers but as ''patients.'' A stopped heart is seen as no good reason to stop fighting for your life. And so Peggy expends a certain amount of psychic energy trying to ignore Robin's cryonics arrangements. Separate bank accounts prevent her from having to see the money spent on annual dues, and the two manage to avoid bringing up the subject at home. When he dies (''which he will,'' Peggy adds), it will fall to someone else to call Alcor and explain Robin's wishes to the hospital staff. ''My husband has said, on numerous occasions, 'Choose life at any cost,' '' Peggy says. ''But I've seen people in pain. It's not worth it.''
 Shortly after they met, Peggy and Robin decided to read each other's favorite works of literature. Peggy asked Robin to read ''The Brothers Karamazov,'' and he asked her to read ''The Lord of the Rings.'' She hated it. ''I asked him why he loved it, and he said: 'Because it's so full of detail. This guy has invented this whole world.' He asked me why I hated it, and I said: 'Because it's so full of detail. There was nowhere for the reader to imagine her own interpretation.' '' Robin, less one for telling stories, describes their early days more succinctly. ''There was,'' he says not without tenderness, ''a personality-type convergence.''
 As an economist with an interest in political institutions, Robin came up with the concept of futarchy, a form of government in which prediction markets would be used to determine the viability of various policies. He would like to live in a futarchy, and an effective cryonic preservation would improve his chances of seeing one. He also talks about what it means to be the kind of person willing to do what it takes to survive. ''Our ancestors came across the oceans,'' he says, ''went across the continent. Many people, most, didn't do those things. But I think of myself as the kind of person who is willing to suffer quite a bit of change in lifestyle, culture and context if it's a matter of that or extermination.''
 Robin's expertise extends to the economics of health care, a domain in which enormous amounts of money are spent on experimental procedures with only a small chance of extending life. Like many cryonicists, he says he thinks of bodily preservation as experimental end-of-life medical care, and it is within a medical context that he typically introduces the subject of cryonics to his health economics class at George Mason. His students rarely accept this framing. ''We spend most of the semester talking about how people are obsessed with taking any small chance at living longer,'' Robin says. ''And then when we get to cryonics, it's: Well, who needs to live longer? What's the point of living anyway? Why can't we solve global hunger?''
 In other words, while his wife says that medical technology has an unfortunate stranglehold on the way we die, Robin longs to claim the mantle of medical science for his attempt to avoid death altogether. But here he doesn't expect to succeed, and as with most societal attitudes that contradict his intuitions, he's got a theory as to why. ''Cryonics,'' Robin says, ''has the problem of looking like you're buying a one-way ticket to a foreign land.'' To spend a family fortune in the quest to defeat cancer is not taken, in the American context, to be an act of selfishness. But to plan to be rocketed into the future -- a future your family either has no interest in seeing, or believes we'll never see anyway -- is to begin to plot a life in which your current relationships have little meaning. Those who seek immortality are plotting an act of leaving, an act, as Robin puts it, ''of betrayal and abandonment.''
 Whether or not the human race subconsciously equates attempts to defeat death with treachery, it's true that a general air of menace hangs over the quest for immortality in Western literature. Think Gilgamesh or Voldemort. ''There is a lot of ancient cultural stereotyping about the motives and moral character of people who pursue life extension,'' says James Hughes, the executive director of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies, a nonprofit organization enamored of life extension. Hughes has chosen not to participate in what he considers a worthy experiment. ''Although it's a rather marginal bet for a potentially huge payoff,'' he says, ''I value my relationship with my wife.''
 If cryonic preservation does indeed signal betrayal, it does so while asking much from those who would be betrayed. Alcor's Patient Care Bay, filled as it is with 10-foot steel canisters packed with human bodies and connected to monitors, may appear self-regulating but in fact requires a very human vigilance against entropy. There is a man charged with topping off the liquid nitrogen. There is a man who mops the floors. Those in charge of the Patient Care Bay are only the last in a long chain of people called upon to assist ''deanimated'' members. Someone must perform the perfusion, for example, whereby blood is replaced with an antifreeze-like solution that will harden like glass rather than freeze like water. Someone must accompany the body from the site of death to the cryonics facility. Someone must deal with flight schedules, local coroners and byzantine hospital bureaucracies generally unfriendly to those who would march into the hospital and whisk away the freshly dead. This is all vastly more likely to succeed if the legal guardian of the remains is willing to help. ''If you don't tell your wife you're involved with cryonics, you don't really love her,'' says S.B., a cryonicist from Indianapolis who reports that his marriage is suffering and that two of his previous relationships failed because of cryonics. ''And when I die, I want my wife to call Alcor.''
 It has not escaped the members of the often sappily life-affirming cryonics community that their practice, so often thought to be the province of either misfit loners or rugged individualists, involves great faith in the competent benevolence of other people. Nor is Robin Hanson blind to the extent to which he depends on his tribe. Marriage, despite its lack of clean edges and predictable outcomes, is one of the few institutions he seems to have no interest in reforming. Peggy describes their conflict as akin to a deep religious difference, bridgeable by some core shared belief. ''Robin and I have been together for 28 years,'' Peggy says. ''We've always loved spending time together. He is an excellent father. He devotes an enormous amount of time and energy to family life. And that has to be there.''
 Robin and Peggy remain silent on the issue of how, exactly, death will part them, but earlier this year a stray bit of chatter glanced past the conversational barricade. Sitting at their kitchen table, Peggy told Robin about a funeral tradition she'd heard about: after a cremation, the ashes of the dead are separated among family members. The children and surviving spouse each get a handful, to save or dispose of as they see fit.
 ''You're not getting any part of me,'' Robin said. ''I'm being frozen.''
 ''No.'' Peggy said. ''Your head is being frozen. I get the rest of you.''

HEADLINE: Taking a Chance On Yourself

BYLINE: By PRERNA GUPTA. 
E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SIX years ago, fresh out of Stanford with a degree in economics, I had what many would consider the perfect job. I was a management consultant at a prestigious firm, with an office overlooking the San Francisco Bay and a shiny new ThinkPad to boot.
 My co-workers were intelligent, ambitious and fun, and I interacted with high-level executives at Fortune 500 companies. My perks included free concert tickets, ski trips and fancy dinners. I was on track to be earning six figures within three years. It was the good life I had been chasing along with my peers at Stanford. 
 So why wasn't I happy? 
 After six months of living this supposed dream, my day-to-day life was far from satisfying. I was working 14-hour days, and most of my time seemed to be spent nudging boxes around in PowerPoint slides and agonizing over the wording of bullet-pointed items.
 It felt wrong to be dreading work at such a young age. I wanted to wake up each morning excited about what was ahead. I wanted to create something of my own. 
 I had joined consulting with the goal of starting my own company one day, perhaps after getting my M.B.A. At the time, I believed that management consulting would best prepare me to run my own business, but I soon realized that consulting was mostly just teaching me how to be a better consultant. 
 Venture capital, I thought, would be a more direct path to entrepreneurship. So I quit my job as a consultant after six months and joined a venture capital firm in Silicon Valley. 
 I lasted just six weeks this time. Although I had indeed moved closer to the world of entrepreneurship, I found myself no closer to actually becoming an entrepreneur. To make matters worse, the work I was doing was even more painful than before, and the hours were longer.
 My day now consisted of mining lists and industry reports for high-growth companies, then cold-calling their chief executives. The more C.E.O.'s I spoke to, the more ''points'' I got. Soon I would be judged by how many meetings I was able to schedule for my partners. And if a meeting turned into a deal, I made money. In short, I was a saleswoman. 
 Sales is an essential aspect of entrepreneurship, which is what initially attracted me to this job. A few weeks of selling something for which I had no passion, however, were enough for me to realize that my venture-capital gig wasn't the good life I had imagined.
 Switching jobs had not solved my problems. The truth was that I hated working in a conventional structure. I hated having a boss, working on someone else's creation and sitting in an office all day. My time was not my own, and I was miserable. I could not bear it for even one day longer. So I quit and decided to become an entrepreneur.
 Along with my boyfriend (now my husband), Parag Chordia, I raised money through family and friends and started my own technology company, a social networking site that grew to two million users. And I have never looked back -- even though that company has not been profitable. 
 Last year, Parag and I started Khush Inc., which makes an iPhone music application called LaDiDa. It's a kind of reverse karaoke -- it creates background music when people sing lyrics into a microphone, and it is one of the top 20 paid music applications in iTunes.
 As chief executive of my own start-up, I now spend my days building consumer products from the ground up, creating grass-roots marketing campaigns, pitching my ideas to investors and dreaming about the next big thing. How many people bought my product? Who saw my video? What can I do to reach more people tomorrow? These are the questions I ask myself each day. 
 There is a certain thrill to seeing one's own creation in the hands and minds of thousands, sometimes even millions, of people around the world. Entrepreneurship is intoxicating.
 Exciting as it may be, however, the entrepreneurial life is far from easy. Stress is a regular part of the day. Money is tight. There are frequent emotional highs and lows, and the desire to succeed can become all-consuming. Underlying all of this is the knowledge that failure is the most likely outcome. 
 Yet, no matter how tough things get, I wake up every morning with renewed hope and excitement for what lies ahead. The fact that I am working on my passion gives meaning to even the most mundane tasks. 
 My future is perhaps more uncertain than it ever has been. I may end up wealthy, or I may earn barely enough to support myself. But the realization that I face a high likelihood of failure is not enough to send me back to the corporate cubicle.
 Maybe I value my time more than my net worth. Maybe my fear of boredom outweighs my fear of failure. Or, maybe I have an irrational belief that I will succeed against all odds. Whatever it is, I find the risk of entrepreneurship to be not only worthwhile but also necessary for fulfillment. Work is no longer work. It is life, and a good one.

HEADLINE: Educational Hope vs. Teenage Reality

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
MIDDLE SCHOOL students are champion time-wasters. And the personal computer may be the ultimate time-wasting appliance. Put the two together at home, without hovering supervision, and logic suggests that you won't witness a miraculous educational transformation.
 Still, wherever there is a low-income household unboxing the family's very first personal computer, there is an automatic inclination to think of the machine in its most idealized form, as the Great Equalizer. In developing countries, computers are outfitted with grand educational hopes, like those that animate the One Laptop Per Child initiative, which was examined in this space in April. The same is true of computers that go to poor households in the United States. 
 Economists are trying to measure a home computer's educational impact on schoolchildren in low-income households. Taking widely varying routes, they are arriving at similar conclusions: little or no educational benefit is found. Worse, computers seem to have further separated children in low-income households, whose test scores often decline after the machine arrives, from their more privileged counterparts.
 Ofer Malamud, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago, is the co-author of a study that investigated educational outcomes after low-income families received vouchers to help them buy computers. 
 ''We found a negative effect on academic achievement,'' he said. ''I was surprised, but as we presented our findings at various seminars, people in the audience said they weren't surprised, given their own experiences with their school-age children.''
 Professor Malamud and his collaborator, Cristian Pop-Eleches, an assistant professor of economics at Columbia University, did their field work in Romania in 2009, where the government invited low-income families to apply for vouchers worth 200 euros (then about $300) that could be used for buying a home computer. 
 The program provided a control group: the families who applied but did not receive a voucher. They showed the same desire to own a machine, and their income was often only slightly above the cut-off point for the government program.
 In a draft of an article that the Quarterly Journal of Economics will publish early next year, the professors report finding ''strong evidence that children in households who won a voucher received significantly lower school grades in math, English and Romanian.'' The principal positive effect on the students was improved computer skills.
 At that time, most Romanian households were not yet connected to the Internet. But few children whose families obtained computers said they used the machines for homework. What they were used for -- daily -- was playing games.
 In the United States, Jacob L. Vigdor and Helen F. Ladd, professors of public policy at Duke University, reported similar findings. Their National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, ''Scaling the Digital Divide,'' published last month, looks at the arrival of broadband service in North Carolina between 2000 and 2005 and its effect on middle school test scores during that period. Students posted significantly lower math test scores after the first broadband service provider showed up in their neighborhood, and significantly lower reading scores as well when the number of broadband providers passed four. 
 The Duke paper reports that the negative effect on test scores was not universal, but was largely confined to lower-income households, in which, the authors hypothesized, parental supervision might be spottier, giving students greater opportunity to use the computer for entertainment unrelated to homework and reducing the amount of time spent studying. 
 The North Carolina study suggests the disconcerting possibility that home computers and Internet access have such a negative effect only on some groups and end up widening achievement gaps between socioeconomic groups. The expansion of broadband service was associated with a pronounced drop in test scores for black students in both reading and math, but no effect on the math scores and little on the reading scores of other students. In the report, the authors do not speculate about what caused the disparities. Neither author responded to a request for an interview. 
 The state of Texas recently completed a four-year experiment in ''technology immersion.'' The project spent $20 million in federal money on laptops distributed to 21 middle schools whose students were permitted to take the machines home. Another 21 schools that did not receive funds for laptops were designated as control schools.
 At the conclusion, a report prepared by the Texas Center for Educational Research tried to make the case that test scores in some academic subjects improved slightly at participating schools over those of the control schools. But the differences were mixed and included lower scores for writing among the students at schools ''immersed'' in technology. 
 THE one area where the students from lower-income families in the immersion program closed the gap with higher-income students was the same one identified in the Romanian study: computer skills. 
 Catherine Maloney, director of the Texas center, said the schools did their best to mandate that the computers would be used strictly for educational purposes. Most schools configured the machines to block e-mail, chat, games and Web sites reached by searching on objectionable key words. The key-word blocks worked fine for English-language sites but not for Spanish ones. ''Kids were adept at getting around the blocks,'' she said.
 How disappointing to read in the Texas study that ''there was no evidence linking technology immersion with student self-directed learning or their general satisfaction with schoolwork.'' 
 When devising ways to beat school policing software, students showed an exemplary capacity for self-directed learning. Too bad that capacity didn't expand in academic directions, too.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Hiring In Anticipation Of a Recovery

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
While much of the country remains fixated on the bleak employment picture, hiring is beginning to pick up in the place that led the economy into recession -- Wall Street.
 The shift underscores the remarkable recovery of the biggest banks and brokerage firms since Washington rescued them in the fall of 2008, and follows the huge rebound in profits for members of the New York Stock Exchange, which totaled $61.4 billion in 2009, the most ever. Since employment bottomed out in February, New York securities firms have added nearly 2,000 jobs, a trend that is also playing out nationwide at financial companies, commodity contract traders and investment firms.
 Though the figures are small in comparison to overall Wall Street employment, executives, economists and headhunters say they expect the growth to pick up steam in the coming months.
 ''I think we're seeing some hiring in anticipation of better times,'' said Rae Rosen, a regional economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. ''Wall Street typically hires in anticipation of the recovery, and there is a sense that the economy has bottomed out and is slowly improving.'' 
 The increase in hiring and cautious optimism stand in sharp contrast to the mood among workers in other fields, where jobs have been slow to return or are disappearing altogether. Since June 2008 the number of jobs has shrunk by nearly 14 percent in manufacturing and by 22 percent in construction, but only by 8.5 percent in the financial industry nationwide.
 It is also the opposite of what is going in other highly paid, white-collar professions like law, where employment nationwide in June was the lowest since late 2001, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 The financial work force in New York has shrunk by more than 28,000 since its peak in January 2008, but is still slightly above its level in 2003 after the tech bubble burst, meaning it actually weathered this recession -- the worst since the Depression -- better than the previous one. Nationally, staffing is back to where it was in late 2005, while employment in the overall economy is near 2004 levels. 
 As hiring has picked up on Wall Street, salary packages recalling the boom years are reappearing at the most senior levels. Richard Stein, president of Global Sage, an executive search firm, said corporate clients had offered compensation packages worth more than $1 million annually to 12 candidates in recent weeks. 
 ''The offers are not near where they were in 2006, but there is still a war for talent,'' he said. ''Everyone thought the ice age had returned, but the thaw has come and we're in catch-up mode.''
 For the local economy, Wall Street's rebound is a rare bit of good news. New York City is cutting services like day care and adult literacy programs to help balance its budget, while Albany is facing a $9.2 billion deficit in the state budget this year.
 ''These are jobs that bring a lot of money into the city and have an impact that is out of proportion to their number,'' said Carl Weisbrod, former president of the Alliance for Downtown New York and the president of Trinity Real Estate. 
 That has a critical effect on city and state finances, driving both tax revenue and job creation. Each job in the securities sector generates two additional positions in New York City, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. In part, that is because the average salary is much larger, with Wall Street employees earning an average of $392,000, compared with $63,875 for other workers in the city.
 ''It's a big deal for both the city and the state,'' said Robert D. Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a leading independent planning group. ''This is a significant turnaround.'' Twenty percent of the state's tax revenue comes from the financial sector, he said, while Wall Street accounts for about 12 percent of the city's budget.
 The hiring is not just a local phenomenon. Major investment banks are quietly rebuilding their global work forces. 
 Goldman Sachs added 600 jobs worldwide in the first quarter, while JPMorgan's investment bank has hired slightly more than 2,000 people globally since the beginning of the year. 
 Closer to home, Credit Suisse's investment bank, based in New York, filled 600 positions in the first quarter, with a significant portion in New York. Deutsche Bank has hired 414 people in New York, including 98 directors and managing directors since the start of the year. 
 Hiring is also picking up at boutique firms and at smaller foreign banks seeking a beachhead in New York. 
 Nomura of Japan has been especially aggressive, recently hiring several top bankers from Deutsche Bank. Nomura's New York-based securities unit has increased its staff to more than 1,700, from 1,000 in March 2009, and the bank says it will hire 300 more workers by March 2011. 
 Macquarie, an Australian investment bank, has also rapidly expanded, even taking over new floors in its Midtown Manhattan headquarters to accommodate new trading operations. One morning last week, long rows of traders there worked the phones and watched a multitude of screens, evoking the heady days before the Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers downfalls. 
 ''We are very bullish on the U.S.,'' said Tim Bishop, who leads Macquarie's United States operations. 
 On Thursday, Macquarie added six fixed-income traders in New York, and it plans to announce the hiring of six equity traders on Monday. 
 At Centerview Partners, a boutique investment bank that specializes in corporate advisory work, 10 bankers have joined the firm in New York this year, bringing its roster to 75. ''I think hiring has turned the corner,'' said Blair W. Effron, a former UBS vice chairman who was a founder of Centerview in 2006.
 To be sure, Wall Street has long been the quintessential boom-and-bust industry, hiring rapidly on the way up and shrinking even more quickly on the way down.
 Employment in the securities industry in New York was at 160,400 in May, up from the trough of 158,500 in February, but still well below its peak of 188,900 in January 2008, according to data prepared by the state comptroller's office.
 As the nascent increase in jobs suggests, the recovery is still very fragile. And executives say it could halt or even reverse if earnings reports for the second quarter, which begin this week, are disappointing. 
 As a result, some banks are hiring in stages, with one eye on the economy. In recent months, Morgan Stanley has hired 100 private bankers in the United States to serve wealthy clients but is holding off on plans to hire 400 more, waiting to see how the market performs.
 Still, top banks and brokerages remain well aware of their reputation for taking reckless risks in the pursuit of profits, and they insist they are not simply reanimating the trading desks and other brash operations that caused the problem in the first place.
 Of 400 recent hires in the sales and trading unit at Morgan Stanley, for example, the bank says only 100 are traders.
 For all the criticism of Wall Street's recent excesses, the industry remains New York's growth engine.
 ''We've thought several times in recent decades that Wall Street was doomed and the city would go into decline,'' said Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor at Columbia University and an expert on New York history. ''The stock exchange goes back more than 200 years and has had lots of ups and downs, but like the city, it's very resilient.''

HEADLINE: Park vs. Park

BYLINE: By JIM RASENBERGER and ELIZABETH GIDDENS; Charanna Alexander, Ali Elkin and Paige Jeffries contributed reporting.

 BODY:
From: Vaux Populi
 To: A Little Bit Country
 Subject: Upper Case Thought
 I admit I was surprised when the idea of a friendly joust over the respective merits of Central Park and Prospect Park was first proposed to us. It had never occurred to me that anyone seriously considered the two parks comparable. I have nothing against Prospect Park. I have actually been to Prospect Park. It is, as I recall, in Brooklyn. I am sure that if I found myself near it again and had nothing better to do, I would be happy to watch the grass grow, or whatever it is people do there. But seriously. I look forward to sharing with you why Central Park is not only the most visited, most famous, most beloved, but also -- wait, I'm going to need the caps lock button for this -- THE GREATEST URBAN PARK ON EARTH.
 From: A Little Bit Country
 To: Vaux Populi 
 Subject: Blushing Horses
 I'm sure Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, the architects of both these parks, would be surprised by your surprise, as Prospect was their clear favorite. It's widely understood among landscape architects that Central Park was a mere practice run, and Prospect Park the true masterpiece -- like God making man before woman.
 I didn't know Manhattanites actually used Central Park. It's a wonder you're even able to, since it's so entirely overrun by tourists. Though I did once ford a treacherous river of Lycra-clad bikers to find a small flat spot of grass where Upper East Siders sardine together in search of the perfect tan. Ah, park as annex to gym and tanning salon! Inspired!
 Consider, by way of contrast, our Long Meadow: the pastoral ideal at its finest, with undulating hills dotted with ancient trees, among which a diverse array of humanity frolics with happy abandon. The difference between our parks is that mine is full of New Yorkers in their own gorgeous backyard, and yours is full of suburbanites snapping pictures out of pedicabs.
 I've got nothing against tourists. I just don't want to be around a lot of them all at once, especially when I'm trying to relax. But they do have the darnedest accoutrements -- their horse carriages, for example. Everyone on them seems so embarrassed. Even the horses are mortified.

 Subject: Blackberry Picking 
 You are right: Central Park is often crowded with tourists, particularly the park's southern acreage. The Isle of Innisfree it is not. 
 But I like the crowds, and I suspect Olmsted and Vaux would, too. Great numbers of people from different backgrounds and economic classes commingle outdoors amid the ''harmonizing and refining influence,'' as Olmsted put it, of trees, grass and water. Somehow, with more than 35 million visits a year, it works. The strolling pedestrians, the Lycra-clad bikers, the horse carriages, those pedicabs backed up near the statue of Balto -- the greatness of Central Park is that it accommodates all of this traffic and remains inviting and rejuvenating. This owes a lot to Olmsted and Vaux's decision to ban the geometric tyranny of the street grid from the park -- nary a right angle is to be found within its borders -- and their use of topography to disperse the crowds among verdant hills and dales.
 There are many good reasons so many people come to Central Park rather than, say, Prospect Park. I could catalog them -- the plush sward of Sheep Meadow, the boat pond, the elegant bridges -- but let me suggest the Mall alone as reason enough. This is one of the finest esplanades in the world, passing under a cathedral-like canopy of American elms (the park contains one of the last great surviving stands of these excellent trees) and ending at Bethesda Terrace. If there is anything in Prospect Park -- or any other urban park -- that can rival that, I'd like to see it.
 Since you mention crowds, I also want to draw your attention to the park's less visited northern region, where the Old World pastoral aesthetic of the southern park gives way to a more rough-hewn American ideal, inspired by those Hudson River School paintings that hang in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I'm talking about the park that lies beyond the museum, beyond the tall pines that sway above the Great Lawn. A pasture of wildflowers descends into a deep and forbidding forest. Nearby are the bushes where my wife picks blackberries in the summer (and once caught a wicked case of poison ivy), and farther down the road primordial chunks of schist jut from the ground. Like Prospect Park, Central Park is almost entirely man-made, but here is a hint of unbridled wildness. 
 From: A Little Bit Country
 To: Vaux Populi
 Subject: Bowl of Light 
 I suppose I'll give you the Mall -- though it stretches for only a few hundred feet, and seriously undermines your right-angles claim. But the reason we have nothing like your Mall is because it would be entirely out of place. 
 Which brings us to design. 
 This is where Prospect Park clearly outshines its unfortunate forebear. It's not Central Park's fault, the poor dear; its construction was fraught with obstacles. Start with an emaciated rectangle of big rocks and bad soil. (The very topsoil was shipped in from New Jersey!) Block out two unmovable reservoirs, and slash it into bits with four major transverse roads. Mix in a corrupt, incompetent, penny-pinching oversight committee that so exasperated the architects that they resigned in disgust before the park's completion. Et voila! A valiant though hopelessly compromised effort that would prove extremely useful in preparing for their magnum opus across the river.
 A frustrated Olmsted wrote, ''I should like to show you what I really am and could do with ... a moderate degree of freedom from the necessity of accommodating myself to infernal scoundrels.''
 He had his chance a year later. Brooklyn's plot was broad, had excellent soil, and was unencumbered by reservoirs or roads. The generosity of the land was matched by the graciousness of the park's commissioner, who scrupulously protected the integrity of their designs. The result was a park with a coherence that was so sadly lacking in the mash-up they'd recently abandoned. 
 Prospect Park is divided into thirds: a gracious meadow, an immense lake, a lush native forest. Grass. Water. Trees. The trinity of benevolent nature. Each is a marvel -- and each is bigger and better than its Central Park counterpart.
 The meadow stretches for a full mile, and seems even longer, boomeranging around to give the illusion of limitless distance. (Olmsted understood that glimpses are often better than a straightforward view.) It's surrounded by massive planted berms that block the sights and sounds of the city and create what the writer Tony Hiss terms a ''bowl of light.''
 The park's watercourse is an exquisite catalog of the many forms water can take. It begins life as a spring, pours into two tranquil ponds that skirt the meadow, then becomes an ebullient woodland stream. After a series of dramatic waterfalls, it matures into a winding river flanked by tall cypresses and sweet gums, and finally flows into a 60-acre lake, home to more than 20 species of fish. 
 This is a real lake, mind you, with reeds and muck and waves lapping at a sinuous shore, not a fenced-off, concrete-bottomed reservoir. You can fish, feed the ducks, skip stones, get your feet wet. You can play fetch with your dog in an upstream pond. Most important, you can gaze at the lake and think thoughts generated only by large bodies of water.
 As for the forest, go there when it's hot -- the temperature is 15 degrees cooler. Your breathing will change. You'll find yourself speaking in hushed tones. The sounds are all birdsong and water, and the air is thick with the scent of lindens. At 146 acres, the forest is so vast you may get lost. Modeled on the Adirondacks wilderness, it's full of centuries-old oaks and centered on a precipitous 100-foot ravine. (But your park has gorges, right? Those blaring transverse roads?)
 While I willingly concede that size is not everything (Prospect Park is smaller than Central Park, for instance), in the case of the uninterrupted sweep of a meadow, a lake, a wood -- well, bigger is obviously better. Not even the birds like a patchy forest.

 Subject: Love on Bow Bridge
 I think you are confusing ease of creation with success of design. I don't doubt that Central Park was a more challenging endeavor than Prospect Park, where the land was cheaper, the earth more pliable, and the politics less bumptious. After finishing Central Park, Olmsted and Vaux could have designed Prospect Park in their sleep. In fact, I wonder if they were not half asleep when they did design it, given its soporific prettiness. (My memory of the Long Meadow is that it looked like a nice place to take a nap.) Like tennis with the net down, easier is not necessarily better.
 Those transverse roads you disdain are a good demonstration of the designers' ingenuity in meeting a practical challenge. One early proposal for the park dispensed with crosstown roads, on the assumption that the east and west sides would have even less to do with each other than Manhattan and Brooklyn. Other plans put the roads on the surface for all to see. Olmsted and Vaux kept the roads but sank them from view, so that you nearly have to walk right up to them to know they are there. Landscape architecture meets urban planning. Problem solved.
 As for the reservoirs in the middle of the park, they posed another design obstruction, but no contemporary New Yorker will regret them.
 One was later drained and turned into that scrumptious carpet of blue and rye grass known as the Great Lawn. The other, the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Reservoir, is a 106-acre breeze-generating expanse of clean fresh water, by far the largest body of water in either of our parks. It is even more spectacular now that the chain-link eyesore that used to surround it has been replaced by a low black steel and cast-iron fence. In spring, the shoreline cherry trees explode with blossoms finer than those around the Tidal Basin in Washington. 
 Reservoirs, rocks and ''infernal scoundrels'' may have all upset Olmsted's vision, but, as he learned, integrity of design is a concept that probably has more currency in Brooklyn coffeehouses than on Manhattan streets, where it has been abused for centuries and not always for the worse. Olmsted surely rolled over in his grave when Robert Moses was named parks commissioner in 1934 and immediately added many playgrounds, a dozen ball fields and an enlarged zoo. The fact is, though, Moses made it a better park.
 Moses's additions speak both to the multiplicity tucked into the park's contours -- it seems larger than 840 acres -- and to its ever-evolving vibrancy. The park is a sanctuary, but there is nothing sanctified about it. Instead of reverential tableaux we get the pageant of life: skaters busting moves near the Mall, Shakespeare lovers lining up at the Delacorte, Beatles fans communing with John Lennon in Strawberry Fields, children sailing remote-controlled boats on the Conservatory Water, and blissed-out romantics on Bow Bridge. All of this is embraced by the Central Park Drive, a rolling, curving 6.1-mile circuit that strings together the jewels.
 My one serious complaint: automobiles. Olmsted would be horrified, and I'm with him (and against Moses) on this one. Automobiles have nearly 500 miles of roadway in Manhattan; do they really need our 6.1 miles, too? 
 From: A Little Bit Country
 To: Vaux Populi
 Subject: We Happy Few
 You can have your Moses additions. We've got them, too, mostly on the perimeter, and I don't like them. There's enough stuff in cities. Parks are places you go to get away from stuff. (His band shell is an exception -- summer concerts are always a delight. Our parks both have stellar programming, but at Prospect's concerts, you needn't arrive at sunrise to secure a spot.)
 But a nap on the Long Meadow? What a lovely idea! Before you doze off, though, let's have a look around.
 There's a golden ratio of space to people in Prospect Park: It's not so packed that you can't get a sense of being alone with your thoughts, yet full enough to enable some superb people-watching.
 And oh, the humanity. You might see some pickup soccer between Hasidim and Haitians. Park Slope tweens flying kites alongside bearded Pakistani men. Girls in vintage dresses, reading. Trinidadians playing cricket. Hipsters making up games with giant red balls. A Salvadoran family clustered around a smoking grill. (Cooking outside, though one of life's great pleasures, is forbidden in Central Park.) 
 And yes, lots of people napping -- Luxuriant stretch! Yawn! -- because the scene imparts a deep sense of ease. 
 So I'll gladly give you ''most famous,'' and please do take ''most visited.'' Judging from the vitriolic online forums, your 35 million is a tight fit.
 From: Vaux Populi
 To: A Little Bit Country
 Subject: A Proposal 
 Remember, not all those 35 million are tourists. Some of us local folk occasionally go, too. (I can personally vouch for about 300 of those per annum visits.) When I really need suburban solitude, I can always repair to my in-laws' in New Jersey. Or to Prospect Park.
 Actually, A Little Bit Country, though it pains me to admit it, you make Prospect Park sound so enticing that I will visit again soon to see it with fresh eyes and, perchance, to nap. On one condition: you come and take a fresh look at Central Park.
 From: A Little Bit Country
 To: Vaux Populi
 Subject: Agreed 
 You're welcome to nap in our paradise. Walk through Endale Arch into the Long Meadow, and you'll find that the city has miraculously disappeared.
 The trouble with Central Park is that you can never forget where you are. Your reverie is constantly shattered by luxury high-rises lowering at every horizon. And yes, your treeline-dwarfed-by-skyline is a favorite photographic cliche, but to my mind it bears an unseemly resemblance to a real estate ad.
 ''A man's eyes cannot be as much occupied as they are in large cities by artificial things ... without a harmful effect,'' Olmsted wrote.
 Maybe it all depends whether your ideal park visit is like a day in the country or a day in a museum. Ultimately, Vaux Populi, I suppose the city needs both.

HEADLINE: Some Europeans Aren't Crying Over a Weak Euro

BYLINE: By CONRAD de AENLLE

 BODY:
THE euro and European stock markets have plummeted this year, but the Continent isn't suffering alone. The ease and speed with which merchandise, money and ugly news travel across borders have ensured that American investors are sharing the pain.
 Developments in Europe -- economic and financial difficulties in Greece and the prospect of something similar all along the Continent's southern edge -- have helped to lower returns throughout the world, although European markets have borne the brunt. Funds in Morningstar's database that specialize in European stocks lost 14.1 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 10 percent loss for funds that focus on American stocks. 
 Turbulent conditions are expected to persist, so mutual funds face challenges wherever they invest. But some managers are also finding opportunity amid the turmoil. 
 They are using two approaches to capitalize on -- or at least protect their shareholders from -- Europe's sudden reversal of fortune: avoiding American companies that depend on Europe for much of their sales and buying European companies that do big business abroad, especially in emerging economies with relatively strong currencies.
 Both tactics acknowledge a phenomenon that occurs when one currency moves sharply against another. Companies in countries where the weaker currency is used typically find it easier to export to places where people spend the stronger currency.
 That's because the exporters' goods are cheaper and because a rising currency often coincides with robust economic growth, so consumers have more money in their pockets. The dynamic works in reverse, too: exporters in the country with the stronger currency find the going tougher because their products are pricier for foreign consumers, who are likely to be struggling.
 ''We're looking for a number of things, including companies that will benefit from a competitive point of view from a decline in the euro,'' said Cindy Sweeting, director of portfolio management for the Templeton Global Equity Group and manager of the Templeton Growth fund.
 Among such companies, she said, are ''multinationals listed in Europe that have a good portion of sales outside Europe, especially outside the periphery.'' Not only does she consider them among the best stocks in the region, but she also sees them as one of the best means for gaining exposure to emerging markets, where local businesses have comparatively rich valuations.
 One sector that Ms. Sweeting highlighted is drug making. European industry leaders like Novartis, Sanofi-Aventis, Roche and GlaxoSmithKline ''have unheralded growth potential in emerging markets,'' she said, as well as something else that carries a premium these days: financial strength in the form of healthy balance sheets with relatively little debt.
 David Marcus, lead manager of the Evermore Global Value fund, says he is discovering ''huge opportunities in Europe'' among large exporters in several industries. His favorites include the conglomerate Siemens; the car maker Daimler; BAE Systems, the corporate descendant of British Aerospace; and such producers of luxury consumer goods as LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior.
 ''Car companies like Daimler will surprise people with better earnings,'' Mr. Marcus predicted.
 The surprise there and at other large European companies, he said, will result not just from favorable currency movements and stronger sales abroad, but also from a restructuring trend he has observed across the Continent.
 ''We actually believe that's the larger theme in Europe,'' he said. ''Europe is coming out of the Dark Ages. Reducing the cost structure is a positive. When you add that to the fact that they're exporters, the bang they get for their euro is a double positive.''
 The surging dollar is a negative for many American businesses. Komal Sri-Kumar, chief global strategist at the TCW Group, notes that companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index generate a significant portion of their revenue abroad. His advice to investors is to own companies that export to the right places or that are the right size. 
 ''Be underweight U.S. companies exporting to the euro zone,'' he suggested. Not only is the euro moving the wrong way for European consumers, but their economic difficulties ''are going to make them purchase less from the United States.''
 American exporters to Asia and Latin America are better propositions, Mr. Sri-Kumar said, as are smaller companies, whose business tends to be more domestically oriented. That means fewer foreign-exchange problems and fewer economic concerns because, he said, ''even if there's a recession, things will be better in the United States.''
 Andrea Mitroff, a manager of global equity portfolios for TIAA-CREF, also likes the prospects for American companies doing business in developing economies.
 ''We like U.S. tech names,'' she said. ''A lot of their sales are oriented toward emerging-market growth. Laptop sales and flat-panel television sales have been very strong.'' Her favorites include Apple, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and two smaller companies, Veeco Instruments and Cree, that specialize in light-emitting diodes and other components of electronic devices.
 BUYING stocks based on foreign-exchange movements does carry risks, these investors warn. For one thing, the euro may reverse course. 
 Mr. Sri-Kumar said he expected the euro to keep falling in the long term, but Ms. Sweeting described selling in the euro as ''a crowded theme'' and said that developments ''could pop the currency,'' sending it sharply higher, at least for a while. And Ms. Mitroff says that currency movements are ''the hardest thing to predict,'' so she isn't factoring them significantly into her stock selection.
 Even with perfect economic foresight, the impact on corporate performance would be hard to gauge. Ms. Mitroff pointed out that companies that derive big chunks of revenue in a particular currency often have much of their cost base in it, too, mitigating foreign-exchange effects. McDonald's, for instance, generates more than 40 percent of its sales in Europe, she said, but also buys food and labor there.
 While she is not necessarily avoiding companies that do a lot of business in euros, she is avoiding companies that do a lot of business in Europe.
 ''I don't think we're getting paid for the risk,'' Ms. Mitroff said. ''We've been underweight Europe, especially European banks, for six months because we don't see attractive growth prospects. I really think the currency is the tail and European economic issues are the dog.''

HEADLINE: Reviving Stalled Projects

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, William Procida, a Bergen County builder and developer turned real estate financier, wrote a prescient article, ''The Coming of the Half-Builts,'' for a trade publication.
 That title neatly summed up what was to come. As the housing, credit and economic crises proceeded to detonate, prospects for completing residential construction projects small and large vaporized.
 ''Half-builts'' can now be found from Asbury Park to Atlantic City and from Fort Lee to Clifton: building skeletons, facades and empty lots with fully approved plans, marring the postrecession landscape and presenting grim evidence of lost momentum. 
 But not entirely lost hope. A number of attempts at resurrection are under way at the moment, with some of the state's largest construction companies, among them K. Hovnanian Homes and Metro Homes, trolling for projects to take over or finish. 
 ''There clearly are a lot of people out there with money looking to get into projects that already have approvals,'' said Dean Geibel, the president of Metro Homes, which is based in Hoboken. ''They can pick them up at a reasonable price, get the work done without having to wade through the regulatory process, and earn a good return in a relatively short time.'' 
 Mr. Procida is working with Metro Homes, the company responsible for the state's most prominent skeleton -- the Esperanza, a beachfront condominium tower in Asbury Park -- to try and bring it back with a redesign and refinancing.
 Mr. Geibel has also hired Mr. Procida to work on reviving a plan to build a second tower at the Trump Plaza Jersey City. The construction lender for the first tower carrying the Trump label took ownership of it last year after Metro Homes defaulted on its loan.
 ''It's ironic that I should be working on a Trump project,'' said Mr. Procida, 48, who describes having talked his way into becoming Donald J. Trump's ''first apprentice,'' long before the television show on that theme appeared. He still regales his pals with tales of his days playing ''Trump's mascot.'' 
 ''But this is the perfect time -- the absolute right time -- to be restructuring deals and reinventing projects, so they make money for everybody,'' he said with characteristic ebullience.
 Mr. Geibel recently ''proved he can do it,'' Mr. Procida said, with another project in Jersey City called Gulls Cove. When his loan was about to be foreclosed by another lender, it was Palisades Financial, then led by Mr. Procida, that lent the money to upgrade public spaces at the building, and to relaunch marketing.
 ''He paid us back in less than 18 months,'' Mr. Procida said, ''and the whole thing was a smashing success.'' The two also teamed up on the remarketing of MetroStop, a 113-unit building in Hoboken, spurring 11 quick sales. A total of 66 units have now sold, well over the halfway mark, as Mr. Geibel noted.
 In late June, Mr. Procida was also taking credit for having arranged financing through G4 Capital and JPMorgan Chase to restart construction at the Harlem Gateway and Lore projects in New York, where work stopped three years ago. He professed to be ''knee-deep'' in dozens of such revival-and-restructuring efforts throughout the New York metropolitan area.
 On both the Asbury Park and Trump projects, Mr. Geibel said, he would prefer a new lending deal that retained his company as sole developer. But he declared himself open to the possibility of taking on a partner. For each project, he has been drawing up plans for less ''grandiose'' designs, he said, and also, at the Trump site, contemplating the idea of a hotel rather than condos. 
 K. Hovnanian is currently marketing its own 77 Hudson condo tower in Jersey City. It is also, according to a spokesman, Doug Fenichel, looking for incomplete projects on which to step in and finish a job.
 ''The ideal for us,'' Mr. Fenichel said, ''would be a multifamily project with all the regulatory clearances, perhaps even some infrastructure, on a site close to work centers and good schools.'' 
 Last month, the Pinnacle Companies acquired an unfinished 270-unit project in Clifton called Winthrop Court, and held a grand ''reopening'' ceremony. The homeowners' group at the development, where only 45 percent of units had been sold, announced its delight at the prospect of completed construction.
 A group of investors led by Fred Daibes recently took over the Moorings, an 18-unit waterfront development in Edgewater that was half finished when its developer, Anthony Rinaldi, lost financial footing in 2007 with just four condominiums sold. The group acquired the note at a ''significant discount,'' Mr. Daibes said.
 A successful developer of rental properties in the Edgewater area, Mr. Daibes is the chairman of a bank he founded and was recently identified as New Jersey's biggest loser in the Bernard L. MadoffPonzi scheme. Although his losses exceeded $17 million, Mr. Daibes described them as a fraction of the fortune he had made in real estate development.
 His company, Daibes Construction, has nearly completed work on seven more units at the Moorings -- five of which sold in the last few months -- and expects to begin construction of the remaining seven units after that.
 ''I think there is reason to make optimistic moves like this,'' he said. ''A property that may have been distressed can still have very solid investment value.''

HEADLINE: The Case for Global Bonds (if Not for the Euro)

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
AS 2010 began, the overwhelming consensus for bonds was that those holding them risked a hefty climb in interest rates. Another assumption was that the huge build-up in United States debt would push down the value of the dollar. 
 The results so far? Wrong on both counts. Rates have eased, and the dollar has strengthened.
 ''What was not predictable was the fear of contagion that emerged in Europe'' prompted by the fiscal crisis in Greece, said Zane E. Brown, fixed-income strategist at Lord Abbett & Company.
 This broad threat to growth also prompted a new, haven-seeking flight to the dollar. 
 These unexpected developments might suggest that the growing ranks of yield-starved American investors attracted to foreign bonds, typically through mutual funds, may be having second thoughts.
 ''Most of the funds in the category lost some ground'' in the second quarter, said Miriam Sjoblom, a bond analyst at Morningstar. For many, she added, ''it's the euro that's been dragging things down.''
 The group lost 0.35 percent in the second quarter, according to Morningstar, versus a first-quarter gain of 1.1 percent and a jump of 13.1 percent for all of 2009. Morningstar's world bond category of some 80 funds is highly diverse. Some hedge currencies; some include United States Treasury debt. But all share exposure to foreign fixed-income securities, and most of the portfolios hold a mix of sovereign and corporate debt. 
 Global bond funds can invest anywhere in the world; international funds exclude American securities. Either type might seem an especially difficult asset to evaluate. After all, investors must consider currency values as well as the direction of interest rates, not to mention the usual factors like manager skill, default risk and costs. Still, the vast investment landscape makes it relatively easy for managers to avoid problem areas and, as one put it, concentrate on the ''low-hanging fruit.'' 
 Despite the bumpy spring in the market -- ''a bit of a perfect storm,'' according to Michael Hasenstab, portfolio manager of the $33 billion Templeton Global Bond fund -- relatively few investors have bailed out. 
 World bond funds are on a pace this year to surpass the inflow of $23.55 billion of 2009, despite a recent slowing. For April and May, the inflow was $4.63 billion, compared with $13.07 billion in the first three months of the year, according to Morningstar. 
 EUROPE was the market's focal point this spring, Ms. Sjoblom observed, as budget and other economic woes weighed on interest rates and prompted a renewed stampede into the presumably safer dollar. 
 The value of the euro, the common currency of 16 nations, fell in the first half of the year, to $1.22 from $1.43, or 15 percent. And the euro's very survival came into question, with pessimists contending that a common currency could not long endure without the coordinating structure of a common fiscal authority.
 During the second quarter, managers continued to shed debt of the most overborrowed countries, with Spain, Portugal and Italy coming under closer scrutiny. Greece, its debt downgraded to junk status, clung to solvency and was backstopped by an international rescue package. 
 Because domestic yields have been so skimpy -- even negative for short- and medium-term Treasury securities when adjusted for inflation -- some specialists argue that this might still be a propitious time for American bond investors to look abroad. 
 Global bonds are ''still a very interesting asset class,'' said Kenneth M. Buntrock, a co-manager of the $2 billion Loomis Sayles Global Bond fund in Boston. Along with most other forecasters, he puts the chances of United States interest rates rising this year ''at virtually zero.'' 
 Mr. Buntrock said his fund provides ''a big diversification of currencies and sectors -- U.S., European and Asian investment-grade bonds, global high-yield and small exposure to asset-backed securities.'' 
 The combination of quality extremes tends to provide higher returns, adjusted for risk, than a middle-ground approach would. With an average portfolio quality of Aa-3, the fund has provided a substantial yield, of 3.8 percent in the 12 months through June. 
 Loomis Sayles Global boasted investment inflows through March, but ''a little bit of outflow'' during the second quarter, Mr. Buntrock said. 
 Bill Gross, the chief strategist at the bond giant Pimco, has recently modified his bearish outlook for United States Treasury bonds, moving essentially to neutral from underweight. Earlier fears that swelling deficits and government borrowing would drive rates higher have been mitigated to some extent by prospects for slower economic growth.
 The global volatility of this past spring produced some enticing investment opportunities. Mr. Hasenstab says that despite the ''huge head wind in Europe,'' the creation of the safety net for European borrowers has made government defaults unlikely.
 And he notes that some countries, like Poland and Norway, have solid budgets. The debt of those two countries, along with that of South Korea, Sweden, Australia and two Australian states, make up the top holdings of his fund.
 ''U.S. growth will outperform European growth,'' Mr. Hasenstab says, adding that Asian growth outside of Japan ''will outperform both Europe and the U.S.'' He suggests that most Asian currencies will appreciate against the dollar, euro and yen. 
 ''We're not a believer in a global double-dip'' recession, he added, noting that China has ''lots of tools'' to soften the blow if it appears to be overdoing efforts to curb unsustainable expansion. 
 Mr. Brown of Lord Abbett, citing substantial risk in United States Treasury bonds, said he had become somewhat encouraged about Europe, where ''perhaps gradual austerity programs won't do quite as much damage to growth as feared.''
 Although his firm has no fund devoted specifically to foreign bonds, Mr. Brown monitors foreign corporate issues, which make up 10 percent to 15 percent of the Lord Abbett High Yield fund, and foreign currencies for its Developing Local Markets fund. 
 DESPITE huge gains in 2009, both foreign and domestic junk bonds still ''offer some fantastic opportunities,'' Mr. Brown said. He added that corporate credits lend themselves to more reliable financial evaluation than do the political actions of governments.
 Somewhat surprisingly, Mr. Brown also advised income-oriented investors seeking to diversify out of the dollar to favor stocks over bonds, which are often expensively hedged.
 ''They really ought to think of equities first and fixed-income second,'' he said. 
 Still, foreign bonds remain an expanding asset class, now a strategic rather than merely a tactical allocation for many investors. ''It's now more important than ever to have a longer view and not to get caught up in quarter-to-quarter moves,'' Mr. Hasenstab says.

HEADLINE: Meanwhile, Back in Cleveland...

BYLINE: By ERIN O'BRIEN. 
Erin O'Brien is a freelance writer.

 BODY:
Cleveland
 WALKING through the stifling heat on Thursday night, just after LeBron James announced he was leaving Cleveland for Miami, I passed smokers in the parking lot of a sports bar, the sort of place where the beers are cheap, the televisions are enormous and there are plenty of both. 
 The smokers were jabbing their cigarette-laden hands into the humid air, cursing LeBron, a once-favorite son -- he's from nearby Akron -- and now, in their eyes, a traitor. This wasn't mere sports-fan ire; they were mourning their city. ''Cleveland will never recover from this,'' lamented one woman. 
 I wanted to reassure her, tell her we've survived worse. I've lived in Cleveland my whole life, and I've seen the city tie itself to one mercurial athlete after another. I remember blinking at the screen in disbelief when Earnest Byner made his famous fumble, losing the 1988 American Football Conference championship. The Browns' head coach, Bill Belichick, could never push Cleveland to a Super Bowl, but he later led the New England Patriots to that hallowed match four times. 
 This is not to say that the LeBron experience didn't come with an extra element of pain. LeBron James isn't just another local athlete. He's a hometown boy from the projects who made it big, and he made Cleveland feel big. With him on the court, every game was an event. He drove our economy, and we were proud of it: a huge billboard with an image of LeBron looking much like Jesus on the cross holds court above the intersection of West Huron Road and Ontario Street, the gateway to downtown.
 It's no wonder, then, that Clevelanders held out hope, right to the end. ''I think he will stay,'' David Lee Morgan, author of ''LeBron James: The Rise of a Star,'' told me before the announcement. ''He could win championships and be God, or he could be a great loser. We're used to losers here.''
 Nor is it any wonder that, when he left, we turned on him. The only thing on the front page of Friday's ''LeBron James Edition'' of The Cleveland Plain Dealer was a giant photo of him walking away, the word ''Gone'' to his right -- and in a much smaller font, ''7 years in Cleveland. No rings,'' with an arrow pointing to his right hand.
 The lack of a championship: if only he'd won a title for us, folks say, then it wouldn't be so bad. It always comes down to that one breathless moment in Cleveland, with a fickle superstar putting a lump in everyone's throat. Then the ball goes south, the screen goes black and the thrill is replaced with that familiar feeling of being let down. 
 Someday, LeBron James will be just a memory as we fall into the arms of our next dashing savior. We'll vow to love him when he loses as well as when he wins. Then he'll drop us cold. Too much faith? Not in this town. Sometimes faith is all we have.

HEADLINE: Volcker, Loud and Clear

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
JUST before the Fourth of July weekend, Paul A. Volcker packed his fishing gear and set off for his annual outing to the Canadian wilds to cast for Atlantic salmon. 
 He left behind a group of legislators in Washington still trying to nail down a controversial attempt to overhaul the nation's financial regulations in the wake of the country's most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression. 
 A well-regarded lion of the regulatory world, Mr. Volcker had endorsed the legislation before he went fishing, but unenthusiastically. If he were a teacher, and not a senior White House adviser and the towering former chairman of the Federal Reserve, he says, he would have given the new rules just an ordinary B -- not even a B-plus. 
 ''There is a certain circularity in all this business,'' he concedes. ''You have a crisis, followed by some kind of reform, for better or worse, and things go well for a while, and then you have another crisis.'' 
 As the financial overhaul took final shape recently, he worked the phone from his Manhattan office and made periodic visits to Washington, trying to persuade members of Congress to make the legislation more far-reaching. ''Constructive advice,'' he calls it, emphasizing that he never engaged in lobbying. 
 For all of what he describes as the overhaul's strengths -- particularly the limits placed on banks' trading activities -- he still feels that the legislation doesn't go far enough in curbing potentially problematic bank activities like investing in hedge funds.
 Like few other policy giants of his generation, Mr. Volcker has been a pivotal figure in the regulatory universe for decades, and as he looks back at his long, storied career he confesses to some regrets, in particular for failing to speak out more forcefully about the dangers of a seismic wave of financial deregulation that began in the 1970s and reached full force in the late 1990s.
 Despite his recent efforts to ensure that the financial legislation might correct what he regards as some of the mistakes of the deregulatory years, he's concerned that it still gives banks too much wiggle room to repeat the behavior that threw the nation into crisis in the first place.
 Some analysts share Mr. Volcker's worries that the proposed changes may ultimately not be enough.
 ''It could be we will look back in 10 years and say, 'Wow, Volcker really changed the tone of the debate and the outcome,' '' says Simon Johnson, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a historian of financial crises and regulation. ''But I kind of worry that is not going to happen.''
 Hear, hear, says Mr. Volcker.
 ''People are nervous about the long-term outlook, and they should be,'' he says.
 AMONG the tools that Mr. Volcker has been able to deploy when regulatory debates heat up is the public support he enjoys in financial and political circles.
 He earned that esteem over many years, and is famously credited for making tough-minded choices to tame runaway inflation as Fed chairman from 1979 to 1987, when he served under Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.
 At the age of 82, Mr. Volcker is from a generation of Wall Street personalities who accepted strict financial regulation as a fact of life through much of their careers. In his recent push for more stringent financial regulations than he believed Congress -- and the Obama administration, for that matter -- were inclined to approve, he lined up public support for a tougher crackdown from other well-known financiers who are roughly his age, including George Soros, Nicholas F. Brady, William H. Donaldson and John C. Bogle.
 His most visible contribution to the current regulatory overhaul effort is what has come to be known as the Volcker rule, which in its initial form would have banned commercial banks from engaging in what Wall Street calls proprietary trading -- that is, risking their own funds to speculate on potentially volatile products like mortgage-backed securities and credit-default swaps. 
 Such bets added considerable tinder to the financial conflagration that erupted in 2008. Many went horribly awry, and the federal government used taxpayer money to bail out banks, Wall Street firms and even a major insurer.
 ''I did not realize that the speculative trading by commercial banks had gotten as far out of hand as it had,'' says Mr. Volcker, explaining why he first proposed the rule 18 months ago.
 Congressional handicappers and Wall Street originally gave the Volcker rule a slim chance of becoming part of the overhaul bill -- until, in fact, it got solidly on track to do just that. 
 Mr. Volcker thinks that Congress has watered down his trading rule -- more on that later -- but rather than roar in protest, he has resigned himself to the present shape of the Volcker rule as well as the overall legislation. 
 ''The success of this approach is going to be heavily dependent on how aggressively and intelligently it is implemented,'' he says, emphasizing that a new, 10-member regulatory council authorized by the bill will have to be vigilant and tough to prevent the nation's giant banks and investment houses from pulling America into yet another devastating credit crisis. ''It is not just a question of defining what needs to be done, but carrying it out in practice, day by day, bank by bank.'' 
 The 2,400-page financial overhaul legislation, already passed by the House, is coming up for a vote in the Senate this week. 
 The Obama administration says it is now satisfied with the broader legislation, and in particular with the Volcker rule in its amended form.
 ''The Volcker rule was designed to make sure that banks could not engage in proprietary trading or create risks to the system through their investments in hedge funds or private equity,'' says Neal S. Wolin, the deputy Treasury secretary. ''We accomplished that.''
 Some members of Congress who have backed the bill still say that it is not as restrictive as they would like, but that a more sweeping bill -- one that also hewed to Mr. Volcker's original conception -- wouldn't make it through the Senate, where the vote is expected to be close. 
 Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, subscribes to that view. He says that there are stronger measures he would have preferred to see in the bill, including the original version of the Volcker rule, but that political reality dictated otherwise. 
 ''I would give the present bill an A-minus,'' Mr. Frank says, ''when you consider that six months ago people were saying the Volcker rule had no chance.'' 
 Mr. Frank is quick to point out that Mr. Volcker signed off on the compromises that got the Volcker rule into the bill. Mr. Volcker doesn't dispute that.
 ''The thing went from what is best to what could be passed,'' he says. 
 THE financial bill has been routinely described in the news media and on Capitol Hill as the most far-reaching regulatory overhaul since the Great Depression, which in some aspects it may be. But it certainly falls short of re-establishing some of the strict boundaries that the earlier laws put in place.
 Those laws, most notably the Glass-Steagall Act, forbade commercial banks (what are now, for example, Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America) and investment banks (like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley) from mingling plain-vanilla products like savings accounts, mortgages and business loans with the more high-octane, high-risk endeavors of trading. 
 Such rules managed to keep the banks and the Wall Street investment houses -- and the broader economy that depended on them -- out of a 2008-style crisis for several decades. But the gradual unwinding of those regulations began in the 1970s as Mr. Volcker rose to prominence, first as president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1975, and then as Fed chairman.
 Mr. Volcker says that most of the deregulation came after he left the Fed. His reluctance to deregulate contributed in part to his departure under pressure from the Reagan administration. His replacement, Alan Greenspan, openly campaigned to weaken and finally repeal Glass-Steagall, and President Bill Clinton signed the repeal into law in 1999.
 Although Mr. Volcker opposed the repeal, he didn't go public with his concerns. ''It is very difficult to take restrictive action when the economy and the financial markets seemed to be doing so well,'' he says of his silence at the time. ''But eventually things blew up.''
 He also says he failed to anticipate just how wild things would become, post-Glass-Steagall: ''Those were the days before credit-default swaps, derivatives, securitization. All of that changed the landscape, and now some adjustment must be made.''
 There were other, earlier silences. Starting in the 1970s, ceilings came off the interest rates banks could place on most deposits and loans. A rising inflation rate made the ceilings impractical, and competition from unregulated money market funds was siphoning big chunks of deposits from the banks. 
 ''The lifting of interest-rate ceilings was inevitable,'' he says. ''I was for doing it more gradually, but it got such a momentum that we moved the limits more abruptly than I wanted to.'' 
 In the wake of those changes, banks were suddenly free to charge more for risky loans, and that encouraged risky lending. The subprime mortgage market grew out of this dynamic, as did the panoply of complex, mortgage-backed securities, credit-default swaps and heart-stopping leverage that finally produced the 2008 crisis. 
 In retrospect, Mr. Volcker regrets not challenging the widely held assumptions that underpinned much of this. ''You had an intellectual conviction that you did not need much regulation -- that the market could take care of itself,'' he says. ''I'm happy that illusion has been shattered.''
 THE Volcker rule, in its initial, undiluted form, was an attempt to resurrect the spirit of Glass-Steagall. 
 The administration initially did not want to separate banks and investment houses, and wanted federal regulation and protections in place for both the Banks of America and the Goldman Sachses of the world. Mr. Volcker disagreed. Let Goldman Sachs and others trade to their hearts' content, he argued in Congressional testimony last fall, and if they fail they can lose their own money, not get a dime in bailouts from taxpayers, and then be dismantled by the government in an orderly fashion.
 Old-fashioned commercial banks that made loans to individuals and businesses were much more essential to the financial system, he argued, and deserved broader federal support than pure Wall Street trading shops. 
 But in exchange for that support, Mr. Volcker said, commercial banks had to agree to a partial resurrection of Glass-Steagall that corralled their trading activities. His hope is that the trading restrictions will make the nation's banks embrace the business of commercial and consumer lending more fully and move away from speculative trading. 
 To encourage that shift, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, co-sponsored an amendment to the financial bill that would have incorporated the Volcker rule with all of its original restrictions. Mr. Volcker even had a hand in writing the amendment, so much so that Senator Merkley suggested, only half-jokingly, that it should be called the Merkley-Levin-Volcker amendment.
 The White House, after resisting, signed on to the proposal, and so did Congress after much internal wrangling -- but the legislation now contains what Mr. Volcker considers an annoying and potentially dangerous loophole.
 Instead of forbidding banks to make investments in hedge funds and private equity funds, the amendment allows them to invest up to 3 percent of their capital in such funds, so long as the fund is ''walled off'' from the bank in a separate subsidiary. 
 Banks won't be allowed to leverage their investments by lending to a hedge fund; such a loan, if sizable enough, could endanger the bank if the hedge fund should fail. In addition, if regulators discover that a bank is overexposed to a given fund, they are required to intervene and, in some cases, may even be able to shut down the fund or restrict its activities, in order to preserve a bank's well-being.
 But the lending restriction is not as clear-cut as it should be, cautions Senator Merkley. 
 ''We have to get some clarification on that,'' he says.
 Nor is it clear that a bank wouldn't try to come to the aid of a hedge fund or a private equity firm in danger of failing if that failure would also cause financial or reputational problems for the bank. 
 For all of that, Henry Kaufman, a Wall Street economist and a contemporary of Mr. Volcker, wonders how effectively regulators will enforce any of the bill's numerous mandates. ''The legislation is a Rube Goldberg contraption,'' he says, ''and there are very long timelines before the Volcker rule is fully implemented.''
 Whatever warts exist in the Volcker rule, its author says that other positive elements of the larger bill are still worthy and important. 
 ''Don't take the Volcker rule out of perspective,'' he says. ''It is one aspect of a broad reform, and it became a big issue because the administration initially disagreed.''
 MR. VOLCKER has had a lukewarm relationship with the Obama White House, where the approach to the economy and financial regulation has been dominated by Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, and Lawrence H. Summers, director of the National Economic Council.
 Both men were at the center of the deregulatory whirlwind that swept across Wall Street and Washington over the last decade or so, and analysts have considered them to be friendlier to Wall Street and less inclined to pursue tougher regulations than Mr. Volcker would be.
 Mr. Volcker supported Mr. Obama in the 2008 presidential election, and the new president named him to lead his Economic Recovery Advisory Board, a group of distinguished outsiders with little real impact on White House policy -- until Mr. Volcker publicly proposed the ban on proprietary trading by commercial banks. 
 After the proposal gained support outside Washington, the president embraced it and dubbed it the Volcker rule. That gave Mr. Volcker more access to the White House and the Treasury on regulatory policy, but people who work with him say that the White House doesn't regularly seek his input on other issues. 
 However complicated his relationship with Washington, Mr. Volcker says his personal life has taken a turn for the better. He had been a widower since 1998, until six months ago when he married Anke Dening, his longtime administrator, executive secretary, adviser and constant companion. Ms. Dening, who is German-born and speaks several languages, travels regularly with her husband and often serves as his interpreter.
 When it comes to interpreting the financial legislation, Mr. Volcker says he remains less than impressed. ''We have to have a regulatory system that reflects today's problems and tomorrow's potential problems,'' he says. ''This bill attempts to do that. Does it do it perfectly? Obviously it does not go as far as I felt it should go.''

HEADLINE: Newfound Strength In Frontier Markets

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
THREE years ago, when Joseph Rohm, manager of the T. Rowe Price Africa and Middle East fund, visited Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, he was chaperoned by guards carrying semiautomatic weapons. These days, he strolls the streets alone. ''I feel safer in Lagos than I do in Johannesburg,'' said Mr. Rohm, a native of South Africa. 
 That transition underscores the changing reality of so-called frontier stock markets, those that are less developed than emerging markets like Brazil, China and India. Countries, whole regions even, that a few years ago were dismissed as perilous to both body and bourse have come into stock market vogue. 
 Big investment companies have rolled out mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that put all or at least a big chunk of their money in frontier regions. Mr. Rohm's fund, one of the older offerings, began in 2007. As of the end of April, it had invested about three-fourths of its $207 million in countries including Nigeria, Kenya and Qatar. For the 12 months through June, it returned 17 percent. 
 Two leading providers of exchange-traded funds, Claymore Securities and Invesco PowerShares, have also introduced frontier products. The Claymore/BNY Mellon Frontier Markets E.T.F. invests around the world, while the PowerShares MENA Frontier Countries Portfolio focuses on the Middle East and North Africa. Both are built upon frontier-market indexes and invest passively. 
 The frontier pitch resonates at a time when the American and Western European economies are struggling and United States interest rates are sagging. And returns in several of the leading emerging stock markets, Brazil, China and Russia, have faltered this year, after surging in 2009.
 ''We view frontier markets as attractively valued compared with emerging markets,'' said Constantine Papageorgiou, a senior portfolio manager at Acadian Asset Management in Boston. ''They didn't participate in the huge run-up in 2009 that you saw in the emerging markets.''
 Frontier investing is a new-enough phenomenon that professionals disagree on which countries make up the sector. Different managers and index providers include different names. The Claymore E.T.F., for example, has Chile and Poland among its top five holdings, though neither is part of the MSCI Frontier Index. The index includes such diverse countries as Argentina, Romania, Kenya and Kazakhstan. It rose 0.66 percent, including dividends, in the first six months this year, compared with a negative total return of 7.57 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The frontier index has been helped along by positive returns in three of its important markets -- Nigeria, Kuwait and Qatar.
 Almost everyone, including MSCI, puts Nigeria in the frontier category. ''I get people asking, 'Who's the next Brazil?' '' said Adam J. Kutas, manager of the Fidelity Emerging Europe, Middle East and Africa fund. ''I answer without hesitation that it's Nigeria,'' because it also has a large population and a huge base of natural resources.
 Nigeria holds hefty oil reserves -- the world's 10th largest, according to the Central Intelligence Agency. For years, its riches produced unrest, as residents of the oil-producing Niger Delta rebelled against what they saw as too small a share of the profits. Lately, the delta has stabilized, and the country, formerly a military dictatorship, has had several democratic transitions. 
 Rising commodity prices have helped Nigeria and several of the leading African economies, which tend to be resource-rich, says Paul Collier, director of the Center for the Study of African Economies at Oxford University. ''These countries are the last frontier for natural resource discovery,'' Professor Collier said. ''With high commodity prices, it'll all get discovered. '' 
 At the same time, policy makers in places like Nigeria have tamed hyperinflation and liberalized trade, he said. That combination of resource wealth and macro stability is attracting investors. 
 Many but not all of the frontier countries are richly endowed with commodities. As expected from economies on four continents, they're diverse. Kazakhstan, for example, unearths oil, metals and mineral, while Argentina sells soybeans, corn and wheat. Vietnam excels at manufacturing. 
 Because of this diversity, their stock returns tend not to move in lock step with those in developed and emerging markets, Mr. Papageorgiou of Acadian said. They can zig when the developed world zags. And returns in the frontier regions even tend not to track one another.
 ''Eastern European markets will trade in line with each other but very differently from the African countries,'' Mr. Papageorgiou said. Thus, a small frontier allocation can provide diversification in a portfolio. 
 All of this does not mean that these locales have become low-risk. ''Some people think that noncorrelation means that frontier markets always will be up when everything else is down,'' said Gregg I. Wolper, a senior fund analyst with Morningstar. ''That's not true. They're not a miracle drug. In the bear market, they got hit hard, so it's not that they're protected.''
 Some frontier countries remain more vulnerable to corruption and political crises than the typical developed market, said Darrell S. Zechman, a Chicago-based consultant with Towers Watson Investment Services. ''They're highly volatile, so you need a very long time horizon,'' Mr. Zechman said. 
 Even so, he said he agreed with arguments for investing in them. ''They're relatively diverse, populous and growing fast,'' he said. ''They're not fully established, but they do merit consideration. People were saying the same kinds of things about emerging markets 15 years ago.'' 
 So what might be an appropriate frontier allocation for a long-term investor who already has a diversified portfolio and can tolerate the risks? Estimates from money managers who operate in the sector range from 2 to 5 percent. 
 But Mr. Wolper of Morningstar was skeptical about investing anything at all. ''International funds and emerging market funds put very little money in frontier markets,'' he said. ''You can build a nice international portfolio without a frontier markets fund.'' 
 Even if you believe that frontier countries will grow far faster than the developed world, you have to deal with the practicalities, including cost, of investing in them, he said. Frontier funds tend to be more expensive than average and have short records. ''They could have great potential, but you can't simply assume that you'll get great returns,'' Mr. Wolper said. 
 ANYONE who believes that frontier markets will rise relentlessly should recall 1978, said Mr. Kutas at Fidelity. That was when Time magazine named Deng Xiaoping, who led the overhaul of China's economy, as its Man of the Year. 
 ''That's when the world came to the idea that China was opening, and that's quite a few years ago,'' Mr. Kutas said. Since then, the economy has boomed, but the stock market has been on a roller coaster -- sagging, for example, during and after the Asian financial crisis that began in 1997. ''What I'm saying is that a lot of these trends are true, but you can go through periods of sharp volatility.''

HEADLINE: They Saw A Way Around A Wreck

BYLINE: By TIM GRAY

 BODY:
MUCH went awry in the stock market in the second quarter, and stock mutual funds suffered accordingly, losing an average of 10 percent, according to Morningstar. Even so, the quarter's better performers managed to limit losses and, in a few cases, grub out some gains. They found havens both in expected places, like gold and China, and in unpredictable ones, like real estate. 
 A Golden Hedge
Investors have long seen gold as a haven in troubled times. It acts as ''a hedge against other financial assets not working,'' says William H. Martin, a manager of the American Century Global Gold fund. 
 With economic uncertainty gripping the United States, Europe and Japan, some investors would prefer to park their money in the glittering metal rather than in dollars, euros or yen. That helped to propel gold bullion to a record price of more than $1,250 an ounce in June. 
 In an environment like that, the fund is designed to thrive. The managers -- Mr. Martin and Joseph B. Sterling -- don't make outsized bets on particular producers or the untested exploration outfits that Mr. Martin calls ''wildcatters''; they also mostly shun other precious metals. Silver accounts for only about 10 percent of their holdings, and others are absent. 
 ''We're trying to capture that alternative currency role'' for gold, Mr. Martin said. ''The other metals have more of an industrial influence on their pricing.'' 
 The approach leaves their fund with a hefty exposure to the burliest of the gold companies -- Barrick Gold, Goldcorp and Newmont Mining, all of which provided positive returns through June. 
 At the end of March, these three comprised nearly 30 percent of the fund, which has almost $1 billion in assets. (The three represented about 40 percent of the fund's benchmark, the N.Y.S.E. Arca Gold Miners index.) 
 ''We're looking to capture production growth and keep costs down, and those three are doing a great job at replacing their production and working costs down,'' Mr. Martin said. 
 The managers will take smaller exploratory positions beyond the stalwarts. Lately, that has led them to Canadian companies that operate in Africa, including Red Back Mining, which has mines in Mauritania and Ghana, and Semafo, with mines in Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger. 
 ''There are low-cost properties in Africa, and the culture for mining is positive,'' compared with, say, the United States, where mines can face community opposition and regulatory obstacles, Mr. Martin said. 
 The fund returned 16.9 percent for the quarter, versus a loss of 12 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.7 percent and doesn't carry a sales charge. But to discourage frequent trading, it imposes a 1 percent fee on shares held for fewer than 60 days.
 A Lift From China
 China's economic growth -- estimated at 9.5 percent this year -- helped limit the losses of the Morgan Stanley Mid Cap Growth fund in the second quarter. The lead manager, Dennis P. Lynch, said he didn't go seeking exposure to China's boom. Rather, his sleuthing in stock sectors like technology and real estate led him there.
 Consider Baidu, the fund's top holding as of the end of May, at about 6 percent of assets. It's the leading Internet search provider in China, and Web stocks have long filled the portfolios that Mr. Lynch oversees. He also directs Morgan Stanley's Focus Growth fund, in which Google is a top investment. 
 Another large Mid Cap stake, Wynn Resorts, is better known for its lavish Las Vegas properties than its interests in Asia. But it, too, is angling to capitalize on China's growth. In 2006, Wynn opened a casino in Macao, the former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that has become China's gambling capital.
 ''We've owned Wynn for about six and a half years now,'' he said. ''Macao was off everyone's radar when we bought it.'' 
 The duration of the Wynn holding is typical for Mr. Lynch. He prefers not to jump in and out of stocks. Instead, he said he tries to buy early and to hang on, tolerating setbacks if a company's competitive advantage endures. Mid Cap will usually hold a stock for four years, compared with about a year for the average fund. 
 Mr. Lynch and his team of co-managers and analysts scout for stocks and American depository receipts of midsize public companies. Beyond that, they can invest wherever they like.
 If that makes them generalists, so be it: Mr. Lynch said he would prefer that they read and research widely, rather than burrow into esoterica. ''People spend too much time on minutiae,'' he said. ''In a world of specialists, we want to make sure our team has a broad perspective.''
 The retail shares of Mr. Lynch's fund lost 5 percent in the second quarter, versus a loss of 9.6 percent for the average mid-cap growth offering tracked by Morningstar. The fund has an expense ratio of 1.17 percent, and its Class A shares carry an upfront sales charge of 5.25 percent.
 Focusing on REITs
 In contrast to Mr. Lynch, Anthony R. Manno Jr., lead manager of the JPMorgan U.S. Real Estate Selectfund, says he is a specialist. As an investor, he sticks to his designated sector and, even within it, won't buy every sort of security available. He skips the riskier and more obscure fare like home-building companies and timberland holdings. 
 Instead, he said, his fund is designed to enable retail investors to ''put their capital in the same kinds of assets that the largest pension funds are trying to buy.''
 For him, that means real estate investment trusts, or REITs, that own office buildings, hotels, hospitals, apartments and self-storage operations. 
 The home-building sector may be hurting, but the best of the commercial real estate companies have managed to chug along steadily. ''Most of their cash flow is driven by rents already in place,'' Mr. Manno said. 
 As a rule, he favors REITs in older markets like Boston, New York and San Francisco. These cities, which have already been intensively developed and have complex permit requirements for new structures, provide a measure of protection to property owners. 
 ''In a place like Midtown Manhattan, it can take 7 to 10 years to develop a building, so you know what's coming online,'' Mr. Manno said. Such markets ''can be more predictable,'' he said, ''and you have leases in place, so there's not volatility of cash flow.''
 Lately, he has stocked up on shares of apartment REITs like AvalonBay Communities and Equity Residential, which was the fund's top holding at the end of May. Partly, he did that in response to the bursting of the housing bubble and the resulting rash of mortgage foreclosures. He reasoned that some former homeowners would need to move into apartments.
 ''We'd been migrating toward a 70 percent homeownership rate in this country versus the 65 percent we'd seen traditionally,'' he said. ''Now we're migrating back toward 65.'' 
 Mr. Manno's fund lost 2.4 percent in the second quarter, compared with an average loss of 4.2 percent for funds in its category, according to Morningstar. The fund, with $1.2 billion in assets, has an expense ratio of 0.93 percent.

HEADLINE: Where Guests Help Head 'em Up

BYLINE: By JEFF WISE

 BODY:
A LEISURELY dinner hour is drawing to a close at the J Bar L ranch in southwest Montana, and a party of guests is still abuzz with the excitement of the day. Eyes bright despite fatigue, they swap tales of how they'd spent the day herding cattle. A high point for some was a veterinary procedure in which cows were held immobile in a chute while a vet made an incision in a flank and reached in arm-deep to pull out the ovaries.
 At the J Bar L, taking on the cowboy lifestyle isn't an idle amusement. And for its guests, that is the key to its appeal: it's a fully authentic livestock operation, where work comes first. ''We don't change our ranch operations to cater to guests,'' said the ranch manager, Bryan Ulring. ''We've got over 1,000 head of cattle. When we move them, it's because we need to move them.'' 
 The property is one of a small but growing number of ranches where guests are willing to pay a premium to experience Western life in a far earthier way than at a standard dude ranch. At the J Bar L, there's no spa, no room service and few amenities, except a gorgeous backdrop of seemingly endless grasslands and mountains. And there's plenty of work to be done. The payoff: a feeling of authenticity that comes from experiencing the West as few but ranch hands ever do.
 ''I feel like I can connect emotionally with these wide-open spaces,'' said Matt Miller, 63, a J Bar L guest from Connecticut who normally spends his days serving as a doctor and administrator at Danbury Hospital. ''This kind of isolation is not common.''
 The J Bar L is owned by Peggy Dulany, a scion of the Rockefeller family, who bought it in 2000 and began accepting a small number of guests four years later. The ranch has room for no more than 20 guests at a time, who bunk down in former homesteaders' cabins that were carefully dismantled and then reassembled with modern comforts in mind; while the unfinished logs that make up the exterior have been authentically weathered by a century of Montana winters, the interiors are appointed with cozy, overstuffed leather armchairs and working cast-iron stoves (albeit ones fueled by propane).
 The J Bar L runs its cattle across 20,000 acres near the Idaho border, in a vast and largely empty valley framed by the looming peaks of the Centennial Mountains. It was this pristine quality that attracted Ms. Dulany, a granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller Jr. Ten years ago, she'd never even been to the Centennial Valley. Then a friend took her on a scenic drive in late autumn. ''We came in on a 56-mile ride on a dirt road that runs through national forest,'' she recalled. ''And as the valley opened before me, and the different mountain ranges came into view, and there was snow on the ground -- it was just totally gorgeous. My heart said, 'This is it.' ''
 But Ms. Dulany didn't just want to own the land; she wanted to maintain it as a working landscape. ''I'm interested in preserving ranch- and farmland as ranch- and farmland, rather than letting it be parceled into subdivisions.'' she said. ''But the economics of raising cattle is not the greatest. If you diversify, you can create a viable operation.''
 When she was starting to explore the guest-ranch market, Ms. Dulany turned for advice to Bill Bryan, a co-founder of the custom travel outfitter Off the Beaten Path, who had long counted the Rockefeller family among his clients. In addition to creating bespoke itineraries for a well-heeled clientele, Mr. Bryan is director of the Rural Landscape Institute, a group that advocates for the preservation of the West's rural way of life. ''There's nothing out here that's just nature,'' he said. ''It's nature and people. It's that connection that's so important for people to understand.''
 To keep that connection intact, Mr. Bryan helps owners of large properties to tap an alternative revenue source in the form of small-volume, high-value tourism. He has also consulted with the Padlock Ranch, an operation that runs 11,000 head of cattle over nearly half a million acres near the Bighorn Mountains. For more than half a century the Scott family ran it as a strictly commercial operation; last year, though, they started bringing in small number of paying guests -- no more than 14 at a time. ''This isn't a dude ranch,'' said Wayne Fahsholtz, the ranch manager. ''We involve guests in ranch activities, and if we had 50 people, they couldn't participate very well.''
 Padlock guests stay at the Wolf Mountain Lodge, a palatial log-cabin-style inn. As at the J Bar L, guests are welcome to take part in daily ranch activities like rounding up and moving cattle, or they go on hikes, fish, or take leisurely trail rides. For the more ambitious, the ranch offers an intensive ''Cowboy School,'' in which ranch hands provide one-on-one instruction in the various points of cattle husbandry.
 Not all the landowners that Mr. Bryan works with are billionaires. In southern Montana, he has consulted with a group of neighboring ranch-owning families that banded together last year to form a collective called Madison Valley Expeditions. The organization takes paying guests to a variety of ranches.
 ''It was an idea that was born in the community,'' said the manager of Madison Valley, Todd Graham. ''The issue was that there was so much wildlife in the valley -- elk, antelope, wolves, bears, raptors -- and they were consuming such a large amount of resources that it was a burden on the ranchers.'' Allowing paying guests access to that abundance of wildlife is a way for the ranchers to turn a burden into a new revenue source. Visitors are also invited to work cattle alongside ranch hands, or simply to enjoy the landscape of the various ranches at their leisure.
 Some of the West's most storied ranches are also opening their gates to guests. Among them is Ted Turner's Vermejo Park ranch in northern New Mexico, which, at 600,000 acres, is about three-quarters the size of Rhode Island. For years, the property has run a small program for hunters and fisherman; two years ago, Mr. Bryan brought in the first small group of visitors for a program focused on forestry and game management. The ranch is home to some 10,000 wild elk, as well as two herds of bison (one wild and one bred for market). Guests who come through Off the Beaten Path can learn about the ranch's livestock management program, as well as its sustainable forestry and endangered species programs.
 Also considering expanding access is Trinchera, the 170,000-acre Colorado spread that Louis Bacon, a prominent hedge fund manager, bought from the Forbes family in 2007 for $175 million. Like Vermejo Park, Trinchera has long allowed hunters and fishermen onto its land, and is now considering letting Mr. Bryan bring in adventure travelers. ''We are actively looking at expanding recreational opportunities on the ranch,'' said Cody Wertz, a Trinchera spokesman. ''It would be great for educating the public about wildlife and habitat management, not just on this ranch, but in Colorado and across the West.''
 For Mr. Bryan, it's all win-win. As a consultant to landowners, he can help maintain traditional stewardship of the land. And as a purveyor of high-end adventure, he can usher Off the Beaten Path clients onto some of the West's most magnificent landscapes, uncluttered by development.
 A day after the spaying session at the J Bar L, he drove down a winding dirt road to the banks of the Ruby River. Mr. Bryan gestured at the dirt track before him. ''You get on a road like this, with grass growing in the middle, and you think to yourself, Holy smoke, this is the real West,'' he said. ''It's still around.''

HEADLINE: Looking Beyond Economic Orthodoxy to Create American Jobs

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEBER. 
Jonathan Weber is editor in chief of The Bay Citizen. jweber@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Andy Grove, one of the founders of the Intel Corporation and a true father of Silicon Valley, is doubtlessly among the most brilliant business strategists of his generation. Yet he has always cut against the grain when it comes to trade issues, championing government support for high-tech industries through much of the 1980s and 1990s and warning of the grave threat to American competitiveness posed by Asian electronics companies.
 Now Mr. Grove is advocating a new policy approach to economic recovery and job creation: a tax on products made overseas, with the proceeds used to fund American firms' ability to grow and build things right here. 
''If the result is a trade war,'' writes Mr. Grove in a recent essay in Bloomberg BusinessWeek magazine, ''treat it like other wars -- fight to win.''
 This, of course, is heresy in corporate America, where the argument over globalization ended long ago. Christopher Thornberg, a Los Angeles economist, succinctly summed up one common reaction to Mr. Grove's article: ''He's an idiot.''
 The received wisdom in the business world is that protectionism in response to economic troubles only makes things worse. More specifically, Mr. Thornberg said exports would be a huge factor in driving the recovery, and that it was thus utter folly to talk about starting a trade war.
 Yet some of Mr. Grove's points are not so easily dismissed. Advocates of globalization say American companies should focus on the high end of the value chain -- do R&D, product design and marketing here, and let low-cost overseas firms handle the manufacturing. But Mr. Grove argues that this will not create enough jobs to assure our long-term economic health.
 A look at the biggest current success stories in Silicon Valley illustrates this dilemma well. 
 Apple, for example, is on a multiyear tear, with revenues and profits soaring; it posted $13.5 billion in revenue for its most recent quarter, up from $9.08 billion a year earlier, and profits almost doubled to $3 billion. 
 Yet employment worldwide was up just 2,300 jobs, to 34,300, from 2008 to 2009, the most recent numbers the company has reported. More people are working to make Apple products, but most of those people work for Foxconn Technology (which employs more than 800,000) or other suppliers in Asia.
 In the Internet industry, likewise, there is little correlation between competitive success and job creation. Google recently reported typically stellar first-quarter earnings, with revenues up 23 percent from the prior year to $6.77 billion. Net income jumped to $1.96 billion, from $1.42 billion. 
 Yet total employment increased less than 5 percent, to 20,600 employees worldwide. If you don't count the people it absorbed with the 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick (and in fact not all those people were absorbed), Google's headcount has increased by just 2,300 since 2007.
 At other hot Bay Area Internet companies -- Facebook, Twitter and Zynga, for example -- there are lots of job openings if you're an engineer or marketer with specific skills. But these jobs number in the hundreds.
 For perspective, 170,300 people were unemployed in Santa Clara, San Mateo and San Francisco Counties in May.
 Mr. Grove's argument is really twofold: the ability to compete over the long run requires the skills and insights that come from building bigger businesses, and social stability requires that innovation industries produce jobs not by the thousands, but by the millions. Free-traders might cite the perils of Depression-era protectionism, but Mr. Grove points to the success of government-driven industrial policies in Asia.
 ''What kind of society are we going to have,'' he asks, ''if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work -- and masses of unemployed?'' 
 For Mr. Thornberg, that misses the point. The economy will recover, and jobs will come back. It will just take awhile, he said, and throwing the benefits of free trade -- money-making exports and lower-cost goods and services -- overboard is a good way to stop the recovery in its tracks.
 For the moment, at least, Mr. Grove's position is a lonely one. But the longer the jobless recovery goes on, the more likely it is that new approaches to job creation will gain traction -- even if they involve economic heresy.

The Tribune Company has come under scrutiny over the past few years for the jarring changes that a management team, laden with radio industry executives, has made to its stable of newspapers. But it is the dramatic and risky revamp occurring inside the bankrupt media company's flagship radio station, WGN-AM 720, that is now making headlines, as its big fan base grows increasingly angry and its grip on the city's radio advertising market loosens.
 The folksy banter from talk-show hosts -- who in some cases have stayed with the powerhouse station for more than 20 years -- helped build a special bond with an audience that became the envy of others in the industry for the long hours Chicagoans spent listening each day. Until recently, WGN was the city's most lucrative and widely listened to station, one that seemed to deserve its familiar tag line ''The Voice of Chicago.''
But a spate of changes -- the recent ouster of a well-known daytime host, the hiring of a former jailed politician to replace a popular sports show at night, and an unfamiliar name from out of town occupying its prized morning slot -- has produced a negative response. Some observers question whether the city is witnessing the beginnings of one of the biggest radio blunders in Chicago media history. 
 ''At some point, this will be a case study of how to dismantle a radio station,'' said Paula Hambrick, a longtime local radio media buyer. ''People were such loyal listeners, 10 hours a day. They're upset and angry, and they are going to look for places to park themselves.''
 Last year, WGN was the only Top 5 station in Chicago to lose market share. It dropped to 8.1 percent of advertising dollars billed from 8.5 percent, good for second place in the market, according to data compiled by BIA/Kelsey. At the same time, the news station WBBM-AM 780, the No. 1 biller in the city, increased its share of the advertising pie to 8.9 percent in 2009 from 8.6 percent in 2008.
 WGN's 2009 advertising revenue was $36.5 million, compared with $44.5 million in 2008, an 18 percent decline in a year when the overall market was down.
 Ratings drive billings, and for WGN, the ratings for the three-month period ending in March were flat. In May, they were up slightly mainly due to excitement surrounding the Blackhawks playoff run, which was carried on the station.
 Stations around the city will await July ratings to show a truer picture of the effects of the WGN changes. So far, the ratings picture has not reflected the anger from listeners on blogs and chat rooms around the city.
 The upheaval comes at a crucial time for executives at the Tribune Company, which is hoping to exit bankruptcy later this year. Management teams are usually risk averse when it comes to major operational changes during bankruptcy, fearing the loss of even more revenue.
 But the Tribune Company has taken a different tack under Randy Michaels, the chief executive. A former Clear Channel Radio executive, Mr. Michaels had helped Sam Zell, the Tribune Company's chairman, sell a radio group to Clear Channel for a premium during a wave of consolidation in the 1990s. Mr. Michaels has brought in several executives from his radio past to help with WGN operations, including Kevin Metheny, who was named WGN program director in late 2008. Howard Stern dubbed Mr. Metheny ''Pig Virus'' in his book ''Private Parts,'' after battling with him earlier in Mr. Stern's career. 
 Asked about the strategy and the anger that the changes have elicited, Tom Langmyer, the station's vice president and general manager, said that one of the things often overlooked is the overall performance of the station. ''The station was getting down to 30th place in key day parts with 25 to 54 year olds,'' he said. ''Those people who are listening are going to be upset. They're upset that their favorite radio station is changing.
 ''Any time you have a heritage brand like WGN, any time you make changes, you are going to have people who are going to be upset. You have to have the courage to do the things that make sense. That is the reason for it. I don't think the typical listener has as much information on the business side. And some of the changes we've made have helped.''
 Mr. Langmyer said that changes have been calculated and based on audience feedback. ''There is a need to make a change to keep the station strong and viable,'' he said. ''The advertising market and the economy in general have changed dramatically, along with the company restructuring. We have to change more rapidly than we normally would.'' 
 Mr. Metheny returned a reporter's phone call, but declined to comment.
 Over the past several months, management at WGN parted ways with longtime hosts, like Kathy O'Malley and Judy Markey, and mothballed its evening ''Sports Central'' show. To fill the sports show's slot, the station hired Jim Laski, a former Chicago politician and felon who had not done radio before -- a move that stunned insiders at the station as well as listeners. ''Laski has done more time in jail than on the air,'' Ms. Hambrick said.
 In the coveted morning slot, traditionally filled by a host who had spent years getting comfortable with the audience in one of the station's other slots, WGN introduced Greg Jarrett, who was brought in from San Francisco last year. Ms. Hambrick said that Mr. Jarrett has so far not caught fire with listeners, although Mr. Langmyer said that Mr. Jarrett has had ''the highest ratings in that morning show slot since 2003.'' Another outsider, Mike McConnell, a personality from Mr. Michaels's former station in Cincinnati, WLW-AM, is expected to join the station next month in an undetermined role.
 The most public change was that of Steve Cochran, the midday host who teed off on management after he was shown the door last month, another move that shocked listeners who were not accustomed to sudden dislocation at the station. 
 ''I was literally dismissed while I was walking out of the men's room,'' Mr. Cochran said. ''There was no explanation given.''
 Behind the scenes, other staff members have also departed over the past several months, including Wendi Power, the station's well-respected top advertising sales executive, who left to run a smaller radio station group in Tampa, Fla.
 Stacked against the station is history: Chicago tends to be unforgiving to newcomers. And with WGN pulling in the second- most radio revenue in the market behind WBBM, its moves are fraught with risk.
 ''It was always difficult to bring someone in from out of town,'' said Bob Sirott, a longtime Chicago broadcaster who recently rejoined WFLD-Channel 32 as its evening anchor and who still fills in at WGN. ''If you're new coming in, it's a little more difficult to be accepted.''
 Mr. Sirott said it often took years before radio and television personalities were embraced by Chicago audiences. ''Now with so many more channels and more fragmented audiences, it's next to impossible,'' he said. ''In today's media landscape, to try to establish someone is risky.''
 WGN executives had a shot at going after a well-known personality like Jonathon Brandmeier, the former WLUP-FM 97.9 personality, but passed. Richard Roeper, the Chicago Sun-Times columnist who is also a familiar local television and radio presence, was picked up by rival WLS-AM 890.
 Any time a station undergoes major changes, there is a risk that listeners will begin sampling other outlets and never return, executives say. Stations like WLS and WBEZ-FM 91.5, the public radio station, are probably beneficiaries of any sampling by WGN listeners. The ''Eric and Kathy'' morning show on WTMX-FM 101.9 could benefit from more female listeners from WGN, if they decide to look elsewhere.
 Ms. Hambrick, the advertising buyer, said WGN had put at risk a unique cachet in the market: its singular relationship with loyal listeners.
 The station ''sold on results for clients and being the absolute voice of Chicago,'' Ms. Hambrick said. ''It always had a special place with listeners and advertisers. Advertisers didn't feel they had a complete campaign unless they were on WGN.''

HEADLINE: The Class War We Need

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
The rich are different from you and me. They know how to game the system.
 That's one interpretation, at least, of last week's news that Americans with million-dollar mortgages are defaulting at almost twice the rate of the typical homeowner. It suggests an infuriating scenario in which the average American slaves away to keep Wells Fargo or Bank of America off his back, while fat cats and high fliers cut their losses and sail off to the next investment opportunity.
 That isn't exactly what's happening, most likely. Just because you have a million-dollar mortgage doesn't make you a millionaire, and a lot of the fat-cat defaulters probably aren't that fat anymore. Chances are they're more like Teresa and Joe Giudice from ''The Real Housewives of New Jersey,'' tacky reality-TV climbers who recently filed for bankruptcy after their decadent lifestyle turned out to be a debt-enabled fantasy. 
 Still, watching the Giudices sashay through their onyx-encrusted mansion, and knowing that thousands of similarly profligate homeowners are simply walking away from their debts, it's easy to succumb to a little class-warrior fantasizing. (Pitchforks, tar, feathers ... that sort of thing.)
 The trick is to channel those impulses in a constructive direction. The left-wing instinct, when faced with high-rolling irresponsibility, is usually to call for tax increases on the rich. But the problem, here and elsewhere, isn't exactly that we tax high rollers' incomes too lightly. It's that we subsidize their irresponsibility too heavily -- underwriting their bad bets and bailing out their follies. The class warfare we need is a conservative class warfare, which would force the million-dollar defaulters to pay their own way from here on out.
 Consider the spread that the Giudices currently occupy (pending potential foreclosure proceedings, of course). The first million of its reported $1.7 million price tag is presumably covered by the federal mortgage-interest tax deduction. Intended to boost middle-class homebuyers, this deduction has gradually turned into a huge tax break for the affluent, with most of the benefits flowing to homeowners with cash income over $100,000. In much of the country, it's a McMansion subsidy, whose costs to the federal Treasury are covered by the tax dollars of Americans who either rent or own more modest homes. 
 This policy is typical of the way the federal government does business. In case after case, Washington's web of subsidies and tax breaks effectively takes money from the middle class and hands it out to speculators and have-mores. We subsidize drug companies, oil companies, agribusinesses disguised as ''family farms'' and ''clean energy'' firms that aren't energy-efficient at all. We give tax breaks to immensely profitable corporations that don't need the money and boondoggles that wouldn't exist without government favoritism. 
 And we do more of it every day. Take Barack Obama's initiative to double U.S. exports in the next five years. As The Washington Examiner's Tim Carney points out, it involves the purest sort of corporate welfare: We're lending money to foreign governments or companies so that they'll buy from Boeing and Pfizer and Archer Daniels Midland. That's good news for those companies' stockholders and C.E.O.'s. But the money to pay for it ultimately comes out of middle-class pocketbooks.
 This isn't just a corporate welfare problem. The same pattern is at work in our entitlement system, which is lurching toward bankruptcy in part because of how much Medicare and Social Security pay to seniors who could get along without assistance. Instead of a safety net that protects the elderly from poverty, we have a system in which the American taxpayer is effectively underwriting cruises and tee times.
 All of this ought to be grist for a kind of ''small-government egalitarianism,'' in the economist Edward Glaeser's useful phrase, that seeks to shrink government by attacking Washington's wasteful spending on the well-connected. And sometimes conservative politicians make moves in this direction. President George W. Bush's Tax Reform Commission proposed sharply reducing the mortgage-interest deduction. House Minority Leader John Boehner, to his great credit, recently floated the possibility of means-testing Social Security. Many Republican senators have been staunch critics of corporate welfare. 
 In the age of Barack Obama, many rank-and-file conservatives have been more upset about redistribution of a different sort -- the kind that takes money from the prosperous and ''spreads the wealth'' (as Obama put it, in his famous confrontation with Joe the Plumber) down the income ladder.
 This kind of spending can be problematic. But conservatives need to recognize that the most pernicious sort of redistribution isn't from the successful to the poor. It's from savers to speculators, from outsiders to insiders, and from the industrious middle class to the reckless, unproductive rich.

HEADLINE: A Chosen Few Are Teaching For America

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
On Education, a new column by Michael Winerip, will appear Mondays. Mr. Winerip can be reached at oneducation@nytimes.com

 BODY:
 HOUSTON -- Alneada Biggers, Harvard class of 2010, was amazed this past year when she discovered that getting into the nation's top law schools and grad programs could be easier than being accepted for a starting teaching job with Teach for America. 
 Ms. Biggers says that of 15 to 20 Harvard friends who applied to Teach for America, only three or four got in. ''This wasn't last minute -- a lot applied in August 2009, they'd been student leaders and volunteered,'' Ms. Biggers said. She says one of her closest friends wanted to do Teach for America, but was rejected and had to ''settle'' for University of Virginia Law School.
 Will Cullen, Villanova '10, had a friend who was rejected and instead will be a Fulbright scholar. Julianne Carlson, a new graduate of Yale -- where a record 18 percent of seniors applied to Teach for America -- says she knows a half dozen ''amazing'' classmates who were rejected, although the number is probably higher. ''People are reluctant to tell you because of the stigma of not getting in,'' Ms. Carlson said. 
 When Robert Rosen graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2009, he did not apply, fearing he would be turned down. Instead, he volunteered in a friend's classroom weekly for the next year, to see if he liked teaching, but also to build a credential that would impress Teach for America. Asked how hard getting in is, James Goldberg, Duke '10 said, ''I'd compare it with being accepted to an Ivy League grad school.''
 Mr. Goldberg, Mr. Rosen, Ms. Carlson, Mr. Cullen and Ms. Biggers count themselves lucky to be among the 4,500 selected by the nonprofit to work at high-poverty public schools from a record 46,359 applicants (up 32 percent over 2009). There's little doubt the numbers are fueled by a bad economy, which has limited job options even for graduates from top campuses. In 2007, during the economic boom, 18,172 people applied.
 This year, on its 20th anniversary, Teach for America hired more seniors than any other employer at numerous colleges, including Yale, Dartmouth, Duke, Georgetown and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. At Harvard, 293 seniors, or 18 percent of the class, applied, compared with 100 seniors in 2007. ''So many job options in finance, P.R. and consulting have been cut back,'' said Ms. Carlson, the Yale grad.
 In interviews, two dozen soon-to-be-teachers here in Houston, one of eight national Teach for America centers that provide a five-week crash summer course in classroom practices, mentioned the chance to help poor children and close the achievement gap as major reasons for applying. Victor Alquicira (Yale), who is Mexican-born, and Kousha Navidar (Duke), who is Iranian-born, said it was a chance to give back to a country that had given them much.
 But there are other more material attractions. Teach for America has become an elite brand that will help build a resume, whether or not the person stays in teaching. And in a bad economy, it's a two-year job guarantee with a good paycheck; members earn a beginning teacher's salary in the districts where they're placed. For Mr. Cullen, who will teach at a Dallas middle school, that's $45,000 -- the same he'd make if he'd taken a job offer from a financial public relations firm. Ms. Carlson, who will also make $45,000 teaching first grade in San Antonio, said: ''I feel very fortunate. I knew a lot of people at Yale who didn't have a job or plan when they graduated.''
 In contrast, the Peace Corps (to which Teach for America compares itself) pays a cost-of-living allowance adjusted for each country where volunteers work, and a $7,500 stipend when the 27-month stint is finished.
 While Teach for America is highly regarded by undergrads -- Mr. Goldberg said Duke recruiting sessions typically attracted 50 students -- it gets mixed reviews from education experts. 
 Research indicates that generally, the more experienced teachers are, the better their students perform, and several studies have criticized Teach for America's turnover rate. 
 ''I'm always shocked by the hullaboo, given Teach for America's size'' -- about 0.2 percent of all teachers -- ''and its mixed impact,'' said Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas professor. Dr. Heilig and Su Jin Jez of California State University, Sacramento, recently published a critical assessment after reviewing two dozen studies. One study cited indicated that ''by the fourth year, 85 percent of T.F.A. teachers had left'' New York City schools.
 ''These people could be superstars, but most leave before they master the teaching craft,'' Dr. Heilig said.
 Carrie James, a Teach for America spokeswoman, challenged the report. Teach for America press releases cite a 2008 Harvard doctoral thesis indicating that 61 percent of their recruits stay beyond the two-year commitment. However, that same thesis also says ''few people are estimated to remain in their initial placement school or the profession beyond five or six years'' -- a finding not highlighted in the releases.
 Ms. James says the program has an impact beyond the classroom, with an alumni contact list of 13,000 still in education, including more than 500 in ''government or policy.'' Michelle Rhee, chancellor of the Washington, D.C., schools, and Michael Johnston, a Colorado state senator, are among the alums.
 Several of the new Teach for America members say it's too early to know whether they'll stick with teaching. Ms. Biggers, who was admitted to Harvard and Vanderbilt Law Schools, has deferred attending to teach elementary school in Houston for two years. She then plans to go to law school and, after finishing, says she hopes to do something in education.
 To be accepted by Teach for America, applicants survived a lengthy process, with thousands cut at each step. That included an online application; a phone interview; presentation of a lesson plan; a personal interview; a written test; and a monitored group discussion with several other applicants. Rachel Faust, a University of Maryland graduate who will teach in Miami, says she was struck by how aggressive some applicants were at the group session. ''They say you're not against each other, it's just a group discussion,'' Ms. Faust said. ''But some people don't treat it like that, they're very competitive.''
 A $185 million operating budget, (two-thirds from private donations, the rest from governmental sources) helps finance recruiters at 350 campuses to enlarge the applicant pool. ''I was recruited like crazy,'' said Mr. Alquicira, who was a Yale Daily News editor and tutor in New Haven. ''I'm not even sure how they got my name.''
 The 774 new recruits who are training here are housed in Rice University dorms. Many are up past midnight doing lesson plans and by 6:30 a.m. are on a bus to teach summer school to students making up failed classes. It's a tough lesson for those who've come to do battle with the achievement gap.
 Lilianna Nguyen, a recent Stanford graduate, dressed formally in high heels, was trying to teach a sixth-grade math class about negative numbers. She'd prepared definitions to be copied down, but the projector was broken.
 She'd also created a fun math game, giving every student an index card with a number. They were supposed to silently line themselves up from lowest negative to highest positive, but one boy kept disrupting the class, blurting out, twirling his pen, complaining he wanted to play a fun game, not a math game.
 ''Why is there talking?'' Ms. Nguyen said. ''There should be no talking.''
 ''Do I have to play?'' asked the boy.
 ''Do you want to pass summer school?'' Ms. Nguyen answered.
 The boy asked if it was O.K. to push people to get them in the right order.
 ''This is your third warning,'' Ms. Nguyen said. ''Do not speak out in my class.''

HEADLINE: Six Months Into Term, Christie Defies Expectations With Political Skills

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
FRANKLIN TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- A momentous deal to cap property taxes was all but done, but Gov. Chris Christie was taking no chances, barnstorming the state to commiserate with squeezed homeowners and keep pressure on the Legislature.
 Outside a farmhouse here in central New Jersey last week, buttoned up in a dark suit despite the triple-digit heat, Mr. Christie promised to tackle rising pension costs, transportation financing, municipal spending -- all while poking fun at his opponents, the news media and, mostly, himself.
 When a reporter suggested that the governor do a rain dance, he said, ''Don't want to miss that, baby.'' And in the rare instance of his withholding judgment on an issue, he said he preferred to know something about the issue before opining, although, he added, tongue in cheek, that actual knowledge was not necessarily a requirement.
 It was a model taste of Mr. Christie, six months into his term as governor: blunt, energetic, clearly enjoying himself. 
 And having his way.
 Mr. Christie has turned out to be a far more deft politician than his detractors -- and even some supporters -- had expected, making few compromises as he pursues a broad agenda for remaking New Jersey's free-spending political culture. So far, polls suggest, the public is giving him the benefit of the doubt.
 ''The most important thing in public life, in a job like governor, is for the people you're representing to know exactly where you stand,'' Mr. Christie said in an interview on Friday. ''People who disagree with me on things at least have a sense of comfort in knowing where I'm coming from.''
 In a mostly blue state where Democrats control the Legislature, Mr. Christie, a Republican, won election last year mostly because of the deep unpopularity of his opponent, Gov. Jon S. Corzine. Mr. Christie, a former federal prosecutor known for aggression rather than deal-making, took office to predictions that his hard-charging style would not work in the labyrinth of Trenton, where factions of party, region and interest group would slow him down.
 Instead, he confronted the powerful public employees' unions and won, cutting future pensions and benefits, and persuaded voters to defeat hundreds of local school budgets. He got nearly everything he wanted in the state budget, making the deepest cuts in generations. And the Assembly is expected this week to give final passage to one of his cherished goals: a cap on local property taxes. 
 The governor has repeatedly used his powers more confrontationally than his predecessors, wading into school budget fights, freezing the actions of semiautonomous public authorities and breaking with tradition by refusing to reappoint a State Supreme Court justice.
 ''I think we all underestimated his political skill coming in,'' said Brigid Harrison, a political science professor at Montclair State University. ''You can't deny that he's been a tour de force in Trenton. He has managed to control the legislative agenda more than other governors, despite having a Legislature controlled by the opposite party.''
 The governor has a direct, pithy speaking style -- the sharp rise in property taxes in the past decade, he said, ''is not a mystery; it's a mandate'' -- often leavened by humor. And he is relentless, willing to hammer any message repeatedly and take on any critic, and he rarely meanders or evades a question.
 When a reporter called him confrontational at news conference, Mr. Christie said, ''You must be the thinnest-skinned guy in America,'' adding that the reporter had never seen him when he was furious.
 The few public opinion polls conducted so far show that he has not had the sharp drop in approval that often accompanies serious budget cuts, though most of the pain from those cuts has not yet been felt. 
 ''He's a much better communicator than we realized, and people seem to be willing to go along with him for now,'' said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ''He uses clear language, he doesn't mince words, he's funny, and he says what he thinks.''
 Mr. Christie has become a favorite of conservatives across the country, and some talk of him as presidential material, though he insists, ''No way is it going to happen.''
 So far, circumstances have worked in Mr. Christie's favor. The State Senate has a new president, Stephen M. Sweeney, who is seen as less liberal than his predecessor, Richard J. Codey, and more inclined to work with the governor. The recession, rising taxes and New Jersey's perilous financial situation give persuasive power to the call to rein in government, and give Democrats who might disagree little room to maneuver.
 ''I think the tough times have dictated straight talk and forceful moves, and that fits him quite well,'' said George Norcross III, a Democratic power broker from Camden County.
 But lawmakers in both parties say the governor and his team -- a mix of old Trenton hands and people who worked for him in the United States attorney's office -- have been strategically smart as well as lucky. Mr. Christie chose top aides, led by Richard Bagger, his chief of staff and a former legislator, who have been able to smooth private negotiations when people are battling in public.
 From the start, the governor served notice that he saw the public employees' unions as a central part of the state's problems, and that he meant to take them on. His first day in office, he signed an executive order, later struck down in court, to limit their ability to finance campaigns. The first bills he signed limited spending on pensions and benefits. He relished months of verbal sparring with the teachers' union, and analysts say he got the upper hand.
 Mr. Christie said there was no plan to put the unions front and center, though some of his aides say privately that it was quite intentional.
 But on controlling local government spending and taxes, he acknowledged that ''yes, absolutely,'' there was a political strategy to doing things in a particular order. The governor's budget reduced school aid, leading to predictions that districts would raise property taxes. He blamed the teachers' union for any increases and proposed capping property tax increases. Now he is using that cap as leverage for a package of bills, which has met union opposition, to help towns and school districts control spending.
 The governor even pointed to areas where he might, uncharacteristically, tread lightly rather than face fierce resistance, like banning the holding of two or more government jobs simultaneously, a common practice among legislators.
 It remains to be seen how well Mr. Christie will wear on New Jersey voters. Over the next year, people will begin to see the effects of his policies in their schools and towns, in his cut in funds for family planning or, for government workers, in their paychecks. The need to focus on fiscal issues has obscured some other areas where his positions are less popular, like his opposition to abortion.
 It is also unclear how he would govern in boom times, when austerity is a harder sell. The governor said he would have preferred not to make some of his budget cuts, but suggested that in any climate he would have pushed for less government.
 He said, ''It's more philosophical than a matter of necessity.''

HEADLINE: An 1800s Party Planner Who Did Funerals, Too

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
You could certainly make the argument that New York's upper classes hardly want these days for personal attention, surrounded as they are by helicopter pilots who fly them to the Hamptons and private stylists who make haircut house calls. But even with today's apparently recession-proof forms of conspicuous consumption, it would be hard to find a servant with the all-encompassing talents - the cradle-to-grave service - of Isaac H. Brown.
 Mr. Brown, who died 130 years ago, was the longtime sexton at Grace Episcopal Church in Greenwich Village, an official title that belied his real role as the amanuensis to, and the arbiter of fashion in, Knickerbocker society. Working at the church from 1845 until his death in 1880, he was a handyman to the smart set: planning their weddings, arranging their soirees and seeing to their funerals when they died. 
 ''Brown's efficiency and authoritative manner lent plausibility when he offered to greet guests at the front of a home for a distracted hostess, and make sure the carriages were ready when the guests departed,'' Eric Homburg wrote in ''Mrs. Astor's New York: Money and Social Power in a Gilded Age'' (Yale University Press, 2004). ''Brown knew just the right merchants from whom tables, chairs and the appropriate linen could be rented. He also ran a carriage-hire business, and those in society knew there was no reason to wait for the return of their own when one of Brown's fleet was at hand.''
 Weighing in at a prodigious 339 pounds, Isaac Brown was himself from the lower classes and worked as a carpenter until the Rev. Dr. Thomas H. Taylor appointed him sexton. In that role, he was responsible for keeping up the church: for lighting furnaces, sweeping aisles clean and collecting rents from pew-holders. At the same time, Mr. Homburg writes, ''he cultivated the cooks, domestic servants and butlers of the wealthy, and learned what services were needed by the residents of Washington Square, Bond Street and Fifth Avenue.''
 Mr. Brown's specialty, of course, was planning parties; these he oversaw with a despotic manner and a contemptuous disdain for parvenus. According to his obituary in The New York Times (see below), ''his office was besieged by fashionably dressed women'' who all but begged him to manage what were known at the time as their ''crushes.'' 
 ''To meet the emergency,'' the paper wrote, ''the popular sexton effected the organization of a corps of handsome young fellows, clerks in wholesale houses - sometimes styled 'Brown's Brigade' and sometimes 'Brown's Five Hundred.' They were bound to dress fashionably. Good dancing was a necessity, and there were certain rules that had to be observed.'' (For one thing, no lifting of the hat next morning to a pretty lady the handsome young buck had flirted with the night before.)
 Given his position, wealth and power, Isaac Brown - who was known as Brown, not Mr. Brown or Sexton Brown - cut an outsize figure in 19th-century New York, enough so that anecdotes about him have entered the city's lore. There was, for instance, the night he carried Baron Rothschild on his back, across a muddy street, from one engagement to another. Later, at a ball in honor of the Prince of Wales at the Academy of Music, he commandingly took charge when a section of the dance floor collapsed.
 Like others who have risen from obscurity, he was a snob. ''The sexton's supreme accolade was the description of a social occasion as 'thoroughbred' '' - or unmixed with social climbers, Mr. Homburg writes. He was his society's Decider, ruling who was in and, of course, who was out. He endlessly complained about the sad decline in manners; no one dared breach etiquette around him. There was frequent gossip that well-timed bribes could win the sexton's favor, but nobody could ever prove a thing.
 At Mr. Brown's funeral - on Aug. 26, 1880 - eight Knights Templar bore aloft a coffin made of polished Spanish cedar that was, as The Times reported, ''large enough for two ordinary men.'' Mr. Brown was as splendidly turned out in death as he always was in life: his body was attired in ''a fashionably-cut full-dress suit of broadcloth, stand-up collar and white necktie.''
 The crowd, however, was somewhat less elegant. It was mostly composed of ''tradespeople, servants and persons from the humbler walks of life.'' There were neighbors from his old block on East 21st Street, and many curious strangers. What there were not, however, were socialites.
 ''Most of the wealthier members of the congregation, whose marriages and feasts Mr. Brown had superintended for 30 years,'' The Times reported, ''were away at Newport,'' and did not come back to attend.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: High Fashion Relents to Web's Pull

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
The Web site for Marc Jacobs, the flamboyant fashion designer with an estimated $5 billion brand, has many things: stylish videos of employees describing their jobs, footage from elite fashion shows and parties, and even a photo of the company's president staring down a camel in Egypt.
 One thing it does not have: clothes for sale. 
 In the genteel world of luxury, companies long felt that the Web was no place for merchandising exclusive products. And there was a gentlemen's agreement with department stores not to siphon sales by reaching out directly to wealthy customers.
 Then, in came the recession, and out went the niceties. Department stores slashed prices on $1,200 handbags, while luxury lines fretted about losing their exclusivity. Now, come September, marcjacobs.com is going retail, 10 years after most brands opened Web showrooms. 
 ''I was so annoyed last year that I wished no one had our merchandise,'' said Robert Duffy, the president and vice chairman of Marc Jacobs. ''All the department stores were panicked, and they were marking things down.''
 Other luxury brands -- Jimmy Choo, Hugo Boss, Vince, Lancome, St. John, Theory, Kiehl's, Lilly Pulitzer, Donna Karan and La Perla -- have started or soon will start selling their products through their Web sites. If it infuriates department stores or brings in customers who might have earned a glare from haughty clerks, who cares, as long as people are buying at full price?
 ''These brands are finally taking the plunge to establish an online retail presence,'' said Jeffrey Max, chief executive of Venda, which handles technology for e-commerce sites. ''The recession forced these manufacturers to realize they needed to look for revenue wherever they could.''
 Adding to the Web's appeal, profits are much higher on clothes sold directly to consumers, since no middleman takes a cut. And the brands can control pricing and styling on their sites.
 Hugo Boss uses the same models from its ads so its marketing is consistent, for instance, while Lacoste ''won't have any discount pricing on the Web, never, never, ever,'' said Eric Bascle, director of strategic projects and e-commerce.
 When companies started to sell items online in the 1990s, most luxury brands paid little attention. By the mid-2000s, a few high-end companies were selling their products directly, but most still didn't bother. 
 ''The classic luxury brand Web site is basically a Flash site with lots of beautiful imagery, but no one ever goes to it,'' said Aaron Shapiro, a partner at the Web design firm Huge.
 Brands whose boutiques have fresh flowers and fawning salespeople could not translate that to the Web.
 ''Luxury brands were a little hesitant or reticent, because they were struggling with how to convey and create an experience that was rich,'' said Mark Brashear, chairman and chief executive for the Americas at Hugo Boss, which introduced its e-commerce site in April. 
 But by the time the luxury market slid last year, attitudes were changing. 
 Technology was improving, so sites could add features like zoom, videos and live help. And with budgets for store openings frozen, a Web store was a relatively cheap way to expand a business. 
 ''An elegant, sophisticated online store with a high level of data security can be had for a few hundred thousand dollars now -- that's probably less than the legal fees to review a lease for a store on Fifth Avenue,'' Mr. Max said.
 And in 2009, as the worldwide luxury-goods industry fell 8 percent, to under $230 billion, luxury sales online were forecast to grow 20 percent, according to Bain & Company. Suddenly, the brands that had sniffed at e-commerce looked rather foolish.
 ''Early adopters are basically in a position now where they're even more ahead of the game and are doing some pretty significant business online,'' said Jem Ripley, vice president at the marketing firm SapientNitro, which is designing sites for Hugo Boss and Kiehl's. ''You've got the late adopters coming forward now and seeing that they need to represent themselves.''
 Of course, shopping on the Web doesn't quite mimic the feeling of browsing at a store. 
 For instance, while clerks at the lingerie store La Perla will measure a woman's bust to find the right bra size, on the Web, visitors are given a size chart and toll-free number. But other companies add functionality to their sites: at sjk.com, St. John allows customers to shop from ad-campaign photographs, and a social networking section lets shoppers send messages to designers.
 The difficulty of making a flat screen feel luxurious is one reason some brands refrained from selling products online, but for the final holdouts, battles with department stores pushed them over the edge.
 Department stores ordered too much inventory for 2009 and were left with piles of unsold clothes when consumer spending declined. The stores slashed prices -- meaning less revenue for the clothing makers, along with a potential image problem when a $500 shirt sold for $200. 
 And last week there was more bad news from luxury retailers, as new data for June showed that luxury department stores, like Neiman Marcus and Saks, fared worse than department stores in general compared with a year earlier.
 Unlike the snooty boutiques of Madison Avenue or Rodeo Drive, the sites will welcome anyone. ''I don't think they're trying to exclude anybody,'' Mr. Ripley said. 
 The department stores are responding by reinforcing their loyalty programs, offering discounts and doing aggressive e-mail marketing to customers. 
 But the brands are biting back by, for example, selling a wider range of colors or styles than one retailer would carry, or selling special products only online. 
 ''I want to give people a reason to go there -- if I have the same stuff on our Web site that's at Neiman's and Saks,'' the site would have little appeal, Mr. Duffy of Marc Jacobs said. 
 Asked if he was worried that retailers might be upset, Mr. Duffy said he was unconcerned. ''How can they? That's ridiculous,'' he said of retailers who sell his line. ''I'm the one that should get huffy that they have it on their Web site.''

 Luxury brands were slow to embrace the Web, but the recession has changed their thinking. (B7)

HEADLINE: Transit Service Cuts Also Reach Museum

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR; Compiled by RACHEL LEE HARRIS

 BODY:
The New York Transit Museum laid off two full-time and two part-time employees last week as part of required payroll reductions across the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its agencies, which are facing a financial crisis, said Aaron Donovan, an authority spokesman. The museum is financed by donations and revenue from admissions and sales in its stores, but its staff members are officially employed by the authority. At the museum the full-time staff has been reduced to 18 from 21 through the layoffs and one vacancy going unfilled. Mr. Donovan said that operations and hours would not be affected. The museum had 566,169 visitors last year at its location in Brooklyn and at Grand Central Terminal.

HEADLINE: SCORE ONE FOR STYLE AND FOR SPAIN

BYLINE: By JERE LONGMAN

 BODY:
JOHANNESBURG -- Regulation had spilled into overtime of this fractious game Sunday. The clock was nearly exhausted, as were the players. Soon, the World Cup final would be decided by its harshest verdict, penalty kicks, and skill would give way to nerve and caprice.
 A record 14 yellow cards and a red would be issued by the English referee Howard Webb. A potentially beautiful game between two elegant teams had turned nasty and destructive.
 Finally, Spain prevailed, 1-0, over the Netherlands with great patience and an accustomed sense of drama in the 116th minute by the goal-scoring wing Andres Iniesta, taking its first World Cup title, even if this one will be remembered more for meanness than splendor.
 The Dutch intended to take Spain away from its graceful passing game. And they frequently did, sometimes with brutal intent. Still, Spain showed hardness of its own, becoming unnerved at times but never discouraged. 
 Finally, it prevailed for a fourth consecutive 1-0 victory, displaying resolve, endurance and a flair for white-knuckled theatrics while completing a remarkable turnaround. Spain, the 2008 European champion, became the first team to win a World Cup after losing its opening match, which La Furia Roja had done in stunning fashion to Switzerland.
 ''I can't quite believe it yet,'' the diminutive Iniesta said. ''It is something absolutely incredible. I simply made a small contribution to a match that was very tough, very rough.''
 Essentially, two World Cups ended Sunday, one with Spain winning on the field, the other with South Africa prevailing by most accounts on a referendum about whether it was ready to stage the world's most popular sporting event.
 For years, rumors persisted that FIFA, soccer's world governing body, would move the World Cup, concerned that South Africa was not equipped to handle matters of security and logistics 16 years after the dismantling of apartheid.
 But those concerns proved largely unfounded. The stadiums were built, nearly full and free of violence. Outside, crime did not become a major headline-grabbing factor.
 ''Organizationally, it has been a great success,'' said Sunil Gulati, the president of the United States Soccer Federation and an economist at Columbia University. ''All the concerns people had about Africa were dispelled.''
 Jacob Zuma, South Africa's president, said on Saturday, ''The world has seen this country in a different light.''
 Danny Jordaan, the chief World Cup organizer, said that the tournament had brought pride, unity, self-assurance and the sharing of a vision to South Africa, adding, ''The nation has crossed a huge psychological barrier.''
 Yet it remains unclear just how thoroughly South Africa was able to project itself internationally as a modern, technologically advanced, democratic and tourist-welcoming nation, said Peter Alegi, a visiting Fulbright scholar at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in Durban and an associate professor of history at Michigan State University.
 In some places, anecdotal evidence indicated that the country was portrayed as just another soccer host or in the stereotypical African safari image, he said.
 ''South Africa saw this as very much a political project, even more so than an economic one,'' Alegi said. ''The verdict is still out on whether brand South Africa sold around the world.''
 Even as the World Cup ended, debate continued about whether it was worth spending about $5.4 billion to put on a soccer tournament when some of the stadiums were likely to become white elephants and there was hardly any system in place for youth development in sports.
 ''It was a waste of money,'' said Marcus Solomon, who spent 10 years as a political prisoner on Robben Island during apartheid and who later founded a youth center in Cape Town.
 A kind of hangover is expected in South Africa on Monday now that the World Cup is over. And an urgent question is already being raised: what happens next in a country where millions do not have adequate housing, electricity or running water, and half of the population lives at or below the poverty line?
 Some fear a return of the xenophobia that led to violent attacks on foreigners two years ago. The plight of the poor must be addressed, The Times of Johannesburg wrote in an editorial Sunday, saying, ''Freedom will forever remain elusive as long as they continue to witness the rich getting richer while their situation is rapidly deteriorating.''
 Sunday night began rousingly as Nelson Mandela, the former South African president who will be 92 in a week and whose moral authority was responsible for the World Cup's coming here, made a brief appearance before the start of the match. A throbbing vuvuzela serenade greeted him as he circled the Soccer City field on a golf cart. 
 Mandela was said to prefer to watch the game at home. If so, what he saw was ill tempered, drained of its expected attractiveness.
 The Dutch midfielders Nigel de Jong and Mark van Bommel often strangled Spain's stylish passing attack by whatever force was necessary. In the 28th minute, de Jong kicked the Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso in the chest and was lucky not to be ejected.
 ''It was still our intention to play beautiful football, but we were also facing a very good opponent,'' said Bert van Marwijk, the Netherlands coach. ''Spain is the best football country the past few years. I think both sides committed fouls. It may be regrettable this happened in a final. That's not our style. But you do play to win.''
 The Dutch had their chances to prevail in regulation, but Iker Casillas, the Spanish goalkeeper, repelled two inviting shots from forward Arjen Robben, one on a kick save, the other by rushing off his line to smother the ball. Finally, the rough fouling took its toll on the Netherlands.
 In the 109th minute, central defender John Heitinga took Iniesta down and drew his second yellow card, leaving the Netherlands a man short for the final 11-plus minutes.
 In the 116th minute, Fernando Torres sent a cross to the top of the penalty area for Spain. The Dutch midfielder Rafael van der Vaart failed to clear the ball. It fell to Cesc Fabregas, who found his teammate Iniesta seven yards from the goal. Iniesta had scored a famous late goal for Barcelona against Chelsea in the 2009 European Champions League semifinals. Now he had another chance for a last-minute rescue.
 ''It just had to go in,'' Iniesta said of his shot, and it did, glancing off the right hand of goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg and into the net.
 Iniesta took off his jersey, revealing a T-shirt that contained words of remembrance for Daniel Jarque, a friend and Spanish soccer player who died of a heart attack last year. This brought an automatic yellow card for Iniesta, but he did not seem to care as he blew kisses and was mobbed by his teammates.
 When the final whistle sounded, the Netherlands had lost for a third time in the World Cup final, and Spain had dispelled its reputation as a team whose achievement rarely matched its talent. Iniesta went to his knees and pumped his fists and toppled over, as tired as he was ecstatic.
 ''I think Spain deserved to win this World Cup,'' he said. ''This is something we have to feel very proud of.''

HEADLINE: Madison Avenue's World of Tomorrow

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WITH technology changing faster than Lady Gaga's concert costumes, it is increasingly difficult for Madison Avenue to keep up with the gizmos on which consumers look at -- or avoid -- commercials, banners, Web video and other forms of advertising. Now, a media agency and a magazine are teaming up to help narrow that knowledge gap.
 The agency is the Media Kitchen in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal & Partners division of MDC Partners. The magazine is Popular Science, owned by the Bonnier Corporation unit of the Bonnier Group of Sweden. 
 Together, they have opened a display they are calling the Test Kitchen, which seeks to give employees of the Media Kitchen and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal some hands-on experience with more than a dozen new technologies, among them the iPad from Apple, 3-D television and smartphones like the Droid from Motorola.
 The Test Kitchen is housed in a 350-square-foot former conference room in the offices of the Media Kitchen and Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal at 160 Varick Street in Lower Manhattan. It is to be open to employees of both agencies as well as clients and potential clients; access to employees of other MDC agencies is being considered.
 Plans call for products in the Test Kitchen to be changed about four times a year. Any casualties of obsolescence -- a quickly doomed device like, say, the Kin phone from Microsoft, which was discontinued 48 days after it went on sale -- would be culled sooner.
 The exhibit has been designed to resemble a comfortable living room, albeit one crammed with gadgetry and dominated by a 46-inch 3-D LED-LCD HDTV set. In other words, not unlike the living room of a 20-something or 30-something urbanite who is an early adopter of leading-edge technology. 
 ''We're hearing from clients that the cost of waiting has gone up,'' said Lori Senecal, president and chief executive at Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal. ''Today, ideas are truly great only if they're conceived and deployed fast enough to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.''
 It is an approach that Ms. Senecal likes to call ''speed to genius,'' even if, as she acknowledged, haste may sometimes make waste.
 ''It's important to jump in and experiment,'' she said. ''It's worth having a few misses in order to have a few big hits.''
 Other agencies are also looking for methods to stay abreast of continuously changing technologies. Last week, GMR Marketing, an event-marketing agency that is part of the Radiate Group unit of the Omnicom Group, hosted what it called the Event Tech Petting Zoo at its office in New Berlin, Wis. The event featured more than 35 exhibits like holograms and gesture-based projection screens.
 The Test Kitchen is based on an exhibit sponsored by Popular Science named the Emerging Media Lab, which the magazine's advertising sales staff brings for a day to the offices of agencies in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and New York.
 After the lab made a couple of visits to the Media Kitchen, Barry Lowenthal, president of the agency, asked Popular Science if a version could be brought there to stay awhile. It took four weeks to assemble and stock the Test Kitchen, Mr. Lowenthal said, adding: ''When we started, some of the mobile gadgets were so 'bleeding-edge.' But now, you can go to Verizon and get them.''
 Among the mobile devices, in addition to the Droid, are the Nexus One from Google, the HTC HD2 from Microsoft and the iPhone from Apple. (The Kin, fortunately, had never been considered for the display.) 
 Other devices in the initial collection include a touch-screen notebook computer, the Asus Eee PC Touch; the MinoHD camcorder from the Flip Video unit of Cisco; a Wi-Fi-enabled Samsung 3-D Blu-ray disc player; the Sony Dash, a mash-up of an alarm clock, Web viewer and Internet radio; and Eye-Fi cards for digital cameras, which can upload photographs to the Internet automatically.
 ''We really do feel an obligation to stay on the front edge, the cutting edge, of technology,'' said Gregg R. Hano, vice president for publishing at the Bonnier technology group, who also oversees magazines like Science Illustrated.
 ''The Popular Science mission for its reader is to deliver the future now,'' he added, ''and the agencies are trying to bring the future forward for their clients.'' In that vein, Popular Science has introduced an application for the iPad, joining magazines like GQ, Popular Mechanics, Sports Illustrated and Wired.
 Popular Science and the agencies are budgeting $50,000 to $60,000 a year for products for the Test Kitchen. But just as the technologies change rapidly, so, too, do the prices. ''We thought the TV would be $10,000,'' Mr. Hano said, referring to the 3-D Samsung, ''and it was $3,400.'' And the project got a break, Mr. Lowenthal said with a laugh, because ''we didn't charge for the wallpaper and the pillows'' that are decorating the space.
 Others involved with the Test Kitchen include Sean Galligan, associate director at the Media Kitchen; Matt Powell, executive director for creative technology at Kirshenbaum Bond Senecal; and Jacob Ward, deputy editor at Popular Science, who is narrating a three-minute video that will be played for visitors.
 A recent visitor to the Test Kitchen marveled at some of the products on display, wondered what possible use others could have and was treated to a reminder of why the exhibit's name includes the word ''test'': a Samsung SyncMaster computer monitor kept displaying an ad for Norton antivirus software. ''It pops up three or four times a day,'' Mr. Galligan said ruefully.

HEADLINE: End of Census, And for Many, End of a Job

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- It was a finely honed machine, this United States Census team, and it had a good run. But in the coming days and weeks, many of its members will experience the pain of unemployment -- once again.
 Christine Egan, a 31-year-old massage therapist, says her census job offered shelter from the economic storm last year. ''The economy was terrible; there was nothing,'' she says. ''I've already gone through 'horrific,' so I'm immunized.'' She smiles, optimism almost extending to her eyes. ''It must be better now, right?''
 When the Census Bureau hired upward of 700,000 Americans over the last two years -- most in the last six months -- it landed more experienced workers with more sophisticated skills than any time in recent memory. This was the unintended upside of the nastiest recession of the last 70 years. 
 Now, its decennial work largely done, the Census Bureau is shedding hundreds of thousands of workers -- about 225,000 in just the last few weeks, enough to account for a jot or two in the unemployment rate, say federal economists. Most of those remaining will be gone by August; a few will last into September. 
 In past decades, the bureau faced a challenge just keeping workers around to close up shop, as most dashed for new jobs that might pay better. Not this time around. Jobs remain scarce. In Rhode Island, the unemployment rate stands at 12.3 percent, higher than a year ago. The national rate, too, has not budged.
 As most census workers have nowhere to go, rushed farewells are rare. Self-reflection, and a touch of anxiety, mark the mood.
 ''Typically, at this point in the process, we're losing a lot of people because they're taking jobs,'' said Kathleen Ludgate, the regional director in Boston. ''I wish we had that problem now.''
 Ms. Ludgate receives notes from departing workers, some by e-mail, others in ink. They thank her for the chance to learn something about themselves and their country. They write to say their confidence had picked up, that they can again meet the gaze of friends and neighbors. 
 These are the missives of hard-working people who found themselves in a tighter spot than they ever expected, and who came to view census work as a lifeline.
 Many are middle-aged. The census offices in Providence and Bridgeport, Conn., offer a sea of gray-haired men and women in neat office garb. They work with an intensity that suggests they would rather concentrate on the task at hand than the fast-approaching end.
 Sherri Wood worked for the schools in Bridgeport before taking a chance a few years back and leaving to try something new. The recession broke like a thunder cloud, and she took a job nearly two years ago in community affairs for the census.
 The money was not great. She began mowing her own lawn and making her lunches, but it wasn't all bad. 
 ''I learned so much, I really loved it,'' said Ms. Wood, 45, who will leave in the next few weeks. ''Things will work. I pray for that.''
 Bureaucratic quirks make life in this recession a nerve-racking ride. Many departing census workers will be eligible for unemployment, although by no means all of them. 
 Some census employees, particularly those who knocked on doors -- known as enumerators -- worked in fits and starts. They were dispatched intensively, then laid off, then rehired. Unemployment rules are a crazy quilt, with no two states quite the same. 
 ''If a worker was in the last tier of long-term unemployment, they might not be able to go back to unemployment,'' said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. ''They may have been better off not taking this job.''
 Perhaps so. But in the Providence office, workers speak of a certain joy that comes with applying their minds. 
 What is left of the Providence team works out of a ground-floor office that overlooks a cemetery, and on a recent morning, workers checked tallies and researched vacant buildings. Bob Hamilton, the director, introduced his staff.
 Ms. Egan, the massage therapist, with a degree in history from the University of Rhode Island, was his assistant field manager. Vada Seccareccia, an architect with an undergraduate degree from Bryn Mawr College, is his payroll manager. And the soft-spoken young mother who oversees the clerks? Yasmin Mercedes has years of retail experience and, if she can't find work, plans to go to college this fall.
 ''You look for people who had certain skills in a previous life,'' Mr. Hamilton says. ''It's not hard to find them, not with this god-awful economy.''
 Angular, with close-cropped gray hair and a voice laden with hard New England vowels, Mr. Hamilton, too, is a temporary worker with a backstory. He was vice president for a retailer until he took some time off in 2007, his mortgage paid and bank account strong. Then the economy tanked, as did his retirement fund. He tried to return only to find that when it came to finding a job, the rug had been pulled out from under him. 
 ''I was reluctant to do this at first,'' he says. ''I finally said to myself: This isn't going any better. I better take the next step.''
 That pattern repeats across the country. In south Connecticut, a laid-off executive for a large insurer helps coordinate the door-to-door counters. In Orange County, Calif., unemployed real estate lawyers work as counters, and the office is managed by a down-on-her-luck corporate trainer. 
 In the census office in Worcester, Mass., the guy who took the tech services job acknowledged quietly that he had a degree in nuclear engineering from M.I.T.
 Wages vary by regional cost of living and responsibilities. A census worker might get $17 an hour in Providence, $23 in Boston or $12.25 in Jackson, Miss. 
 Mr. Hamilton has only to look at his Red Sox calendar to see the days ticking down. He would like to find a job back in retail management. He has a sneaking suspicion that his age -- he's 59 -- works against him. ''That's my goal,'' he says. ''Whether I get there or not is something else.'' 
 Every member of his team sounds reshaped, by the experience and by the recessionary storm howling outside. 
 Ms. Egan smiles and says she knows she can survive. When she was jobless and counted quarters to pay for groceries, she took a job as a boat deckhand and a bartender. She does not want to go back to giving massages full time, though; she found she is a natural at motivating people.
 So she has polished her resume. ''We all understand, if you have another opportunity, take it,'' she says, more cheerfully than you might expect. ''We're on a sinking ship.'' 
 Mr. Hamilton walks a visitor to the door. He turns and looks at his domain, and says, more to himself: ''You could start a hell of a business with these folks.''

HEADLINE: A Humane Egg

 BODY:
The life of animals raised in confinement on industrial farms is slowly improving, thanks to pressure from consumers, animal rights advocates, farmers and legislators. In late June, a compromise was reached in Ohio that will gradually put an end to the tiny pens used for raising veal calves and holding pregnant sows, spaces so small the animals can barely move. 
 In California last week, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed a law requiring that all whole eggs sold in the state conform to the provisions of Proposition 2, the humane farming law that was embraced by state voters in a landslide in 2008. By 2015, every whole egg sold in the state must come from a hen that is able to stretch her wings, standing or lying, without touching another bird or the edges of her cage. This requirement would at least relieve the worst of the production horrors that are common in the industry now. 
 Since California does not produce all the eggs it eats, this new law will have a wider effect on the industry; every producer who hopes to sell eggs in the state must meet its regulations. 
 Heartening as these developments are, there is also strong resistance from the food industry and from fake consumer-advocacy groups that are shilling for it. 
 In fact, there is no justification, economic or otherwise, for the abusive practice of confining animals in spaces barely larger than the volume of their bodies. Animals with more space are healthier, and they are no less productive.
 Industrial confinement is cruel and senseless and will turn out to be, we hope, a relatively short-lived anomaly in modern farming.

HEADLINE: Big Oil's Good Deal

 BODY:
No industry enjoys the array of tax breaks and subsidies that the oil and gas industry does. No industry needs them less. For all the damage it has caused, the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico may provide the political momentum to end this special treatment.
 President Obama's 2011 budget, proposed before the spill, would eliminate $4 billion in annual tax breaks for oil and gas companies. Bills in both houses introduced after the spill would achieve many of the same results. Industry has spent $340 million on lobbying over the last two years to block these sorts of initiatives, and until recently Congress has been eager to do its bidding. This year could be different. 
 The White House has proposed eliminating nine tax breaks. Some are modest, all are complicated, but in toto they provide a range of cushy benefits -- fast write-offs for upfront drilling expenses, generous depletion allowances, and the like -- that are available at virtually every stage of the exploration and production process. 
 The net result, as The Times reported recently, is an effective tax rate on investment far lower than that paid by other industries. That, the Treasury Department argues, has encouraged overinvestment in oil and gas drilling at the expense of other parts of the economy. 
 Industry argues that these and other breaks are vital to robust domestic production and that both investment and employment would fall if they were eliminated. These arguments, which may have made sense years ago, are much less compelling when oil prices are hovering near $80 a barrel and oil companies -- including BP -- have been racking up huge profits. 
 Moreover, a Treasury Department analysis says that ending these breaks would reduce domestic production by less than 1 percent. A separate study by Congress's Joint Economic Committee says that ending the biggest of the deductions -- 9 percent of qualified income from gas and oil produced in the United States -- would have zero effect on consumer prices. 
 Apart from these benefits, two other areas cry out for reform. One is the royalty relief program, enacted by Congress in 1995 to encourage the kind of deepwater drilling that has now landed the gulf, its wildlife and its neighboring citizens in so much trouble. Royalty rates are currently 12.5 percent of the per-barrel price for onshore leases, and up to 18.75 percent offshore. 
 The law suspended royalties as long as oil remained below a threshold price of $28 a barrel. Prices have long since exceeded that threshold, even adjusted for inflation; and because the law was not tightly written, companies have been able to exploit its ambiguities to save themselves billions of dollars.
 Sima Gandhi, a tax expert at the Center for American Progress, a liberal advocacy group, estimates that the losses from lost royalties could eventually exceed $80 billion unless Congress fixes the law. It is high time to review the entire royalty relief program, which at current prices is surely outdated and may be unnecessary. 
 The administration also needs to look carefully at the oil industry's use of tax havens abroad. The Senate Finance Committee has already announced that it will examine whether Transocean, the operator of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, exploited tax laws when it moved its headquarters first to the Cayman Islands, then to Switzerland. Other oil companies also have foreign subsidiaries; the question is whether and to what extent they use them to dodge taxes. The Times article reported that Transocean alone had saved $1.8 billion in taxes since moving overseas in 1999.
 Instead of enriching the oil companies, Congress should end these unjustifiable breaks and focus on encouraging alternative fuel sources that create cleaner energy and new clean-energy jobs.

HEADLINE: Investors Expect Good Profits and Seek Clues to Future

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Many Americans are still waiting for an economic recovery. But for corporate America, a recovery of sorts is already at hand.
 The corporate earnings season, that quarterly rite of Wall Street, begins in earnest on Monday, and investors are hoping for some good news. Major corporations are expected to report some of their strongest profits in years.
 ''It has been one of the strongest profits recoveries ever,'' said David S. Bianco, chief United States equity strategist for Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. ''You have got to go back to the Depression to find a profits recovery that outpaces this one.'' 
 The question on many economists' minds is whether this corporate recovery will last -- and if it does, when it will yield jobs for recession-weary Americans. 
 This week, corporate bellwethers like Alcoa, Google, JPMorgan Chase and Intel are scheduled to report second-quarter results. While earnings will vary by company and industry, economists say that, taken together, the reports will point to some bright spots for the economy, as well as to some enduring obstacles.
 Since profits plunged in late 2008, along with the economy, earnings have been increasing fairly steadily for many companies, partly because they have been coming off such a low base. 
 For the second quarter, earnings per share for companies whose stocks are included in the Standard and Poor's 500-stock index are expected to have expanded 25 to 30 percent from the same period a year earlier. If the results beat analysts' expectations, they could add fuel to the nascent rally in the stock market, bolster the pace of the economic recovery and possibly hint at what many Americans hope for the most: a return to hiring. 
 But analysts say they also believe that now, perhaps more than at any other time since 2008, the numbers will be only part of the story. Many investors will comb the results for clues about where corporate executives think their businesses, and by extension, the broader economy, will go from here.
 How will companies weather the expiration of the federal stimulus program and tax cuts? How will they deal with the running financial crisis in Europe? What about exports and the looming midterm elections? 
 For now, the view from the corner office looks quite different than the view from the street corner. 
 ''You are going to hear outlooks from companies that are more upbeat than the sentiments you are going to get from workers and households,'' Mr. Bianco said. 
 So far, the rebound in corporate profits has not translated into a rebound in jobs. Many companies have cut costs and increased productivity. Manufacturers have mothballed plants and equipment. Consumers remain anxious. 
 With earnings reports looming, the stock market rose for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, rounding out its strongest week this year. 
 Economists said many investors would examine the business outlooks that companies provide even more than those companies' income statements. The question is whether companies expect to expand and hire, or instead seem to be bracing for a double-dip recession.
 ''Investors look through the front window more than the rearview windows,'' said David A. Rosenberg, the chief economist for Gluskin Sheff.
 So how companies couch their latest results will be crucial. 
 ''There is no magic bullet that is going to come out of the earnings period,'' said Tobias Levkovich, the chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup. Guidance from reporting companies about the economy ''resolves very, very near-term fears, but it does not take that three-, six-month fear off the table,'' he said.
 Mr. Bianco said several industries would be ''bright spots'' this earnings season. Many technology companies, for instance, are expanding in Asia. Capital goods businesses are positioned for growth.
 In the financial industry, the wild card will be credit costs and loan-loss provisions, said William T. Fitzpatrick, an equities analyst who focuses on banks for Optique Capital Management. 
 Wall Street trading and capital markets businesses, which have driven the stunning recovery in bank earnings thus far, probably suffered in the second quarter given the volatility in the markets. Investment management was probably hurt, too. 
 ''Everything is always in the context of expectations,'' said Joshua Steiner, a managing director at Hedgeye Risk Management. ''The expectations for the second quarter are fairly low on that portion of the business,'' he said, ''setting the stage for possible upside surprises.''
 Earnings at energy companies were probably aided by higher oil prices, said Brian M. Youngberg, an analyst with Edward Jones. ''You will see strong earnings growth driven by higher oil and natural gas prices.'' In this industry, guidance will be crucial in determining the expected impact of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on future earnings, he said.
 Earnings in consumer discretionary companies are expected to rise 50 percent and those in the consumer staples industry 5 percent, Mr. Rosenberg said. 
 In manufacturing, companies are benefiting from rebuilding their inventories. Capital spending is contributing to growth but remains weak. 
 ''What they are not doing is making capital investments in their own businesses,'' Cliff Waldman, an economist for Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, said of companies in the industry. ''But they were ahead of a lot of other sectors in costs cutting.'' 
 That means revenue is growing for many manufacturers, particularly exporters. Jobs are -- slowly -- starting to follow. 
 ''So one would expect a pretty good earnings situation, in particular for large manufacturers that are connected to export markets,'' he said.
 Earnings at industrial companies are expected to grow about a third. Railroads and airlines are benefiting from reduced costs and a pickup in demand. 
 Still, for all the focus on this round of earnings, the real question is what lies ahead. 
 ''The only thing anybody cares about now is what is going to happen in the next quarter,'' said Howard W. Penney, a managing director for Hedgeye Risk Management.

HEADLINE: A Film That Explores Humanity on Wall Street

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Finding humanity on Wall Street, some might say, can be a little like finding a good mortgage in a bundle of C.D.O.'s. Traders, after all, tend to pride themselves on their dispassionate objectivity. They resist introspection, and find drama in numbers flickering across a screen. 
 Oh, and they aren't exactly held in high esteem these days. 
 This was the challenge facing the stars of ''Margin Call,'' an independent film that deals with the high-stakes choices a group of traders must make during the financial crisis. 
 ''I am trying to humanize bankers,'' said Kevin Spacey, the Academy Award-winning actor, who plays a veteran trader. ''Everyone talks about facts, figures and debt. I was more interested in what they were feeling.'' 
 Mr. Spacey spoke about the research he did for his role late on Thursday night between takes on the film's set, a recreated trading floor high above Midtown Manhattan, on the 42nd floor of One Penn Plaza. To prepare, he said that he searched for clues like a psychological sleuth.
 Mr. Spacey toured investment banks, ferreted out nuggets from newspaper articles about the financial crisis and from the book ''Too Big to Fail,'' and even dug up old speeches from Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman.
 Some of his deepest insights, he said, came from conversations with senior Wall Street bankers and traders. During the discussions, he asked: ''What was it like to be at a friend's wedding, or a bar, when you knew that the whole house of cards was about to collapse?'' 
 ''I listened with some degree of surprise about the weight of having knowledge that others don't, how that shifted relationships -- what guys couldn't even tell their wives at the height of the turmoil,'' Mr. Spacey said. Many of the traders, he discovered, were angry about some decisions that helped assure the survival of their firm but also destroyed longstanding bonds of trust between them, their clients and their colleagues.
 Other cast members found revealing clues elsewhere. Simon Baker, the star of TV's ''The Mentalist,'' who plays an ambitious trader in the film, pulled out a copy of the ''The Big Short'' by Michael Lewis and said he listened to podcasts from the Mad Hedge Fund blog. 
 Penn Badgely of ''Gossip Girl'' said a trip to Citigroup's trading floor helped prepare him to play a junior analyst. He observed how young traders sported ''nice clothes that were not terribly tailored,'' took in Wall Street tropes like using ''bucks'' to signify millions, and parsed the unofficial pecking order of the desks based on who fetched coffee and eggs for their bosses. 
 Demi Moore was cast as a chief risk officer just before the cameras started rolling, leaving her less time for extensive research. ''We got her up to speed, but she is certainly not going to be out there crunching numbers anytime soon,'' said J. C. Chandor, who both wrote and directed the film.

HEADLINE: Settling With Intel

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission has an opportunity to reach a settlement in the litigation over Intel's dominance in the microchip industry, an important sector of the American economy. It has until July 22 to do so. It is crucial that the agency get it right. 
 Merely forcing Intel to stop behavior that has hindered competition in the industry will not do. The F.T.C. must close off Intel's ability to leverage its near monopoly in C.P.U. chips to foreclose competition in other fast-developing technologies. While the agency cannot foresee every tactic that might smother competition, its objective should be to lower the barriers to entry for new competitors.
 Such a deal, however, would probably require imposing structural changes, like forcing Intel to license the technology to its x86 chips -- the cornerstone of the computer architecture -- on reasonable terms so rivals can design processors that will operate smoothly on Intel's platform. Intel may resist, but there is no point reaching a settlement if it cannot protect future innovation. If the company will not agree to these changes, the F.T.C. should not settle.
 The F.T.C.'s suit is the latest in a series of legal challenges to Intel's practices around the world. Antitrust authorities in Japan and South Korea have accused the company of using illegal tactics. The European Commission fined Intel $1.5 billion for abuse of monopoly power. Last year, Intel paid $1.25 billion to its smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices to settle charges that it used illegal tactics to shut A.M.D. out of computer markets.
 But the challenges have mostly been narrow, centered on the C.P.U. market -- where Intel has an 80 percent market share. They revolve around its practice of offering rebates and other incentives to reward computer makers that used only Intel chips and punish those that used A.M.D. processors. As part of its settlement with A.M.D., Intel agreed not to use such tactics.
 The F.T.C. said Intel's abuses extend to graphics processors, which are faster and can handle more data than standard chips and have been taking over many tasks formerly done by C.P.U.'s. Intel's graphics chips are technologically behind those of cutting-edge rivals like Nvidia, but have about a 50 percent market share.
 According to the F.T.C., Intel corrupted its chips so rival processors would not run smoothly with them. It misled Nvidia about technical specs -- leading it to waste time and money. It charged more for its C.P.U.'s to computer makers that used rival processors for graphics. Intel should probably commit to some standard of inter-operability or at least guarantee it will not to do anything to degrade the operation of rival processors. 
 But the F.T.C.'s ultimate objective should be to ensure competition that prevails in the computer processor market. In a world in which Intel has four-fifths of the market for the basic building block, the task is to ensure that innovative chip designers have reasonable access to the Intel technology they need for their innovations to work.

HEADLINE: Mr. Secretary, This Is Your Life (in Plenty of Detail)

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
It's not a prank, and it's not ''Punk'd.'' PBS really is presenting a three-hour documentary about George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state.
 It's a little hard to believe. Even the title sounds like a ''Colbert Report'' punch line: ''Turmoil and Triumph: The George Shultz Years.'' But this is no joke. Part 1 is on Monday, and the documentary continues the following Monday, and then the next. It feels as if it never ends.
 Not that there is anything wrong with honoring Mr. Shultz. He was an able steward of Ronald Reagan's foreign policy, a steady voice of reason in a White House often embroiled in ideological sniping. The 1980s certainly qualify as a time of turmoil: the war in Lebanon, perestroika, the Philippines, the contras. There was plenty of triumph too, even if the Berlin Wall didn't fall until 1989, and the Iran-Contra scandal clouded the eternal sunshine of President Reagan's second term. 
 But three hours? PBS was able to tell the story of Eleanor Roosevelt in two and a half. Walt Whitman got two hours. So did J. Robert Oppenheimer. A 2009 film about Herbert Hoover is 60 minutes long. Even Ken Burns was able to polish off an entire mini-series about Thomas Jefferson in three hours. 
 The Titanic took less time to sink (2 hours 40 minutes) than it takes PBS to give Mr. Shultz his due. 
 It can be argued that Mr. Shultz was one of the best -- and least controversial -- secretaries of state since George C. Marshall, especially since nobody can remember, for example, who Nixon's first secretary of state was (William P. Rogers) and lots of people still have a problem with the second (Henry Kissinger). Names like Dean Rusk, Cyrus Vance and Warren Christopher are stumpers on ''Jeopardy.'' People don't always remember Mr. Shultz either, because while he was distinguished, he wasn't that distinctive; he took pride in being opaque.
 So it is nice to learn that at 89, he looks hale and quite jaunty in the interviews he gave in a replica of the Oval Office. He speaks as slowly and soberly as ever, but there is more of a twinkle in his eye. 
 The documentary reminds viewers, at lavish length, that Mr. Shultz had a prestigious career before the State Department, looking back at his days as an economist, as a cabinet member in the Nixon administration, as president of Bechtel and as dean of the University of Chicago's graduate school of business. 
 Mr. Shultz, a distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, is still very active in public life. And according to the society pages, he and his wife, Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, are pillars of San Francisco's beau monde. 
 Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Edward M. Kennedy are unstinting in their praise. On the review DVD, the diplomatic historian Walter LaFeber says, ''He's going to go down in history as the person who was most important in ending the cold war.'' 
 The series is a generous tribute, but it feels more like an encomium than a history lesson. 
 There is archival footage and also the kind of cheesy re-enactments more commonly seen on the History Channel. In one, the impersonator Rich Little imitates Ronald Reagan complaining to Mikhail Gorbachev about the Soviet Union's support of leftist revolutions. (''I've told you as frankly as I can that we fear you.'') 
 There is no mention that Mr. Shultz was a cheerleader for the 2003 invasion of Iraq while still on the board of Bechtel, a construction and engineering firm that won huge contracts that were later criticized by the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction. The film doesn't even note that Mr. Shultz, though generally not known for frivolity, has a small Princeton tiger tattoo on his derriere. 
 Bob Chitester, founder of Free to Choose Media, is the executive producer of the Shultz biography. He explained in an interview that he had originally pitched a two-hour program, but found that there was just too much material. (In fairness, the script is largely based on Mr. Shultz's 1993 memoir, ''Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State,'' which is 1,184 pages long.) 
 Mr. Chitester said he was able to raise more money from the program's sponsors for an additional hour and asked PBS for more time. PBS said yes. 
 The sponsors for this tribute include Mr. Shultz's Nixon-era colleague, Peter G. Peterson, who is married to Joan Ganz Cooney, the founder of Children's Television Workshop. The Stephen Bechtel Fund gave money, so did Charles Schwab, founder of the Charles Schwab Corporation, where Mr. Shultz also served as a board member. So did many prominent foundations and individuals, including Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat from California. 
 It might sound like PBS was made an offer it couldn't refuse, but John Wilson, the chief programming executive, said that was not the case. 
 ''We evaluate programs on their merits,'' Mr. Wilson said in an interview. ''PBS has a vivid track record of covering this administration's key players. It goes without saying this is not our first look at the Reagan White House and not the last.''
 To viewers, however, it may seem like the longest.

HEADLINE: With Timing Unclear, Democrats Corral Votes for Bank Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Final passage of sweeping legislation to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory system is now a question of when -- not if -- according to Senate Democrats. Yet, there still seem to be a lot of questions about when.
 As in: When will the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, be confident enough that he has the 60 votes needed to overcome any Republican filibuster and bring the legislation the Senate floor? 
 And that question could hinge on another: when will Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia name a replacement for Senator Robert C. Byrd, a Democrat and supporter of the legislation, who died recently at the age of 92? 
 Yet another question is when the few Republicans who previously supported the bill will join Democrats on a motion to end debate and proceed to a final vote. 
 At the glittery Aria Casino in Las Vegas on Thursday night, Mr. Reid proudly told thousands of supporters waiting to see President Obama, ''We're going to finish that conference report!'' 
 Despite the enthusiasm behind the words, Mr. Reid's use of cryptic Washingtonese to describe the most far-reaching restructuring of the financial regulatory systems since the Great Depression drew no applause. 
 For now, it seems that the earliest the bill could win final approval is Thursday. But Mr. Reid has contingency plans to work on other legislation, including an extension of unemployment benefits and a bill to bolster lending to small businesses. 
 Democrats already have been asking ''when'' about the financial regulatory bill far longer than they intended. Their struggle to complete a measure that was expected to pass with wide bipartisan support has become a symbol both of the success of Senate Republican leaders in stalling the Democrats' agenda and the political gridlock that is likely to persist through the November elections. 
 Mr. Obama had wanted the financial regulation bill completed and sent to him for his signature before Congress left for the Fourth of July recess. 
 But the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who opposes the measure, persuaded colleagues likely to vote for it to at least slow things down. Mr. McConnell has worked aggressively to deny Democrats the time needed to rack up legislative accomplishments before the midterm elections. 
 In response, Senate Democratic leaders are considering staying in session during the second week of August -- delaying their summer recess by one week -- in an attempt to pass an energy bill and finish other work. But more time in Washington may only deepen the partisan paralysis.
 The final legislation largely mirrors the regulatory policies initially sought by the White House, including a powerful new consumer financial protection bureau at the Federal Reserve, a tough regulatory framework for derivatives, and tighter rules and requirements for big banks. 
 But there are also some provisions deeply opposed by the White House, including an exemption for car dealers so they are not overseen by the new consumer protection bureau. And with the economy still struggling, the Obama administration has found itself on the defensive, amid claims that it is pursuing policies hostile to businesses. 
 In an interview on ABC's ''This Week,'' David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said that the lax regulatory climate during the Bush administration had led to ''financial disaster.'' 
 ''Our financial system is now stable instead of collapsing, which would have been a devastating thing for every business in this country, large and small,'' Mr. Axelrod said. ''We're working closely with business and want to continue to work closely with business, but working closely doesn't mean that we simply turn away from the kinds of corrective measures that are necessary to prevent that kind of disaster from happening again. 
 While the House approved the final financial regulatory bill this month, Senate Democrats were not able to, in part because one Republican supporter, Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, expressed a last-minute objection to a proposed tax on big banks and hedge funds. 
 Democrats reopened the House and Senate conference process to replace the bank tax with a plan to end the Troubled Asset Relief Program early, freeing $11 billion in spending authority, and to increase the reserve requirements for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to help cover the bill's projected $20 billion administrative cost. 
 Between that and the death of Mr. Byrd, whose coffin occupied the Senate chamber for much of the day before the recess, there was no way to finish the bill before Independence Day. 
 That evening, Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, who originally opposed the regulatory overhaul, announced that she would support the final version. The move came after she received a letter from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission about provisions relating to new regulation of derivatives, the complex financial instruments that were at the heart of the 2008 crisis. Ms. Cantwell had been concerned about potential loopholes but said she was reassured that the bill would impose a tight regulatory framework. 
 Even with Ms. Cantwell's support, Democrats needed the backing of at least three Republicans -- or two, once a replacement is named in West Virginia, but Governor Manchin, a Democrat, has said that will not happen this week. (Senator Russ Feingold, Democrat of Wisconsin, has opposed the bill and said he would vote against the final version.) 
 Mr. Brown, while professing satisfaction with the removal of the bank tax, said he wanted to study the final legislative language over the holiday break. 
 Mr. Brown is expected to vote for the measure, along with the Republican senators from Maine, Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe. But so far only Ms. Collins has committed her vote. And with Mr. Feingold in opposition and Mr. Byrd's seat vacant, the math for passage is still tricky. 
 Another Republican who supported the Senate version of the regulatory overhaul, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, has expressed some reservations about the final version, including the very change made to get Mr. Brown's support, by ending the TARP program. 
 An aide said Mr. Grassley was concerned about those changes because Mr. Grassley has long called for any money left over from TARP to be returned to the Treasury. Mr. Grassley was also concerned that money paid to the F.D.I.C. would be used only for dealing with future bank failures. 
 Democrats have said they are not counting on Mr. Grassley's vote. But until a successor for Mr. Byrd is named, they have no margin of error.

HEADLINE: Despite Privacy Inquiries, Germans Flock to Google, Facebook and Apple

BYLINE: By KEVIN O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Chenchao Liu has 446 friends on Facebook, loves his iPhone 3GS and is obsessed with Google searches and maps. 
 In that respect, Mr. Liu, 21, is like many American college students. But Mr. Liu lives in Germany, a country whose strict data protection laws have spurred inquiries into the practices of Facebook, Apple and Google -- the companies responsible for the products and services he enjoys.
 He is one of the millions of users who have helped make the offerings successful in Germany. 
 ''I think many people in Germany, especially those in my age group, do not have as many problems with data protection as the regulators are making out,'' said Mr. Liu, who studies chemistry at Technical University in Munich. ''What it all comes down to is personal responsibility. No one is forcing anyone to use any of these services.''
 American technology companies are under close scrutiny in Germany. Google is being investigated for having errantly collected personal Internet information like e-mail passwords while doing research for its Street View mapping service. 
 Facebook is being investigated for collecting data on non-Facebook users from the mailing lists of active users. And Apple has been asked to explain what kind of information its latest iPhone 4 is storing on users and for how long. 
 Johannes Caspar, a data protection supervisor in Hamburg who is conducting the investigations into Google and Facebook, said his agency was trying to protect consumers from themselves. ''The problem is that many people are unaware what is being done with their data,'' he said. 
 Strict privacy laws are a product of the post-World War II reconstruction, when German lawmakers restricted the use of personal information to prevent the government from singling out citizens and persecuting them. 
 It is illegal, for example, to publish the image or name of any private person without permission. This includes felons, who are usually identified in the media by the initial of their last name only, like Klaus P. 
 That has not stopped Germans from flocking to a social networking site or downloading the latest smartphone applications. 
 As of May, Googe controlled 92 percent of the online search market in Germany, compared with 65 percent in the United States, according to comScore, a research firm in Reston, Va. 
 Facebook has about 7.7 million users in Germany (which has a population of about 82 million), according to Inside Network, a research group in Palo Alto, Calif. All versions of the iPhone, including the iPhone 4, which went on sale in Germany in June, have sold out within days. Apple does not provide specific sales figures in Germany.
 ''What I think we have in Germany is a big disconnect between data privacy laws and consumer sentiment toward privacy,'' said Felix Haas, the chief executive and founder of Amiando, a company in Munich that is the largest online event registration platform in Europe.
 Amiando is a case in point. Its software is used by the concert promoters of German entertainers like Lena Meyer-Landrut, the winner of the Eurovision song contest this year, and even by the country's own data protection officials, who registered online to attend their annual convention.
 The regulators typed their names, addresses and other details into Amiando's registration form and -- if they wanted to receive offers on related events -- checked a box authorizing the mailings. Amiando, like most German online businesses, does not sell its data to third parties, but it makes its list available for focused mailings.
 The American practice of selling customer names and details, Mr. Haas said, is legal in Germany but almost never used because ''it would erode the trust we have built up.''
 Yet more and more Germans are disclosing personal details if they can save money doing so. A retail bonus card, called Payback, has 19.4 million subscribers. In exchange for discounts at retailers, cardholders give Payback's operator, Loyalty Partner of Munich, permission to send them offers.
 The company scored a legal victory in August 2008 when the German supreme court, the Bundesgerichtshof, rejected a complaint from consumer protection officials who had claimed that Payback did not tell consumers enough about how it used their personal information in marketing efforts. 
 Dieter Weng, the president of the German Dialogue Marketing Association, a group of 800 businesses that includes online marketers, said Germany was unlikely to loosen its privacy restrictions. 
 But the need to encourage the growth of the Internet economy, Mr. Weng said, could help lower barriers for online marketing.
 ''I think Germans are concerned about personal data being misused by government or law enforcement,'' Mr. Weng said. ''But for behavioral or attitudinal data about customer preferences, people are more willing to share if they see an advantage in it for them.''
 Peter Barron, a Google spokesman in London, said the challenge for regulators was to strike a balance between data protection and nurturing Internet businesses.
 ''If that balance isn't right,'' Mr. Barron said, ''then users and businesses will lose out.''

HEADLINE: Curacao Faces Friction With Chavez Over U.S. Planes

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
HATO, Curacao -- This small island in the Netherlands Antilles might go unnoticed by its neighbors if not for the importance of the foreign interests it hosts: an American Air Force installation pivotal in fighting the region's drug trade and a huge refinery that turns Venezuelan oil into gasoline.
 Chafing at the American military outpost just 40 miles from Venezuela's coast, President Hugo Chavez is testing Curacao's nerves by repeatedly claiming that the Dutch government, which oversees defense issues here, is letting Washington use Curacao as a base for planning a possible attack on Venezuela. 
The assertions come just months before Curacao, which has relied for centuries on trade with Venezuela, will gain greater autonomy from the kingdom of the Netherlands when the Netherlands Antilles is dissolved as a unified political entity this fall. The Dutch will continue to oversee aspects of Curacao's foreign policy, though a vocal minority here favors full independence, and Mr. Chavez's talk could stoke that thinking. 
 ''When you are small, you have to be wise, and when the big ones are in a quarrel, small countries have to stay out of that,'' said Helmin Wiels, 51, the leader of Pueblo Soberano, a leftist party here that wants to expel the American surveillance planes. 
 But for now, the breakup of the Netherlands Antilles is expected to be a largely uneventful political reorganization in which the Netherlands will maintain its control of defense and foreign-relations issues for all the islands involved, including continuing to allow the American aircraft to be based at Curacao's airport. 
 The planes have used the airport since an agreement was signed in 2000. The agreement will expire this year, and the Dutch have said they plan to approve a five-year extension. 
 Lt. Col. Brian Bell, who commands the American outpost, said in an interview, ''Curacao is strategically located near major trafficking corridors, which is one of the reasons why we'd like to remain here.''
 The surveillance flights over the Caribbean last about 12 hours, resembling a cat-and-mouse game using radar to detect ships and small planes carrying cocaine.
 In the region, the United States drug interdiction program also has planes based in El Salvador and Aruba and access to the Soto Cano Air Base in Honduras, and it recently gained access to several bases in Colombia. Venezuela is not alone, though, in Latin America in its unease over the American military's role in the war on drugs. Ecuador recently terminated an agreement that allowed American military personnel to operate from a base on the country's Pacific coast. 
 In Hato, the hulking Awacs and P-3s share the tarmac with Venezuelan airlines, which have flights daily to and from Caracas, Venezuela's capital.
 Some friction with Mr. Chavez's government might be inevitable since Venezuela emerged in recent years as a major narcotics transshipment point. The United Nations said last month that Venezuela accounted for over half of all detected maritime shipments of cocaine to Europe. 
 At the same time, Venezuela and Curacao are important, if uneasy, partners in trade. The rusting refinery here is one of the largest employers on the island; of the 150,000 residents, about 1,000 work at the refinery. 
 In March, Rafael Ramirez, Venezuela's oil minister, threatened to abandon the refinery if Venezuela detected signs of aggression from the American planes, and yet the site provides crucial refining capacity for Venezuela's national oil company, which leases it from Curacao.
 Historians say that in the early 20th century the Venezuelan dictator Juan Vicente Gomez pushed for its construction off Venezuelan soil, but within his own sphere of economic influence, to keep rivals in oil-rich areas of western Venezuela from amassing power. When oil was discovered in Venezuela about a century ago, Royal Dutch Shell built the refinery here for oil from fields of nearby Lake Maracaibo in Venezuela.
 In a speech in Copenhagen last December, Mr. Chavez asserted that Curacao and Aruba, another self-governing Dutch island, were located within Venezuela's territorial waters.
 Mr. Chavez said this year that two Venezuelan F-16 fighter jets had intercepted an American military plane flown from Curacao, an assertion disputed by the United States Defense Department. Still, Mr. Chavez used the episode to chastise the Dutch.
 Curacaoan, Dutch and American officials have rejected Mr. Chavez's assertions. The officials said the agreement overseeing the base prevented the planes involved from carrying any weapons. ''We explain and keep explaining,'' Carel de Haseth, an aide to Curacao's prime minister, Emily de Jongh-Elhage, said. ''It's no secret. It's open. Once again, there's no military presence. It's part of drug intelligence and combating trafficking. These are reconnaissance flights, unarmed planes.''
 Colonel Bell said, ''We have no offensive capabilities at this location at all.''
 For now, Curacao seems ready to continue hosting American airmen deemed adversaries of Mr. Chavez, while still comfortably exploiting some of the policy distortions put into motion in its oil-rich neighbor, like the multiple exchange rates that recently drove large numbers of Venezuelans here to profit from illegal schemes to obtain hard currency. 
 Michiel van der Veur, a political scientist at the University of the Netherlands Antilles in Curacao, said, ''You can see Venezuela from here on a clear day, but Chavez's claims are absurd.'' 
 ''He's likely saying these things for internal consumption in order to distract Venezuelans from the problems his government has created,'' Mr. van der Veur said.

HEADLINE: As Congress Returns, Series of Tests Awaits

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
Lawmakers took vacation, but economic and political currents swirling around them did not. In some ways, both parties return to Washington this week on the defensive.
 Economic indicators that raise questions about the strength of recovery bolster Democratic arguments for new stimulus spending. Even if increased stimulus spending raises the near-term budget deficit, Republican leaders will have more difficulty maintaining their wall of opposition.
But the same indicators strengthen Republican arguments for delaying pending tax increases. Even if those increases affect only affluent taxpayers, Democratic leaders will have more trouble uniting their party behind them. 
 The first test comes this week when Senate leaders return to tax-and-spending legislation that they say will help the economy.
 The second will come when Democrats settle their internal debate over the timing of tax legislation that Congress must pass to avert increases on all taxpayers when tax cuts imposed under President George W. Bush expire on Dec. 31.
 House leaders, fearing political fallout, want to wait for a lame-duck session after the midterm elections. Some Senate strategists, arguing that the tax issue cannot be avoided in any case, favor moving this summer or fall.
 A third test will come as the administration pursues untapped economic resources: the $1.8 trillion in cash that wary corporations are sitting on. Some Democratic moderates insist that the key is a more business-friendly message to overcome executives' concerns about the commitment of President Obama's party to both short-term job creation and long-term deficit reduction.
 ''There's some talking past each other,'' said Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat and former telecommunications executive. ''The market is looking for signs we're going to be serious.'' 
 Collision Course
 For Democrats, the election-year economic debate has often reached a dead end.
 Mr. Obama and his Congressional allies believe that their policies have spurred recovery, just not fast enough. But additional stimulus proposals collide with rising concerns about deficits.
 Recent data on jobs and housing, however, have exacerbated fears that the recovery may even be weaker than previously thought. Gloomier forecasters have raised the possibility of a second, ''double dip'' recession.
 Politically, that bolsters Democratic arguments for more unemployment benefits, aid to small businesses, and assistance for states with medical and education costs. In coming Congressional debates, said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, a member of the Democratic leadership, the balance between deficit reduction and stimulus concerns ''is going to shift in the direction of job creation.''
 But there is also evidence of a corresponding shift in tax policy debates.
 Mr. Obama's advisers say there is no reason to abandon his longstanding intention to allow Bush-era income tax cuts to expire on households earning over $250,000, and to raise rates on capital gains and dividends to 20 percent from 15 percent for those same households. Slightly higher rates will not affect those taxpayers' spending habits much, they say - and the government needs the higher tax revenues for deficit reduction.
 Yet political cracks are developing in the White House position. Mark Zandi, an independent economist whose analysis Democrats have cited to justify spending proposals, says slowing top-end tax increases would avert a further drag on growth.
 ''Any tax increases would be counterproductive until the economy is consistently expanding at a strong enough rate to significantly lower unemployment,'' Mr. Zandi recently told the House Budget Committee.
 For this reason, Keith Hennessey, a former Bush economic adviser, says Mr. Obama ''could trap Republicans in their own anti-fiscal-stimulus rhetoric'' by proposing temporary extensions of top-end tax cuts and unemployment benefits at the same time.
 ''It won't happen,'' Mr. Hennessey asserted in a blog post last week. But the idea underscores what he called the ''intellectual inconsistency'' of both parties in selective advocacy of methods to spur growth.
 A Two-Step Proposal
 What could still happen, Mr. Warner said, is improvement in a dialogue between Democrats and business leaders in which ''I sometimes feel like a translator.''
 Corporate leaders have intensified their complaints that Mr. Obama's rhetoric and policies on health care, financial regulation and energy have deterred business investment. Administration officials believe that, to some degree, those complaints mask more personal concerns about looming increases in their own taxes.
 ''They just hate it,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff.
 Mr. Warner suggests two concrete steps to temper the grousing and build business confidence. One is making states demonstrate commitment to long-term spending restraint in exchange for assistance with Medicaid expenses.
 The other is a generous extension of the research and development tax credit that Congress is now considering. Mr. Warner's argument to corporate leaders: ''If we're going to raise the R&D tax credit, you can't complain about your personal rates going back to where they were under Clinton.''
 ''There's a willingness for a little more straight talk,'' he said, ''if everyone feels we're all in it together.''
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Feckless Fed

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Back in 2002, a professor turned Federal Reserve official by the name of Ben Bernanke gave a widely quoted speech titled ''Deflation: Making Sure 'It' Doesn't Happen Here.'' Like other economists, myself included, Mr. Bernanke was deeply disturbed by Japan's stubborn, seemingly incurable deflation, which in turn was ''associated with years of painfully slow growth, rising joblessness, and apparently intractable financial problems.'' This sort of thing wasn't supposed to happen to an advanced nation with sophisticated policy makers. Could something similar happen to the United States?
 Not to worry, said Mr. Bernanke: the Fed had the tools required to head off an American version of the Japan syndrome, and it would use them if necessary. 
 Today, Mr. Bernanke is the Fed's chairman -- and his 2002 speech reads like famous last words. We aren't literally suffering deflation (yet). But inflation is far below the Fed's preferred rate of 1.7 to 2 percent, and trending steadily lower; it's a good bet that by some measures we'll be seeing deflation by sometime next year. Meanwhile, we already have painfully slow growth, very high joblessness, and intractable financial problems. And what is the Fed's response? It's debating -- with ponderous slowness -- whether maybe, possibly, it should consider trying to do something about the situation, one of these days.
 The Fed's fecklessness is, to be sure, not unique. It has been astonishing and infuriating, as the economic crisis has unfolded, to watch America's political class defining normalcy down. As recently as two years ago, anyone predicting the current state of affairs (not only is unemployment disastrously high, but most forecasts say that it will stay very high for years) would have been dismissed as a crazy alarmist. Now that the nightmare has become reality, however -- and yes, it is a nightmare for millions of Americans -- Washington seems to feel absolutely no sense of urgency. Are hopes being destroyed, small businesses being driven into bankruptcy, lives being blighted? Never mind, let's talk about the evils of budget deficits.
 Still, one might have hoped that the Fed would be different. For one thing, the Fed, unlike the Obama administration, retains considerable freedom of action. It doesn't need 60 votes in the Senate; the outer limits of its policies aren't determined by the views of senators from Nebraska and Maine. Beyond that, the Fed was supposed to be intellectually prepared for this situation. Mr. Bernanke has thought long and hard about how to avoid a Japanese-style economic trap, and the Fed's researchers have been obsessed for years with the same question.
 But here we are, visibly sliding toward deflation -- and the Fed is standing pat.
 What should it be doing? Conventional monetary policy, in which the Fed drives down short-term interest rates by buying short-term U.S. government debt, has reached its limit: those short-term rates are already near zero, and can't go significantly lower. (Investors won't buy bonds that yield negative interest, since they can always hoard cash instead.) But the message of Mr. Bernanke's 2002 speech was that there are other things the Fed can do. It can buy longer-term government debt. It can buy private-sector debt. It can try to move expectations by announcing that it will keep short-term rates low for a long time. It can raise its long-run inflation target, to help convince the private sector that borrowing is a good idea and hoarding cash a mistake.
 Nobody knows how well any one of these actions would work. The point, however, is that there are things the Fed could and should be doing, but isn't. Why not?
 After all, Fed officials, like most observers, have a fairly grim view of the economy's prospects. Not grim enough, in my view: Fed presidents, who make forecasts every time the committee that sets interest rates meets, aren't taking the trend toward deflation sufficiently seriously. Nonetheless, even their projections show high unemployment and below-target inflation persisting at least through late 2012.
 So why not try to do something about it? The closest thing I've seen to an explanation is a recent speech by Kevin Warsh of the Fed's Board of Governors, in which he declared that doing what Mr. Bernanke recommended back in 2002 risked undermining the Fed's ''institutional credibility.'' But how, exactly, does it serve the Fed's credibility when it fails to confront high unemployment, while consistently missing its own inflation targets? How credible is the Bank of Japan after presiding over 15 years of deflation?
 Whatever is going on, the Fed needs to rethink its priorities, fast. Mr. Bernanke's ''it'' isn't a hypothetical possibility, it's on the verge of happening. And the Fed should be doing all it can to stop it.

HEADLINE: Japan's Governing Party Suffers Sharp Setback in Elections

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Yasuko Kamiizumi contributed reporting from Yokohama, Japan, and Makiko Inoue from Sayama, Japan.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's governing Democratic Party suffered a stinging setback in midterm elections on Sunday that showed growing voter disappointment with the party's apparent inability to deliver on promises to revamp the country's sclerotic postwar order.
 The election, for seats in the Upper House, was widely seen as a referendum on the nine-month-old leadership of the Democrats, who won a historic election victory last year over the long-governing Liberal Democrats, but then got mired in money scandals and a dispute over an American airbase. With most districts reporting final results, the Democrats trailed the opposition Liberal Democrats, failing to win enough of the 121 contested seats to gain a controlling majority in the chamber. 
 ''No one expected it to be as bad as this,'' said Naoko Taniguchi, a professor of political sociology at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. ''Voters see a leadership crisis.''
 The election was another big blow to the party after the sudden resignation last month of Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama, who faced deepening criticism over his indecisive leadership. 
 The Democrats are not in danger of losing control of the government, since they have a comfortable majority in the more powerful Lower House. But their failure to control the Upper House could result in a split Parliament, making the Democrats' promises to strengthen social welfare and assert more control over the nation's powerful bureaucracy far more difficult to achieve. 
 Analysts said the vote showed growing doubts about the party's ability to end the prolonged economic stagnation in Japan, once the powerhouse of Asia. They credited the Liberal Democrats' apparently strong showing after months of disarray to its still formidable local vote-gathering ability, though the gains also reflected a protest vote against the Democrats.
 Opinion polls had predicted a tough race for the Democrats, who suffered as Mr. Hatoyama's popularity plummeted. The party then voted in a new prime minister, Naoto Kan; his approval ratings also fell after he proposed an increase of the national consumption tax only to waffle about it later, raising questions about his leadership skills.
 On Sunday, Mr. Kan took responsibility for the election setback but said he would stay on as prime minister.
 ''My insufficient explanation was a big reason in this big election defeat,'' Mr. Kan said at a news conference.
 The Democrats appeared to have won 44 of the 121 contested seats, far below their previous total of 54 and much less than the 60 seats needed to claim a majority in the Upper House, according to N.H.K., Japan's national broadcaster. N.H.K. used actual vote tallies and its own projections of contested races. The Liberal Democratic Party, or L.D.P., appeared to have secured 51 seats, with the rest going to smaller parties.
 Final results were available for about two-thirds of the races. The rest were expected on Monday.
 Without a majority in the Upper House, the Democrats may be forced to seek a coalition partner. 
 One possibility was a grand coalition with the Liberal Democrats, whose election platform was very similar to the Democrats', including the call for a consumption tax increase. Failure to form a coalition could result in renewed political paralysis, and possibly pressure to dissolve Parliament and call new elections, political experts said. 
 But a Democratic official said Sunday that the party might instead ask opposition parties to cooperate on a policy-by-policy basis. A likely candidate is the oddly named Your Party, a new party advocating small-government policies that emerged as a distant third on Sunday with 10 seats.
 Voters casting ballots at a fire station in Yokohama, a city outside Tokyo, agreed that the Democrats had stumbled since taking office. But they were divided on whether to support them. 
 Mineko Tokumasu, 79, a tobacco shop owner, said the party should be given a reprieve. 
 ''I think it's too early to judge the Democratic Party,'' she said. ''You cannot change something like the bureaucracy in just nine months.'' 
 Other voters said they were already fed up with the country's new leaders. 
 ''I voted for the Democratic Party last time, but they did not live up to expectations,'' said Yoshifumi Shimura, 56, a transportation industry worker who said he voted for the L.D.P. this time. The Democrats ''just talked about ideals but lacked the skill to make them reality,'' he said.
 In fact, many had expected this election to be an easy victory for the Democrats, who had seen a rebound in popularity after Mr. Kan, a plain-spoken former social activist, replaced the unpopular Mr. Hatoyama. 
 But Mr. Kan saw his approval ratings quickly drop, first by proposing a tax increase before an election -- a political no-no in almost any country -- and then by seeming to vacillate when the proposal proved predictably unpopular among voters. 
 The apparent flip-flopping appeared to raise broader doubts here about whether the inexperienced Democrats, an alliance of L.D.P. defectors and former socialists who once seemed permanently relegated to Japan's opposition sidelines, could mold themselves into an effective governing party. 
 Mr. Hatoyama's and then Mr. Kan's inconsistencies appeared to fan fears of what some political experts characterized as a leadership crisis in Japan, where voters are eager to find someone to point a way out of the country's seemingly intractable decline.
 ''Kan's handling of the tax issue backfired by reminding people of the hapless Hatoyama,'' said Jeff Kingston, a politics professor at Temple University in Tokyo. ''People here are desperate for leadership, and for change.''
 Indeed, this election was already history-making in one regard: This was the first time since the mid-1950s that a party other than the L.D.P. had been the incumbent party going into a national election. 
 During the campaign, Mr. Kan ran on a platform that called for the strengthening of Japan's social safety net while using revenue from the tax increase to invest in job-creating industries like medical care and new energy. 
 He seemed to avoid foreign policy issues after his predecessor was forced to resign over his mishandling of a dispute with Washington over relocating an American military base on Okinawa. 
 The focus on economic issues appeared to be part of the party's strategy to regain credibility with voters. 
 ''This election is about whether voters have confidence in the Democratic Party,'' said Goshi Hosono, the party's deputy secretary general.

HEADLINE: Governors Voice Grave Concerns On Immigration

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH; Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting from Washington, and Katie Zezima from Boston.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- In a private meeting with White House officials this weekend, Democratic governors voiced deep anxiety about the Obama administration's suit against Arizona's new immigration law, worrying that it could cost a vulnerable Democratic Party in the fall elections.
 While the weak economy dominated the official agenda at the summer meeting here of the National Governors Association, concern over immigration policy pervaded the closed-door session between Democratic governors and White House officials and simmered throughout the three-day event. 
 At the Democrats' meeting on Saturday, some governors bemoaned the timing of the Justice Department lawsuit, according to two governors who spoke anonymously because the discussion was private. 
 ''Universally the governors are saying, 'We've got to talk about jobs,' '' Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat, said in an interview. ''And all of a sudden we have immigration going on.'' 
 He added, ''It is such a toxic subject, such an important time for Democrats.''
 The administration seemed to be taking a carrot-and-stick approach on Sunday. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, in town to give the governors a classified national security briefing, met one-on-one with Jan Brewer, the Republican who succeeded her as governor of Arizona and ardently supports the immigration law. 
 About the same time as that meeting, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said on a taped Sunday talk show that the Justice Department could bring yet another lawsuit against Arizona if there is evidence that the immigration law leads to racial profiling.
 Ms. Brewer said she and Ms. Napolitano did not discuss the current lawsuit. Instead, in a conversation she described as cordial, they discussed Arizona's request for more National Guard troops along the border with Mexico, as well as other resources.
 The Democrats' meeting provided a window on tensions between the White House and states over the suit, which the Justice Department filed last week in federal court in Phoenix. Nineteen Democratic governors are either leaving office or seeking re-election this year, and Republicans see those seats as crucial to swaying the 2012 presidential race. 
 The Arizona law -- which Ms. Brewer signed in April and which, barring an injunction, takes effect July 29 -- makes it a crime to be an illegal immigrant there. It also requires police officers to determine the immigration status of people they stop for other offenses if there is a ''reasonable suspicion'' that they might be illegal immigrants.
 The lawsuit contends that controlling immigration is a federal responsibility, but polls suggest that a majority of Americans support the Arizona law, or at least the concept of a state having a strong role in immigration enforcement. 
 Republican governors at the Boston meeting were also critical of the lawsuit, saying it infringed on states' rights and rallying around Ms. Brewer, whose presence spurred a raucous protest around the downtown hotel where the governors gathered. 
 ''I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that almost every state in America next January is going to see a bill similar to Arizona's,'' said Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska, a Republican seeking re-election.
 But the unease of Democratic governors, seven of whom are seeking re-election this year, was more striking. 
 ''I might have chosen both a different tack and a different time,'' said Gov. Bill Ritter Jr. of Colorado, a Democrat who was facing a tough fight for re-election and pulled out of the race earlier this year. ''This is an issue that divides us politically, and I'm hopeful that their strategy doesn't do that in a way that makes it more difficult for candidates to get elected, particularly in the West.''
 The White House would not directly respond to reports of complaints from some Democratic governors. 
 But David Axelrod, the president's senior adviser, said on Sunday on CNN's ''State of the Union'' that the president remained committed to passing an immigration overhaul, and that addressing the issue did not mean he was ignoring the economy. 
 ''That doesn't mean we can't have a good, healthy debate about the economy and other issues,'' Mr. Axelrod said. 
 Mr. Obama addressed the economy last week during stops in Kansas City and Las Vegas, and has been calling on Congress to offer additional tax relief to small businesses. 
 And the heads of Mr. Obama's national debt commission -- Alan K. Simpson and Erskine B. Bowles -- were on hand here on Sunday to press the economic issue.
 The nation's total federal debt next year is expected to exceed $14 trillion, and Mr. Simpson, a former Republican senator from Wyoming, and Mr. Bowles, a Democrat and the White House chief of staff under President Bill Clinton, offered a gloomy assessment if spending is not brought under control even more.
 ''This debt is like a cancer,'' Mr. Bowles said. ''It is truly going to destroy the country from within.''
 Still, the issue of immigration commanded as much attention as anything here this weekend.
 Ms. Brewer, who was trailed by television cameras all weekend, called the lawsuit ''outrageous'' and said the state was receiving donations from around the country to help fight it. 
 ''I think Arizona will win,'' she said, ''and we will take a position for all of America.''
 Immigration was not the only topic at the Saturday meeting between Democratic governors and two White House officials -- Patrick Gaspard, Mr. Obama's political director, and Cecilia Munoz, director of intergovernmental affairs. But several governors, including Christine Gregoire of Washington, said it was a particularly heated issue. 
 Ms. Gregoire, who does not face an election this year, said the White House was doing a poor job of showing the American public that it was working on the problem of illegal immigration. 
 ''They described for me a list of things that they are doing to try and help on that border,'' Ms. Gregoire said of the White House officials at the closed-door meeting. ''And I said, 'The public doesn't know that.' ''
 She added, ''We've got a message void, and the only thing we're hearing is that they're filing a lawsuit.''
 Some Democrats also joined Republicans in calling for Congress to pass an immigration policy overhaul this year. 
 ''There are 535 members of Congress,'' said Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a Democrat. ''Certainly somebody back there can chew gum and hold the basketball at the same time. This is not an either-or.''
 Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico praised the Justice Department's lawsuit, saying his fellow Democrats' concerns were ''misguided.'' 
 ''Policy-wise it makes sense,'' said Mr. Richardson, who is Hispanic and who leaves office this year on term limits, ''and Obama is popular with Hispanic voters and this is going to be a popular move with them nationally.''
 Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland -- a Democrat who voiced apprehension about the lawsuit in the private meeting, according to the two governors who requested anonymity -- said in an interview that he supported it. 
 ''The president doesn't have control over some of the timing of things that happen,'' Mr. O'Malley said. ''When those things arise, you can't be too precious about what's in it for your own personal political timing or even your party's timing. When matters like this arise, I think the president has to take a principled stand.''
 But Mr. Bredesen said that in Tennessee, where the governor's race will be tight this year, Democratic candidates were already on the defensive about the federal health care overhaul, and the suit against Arizona further weakened them. In Tennessee, he said, Democratic candidates are already ''disavowing'' the immigration lawsuit.
 ''Maybe you do that when you're strong,'' he said of the suit, ''and not when there's an election looming out there.''
 Mr. Ritter of Colorado said he wished the Justice Department had waited to sue Arizona until after the law went into effect, to give the public a chance to see how difficult it would be to enforce.
 ''It's just an easier case to make,'' he said. ''I just think that law enforcement officers are going to have a terribly difficult time applying this law in a constitutional way.''

HEADLINE: A Web Site That's Not Afraid to Pick a Fight

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MASCIA

 BODY:
When Jon Stewart announced on the June 29 episode of ''The Daily Show'' that ''Jezebel thinks I'm a sexist,'' some viewers may have been wondering: who exactly is Jezebel?
 At least a million and a half people can answer that question; that's how many visited the site, a women's interest blog, last month. Mr. Stewart's comment was a response to Jezebel's recent report on claims by women who say they faced a sexist environment when they were ''Daily Show'' writers and correspondents. The post garnered more than 211,000 page views, over 1,000 comments and a sharp retort from 32 female employees currently with ''The Daily Show.''
 Jezebel began in 2007 as a postfeminist companion to Gawker.com, the New York media insider blog, and in some ways has eclipsed its sibling, capturing an impassioned female audience and recently surpassing Gawker in monthly page views. 
 And Mr. Stewart is hardly the first media heavyweight the site has taken to task. Jezebel also weighs in on the sexually predatory nature of the fashion business, skewers celebrities like Gwyneth Paltrow and Elle MacPherson, and chronicles the doctored photographs in fashion magazines in a regular feature called Photoshop of Horrors. Jezebel's audience is 97 percent female, and the site says it gets more than 37 million page views a month and about 200,000 unique visitors each day.
 ''In media, men are not a coherent sect,'' said Nick Denton, owner of Gawker Media, the parent company of Jezebel and Gawker. ''You go into a magazine store and see rows upon rows of women's magazines,'' but only a few men's magazines. With women, he said, ''there's a much clearer collective.''
 Jezebel's approach seems to be paying off. Advertising Age has called the blog ''one of the few genuinely intelligent repositories of media/marketing/fashion commentary/celebrity deflation.'' The site's advertisers, which typically pay $8 to $12 per 1,000 impressions, include The New York Times, American Apparel, Dentyne, Skyy vodka, Clairol, Starbucks, and premium and basic cable channels. (In contrast to magazines like InStyle and Vogue, which push expensive handbags, designer clothes, slimming undergarments and long-lasting lipstick.)
 Those advertisers are appearing on a site that is certainly cutting, and frequently incendiary. Jezebel did not become one of the fastest-growing sites in the Gawker family without making a few enemies. ''In its lifetime, Jezebel has received more complaints per year than any other site,'' said Gaby Darbyshire, Gawker Media's chief operating officer, adding that the posts ''that discuss subjects with critical commentary usually draw the hottest fire.''
 Jessica Coen, the site's editor in chief, said that forthrightness is not a ploy to attract advertisers, but part of the Jezebel attitude.
 ''We're absolutely not afraid to take on the things that need to be taken on, and we're not afraid to say things that need to be said,'' Ms. Coen said at Gawker Media's Manhattan offices on Friday, where two dozen writers, producers and technicians design, update and moderate content for seven of the network's 10 sites. ''That's the whole point.''
 Indeed, the morning after Mr. Stewart's on-air rebuke, Irin Carmon, the staff writer who contributed the original post, continued to hammer the show. And after 32 women who work for the show wrote an open letter in response to Jezebel's allegations of sexism -- they addressed it ''Dear People Who Don't Work Here'' and signed off with an expletive-laced suggestion -- Ms. Carmon defended herself in a follow-up post by pointing out that the show did not answer questions or make anyone available for comment when she approached Comedy Central before the original critique was published.
 Ms. Coen continues to stand by the post. Steve Albani, a spokesman for Comedy Central, said on Friday, ''The open letter posted earlier this week speaks for itself, and the show will have no further comment.''
 With 50 to 60 posts published daily, Jezebel offsets weighty topics with lighter fare. One popular feature, Midweek Madness, is a tongue-in-cheek dissection of the week's glossy tabloids; with all the chatter about celebrity pregnancies, the Jezebel staff sometimes refers to it as ''Unsolicited Uterus Update Weekly.'' Dress Code is a question-and-answer feature that functions as a sartorial Miss Manners; Beauty 101 provides inexpensive and practical alternatives to the cosmetic tips espoused by Vogue and Allure.
 Jezebel's founding editor, Anna Holmes, 37, worked at some of the very magazines Mr. Denton scorned, including both Glamour and Star under Bonnie Fuller. Charged with creating ''the Girly Gawker,'' Ms. Holmes sought ''an antidote to superficiality and irrelevance of women's media properties.''
 ''I felt disillusioned by magazines to a certain degree,'' said Ms. Holmes, who recently left Jezebel, ''because they perpetuate this insecurity factory and present solutions to the insecurities they just created.''
 A month after the blog's inception, Ms. Holmes struck gold when someone involved with the production of Redbook sent Jezebel the July 2007 cover image of Faith Hill before the airbrush was applied. The difference between the raw photo and the final cover is jarring: Ms. Hill's silhouette has been redrawn, under-eye lines have been smoothed out and one of her arms has been halved in size -- all unnecessary alterations, Ms. Holmes said.
 ''Look at the picture above, and tell us that Faith Hill is not gorgeous and vibrant just the way God -- not Photoshop -- made her,'' she wrote on the site. The ensuing controversy received national attention, officially putting Jezebel on the map and attracting a devoted fan base, one that is not shy about posting comments about past traumas like rape and drug abuse.
 Because readers are actively engaged with the content, ''Jezebel shows that not only are thousands of eyeballs viewing the site, but they are doing something,'' said Kelli Matthews, an instructor of public relations at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. ''They're leaving comments. They're interacting with each other.
 ''This helps people feel like part of the Jezebel 'community,' which only adds to the loyalty that the site enjoys,'' she said.
 Last week, Emily Gould, herself a Gawker alumna, wrote a highly critical piece on Slate saying that Jezebel's criticism of pop culture and ''righteously indignant rage'' are really just ''petty jealousy, cleverly marketed as feminism.''
 ''The easiest way for Jezebel writers to be provocative is to stoke readers' insecurities -- just in a different way,'' she wrote.
 But Ms. Coen says that Jezebel's audience is so loyal because its readers are not condescended to, but leveled with. ''It's great to see such a devoted audience,'' she said. ''You see that your work matters to people.''
 With Jezebel breaking more stories and garnering more unique visitors than ever before, ''Advertisers are no longer treating it as a cute new entrant,'' Mr. Denton said. ''This is Jezebel's moment.''

HEADLINE: The Dream Job, Out of Reach

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''A New Generation, an Elusive American Dream'' (front page, July 7) shines a light on the significant changes in the lives of educated, well-off, hard-working people who by all standards should be succeeding and are instead finding themselves struggling in wholly unfamiliar territory.
 Educated couples with good jobs provided loving homes to their children and promised them that they could be president one day, only to find that their efforts weren't enough. They did everything right by their children, only to watch them flail.
 And as children of this generation, we were always told to chase our dreams, that we could be anything we wanted to be, so why should we settle for less? Why should we major in something practical at a reasonably priced college instead of following our passions in theoretical studies with bills in the six digits? Why should we take any job when we've been groomed to believe that we can have the job of our dreams? 
 Who erred -- our parents for telling us we could have everything, or us for believing them?
 Heidi Kim New York, July 8, 2010
 To the Editor:
 I was always one of those top-of-the-class kids whom everyone loved to hate but who everyone also assumed was destined to succeed.
 I finished graduate school in August 2007, briefly taught English abroad and landed back in Washington about two years ago, looking for work. In the last couple of years, I've worked hard to gain experience -- in administrative positions, as a tutor, as a freelance writer and so forth. But I've never held a paying job in my field -- international human rights and welfare -- and I would willingly have taken such a job for $30,000 a year.
 I know a lot of other incredible young people in situations like mine.
 Many readers, in the comments on your Web site, criticized Scott Nicholson for expecting too much in his job search. But while there may be some millennials deserving of such criticism, there are many more of us who ask, for the time being, for little more than jobs that take our brains out for a jog at least a few times a day and offer us a modicum of personal fulfillment.
 We'll hold off on wanting the manicured lawns and white picket fences until later, if we'll ever want them at all. For us, for now, the dream is simply to keep our feet moving, step by step, along the basic pathway to eventual success.
 And yes, for many of us, that dream is proving elusive.
 Arielle K. Eirienne Washington, July 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Unfortunately, it sounds as if the ''American dream'' to which the article refers is a new one based on privilege and entitlement.
 I don't think the dream is gone. I just think that well-meaning parents who continue to pay their son's cellphone bill and rent leave their son with no incentive to realize and appreciate that a $40,000-a-year job offer after two years of unemployment is what many Americans would call a dream come true.
 Vivian Todini Brooklyn, July 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Instead of taking an entry-level job at $40,000 a year, Scott Nicholson turned it down in search of something more corporate. As a 2007 honors graduate of Skidmore College (on the eve of the recession), I entered the work force as a foreclosure intervention counselor making barely more than $26,000 a year -- work that was far from ideal.
 Over the course of the last three years I have changed my ''career'' twice. In each case, the work at my ''dead-end job'' provided immense resume value and I got job offers within a few days. I have even used the experience and connections I gained from my ''dead-end job'' to start two businesses, grant-writing and publishing poetry pamphlets.
 The tragedy has been that we, as a generation, were led to believe that job security and high earnings would fall into our lap. I have had to prove my own worth and dedication in this economic climate, and I wish the absolute best for all my fellow recent graduates and my many friends who still struggle to find their way.
 Daniel Schrager Holyoke, Mass., July 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 As an executive recruiter in the financial services industry in New York City, I would call the outlook for this new generation an American nightmare. I see hundreds of resumes every week from young men and women graduating from college, some with advanced degrees, and some with terrific experience in the Peace Corps and other worthwhile volunteer services, and they all face the same dilemma: no jobs.
 As your article points out, there are many young people who have dropped out of the search for a decent well-paying job, and some are severely depressed and caught in a vise between parental reproach and peer pressure from those who have landed good jobs.
 When asked by young college graduates what to do, I suggest graduate school, volunteer organizations or unpaid internships with companies in industries in which they are interested. Anything these young people can do to make themselves stand out from what has become an ever-increasing legion of job seekers may be the key to success in finding a job and restoring their sense of confidence and self-worth.
 Henry A. Lowenstein New York, July 7, 2010
 To the Editor:
 A friend once referred to ''the lost generation'' as she watched uncomfortably while her daughter, a law school graduate, found herself unemployed and, for a short period, back home. It is a distressing time for the older generation as we watch the dreams of our young being deferred and hope that they are not permanently destroyed.
 I am a parent of two children in their 20s. I have witnessed a number of their friends get stressed over remaining in jobs that were a bad fit because of fear of the alternative. Others have decided that the anguish of being in the wrong workplace is ultimately just not worth it. They now are either in their childhood bedrooms, looking for something that makes sense, or seeking the shelter of a further degree, hoping they find a different economic environment down the road.
 Next year, my daughter completes her graduate education. I hope that all her hard work will result in a job that is both satisfying and pays the bills. It is not too much to wish for, but with an ''elusive American dream'' I recognize that it is something that she, like so many others, could find just out of reach.

HEADLINE: Waiting Lists for the AIDS Drug Assistance Program

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Your report about growing waiting lists for the federal AIDS Drug Assistance Program (''Slump Cripples Aid for Drugs to Treat H.I.V.,'' front page, July 1) is deeply troubling to me. 
 As a member of the Florida Senate, I know that legislators from both parties worked diligently during our state's legislative session this spring to ensure that we adequately financed our share of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program.
 Nearly 18,000 Floridians rely on this program for lifesaving antiretroviral drugs, which can cost thousands of dollars a month. Thanks to increased availability of these drugs through the program, we have seen a significant decrease in AIDS-related illness and death in our state.
 Unfortunately, the economic downturn has forced more people to turn to government for help with their H.I.V. medication. As a result, we now have close to 400 Floridians on the waiting list for the program, and other states are likewise seeing more applications for AIDS drug assistance.
 I will continue to work with Gov. Charlie Crist and my colleagues in the Florida Legislature to ensure that we provide our state share of financing for the program. I likewise call on the Obama administration and Congress to make sure that sufficient federal money is available, so that all patients on waiting lists receive H.I.V. medications.
 In the richest country on the planet, where these lifesaving drugs are readily available, this is nothing short of a moral imperative.
 Nan Rich Sunrise, Fla., July 1, 2010
 The writer is vice chairwoman of the Health and Human Services Appropriations Committee in the Florida Senate.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Plan to Remove Sheridan Expressway Gains Momentum

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
For more than a decade, a plan pushed by some South Bronx residents and transportation advocates has sat on the fringes of the State Transportation Department's to-do list, in part because it would be a radical undoing: tearing down the Sheridan Expressway.
 Although the plan has no real precedent in New York, advocates recite the benefits. They say it would ease traffic, improve neighborhood life and right a decades-old wrong committed by the master planner Robert Moses of building an unnecessary highway. 
 As other proposals for the Sheridan have been tossed aside, the idea to tear it down has improbably progressed to the center of the state's rethinking of the highway, which runs only a mile and a quarter long between the Cross Bronx and Bruckner Expressways. 
 In the process, the Sheridan, a reliable thoroughfare for truckers and an eyesore for Hunts Point residents, has become something else: a battleground in a national fight to take urban spaces back from the automobile.
 ''We're rolling back the freeway system,'' said John Norquist, president and chief executive of the Congress for a New Urbanism, a group based in Chicago that promotes walkable cities. He pointed to Portland, Ore.; San Francisco; and Milwaukee, where he was mayor, as cities that have removed highways running through urban areas.
 Mr. Norquist said the Sheridan was ''a big important example because it's in New York and it's very visible; it would inspire other people that are trying to do the same thing.''
 State transportation officials have been studying the Sheridan for years. They have narrowed the field of proposals to three, including a plan to ''demap'' the roadway, which would probably lead to its removal.
 On Tuesday, officials will release long-awaited results of a study of the traffic implications for keeping and removing the Sheridan. While no final decision is expected, the report could presage the road's fate.
 ''We realize that we can't just look at the highway facility itself; we need to look at the impact of a highway through the community it runs through,'' said Phillip Eng, the city's regional director of the State Transportation Department. ''It needs to focus on not just moving traffic.''
 The Sheridan carries roughly 50,000 vehicles a day, according to state officials. It provides a route for truckers to reach the major food distribution center in Hunts Point but also acts as a physical barrier between local residents and the Bronx River.
 Removing the Sheridan would open up 13 acres of open space along the river, land that advocates want to connect with some 15 other acres of service roads and riverfront property to create 1,200 affordable housing units, commercial and industrial space, and amenities like playgrounds, swimming pools and soccer fields. 
 ''This proposal is really rooted in the environmental justice battles that low-income communities have been fighting for decades,'' said Joan Byron of the Pratt Center for Community Development, a member of the campaign to remove the Sheridan. ''If you look at globally competitive cities, they're all looking at the spaces they gave over to highways decades ago, and they're rethinking those decisions.''
 In contemplating Mr. Moses' legacy, the Sheridan stands as more an asterisk than a triumph. It was conceived as cutting across the northeastern Bronx, but local opposition foiled the plan because the road would have gone through part of the Bronx Zoo. 
 Still, removing the Sheridan would be a bold decision; after all, it received a $27 million upgrade in 2004. 
 ''The Sheridan, physically, is really a new highway,'' said Sonia Pichardo, a State Transportation Department official. 
 The last major removal of a New York City highway was of elevated portions of the West Side Highway, most of which were removed in stages from 1976 to 1989. (In 1973, a truck fell through the highway at Gansevoort Street.)
 The Southern Bronx River Watershed Alliance, a coalition of Bronx and citywide environmental, housing and transportation groups, say the Sheridan, no matter its condition, is unnecessary. It links two highways, the group points out, that already intersect to the east.
 The plan to remove the highway proposes new ramps from the Bruckner that would improve access to the Hunts Point market. A plan to keep the Sheridan also calls for new ramps from the Bruckner to the market but seeks to preserve the Sheridan as an alternative to other traffic-clogged highways. A third plan essentially keeps the highway as it now stands. The state has been evaluating the traffic implications of all three plans since 2008. 
 For the thousands of truckers who pass through Hunts Point every night, improving the highway is seen as far more essential than a desire for open space. 
 ''Eliminating the Sheridan would bring things backwards a bit and make it worse,'' said Matthew D'Arrigo, a third-generation produce distributor and co-president of the Hunts Point Terminal Produce Cooperative Association. ''The job is to try and fix the situation, not to make a park. This is about highway stuff and traffic.''
 Mr. D'Arrigo said that even if the new route added just a few minutes of time to truckers' trips to and from the market, ''a few minutes of truckers' time on a bad day will stifle the entire community.''

HEADLINE: BATS: In Braves' Infante, Even Utility Players Have All-Star

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER and ALAN SCHWARZ

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- When Phillies Manager Charlie Manuel picked Omar Infante for the National League All-Star team, it was one of the most puzzling choices in the game's history. Infante was not even an everyday player. That day, July 4, he pinch-hit for Atlanta and struck out to end the game.
 ''I felt sad, because I see on TV a lot of people don't like it, because I don't have the numbers,'' Infante said on Tuesday, remembering his selection. ''A lot of good players have the numbers and aren't here. I didn't know what to say, because I can't say no. The manager said yes, so I've got to go to the All-Star Game.'' 
 Infante thanked Manuel before the Braves' next game, in Philadelphia. Manuel replied by saying he enjoyed watching Infante play, and told him not to apologize for his spot. Manuel was instructed to take someone who could play multiple positions to utilize a new rule in which one player can re-enter the game.
 ''Hey,'' Manuel told Infante, ''you're good.''
 Infante's own manager, Bobby Cox, used him as a starter in each of the Braves' next six games. Infante, who started in left field, right field and at third base, responded by going 13 for 28 to raise his average to .332. He said the grumbling over his selection motivated him. 
 ''I think so, yeah,'' Infante said. ''It was like, 'Omar, you're going to the All-Star Game; you have to have more numbers.' I played more, and I hit good. That made me excited and happy.'' 
 Infante, 28, has started at every outfield position and three infield positions (not first) since beginning his career with Detroit in 2002. His selection became less controversial after Manuel revealed his reasoning, and can now be viewed as a victory for an overlooked utility man.
 ''It's not easy,'' Infante said. ''You have to practice every position every day, because you have to be ready. Maybe I've opened the door for utility players, because I'm here. That's why I feel good.''
 A FAMILIAR VOICE As he does before every at-bat at Yankee Stadium, Derek Jeter will use a recording of Bob Sheppard announcing his name when he comes to bat at Tuesday's All-Star Game. Sheppard, the Yankees' public-address announcer from 1951 to 2007, died on Sunday at 99.
 ''He was as much a part of our organization as any player, as a part of the whole experience of going to Yankee Stadium,'' Jeter said Monday. ''Every player got a thrill out of hearing the way he says your name. It's almost like a sign that you made it, to have Bob Sheppard announce your name.''
 NEW TEAM, SAME GOAL Cliff Lee made all but one of his starts in the first half for the Seattle Mariners, but he is here representing the Texas Rangers, who acquired him in a trade last Friday. Lee starred late last season for the Phillies, who traded him in December and now could use another pitcher for the stretch drive. Lee was asked if he took any satisfaction in how much the Phillies miss him.
 ''That's not up to me to say; that's up to the media,'' Lee said. ''I loved my time in Philadelphia. I've been pretty open about that. I loved it there, and it has nothing to do with the management and the decisions they make. It had to do with the manager and the coaches and the guys that were on the field every day.''
 Now that he is back in first place with the Rangers, he will try to help them to the World Series, just as he did with the Phillies last year.
 ''I'm up for it,'' Lee said. ''Let's do it.''
 POSSIBLE REPLACEMENT On Sunday at the All-Star Futures Game, Desmond Jennings started in left for the United States team. On Tuesday at the All-Star Game, Carl Crawford will start in left for the American League. The symmetry is important to the future of the Tampa Bay Rays.
 Crawford, last year's All-Star most valuable player, can be a free agent after the season. Jennings, who is hitting .297 with 21 steals in 23 attempts for Class AAA Durham, is his probable replacement. Jennings, 23, said Crawford served as a role model for him in spring training.
 ''He was like the first one to the field,'' Jennings said. ''I would try to beat him there, and I would pull up, and his car would always be there. He works hard, works out every day, hits in the cage, gets his work in. It's more so the things he does than what he says.''
 Crawford, 28, started his major league career with Tampa Bay in 2002 and has not ruled out returning. Economics would seem to make that almost impossible -- Crawford can command a raise from his $10 million salary, and the Rays' payroll this season is just $72 million.
 NO VUVUZELAS ALLOWED Fair warning to all World Cup crazies: do not try to take a vuvuzela to the All-Star Game. 
 Jim Caple, ESPN's intrepid video humorist, went to Anaheim Stadium on Sunday to do a piece comparing the vuvuzela to Angels fans' favorite noise polluter, ThunderStix. As Caple's gear was inspected as he entered the news media gate, two security guards discovered the horn and sprang into action.
 The security guards said flatly that Caple could not take his vuvuzela into the stadium.
 ''Last year at the World Series in Philadelphia, I was doing something with carving a pumpkin,'' Caple said. ''I had a big knife that had blood on it because I nicked myself. So it had blood on it. And they let that in. 'C'mon, bring in a big bloody knife, but don't bring in a vuvuzela!' '' ALAN SCHWARZ

HEADLINE: A Geyser of Goods

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Panasonic makes the world's biggest 3-D television, a 152-inch, high-definition plasma screen that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars and is big enough to project life-size people.
 The company also sells no-frills refrigerators for poorer countries that come with extra space for pumped water and are priced at $170. 
 And between those extremes Panasonic has a vast catalog of other consumer electronics products in various price ranges, including four types of nose-hair trimmers and a separate device for ear fuzz.
 But how long can Panasonic keep trying to be all things to all consumers? 
 Analysts complain that Panasonic suffers from a case of the attention deficit disorder that they say plagues many Japanese consumer electronics giants. The affliction, critics say, has distracted management and ceded markets to more focused, agile players like the American company Apple and Samsung of South Korea. 
 After the empire-building glory years for Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s, as markets began to clog with cheap products and competition grew more intense, it became clear that the Japanese needed to concentrate on fewer products instead of trying to compete across hundreds of unrelated ones. 
 And yet, despite repeated company promises to ''sentaku to shuchu,'' or ''choose and focus'' -- an oft-heard corporate refrain in Japan in recent years -- many Japanese manufacturers have struggled to pare their operations and curtail overlapping product universes. 
 But Panasonic, shrugging off criticism that it is spread too thin, seems intent on even further product expansion -- despite having lost 103 billion yen ($1.2 billion) on revenue of 7.4 trillion yen (about $83 billion) in the fiscal year that ended in March. An investment bank, Macquarie, predicts that Panasonic's net profit will rebound to 91 billion yen for the fiscal year ending in March 2011, as the global economy recovers.
 ''It's true our business spans a wide area,'' Fumio Ohtsubo, the president, said in a recent interview at the Tokyo offices of Panasonic, which is based in Osaka. ''But it's not as difficult as you might think.'' In fact, the new drive by Panasonic to sell its wares in poorer countries like India and Indonesia has yielded early successes. So has its push into 3-D technology, billed as the next revolution in home entertainment in rich countries like the United States and Japan.
 But those efforts also increase entropy in an already far-flung product universe, each category with its own broad spectrum -- Blu-ray disc recorders to mobile phones, microwaves to massage chairs, rechargeable camera batteries to automotive fuel cells.
 At the same time, Panasonic is also shouldering the costs of its 400 billion yen ($4.5 billion) acquisition last year of Sanyo Electric, the world's largest maker of rechargeable batteries and a major manufacturer of solar panels. The purchase was meant to raise Panasonic's standing in the promising renewable energy field, but it also expanded its product line even further.
 ''We probably sell tens of thousands of products; we've never counted,'' said Akira Kadota, a Panasonic spokesman in Tokyo. ''Perhaps even a million?''
 Sprawl is by no means unique to Panasonic. Until recently Sharp, Fujitsu, Toshiba, NEC, Casio, Hitachi, Kyocera and Sony all made cellphones, while in some cases also building nuclear reactors and advanced business-network server computers. 
 Sony, the electronics and entertainment giant, perhaps best known for its televisions and the PlayStation game consoles, is also busy making car navigation systems and rechargeable batteries for laptops and other gadgets, while also running a movie studio and a financial services firm. That breadth, some analysts argue, is distracting Sony from major battles like the one against Nintendo and Microsoft in the lucrative gaming market.
 ''A large majority of tech companies in Japan have way too many businesses,'' said Atul Goyal, a consumer electronics analyst at the brokerage firm CLSA. ''These companies need to think: what are their strengths, what are their weaknesses, and focus on their core strengths.''
 Generally bucking the trend is Nintendo, one of Japan's most consistently profitable tech companies, which sells just two hardware products: the Wii home video game console and the DS hand-held. (Staying true to its game roots, Nintendo also makes traditional Hanafuda playing cards and Go board games.)
 An obvious move that many Japanese manufacturers could consider, favored by American conglomerates like General Electric, would be to sell off money-losing or marginally profitable businesses and cut excess workers. But large layoffs, considered a lapse of social responsibility, especially at larger companies, are still frowned upon in corporate Japan.
 There have been some steps toward consolidation. Last month, Fujitsu and Toshiba said they would combine their cellphone operations to better compete domestically against companies like Apple and its iPhone. Separately, NEC, Casio and Hitachi merged their handset operations.
 But Panasonic, with 385,000 employees worldwide, continues to push forward on all fronts. 
 Its revamped business strategy, presented to analysts in May, charts a three-year course. Panasonic is aiming for a 330-billion-yen expansion of sales in emerging markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China, and plans to reach 1 trillion yen ($11 billion) from those markets in 2013. 
 And over all, Panasonic means to increase annual sales to 10 trillion yen ($112 billion) in 2013, which would be up 35 percent from its most recent fiscal year. 
 ''We have high expectations for emerging markets,'' said Mr. Ohtsubo, the president. ''Our focus will be on increasing overseas sales.'' 
 To tailor products to local needs, Panasonic says it has conducted ''lifestyle research'' in various emerging markets. After visiting Indonesian households, for example, the company designed a refrigerator with extra space for the pumped water that families often store in bottles, as well as a dedicated shelf for medicines and cosmetics that are often stored chilled alongside fruits and vegetables.
 To drive down costs, Panasonic also eliminated a separate freezer compartment, which simplified manufacturing and cut down on parts, to achieve that $170 price tag for the standard model. 
 At the opposite end of the pricing spectrum, Panasonic has been pushing its 3-D plasma TVs, rushing early models to market in the United States in March, on the heels of the flat-panel market leader, Samsung. 
 Mr. Ohtsubo said that brisk sales had prompted Panasonic to raise its internal target for 3-D TV sales to a million units, up from 700,000, in the first year. A 50-inch 3-D plasma TV bundled with a Blu-ray player and glasses costs $2,900. 
 But 3-D vision is not the same as a strategic focus, as is evident in Panasonic's development efforts in other product categories -- like its new Three-Star Bistro microwave, which comes with a new setting that lets users grill frozen fish and meat without defrosting, and which Panasonic says is a first. 
 Impressive feat -- or dilettantish distraction? Depends on your perspective. 
 ''In terms of technological potential and breadth, we're on top,'' says Mr. Ohtsubo.
 But some others are not sure it is a sustainable strategy. 
 ''When resources are limited, it's important to ask, what do you really want to commit to?'' said Michiko Kakiya, a Tokyo-based technology analyst for Macquarie, the investment bank. ''It is important to start choosing.''

HEADLINE: Outside The Casino

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The hustlers and high rollers at Wall Street's gaming tables are starting to feel lucky again.
 Hiring is beginning to pick up in the very sector that led the country to the edge of a depression. An article on the front page of The Times on Sunday noted that this turnaround ''underscores the remarkable recovery of the biggest banks and brokerage firms since Washington rescued them in the fall of 2008, and follows the huge rebound in profits for members of the New York Stock Exchange, which totaled $61.4 billion in 2009, the most ever.''
 The hustlers and high rollers are always there to skim the cream, no matter what's happening in the real world of ordinary American families. 
 In a column that was published a few days before Christmas 2007, the very month that the great recession began, I wrote about the record-breaking seasonal bonuses being handed out on Wall Street: an obscene $38 billion, the highest total ever. The subprime mortgage debacle was already upon us and the economy was sinking like a stone, but the casino crowd was celebrating as never before. ''Even as the Wall Streeters are high-fiving and ordering up record shipments of Champagne and caviar,'' I noted, ''the American dream is on life support.''
 The fattest of the fat cats live in a perpetual heads-I-win, tails-you-lose environment. But if you step outside the Wall Street casino, you'll notice that things aren't going too well in the rest of the country. More than 14 million Americans are out of work, and nearly half of them have been jobless for six months or longer. The unemployment rate for black Americans is 15.4 percent.
 School districts across the country are taking drastic steps to cope with collapsing budgets: firing personnel, increasing class sizes, cutting kindergarten and summer-school programs and, in some cases, moving to a four-day school week. The Associated Press, in a demoralizing report, recently noted: ''As the school budget crisis deepens, administrators across the nation have started to view school libraries as luxuries that can be axed rather than places where kids learn to love reading and do research.''
 What a country. We'll do whatever it takes to make sure the bankers keep living the high life and swilling that Champagne while at the same time we're taking books out of the hands of schoolchildren trying to get an education.
 I'm no friend of the deficit hawks, but the staggering amounts of money we've been spending for the past several years have not benefited the people most in need of help and have not laid the foundation for a more secure economy going forward. We've handed over unconscionable tax breaks to the very rich (you can see the Prada paraders high-stepping along Fifth Avenue in their million-dollar flip-flops) and countless billions to the private contractors brazenly feeding off the agony of the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. 
 (Sunday's paper also had an article about six more American G.I.'s killed in Afghanistan.)
 What's needed is the same sense of urgency about helping struggling families and putting people back to work as the Bush and Obama crowds showed when the banks were about to go bust. That sense of urgency is always missing when it's ordinary people who are in trouble. 
 Millions of Americans are stuck in an economic depression. Several million have either lost their homes to foreclosure during the recession or are in imminent danger of losing them. The long-term unemployed are facing painful daily choices on such basic matters as whether to buy food or refill needed prescription medication or pay electric bills to keep the lights on.
 Back in February, The Times's Peter Goodman wrote about the new poor, ''people long accustomed to the comforts of middle-class life who are now relying on public assistance for the first time in their lives -- potentially for years to come.''
 There can be no real national recovery with so many millions of people in such deep economic distress. We can pretend that we're locked in some kind of crisis of confidence, that if only people felt better about themselves and the economy then they'd start spending again. This is a variation on the ''mental recession'' lunacy spouted by Phil Gramm, John McCain's top economic adviser during the presidential campaign.
 People who are out of work and deeply in debt don't have any money to spend. The only way to get real money back into their wallets and bank accounts (and thus back into the economy) is to get them back to work.
 With our help, the banks and Wall Street have done fine. Better than they had any right to expect. It's the ordinary folks outside the casino, in the real world, who are still in desperate need of help. But in a society of, by and for the rich, that help will be a long time coming.

HEADLINE: Israeli Military Finds Flotilla Killings Justified

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Diyarbakir, Turkey.

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- An Israeli military investigation into its naval takeover of a Gaza-bound flotilla six weeks ago found that it was plagued by errors of planning, intelligence and coordination but that the killings of nine Turks on board were justified, according to an official summary of the findings released Monday. 
 Giora Eiland, a retired major general who led the inquiry, presented his classified findings to the military chief of staff; they were not released to the public. But a statement issued by the military said that the investigators faulted the military for not knowing who was on board one of the ships. A senior officer involved in the report said that at least 65 Turkish Islamic militants armed with metal sticks and knives were on the flotilla's main ship, and had vowed to fight any effort by the Israeli Navy to board. 
 The scuffles that ensued led to Israeli commandos shooting the nine Turks, including one with dual Turkish-American citizenship. 
 ''The team concluded that not all possible intelligence gathering methods were fully implemented and that the coordination between Navy Intelligence and the Israel Defense Intelligence was insufficient,'' the report's official summary said. ''The team also pointed out that the anticipated level of violence used against the forces was underestimated.''
 The investigators praised the commandos who rappelled onto the main ship from helicopters, saying that they ''operated properly, with professionalism, bravery and resourcefulness.'' They called the use of live fire justified. No dismissals were publicly recommended, but officers said some demotions or dismissals might occur.
 The military's investigation, carried out by eight officers, did not deal with larger policy issues like the legality or appropriateness of Israel's blockade against Gaza or its takeover of the six-boat flotilla in international waters on May 31. A second investigation, led by a retired Supreme Court justice and including two foreign observers, has just begun its work. Neither, however, seems likely to satisfy demands for a full international investigation by the Turkish government. Turkey has withdrawn its ambassador from Tel Aviv and threatened further steps unless Israel issues an apology and sets up an international inquiry.
 On Monday, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey stood by his country's demands. ''We will be a close follower of our expectations until the end,'' he said during a visit to Belgrade, Serbia, according to the online edition of Zaman, a Turkish daily with close links to the government. 
 Everything that happened on board the Turkish flotilla six weeks ago remains a matter of controversy -- who shot first, how aggressive the passengers were, how violent the commandos became, whether the action was justified in international waters. The cargo proved unquestionably humanitarian in nature -- hospital beds, medicines, clothing -- but the goal of the flotilla was to challenge Israel's authority over what goes in and out of Gaza. 
 General Eiland, a former national security adviser, said in his briefing that more ships might try to breach Israel's Gaza blockade and so lessons from what happened on the Turkish flotilla were important.
 In fact, a Libyan vessel arrived in the area of Crete on Monday, with its crew saying it was scheduled to reach Gaza on Wednesday. Israeli officials have vowed to prevent it from getting through.
 Israel created a blockade against Gaza, both by land and sea, three years ago, after Hamas, which had won elections the previous year, took full control of the Palestinian coastal strip. The goal of the blockade was to put pressure on Hamas, which rejects Israel's existence and was firing crude rockets at its southern communities. Hamas has held an Israeli soldier captive in Gaza for four years. Israel has thousands of Palestinian prisoners in its jails and also set Hamas leaders and militants as targets.
 The blockade, joined by Egypt, has suffocated the Gazan economy and barred people from coming and going except in medical emergencies, although food has always been let in. Following the takeover of the flotilla and the deaths on board, international pressure forced Israel to ease the land blockade. 
 Now the blockade is largely limited to the sea and to materials, like steel, that Israel fears could be turned into weapons by Hamas. There remains, however, intense international opprobrium because of the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza and the sense that the policy has done little to weaken Hamas.
 General Eiland's report finds that there was at least one gun on board because an Israeli soldier took a bullet in the knee that was not from an Israeli weapon. It also contends that Israeli soldiers most likely fired only after having been fired upon first. 
 ''All the shooting was either when the soldiers were in immediate danger of their lives or when they had to rescue fellow soldiers,'' said a senior official involved in the investigation, speaking under military rules of anonymity. He added that there were between four and six events in which Israeli soldiers were fired upon with live fire by those on board.
 Passengers aboard the flotilla have mostly told a very different story, with some witnesses accusing the commandos of shooting randomly as they came aboard.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Manages to Keep Its Winning Streak Alive

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Stocks in the three major indexes extended their gains for a fifth consecutive session on Monday, edging up in thin volume ahead of the onslaught of corporate reports that started with Alcoa. 
 The market was mixed through most of the day, but in the final minutes the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index managed to turn positive. 
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 18.24 points higher, or 0.18 percent, at 10,216.27. The S.& P. edged up less than a point at 1,078.75. The Nasdaq composite index rose 1.91 points, or less than 0.1 percent, to 2,198.36. 
 The market struggled for direction on Monday, coming off the heels of a 5 percent rally last week. Investors are taking stock of the beginning of quarterly earnings reporting, as well as the prospect new economic data later this week.
 Describing the day's activity as ''anemic,'' Stephen J. Carl, head equity trader at the Williams Capital Group, said that in the absence of any economic data there was little else to provide direction in the broader market. 
 ''Some of the industrials and materials were off most of the day,'' he said. ''Commodities were kind of mixed, nothing really leading it up or down. Everything is modest.'' 
 Copper, gold and oil prices fell. Materials, industrial stocks and health care shares were lower, while technology and utilities stocks held on to marginal gains. 
 Major corporations are expected to report earnings that show an increase over previous quarters, in part because of easy comparisons, with investors likely to study the outlooks for a sense of where the economy is headed. 
 ''We are actually in a market without a clear direction,'' said Joe Battipaglia, a market strategist for the private client group for Stifel Nicolaus. ''It is truly a trendless market.''
 The aluminum producer Alcoa kicked off earnings reporting after the market closed on Monday. Later this week, the technology giants Intel and Google will report results as will the financial giants JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup. 
 Analysts were likely to mine the company outlooks for clues as to the potential impact of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and economic activity in China, and for the pace of the recovery in the United States.
 Listless economic data in recent weeks has failed to provide the market with any clear picture. Recent indicators for retail sales, housing and gross domestic product have suggested that the pace of the recovery is slowing, even as investors are aware that one monthly data point does not make a trend. 
 While some crucial indicators are due this week, including trade, retail sales and consumer and producer price indexes, analysts and investors will probably see more inspiration from corporate data.
 ''It all boils down to how we all interpret the forward view, by sector, by industry,'' Mr. Battipaglia said.
 In what could be taken as a sign of confidence in the economy, several deals were announced on Monday. 
 The insurance broker Aon Corporationsaid that it would acquireHewitt Associates and would merge it with an Aon subsidiary in a transaction worth about $4.9 billion, consisting of 50 percent cash and the rest in Aon stock.
 Shares of Aon fell $2.72, to $35.62, and Hewitt soared $11.39 a share, to $46.79. 
 In addition, the health care company Johnson & Johnson announced that it would acquire a medical device maker, the Micrus Endovascular Corporation, in a cash-for-stock exchange worth about $480 million.
 Shares in the Apache Corporation fell 3.2 percent as news reports emerged that it was in talks to buy some of BP's major assets for at least $10 billion.
 At the close, shares of Apache fell $2.81, to $85.07. BP's American depositary receipts rose $2.71, to $36.76. Its shares listed in London rose even higher, up about 9.1 percent at 398.02 pence each.
 The Treasury's 10-year note fell 3/32, to 103 22/32. The yield rose to 3.06 percent, from 3.05 percent late Friday.

 BODY:
The Aon Corporation, the insurance brokerage company, said on Monday that it had agreed to buy the human resources specialist Hewitt Associates for $4.9 billion in cash and stock to expand its consulting operations. 
 The deal, assuming it is approved by regulators, is Aon's biggest ever and would nearly triple the size of Aon's consulting business. Aon is the world's largest insurance brokerage firm but trails its rival Marsh & McLennan, whose subsidiaries include Mercer and the Oliver Wyman Group, in the size of its consulting business.
 Aon will pay $50 a Hewitt share. That is a 41 percent premium from Hewitt's closing price Friday of $35.40. On Monday, Hewitt shares jumped $11.39, or 32 percent, to $46.79, while Aon shares fell $2.72, or 7.1 percent, to $35.62.
 Hewitt, based in Lincolnshire, Ill., is one of the world's biggest human resources consulting and outsourcing companies with more than $3 billion in annual revenue and 23,000 employees in 32 countries.
 Aon, based in Chicago, plans to integrate Hewitt with its existing consulting and outsourcing operations and create a new unit, Aon Hewitt, after the deal closes.
 Aon said it expected the dealwould save $355 million a year beginning in 2013, primarily from reducing back-office areas, management overlap and public company costs and getting more from technology platforms. It said the deal would help earnings in 2011 and 2012.
 Hewitt stockholders will receive $25.61 in cash and about 0.64 percent of a share in Aon stock for each Hewitt share. The total payment will be $2.45 billion in cash and 64 million shares.
 The deal is expected to close by mid-November.
 Gregory C. Case, Aon's chief executive, said in a conference call that the deal would help its expansion goals. ''As we continue to grow our business, this merger will give us a broader portfolio of innovative products and services,'' he said.
 Bill Bergman, an analyst at Morningstar, said Aon might have overpaid. ''The transaction reflects the favorable economics of combining commercial insurance brokerage and human resources consulting businesses under one umbrella,'' he said in a note to investors. ''But we are concerned about the price Aon is paying.''
 Aon has made dozens of acquisitions in recent years aimed at strengthening and reorganizing the company in the face of declining insurance rates and weak economic growth. It has more than 36,000 employees in over 100 countries.
 Russell P. Fradin, chairman and chief executive of Hewitt, will take on the same roles at Aon Hewitt.

HEADLINE: Alcoa Profit Up Sharply Even as Price Of Metal Falls

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The aluminum producer Alcoa posted a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit Monday and raised its estimate for global aluminum consumption, sending its shares up 3 percent in after-hours trading. 
 The company, whose results are often viewed as a bellwether of the United States economy, cited strength in several industrial sectors and raised its estimate for aluminum consumption this year, even as metal prices have been falling recently.
 Shares of Alcoa rose more than 3 percent in extended trade after closing at $10.87 in the regular session.
 ''It's constructive and it helps start the earnings season off on a positive note,'' said Brian Hicks, portfolio manager of U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio. 
 ''From the standpoint of Alcoa, they see the economy continuing to expand. It's robust enough that they have to increase their forecast for global aluminum production.''
 Earnings were $136 million, or 13 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $454 million, or 47 cents in the quarter a year earlier, the company said. 
 Earnings from continuing operations, which excludes one time items, were $137 million, or 13 cents a share.
 Revenue rose 22 percent, to $5.19 billion from $4.24 billion, Alcoa said.
 Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 11 cents a share and revenue of $5.05 billion, according to Thomson Reuters.
 In the quarter, Alcoa said there was a 1 percent increase in third-party prices for alumina -- the raw material for aluminum. However, that was offset by a 1 percent decrease in realized prices for the metal.
 Alcoa said there was strong revenue growth over the first quarter in several markets, in particular in packaging, commercial transportation and building and construction.
 ''The top and bottom line growth was driven by higher volumes from stronger end markets and continued gains from our productivity programs,'' the chief executive, Klaus Kleinfeld, said in a statement announcing the results. 
 ''Based on this improved end-market demand, we are raising our projection for aluminum consumption from 10 percent to 12 percent this year,'' he said.
 On a conference call with analysts, Mr. Kleinfeld said the biggest risk remained ''the volatility that could potentially come from financial markets.''
 In the last three months, the price of aluminum in London has dropped sharply as weak demand for cars, planes and construction, and uncertainty over the strength of the global recovery have weighed on the metal.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Gets More Power To Evaluate Banks' Risk

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal bank regulators have agreed to give the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation unlimited authority to investigate banks, clarifying the agency's power, which was in question during the financial crisis. 
 The F.D.I.C.'s board on Monday approved an agreement between the agency and regulators at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department. It spells out the F.D.I.C.'s authority to make special examinations of banks. It was approved 5 to 0.
 Federal bank regulators were widely criticized during the financial crisis for failing to signal high-risk practices before the institutions failed.
 The F.D.I.C., which takes over failed banks, has said it lacked access to information it needed to evaluate banks' risk.
 The Fed and two Treasury Department agencies, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, have primary authority to regulate banks. But the F.D.I.C. often serves as the backup regulator for banks, empowered to examine banks' condition and operations. 
 The new agreement was signed by the F.D.I.C., the Fed and the two Treasury agencies. It updates a similar accord that took effect in 2002.
 The F.D.I.C. has said that during the financial crisis, the 2002 agreement limited its ability to effectively assess risk at weakening banks and to put together strategies for resolving them after they failed. 
 Among other things, the 2002 agreement required the F.D.I.C. to conduct its special exams of banks at the same time as the periodic reviews by their primary regulator. The F.D.I.C. was blocked from examining banks that were deemed financially healthy by their primary regulators.
 ''The past financial crisis provided us with a strong and sober reminder that the activities of large banks are often very complex and opaque,'' the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, Sheila C. Bair, said before the vote by the agency board at a public meeting. ''The F.D.I.C. needs to have a more active on-site presence and greater direct access to information and bank personnel in order to fully evaluate the risks to the deposit insurance fund on an ongoing basis and to be prepared for all contingencies.''
 Since the start of last year, 230 banks in the United States have failed amid mounting losses on loans and the toughest economic climate since the 1930s. The failures have drained billions of dollars from the deposit insurance fund, which fell into the red last year. Its deficit stood at $20.7 billion as of March 31.

HEADLINE: After Attacks In Uganda, Worry Grows Over Group

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Scott Shane contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The deadly bombings in Uganda during the World Cup final have deepened worries among American authorities about another once localized Islamic group that is spreading its terrorism across borders, using a playbook written by Al Qaeda.
 The group, the Shabab, claimed responsibility for the coordinated bomb attacks that tore through festive crowds in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, killing at least 70 people, including an American aid worker. The synchronized nature of the attacks, a senior American official said Monday, bore the hallmarks of a Qaeda strike, suggesting that the Shabab got support or at least inspiration from Al Qaeda and its affiliates in East Africa.
 Analysts and officials said the emergence of the Shabab on the world stage fit a pattern of localized Islamic militant groups that have been able to mount sophisticated operations farther and farther afield, including the attempt by a Qaeda-linked group to blow up a plane on its way to Detroit on Dec. 25. The bombings also illustrate how the region has become a hive of Islamic militancy, complicating the efforts of the United States, which has thrown its support behind Somalia's embattled transitional government. 
 ''This was a localized cancer, but the cancer has metastasized into a regional crisis,'' said Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ''It is a crisis that has bled across borders and is now infecting the international community.''
 The Shabab have been in the cross hairs of intelligence and counterterrorism officials for years. But the group's growing force and alliances with a shifting array of Somali warlords has posed a constant, vexing challenge for the Obama administration's efforts to bolster Somalia's weak government and stabilize the country. Last year, after what a senior administration official described as a fierce internal debate, President Obamahalted American food aid to Somalia after evidence mounted that the Shabab was siphoning some of the aid for its operations.
 The group has also recruited young fighters from the frustrated ranks of Somali immigrants in the United States. In October 2008, a Minneapolis teenager, Shirwa Ahmed, became the first confirmed American suicide bomber, when he drove a car laden with explosives into a compound in northern Somalia. He had traveled to Somalia and was apparently trained as a fighter by the Shabab.
 Despite the group's foreign recruits, a senior intelligence official said the United States believes it is still mainly focused on fighting the Somali government and those who support it, rather than the West. On Monday, a spokesman for the Shabab threatened to single out another African country, Burundi, which, like Uganda, has sent troops to Somalia to help shore up the weak federal government.
 In drawing up a list of potential terrorist targets during the World Cup, the intelligence official said, an attack somewhere in Africa was high on the list. Given the continent's often porous borders and haphazard security, he said, it would have been relatively easy for the Shabab to send suicide bombers to Uganda. The group has conducted cross-border raids into Kenya with impunity for some time.
 But other terrorism experts said that running a clandestine operation in Uganda, which lies hundreds of miles away, on Kenya's western border, requires sophistication, as does pulling off simultaneous bombings, at a rugby field and an Ethiopian restaurant.
 The Shabab appears to relish its membership in the international brotherhood of jihadi groups. In 2008, it traded messages on militant Web sites with Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric now in hiding in Yemen, whom intelligence officials say had had a role in the attempt to blow up the Northwest Airlines plane to Detroit on Dec. 25.
 ''We would like to congratulate you on your victories and achievements,'' Mr. Awlaki wrote to the group, saying it provided ''a living example of how we as Muslims should proceed to change our situation.'' In a response, the group thanked ''Sheikh Anwar'' for his recommendations and noted that the ''enemies of Islam'' were directing more of their efforts to the battle for ''hearts and minds'' through the media.
 ''Al Shabab is emerging as one of these archetypal 21st-century terrorist groups,'' said Bruce Hoffman, an expert in counterterrorism at Georgetown University. ''Ten years ago, no one would ever have heard of them. These are not the kinds of groups that would have had the ability to operate across borders.''
 Mr. Hoffman said the Shabab had the ingredients to turn itself into even more of an international threat: a savvy communications operation; an expatriate Somali population from which to recruit; charismatic figures it could send out to attract followers; and a proven capacity, after this weekend, to operate in foreign countries. The Kampala attack, he said, might represent a bid by more ambitious members of the group to ally it more closely with Al Qaeda and Al Qaeda's affiliates.
 There are cracks in the group's armor, however. The Somali population has grown increasingly fed up with the Shabab's harsh brand of Islam, and the group's efforts to recruit in the United States seem to have faltered after it lured several young men from the Minneapolis area two years ago. Reports about life on the battlefield apparently chilled the appetite of some potential fighters, while officials said the F.B.I. warned the Somali-American community to keep an eye on its youth.
 On Sunday, Mr. Carson spoke to Uganda's president, Yoweri Museveni, and said he was confident that the president would not allow the attack to bully Uganda's government into withdrawing its troops from Somalia. A few members of the Ugandan Parliament have demanded a review of the peacekeeping force.
 The United States sent three agents from the F.B.I. to help the Ugandans collect evidence, as well as two Diplomatic Security agents to help in the investigation. There is a further F.B.I. team on call in Washington. ''The United States stands shoulder to shoulder with Uganda in the fight against terrorism,'' said the State Department spokesman, Philip J. Crowley.
 He declined to say whether the United States planned any other response. Despite the death of the aid worker, and five other Americans who hospitalized with injuries, officials said they did not believe the attacks were aimed at Americans.
 The United States helps with counterterrorism operations in the countries that border Somalia, officials said. But the root causes of the problem are much larger: widespread poverty, hunger, a crippled economy and the absence of a function central government for almost 20 years.
 Mr. Crowley said the United States would work with Uganda, Kenya, and other African countries to help stabilize the Somali government. But American officials said the Shabab were an outgrowth of a daunting array of other issues, including refugees, illegal trade in arms and other goods, and piracy on the seas off Somalia.

HEADLINE: For Tours, 2010 Has Been a Tough Sell

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
As CD sales have plunged over the last decade, the music industry has increasingly looked to touring for income. And for a decade the live market has grown significantly, with greater revenues posted each year on steadily rising ticket prices.
 But according to a new report, the weak economy is taking a toll on the concert industry. Pollstar, a trade magazine that collects ticket data from promoters, said sales were down as much as 17 percent for the first half of 2010, and that with some big cancellations and extensive ticket discounting, the losses will probably continue for the rest of the year. 
 Gross revenues for the Top 100 tours in North America were $965.5 million, down 17 percent from the same period in 2009, and the lowest midyear figure since 2005. The number of tickets sold was another five-year low, at 15.9 million, down nearly 12 percent from the first half of 2009. 
 The top touring act in 2010 so far is Bon Jovi, with $52.8 million, according to the report, which was released on Friday. Taylor Swift, George Strait, Black Eyed Peas, John Mayer and Tim McGraw placed high on the list, and the report notes that ticket sales outside the United States have remained healthy.
 The Eagles, Rihanna, the Jonas Brothers, Lilith and ''American Idols Live!'' are among the prominent tours that have canceled some dates this summer. Some promoters have blamed the economy for weak sales, but industry analysts have also said that the need to make money on the road has led artists to tour too often and set prices too high. (Plenty of cancellations and delays have happened for more conventional reasons, too: U2put off its North American dates to allow Bono to recover from back surgery.)
 After the report was published, the Eagles released a statement saying that Pollstar's data was incomplete. The report had put the Eagles at No. 33 on the Top 100 with $10 million in grosses, but the Eagles said their full figure was $48.7 million. If correct, that would put the band at No. 2, behind Bon Jovi but ahead of the double bill of James Taylor and Carole King (with $41 million). 
 In a statement Pollstar said that it was ''repeatedly promised the missing information on the Eagles, but ultimately it was not provided in time.'' 
 For years the concert industry has been able to keep grosses high despite sliding attendance by charging ever-higher ticket prices. From 1996, when the average ticket cost $25.81, prices rose steadily each year until 2008, when the average hit an all-time high of $67.33. But Pollstar's report suggests that artists and promoters will have to slash prices significantly to stay afloat.
 Last year the average ticket price fell for the first time in more than a decade, and so far in 2010 it has slipped again, dropping by 6 percent, to $60.77. That is at least partly attributable to ticket discounting in response to slow early sales, a strategy led by Live Nation, which cut service charges for many shows in June and has marketed discount packages aggressively; even if losing money on a discounted ticket, the company also profits from ancillary sales like parking, merchandise and food.
 Not all tours are selling poorly. Paul McCartney, for example, reached No. 4 on the list, with $31.6 million in sales for only seven shows that carried one of the highest average ticket prices on the list ($129.55).
 ''In the long term,'' the report concluded, ''the concert business will remain healthy because consumers continue to demonstrate a strong desire to see live music.'' It added, ''Promoters selling tickets to Lady Gaga, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber or Muse shows are not crying.''

HEADLINE: Real Estate Strategy Puts Schools First

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
When Ann and Jonathan Binstock started shopping for an apartment in Manhattan in 2007, their first call was not to a real estate broker. Instead, they hired an education consultant, to show them where the best schools for their daughter, Ellen, were. After the consultant suggested the most desirable zones , they chose a two-bedroom apartment near Public School 87 on the Upper West Side. Public records show it cost $1.975 million.
 Ms. Binstock said the family's apartment ''was a stretch financially.'' 
 ''We ended up buying the apartment that we live in now based on the schools,'' she added. ''All of our money is in our little two-bedroom apartment.''
 Now Ellen is entering second grade, and the Binstocks are finding that plenty of other parents shared their real estate strategy: P.S. 87 has become so overcrowded with students that, in first grade, Ellen had no gym class, and her lunch started before 11 a.m. It has a waiting list. The Binstocks heard that a neighboring school, P.S. 199, was also crowded, with its own waiting list.
 Families like the Binstocks helped raise the tide of New York real estate prices in recent years by bypassing the suburbs and, instead, paying premium prices for apartments near high-performing public schools in places like TriBeCa and the Upper West Side in Manhattan, and Park Slope in Brooklyn. Developers, in turn, built costly family-size apartments near the same schools, knowing they would draw parents hoping to avoid the cost of a private education.
 But there were never any guarantees. Schools fill up. Zones are altered by the Department of Education, which sometimes switches the blocks that each zone comprises. Children in New York City, after all, are guaranteed a public education, but not necessarily in the school that their parents want, or in the one that is closest.
 Building more schools goes a long way toward easing the problem, of course, but it is an expensive remedy, especially in stressed economic times. That is one reason the city often requires builders of ambitious projects to include a place that helps the public, like a school, in their plans.
 All of these issues are wrapped up in a struggle on the Upper West Side between parents like the Binstocks who want more classrooms -- many more -- and the developer of a new project who is offering to build a school that some say is not big enough. The issue -- and the emotional and financial repercussions that go with it -- resonates with families across the city.
 The parents are pushing Extell Development, which is in the process of getting approval for its Riverside Center Development, to build an even larger school than the one it has promised. The local community board plans to vote on this project, which includes the push for the larger school, on July 22.
 While the school may not even be completed for six to eight years, parents want it to accommodate the young families expected to move to the neighborhood during that time. They argue that a developer who profits financially from selling apartments to families who live there for the schools should chip in more.
 ''This overcrowding has been caused to a fair extent by overbuilding,'' said Noah E. Gotbaum, president of District 3's Community Education Council, which approves zoning lines for West Side schools, including the proposed Riverside Center school. ''This school has got to be big,'' he said. ''It's got to be paid for by the developer and it's got to be among the first buildings built.''
 Extell Development has already offered to build a 75,000-square-foot school for 480 students for children in kindergarten through eighth grade, according to a May 3 letter from Extell to the School Construction Authority. The developer would pay to build the ''core and shell'' of the school, which is standard, and the interiors and classrooms would be paid for by the School Construction Authority.
 Gary Barnett, Extell's president, agreed that schools had become a ''very important consideration citywide'' and that city-dwelling families valued schools as much as their suburban counterparts. But he said that the School Construction Authority was ''where we take our direction from.''
 Extell said it would build a school double the original size, as long as the School Construction Authority paid the additional construction costs.
 Parents say that is not big enough. They want Extell to build a school that accommodates six classes per grade or roughly 1,250 students, and they want Extell to pay for more of it.
 Rachel Laiserin, co-president of the P.S. 87 Parents Association, said that at her school the number of incoming kindergartners more than doubled, to 241 in 2010 from 93 in 2007. She added that these numbers were only going to grow, based on the growing presence of Gymborees and baby stores in the neighborhood.
 ''You literally see more strollers everywhere,'' Ms. Laiserin said.
 Jack Zarin-Rosenfeld, a spokesman for the Department of Education, pointed out that other schools in the district that includes P.S. 87 have not even been filled yet.
 ''When you look at the whole Upper West Side, you see some schools that are at capacity and some that aren't,'' he said. ''It's important that we effectively use the space we already have.''
 But Joe Fiordaliso, the father of two girls, said the debate was more about the department delivering what it promised. His 4-year-old daughter, Camilla, is on the waiting list at P.S. 199.
 While Camilla has been admitted to another public school, the Fiordalisos say they hope she is accepted at P.S. 199, because her admission should make it easier for her 2-year-old sister, Rose, to go there. The family is renting a 900-square-foot apartment across the street from P.S. 199 until learning whether Camilla got off the waiting list.
 ''Has my family sacrificed to stay in this zone? Absolutely,'' Mr. Fiordaliso said. ''When we made the decision to stay in the city, we entered into a pact with the city. That pact was that my child would go to his or her zoned school.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Revises Rules for Drilling Ban

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued revised rules on Monday for a six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, replacing an earlier one that had been declared invalid by federal courts. 
 The revised moratorium would allow some drilling rigs to resume operating under certain conditions. To qualify, the rig's owners must prove that they have adequate plans in place to quickly shut down an out-of-control well, that the blowout preventers atop the wells it drills have passed rigorous new tests, and that sufficient cleanup resources are on hand in case of a spill. Industry officials said it would be difficult to meet those conditions quickly, which could threaten thousands of jobs. 
 The original moratorium, struck down late last month by a federal judge in New Orleans, halted work on 33 wells being drilled in water greater than 500 feet deep in the gulf. Other new regulations have slowed or stopped work on dozens of other wells in shallower water. 
 Mr. Salazar directed federal regulators to come up with interim rules by the end of August that would clarify the steps needed to resume operations. But he made clear that most rigs would remain barred from drilling in deep water through November. 
 His department characterized the moratorium issued on Monday as a refinement of the previous one that was rejected by the courts, not a retreat from it. 
 ''Like the deepwater drilling moratorium lifted by the District Court on June 22, the deepwater drilling suspensions ordered today apply to most deepwater drilling activities and could last through Nov. 30,'' the Interior Department said in briefing materials on the new ban. 
 ''The suspensions ordered today, however,'' the materials said, ''are the product of a new decision by the secretary and new evidence regarding safety concerns, blowout containment shortcomings within the industry and spill response capabilities that are strained by the BP oil spill.'' 
 The main lobby for the oil industry, the American Petroleum Institute, criticized the new order, saying it would worsen the economic hardship already being felt across the Gulf Coast. 
 ''It is unnecessary and shortsighted to shut down a major part of the nation's energy lifeline while working to enhance offshore safety,'' Jack Gerard, the association's president, said in a statement. ''It places the jobs of tens of thousands of workers in serious and immediate jeopardy and promises a substantial reduction in domestic energy production. No certain and expeditious path forward has been established for a resumption of drilling.'' 
 Mr. Salazar directed Michael R. Bromwich, head of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management -- the former Minerals Management Service -- to conduct public hearings and discussions with industry officials to make recommendations for ways to improve the safety of deepwater drilling. 
 ''I remain open to modifying the new deepwater drilling suspensions based on new information,'' Mr. Salazar said, ''but industry must raise the bar on its practices and answer fundamental questions about deepwater safety, blowout prevention and containment and oil spill response.'' 
 In New Orleans, Bob Graham, a co-chairman of the presidential panel investigating the April disaster on the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig, which left a well gushing oil and gas a mile below the surface of the gulf, said on Monday that the group would try to determine whether BP was operating in a riskier way than the rest of the offshore industry. 
 ''Was the Deepwater Horizon an outlier, an oil rig operating outside the normal standards of safety, or was it representative of other rigs?'' asked Mr. Graham, a former senator and Florida governor, before the seven-member commission opened its first public hearings on the disaster. 
 The answer, he said, will help guide the panel's deliberations and color its ultimate report to President Obama. The group has been charged with finding the root cause of the blowout and with recommending how to resume deepwater oil and gas drilling more safely. It has six months to complete its work and has only begun hiring staff and moving into offices in Washington. 
 Mr. Graham and the panel's other co-chairman, William K. Reilly, a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the commission would not weigh in on whether the deepwater drilling moratorium declared by the Interior Department should continue. But the commission spent two hours Monday afternoon talking with industry representatives about the conditions under which drilling might safely resume.

HEADLINE: Overhaul Gets 60th Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said Monday that she was prepared to support the final version of legislation to overhaul the nation's financial regulatory system, putting the Senate in a position to complete the bill by week's end. 
 Earlier on Monday, Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, said that he, too, was ready to approve the bill after pondering it over the Fourth of July recess. 
 Senate Democrats need the backing of at least three Republicans in order to advance the financial regulatory overhaul. Party leaders had thought they might need to wait until next week for Gov. Joe Manchin III of West Virginia to name a replacement for the late Senator Robert C. Byrd, who had supported the bill. 
 But with Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, already indicated her intention to support the measure, the announcements by Ms. Snowe and Mr. Brown made clear that Democrats would have the 60 votes needed to close debate and move to a final vote.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, had supported the earlier Senate version of the legislation but has not said how he would vote. Mr. Grassley has said he is concerned about some of the ways Democrats have proposed to pay for $20 billion in administrative costs for the regulatory bill. 
 Mr. Grassley voted in favor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program to rescue the financial system in October 2008, but against the economic stimulus measure. His aides have said that he has ongoing concerns about the way the TARP program was administered, and that he did not like the idea of using spending authority freed up by ending the TARP early to help pay for the regulatory overhaul. Mr. Grassley has said that any money left over from the TARP should be used to reduce the deficit. 
 In her statement, Ms. Snowe said the regulatory bill would help prevent future economic crises. 
 ''To ensure we avoid another financial catastrophe such as the one that plunged our nation into the worst recession since the Great Depression, it is imperative that we implement an aggressive overhaul of the American financial regulatory system,'' she said. ''And this effort must include real and substantial consequences for those whose reckless actions caused the crisis in the first place while guaranteeing the transparency and accountability of taxpayer dollars. After thoroughly reviewing the 2,315-page financial regulatory reform conference bill during the July 4 work period, I intend to support passage of the legislation when it's brought before the Senate for consideration.'' 
 Anticipating a delay, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, had planned to work on a bill to bolster lending, and provide tax breaks, to small businesses. 
 Under normal Senate procedure, it would probably take until Thursday to hold a final vote on the financial regulatory bill, unless Senate Republican leaders agree to allow a vote to happen sooner.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Small-Business Lending Is Down, but Reasons Still Elude the Experts

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chairman of the Federal Reserve urged banks and regulators on Monday to help the nation's small businesses get the loans they needed to create jobs.
 He also acknowledged that economists could not agree on why such lending has contracted substantially over the last two years.
 Small businesses -- those having fewer than 500 employees -- employ half of all Americans and account for about 60 percent of gross job creation. Federal data indicate that lending to such companies fell to below $670 billion in the first quarter of this year from more than $710 billion in the second quarter of 2008. 
 The reasons are unclear. Many entrepreneurs say that bank loan officers are denying loans to creditworthy borrowers as part of an overreaction to the bad loans of the last economic expansion and heightened scrutiny by regulators.
 But several economists paint a more nuanced picture, arguing that weak economic fundamentals and battered balance sheets have lowered the appetite for new lending. They say that demand could take years to recover. 
 The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, acknowledged the uncertainty at the start of a daylong forum on small-business lending at the central bank's headquarters.
 ''How much of this reduction has been driven by weaker demand for loans from small businesses, how much by a deterioration in the financial condition of small businesses during the economic downturn, and how much by restricted credit availability?'' Mr. Bernanke asked. ''No doubt all three factors have played a role.'' 
 In a broad outreach effort, the Fed held 43 meetings on the financing needs of small businesses, starting on Feb. 3 in Lexington, Ky., and ending on June 30 in Shreveport, La. Two of the meetings, in Miami and Davenport, Iowa, focused on Hispanic-owned businesses. One, in Denver, was centered on the Small Business Administration's guaranteed-loan programs. At yet another, in Detroit, the challenges facing auto industry suppliers took center stage.
 A collapse in the value of real estate and other collateral used to secure loans posed a ''particularly severe challenge'' to small businesses, Mr. Bernanke said. He recalled that a business owner at the Detroit meeting told him, ''If you thought housing had declined in value, take a look at what equipment is worth.''
 Some entrepreneurs have resorted to borrowing on their personal credit cards or from their retirement accounts, he noted.
 Banks, for their part, say that they have not so much tightened credit as returned to more traditional underwriting standards after being too lax, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged. 
 ''But, though some lenders said they were emphasizing cash flow and relying less on collateral values in evaluating creditworthiness,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''it seems clear that some creditworthy businesses -- including some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flows remain strong -- have had difficulty obtaining the credit that they need to expand, and in some cases, even to continue operating.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke's cautious diagnosis set the tone for the forum, which included four panel discussions. His view was echoed by two other speakers, Karen G. Mills, the head of the Small Business Administration, and Elizabeth A. Duke, a member of the Fed's board of governors.
 But the ambivalent nature of the discussion -- after months of listening and research by the Fed -- prompted expressions of frustration from several of those invited to the event.
 ''With all due respect for my banking colleagues, there is an apparent disconnect between the proclaimed 'business as usual' and the widespread problems with access to credit reported by small businesses,'' said Shari Berenbach, president of the Calvert Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Bethesda, Md., that makes loans to community development financial institutions that serve poor and working-class areas. Bank representatives maintained that meritorious borrowers were getting loans, and economists agreed that there was not much evidence of a broad refusal to lend. 
 Kevin P. Watters, chief executive of business banking at JPMorgan Chase, said the bank was taking a second look at borrowers that initially were denied loans, and was eager to make loans. ''We're really trying to get those healthy borrowers to invest again,'' he said. 
 William C. Dunkelberg, an economist in the School of Business and Management at Temple University, said surveys showed that capital spending was at a 35-year low and that companies were still cutting, not adding, inventory. ''Credit's not an issue,'' he said. ''Customers are the issue.'' 
 Even so, Mr. Bernanke's remarks suggested that the Fed was not sure why lending had contracted. He highlighted the particular importance of start-up businesses. Companies less than two years old accounted for roughly a quarter of gross job creation over the last 20 years, even though they employed less than 10 percent of the work force during that time, he said, citing new research.
 Zoltan J. Acs, an economist in the School of Public Policy at George Mason University, said that in Japan stagnation had stifled entrepreneurship, and that the United States might be following a similar path.
 ''What I worry about is, are we on a trajectory where start-ups are not going to recover?''

HEADLINE: Both Frail And Feisty, Fidel Castro Goes on TV

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- In one of his first public appearances since falling ill four years ago, a frail-looking Fidel Castro went on Cuban television on Monday night and warned in a near whisper that the United States was increasing the chances of nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula and Iran.
 Mr. Castro, who underwent emergency gastrointestinal surgery in July 2006, wore a flannel shirt and jogging suit and appeared at times to struggle to get his words out. But some of the feistiness he was known for in booming speeches that could stretch on for much of the day remained. 
 Reading from a sheaf of papers and gesturing in the air, Mr. Castro rattled off statistics, gave his view of history and appeared cogent as Randy Alonso, a government journalist who is close to Mr. Castro, lofted softball questions at him.
 Since undergoing surgery and turning over the presidency to his brother, Raul, Mr. Castro has slipped from the spotlight, but never completely disappeared. He has met frequently with foreign leaders, usually while wearing a jogging suit, and written regular commentaries for Granma, the Communist Party newspaper, on everything from the global financial crisis to the World Cup.
 But his Monday night appearance on ''Mesa Redonda,'' or ''Round Table,'' a public affairs program broadcast on Cuban television, was the first time since fall 2007 that Cubans could actually see and hear their once-omnipresent leader again. His attention to detail, even when it leaves listeners scratching their heads, is one thing that had not changed.
 The appearance came as Raul Castro, who formally took over the presidency in 2008 after two years as the country's interim leader, prepared to release dozens of political prisoners whom Fidel Castro had jailed in a crackdown on dissent in 2003. The first prisoner was released on Monday and placed on an airliner bound for Madrid, Reuters reported, with as many as a half-dozen others expected to follow shortly.
 The prisoners did not come up in the hourlong interview show on Monday, and it remains unclear if the Castro brothers agree on the release.
 Analysts said that it had always been difficult to interpret Fidel Castro's motives, and that remains the case. Just why he would make such an appearance now was anybody's guess. It followed the release of photographs over the weekend showing Mr. Castro greeting Cubans at a government-run scientific institute.
 ''It's more evidence that he continues to play a significant role,'' said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst whose 2005 book, ''After Fidel,'' examined the transition in Cuba's leadership. Mr. Latell, now at work on another book about the long, slow-motion transition in leadership, noted that Fidel Castro, although no longer president or commander in chief, remained first secretary of the Communist Party and thus continued to wield influence in the Cuban bureaucracy.
 As for his health, the television appearance seemed to put to rest speculation that Mr. Castro, who turns 84 on Aug. 13, was incapacitated or even dead. Former President George W. Bush, a fierce Castro foe, had expressed frustration that the ailing Mr. Castro continued to hang on. ''One day the good Lord will take Fidel Castro away,'' Mr. Bush once said.
 President Obama's words have been more restrained, but Cuba and the United States have nonetheless found themselves at odds on a number of issues.

HEADLINE: Paulson Likes What He Sees In Overhaul

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
''The one thing you're not going to get me to do is speculate.''
 That is what Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former secretary of the Treasury, told me when I called him last week and posed this question: If the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act had been in place during his tenure, would the financial crisis -- and the ensuing recession -- have happened?
 Given that President Obama is expected to sign the bill into law soon -- the deadline keeps slipping -- it seemed timely to ask the central government actor during the panic of 2008 what he made of the legislation and whether he thought, in practice, it would help us avoid another crisis. 
 Mr. Paulson, who was speaking by phone from his longtime home in Barrington, Ill. -- he recently put his home in Washington up for sale -- was initially reluctant to weigh in. He said he had not read all 2,000 pages of the legislation. But as he began talking, despite his insistence that he didn't want to answer my question, he did exactly that.
 ''We would have loved to have something like this for Lehman Brothers. There's no doubt about it,'' Mr. Paulson declared about midway into our conversation. 
 He was referring to a provision of the bill known as resolution authority, which would enable the government to unwind a failing investment bank or insurance company in an orderly way without forcing it into bankruptcy, thus avoiding the unintended consequences that a bankruptcy might create. Mr. Paulson had spoken publicly about the need for resolution authority in June 2008, three months before Lehman's failure, but did not believe it was politically viable to ask Congress for such powers.
 As he recalled those sleepless days in September, he suggested that had he had resolution authority, he would have been able to take over Lehman Brothers and the American International Group without the financial system crumbling. (Of course, there remains a running debate about why Mr. Paulson didn't seek to have the government bail out Lehman Brothers; he says he didn't have the powers.)
 I followed up by asking whether he believed he would have used the power to take over Morgan Stanley and then, perhaps, even Goldman Sachs. Would he have taken them over, too?
 He said that he believed that if the government had had the authority to take over Lehman and A.I.G., it would have stopped the panic endangering other firms. 
 ''It's hard to believe that winding down Lehman in an orderly way would have put more pressure on Morgan Stanley than what happened,'' he said.
 But Mr. Paulson said that even more than the resolution authority, he saw the legislation's creation of a systemic risk council as perhaps the most important aspect of the bill and crucial to preventing the next crisis. The council would give the various parts of government insight into what was going on elsewhere and the power to shut firms down or change practices that might put the system at risk.
 ''Some things would hopefully have been identified earlier,'' he said. While his critics have contended that regulators missed warning signs about impending problems, he said he had little visibility into certain businesses, like A.I.G., until it was too late.
 ''I doubt that there is any regulator that had all the information that would have allowed something like what was happening at the A.I.G. holding company to have occurred,'' he said.
 But to fully prevent the crisis of 2008, he said, the Dodd-Frank act would have needed to have been in place not just before September 2008, but years earlier. He suggested it would have had to have been in place even before he joined the administration in 2006 to have had any effect.
 ''We'd have needed the systemic risk regulator up and running by 2005 or so, to recognize the dangers of ever more lax underwriting and intervene,'' he said. His critics might say that his suggestions are a bit too convenient, but Mr. Paulson earnestly said that he and the Bush administration were blindsided by the development of the market for collateralized debt obligations and the importance of ''repos,'' or repurchase agreements, that kept investment banks afloat, often literally on a overnight basis.
 Still, he said he was frustrated that the legislation had focused little on policy, specifically housing policy. ''The root causes of all this are housing policies -- not just Fannie and Freddie,'' he said, referring to the giant mortgage companies. ''That hasn't been dealt with.'' 
 But he did not seem surprised by that development -- or lack of. ''There's plenty of blame to go around -- the banks, investors, rating agencies, regulators. But let's not forget policy makers,'' he said.
 One policy that Mr. Paulson was not so sure of was the so-called Volcker rule, which would largely prohibit banks from investing with their own capital and being in the business of hedge funds and private equity.
 ''Proprietary trading during the crisis that I dealt with wasn't what created the problems at WaMu or Countrywide or Wachovia or Lehman Brothers or A.I.G.,'' he said. ''We were dealing with another set of issues.''
 In the end, though, Mr. Paulson said that regulation on its own would not be enough to prevent another crisis. No, that will come down to people. 
 ''As I've thought about it, this is very people-driven,'' he said. ''A lot of this is about the people who have the responsibility for the regulation when there isn't a crisis and the people who have the responsibility during a crisis. Unless you believe that the big financial institutions were intentionally trying to blow themselves up, they were unable to spot a number of the issues.''
 He continued: ''I think it is asking a lot for regulators to be perfect -- because they won't be. But what you have here is a mechanism that gives regulation a much greater chance to be successful.''

HEADLINE: THE ONE AND ONLY; His Final Victory Is a Yankees Empire Restored

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- The Yankees had more All-Stars on Tuesday than any other major league team. They are the reigning World Series champions, with the best record in baseball. They have a gleaming new stadium in the Bronx and a thriving cable television network. Their empire is fully restored, the way George Steinbrenner wanted.
 Steinbrenner, 80, left the stage Tuesday, just as baseball prepared for its annual summer showcase. The principal owner of the Yankees since 1973, he was the second grand figure of the franchise to die in three days. Bob Sheppard, the public-address announcer at Yankee Stadium from 1951 to 2007, died on Sunday at age 99.
 Inevitably, their deaths will set a somber tone at Yankee Stadium for Saturday's Old-Timers' Day, one of many traditions of which Steinbrenner was proud caretaker. As demanding and meddlesome as he was in his heyday, nobody questioned Steinbrenner's reverence for the Yankees, who wore black armbands on Tuesday and will wear memorial patches the rest of the season. 
 ''I know he was controversial,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said. ''I know all the arguments. He was clearly a giant in this sport. After all, when he took over the Yankees, the Yankees were struggling for the first time. It was absolutely remarkable. I'll say this: Nobody loved his team more than he did.''
 Steinbrenner, who once invested in Broadway plays, always had a knack for theatrics. On the day of Game 7 of the 1985 World Series, between St. Louis and Kansas City, he replaced Billy Martin with Lou Piniella as manager. Five years later, on the night Piniella's Cincinnati Reds won the World Series in Oakland, Steinbrenner hosted ''Saturday Night Live.''
 On Tuesday, with the baseball world concentrated in one place, Steinbrenner's death had an added poignancy that resonated even with players who never knew him. The flags at Angel Stadium flew at half-staff, and a moment of silence was observed.
 ''It's kind of ironic that it happened on a day like this,'' said Ryan Braun, the young outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers. ''It gives everybody an opportunity to reflect on how great he was to the game and what he really meant to the sport of baseball.''
 Most of the Yankees' All-Stars did not know the hard-driving Steinbrenner of old. That persona faded a few years ago, as his health deteriorated. But those who knew him best held a news conference before batting practice Tuesday -- first Andy Pettitte, Alex Rodriguez and Manager Joe Girardi, and then, by himself, Derek Jeter.
 ''It's tough, because he's more than just an owner to me,'' said Jeter, whom Steinbrenner named the team's captain in 2003. ''He's a friend of mine. He will be deeply missed.''
 Jeter awoke Tuesday to a flurry of messages about Steinbrenner, and he said he was shocked. Jeter was planning to visit Steinbrenner in Tampa, Fla., sometime in the next two days. Jeter last saw Steinbrenner at the home opener in April, presenting him with his championship ring in the owner's suite at Yankee Stadium.
 ''I got a chance to tease him because he had an Ohio State ring and I told him to take it off now, and replace it with the Yankee ring,'' Jeter said. ''Those are the memories that you remember, the intimate moments.''
 Jeter first met Steinbrenner in 1992, when he was 18 and had just signed as the team's first-round draft pick. From the start, Steinbrenner made clear his expectations: ''We expect big things from you,'' he said. Twelve years later, when he had slowed a bit, Steinbrenner gave another newcomer, Rodriguez, the same greeting.
 ''He wrote me a note, and it was hand-delivered by a clubhouse kid, and at that point I got a little nervous,'' Rodriguez said. ''I still have this note. In the end, he basically said, 'I'm counting on you,' with capital letters and an exclamation point. So I think, to this day, we are still playing for him, not to let him down.''
 Steinbrenner famously challenged his players, doubting Girardi's ability to replace the power-hitting Mike Stanley as catcher in 1996, and urging a trade of Pettitte as he struggled in 1999. But the players often saw a softer side that surprised them.
 In his first spring with the team, Girardi explained, he and his wife were walking their bichon on the carefully manicured grass at the Yankees' complex. Girardi saw Steinbrenner and cringed, expecting a scolding. Instead, Steinbrenner sat with the Girardis and asked about the dog.
 ''That was the first time I saw that he wasn't everything he was painted to be; there was a gentle side to this man,'' Girardi said. ''But I have to tell you, one of his athletes walking a little white dog, I was expecting something totally different.''
 Steinbrenner was famous among players for gestures designed to help them meet his outsized expectations. Before playoff starts, Pettitte said, Steinbrenner would sometimes hand him Bible verses.
 ''He was always there to support you, but it was tough support, so I think sometimes the tough support doesn't get the limelight,'' Pettitte said. ''He expected a lot; he demanded a lot. He raised, I believe, the level of not only the Yankees' organization and what they want to do -- as far as winning championships -- but he's raised the bar around baseball for other teams to try to keep up and compete.''
 Today's generation knows Steinbrenner more as a benefactor than as the impulsive tyrant of the 1970s and '80s. His high payrolls have driven up salaries, and players relate to his competitive drive.
 ''Every player in here should be grateful for what he's done for the economic part of the game,'' the Mets' David Wright said in the National League clubhouse before the game. ''I think the most important thing is you respect him because he wants to do everything he can to win.''
 Steinbrenner was an old football coach who never accepted the idea that baseball teams play too many games to be undefeated. No Yankee better reflected Steinbrenner's mission than Jeter, who shared the notion that no season could be successful without a World Series title. 
 Early in his career, Jeter said, he was doubled off third base on a line drive. After the game, Steinbrenner yelled at him for the mistake. It did not matter that the Yankees had won. Steinbrenner had no tolerance for failure.
 ''That rubbed off,'' Jeter said. ''Whether it was the players, the front office, the people working at the Stadium, it didn't make a difference. He expected perfection.''
 Perfection is impossible, but Steinbrenner restored the culture in which the Yankees relentlessly pursue it. On the day he died, they were about as close as they could get.

HEADLINE: For the Heirs, the Big Test Will Be Building Upon Excellence

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON and RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
George Steinbrenner's legacy as the owner of the Yankees is secure. But can his heirs sustain it?
 In a way, his declining health and retreat from the limelight in recent years gave his sons, Hal and Hank, and his top executive lieutenants, Randy Levine, Lonn Trost and Brian Cashman, a dry run in a world without him.
 And the team has not flagged without his considerable ambition, skills and bombast. 
 The Yankees are still baseball's most valuable franchise and one of the most recognizable teams in the world. Even after Steinbrenner retired to Florida, the Yankees have maintained baseball's highest payroll, opened a new Yankee Stadium and won a 27th World Series.
 ''When Hal, Cashman and I did the Teixeira deal, obviously the Steinbrenner philosophy has not changed,'' Scott Boras, the agent for Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, said of their negotiations in 2008. ''With the cathedral for baseball that he left, his family has the foundation and economic platform to do that.''
 That is the way Steinbrenner planned it. In 2003, he discussed the possibility of stepping aside to let ''the young elephants in the tent,'' meaning his two sons and Steve Swindal, his former son-in-law. Hal, 40, is now the team's top pachyderm, his father's designated successor as the Yankees' managing general partner. 
 He is a quiet Steinbrenner, not given to his father's emotionalism or love of the limelight. Hank, his older brother at 53, seems to have inherited their father's grandiloquence
 In public appearances, Hal is humble and rarely says anything too quotable, but he is well informed and knowledgeable about baseball and running a team.
 ''He's a smart young man who's seen all the good things and other things and is certainly disciplined,'' said Harvey Schiller, a friend of George Steinbrenner's who was the chairman of the now-defunct YankeeNets, a joint sports venture with the Nets. ''He's been a businessman outside the Yankees in hotels and in other endeavors. He understands all the elements of running a business.''
 He continued: ''There aren't many things he isn't in control of; behind the scenes, not much goes on without him. He doesn't need to be guided by anyone.'' 
 Boras said that in his dealing with Hal Steinbrenner on the Teixeira deal, ''he evidenced that he was aggressive and did something within the lineage of the New York Yankees.''
 The heirs of a family-controlled business are often hard pressed to duplicate the success of a patriarch who is closely associated with the firm's image. The Steinbrenner sons may be no different.
 In addition to coming out from behind their father's shadow, they will have to fend off innovative rivals like the Red Sox, who have developed new strategies for winning championships. They will also have to resist calls from those seeking more revenue sharing from the wealthier clubs and try to keep salaries from escalating. At the same time, they must convince fans to pay for higher-priced tickets and suites at their new stadium. 
 ''They are hard shoes to step into,'' said Stan Brand, the vice president of the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues, the governing body of minor league baseball. ''But these guys were already running the team, so if there's any franchise that can make the transition, it would be them.'' 
 Hal, Hank and their sisters, Jessica and Jennifer, inherit a business with revenue flowing from the $1.5 billion stadium that opened last season and the enormously successful YES Network, of which the Yankees own 34 percent, and which some think is worth at least $3 billion on the open market. The network could become even more valuable when existing deals with cable, satellite and telephone companies expire and the subscriber fees jump substantially.
 According to Forbes magazine, the Yankees are the third-most valuable sports franchise globally, worth $1.6 billion. Manchester United, a soccer club in the English Premier League, is first at $1.83 billion, and the Dallas Cowboys of the N.F.L. are second at $1.65 billion. 
 The family also inherits a legacy of the patriarch's free-agent spending: the nine-figure sum the team annually pays into baseball's revenue sharing and the luxury tax pool. Although the extent of the family's estate tax planning is not known, Schiller said: ''George talked to me about it more than 15 years ago; clearly, the family is well prepared for whatever happened.''
 There is currently no estate tax, but Cheryl Hader, an estate lawyer, said in an e-mail message that ''significant estates resulting from deaths in 2010, such as those of George Steinbrenner and Texas billionaire Dan Duncan, will undoubtedly attract significant scrutiny as to whether these taxes will be reinstated retroactively. As a result, any type of planning that may have been done to take advantage of the current situation is not guaranteed to work.''
 A franchise without its symbolic leader is an altered business, regardless of a succession plan. Steinbrenner defined the Yankees in his image, whether magnanimous or cruel, generous or autocratic. Those who follow him will almost certainly try not to compete with his memory.
 Steinbrenner had become the Yankees' brand and the Yankees' brand had become Steinbrenner. Players and managers passed through, but Steinbrenner endured -- on the field, in his luxury box, being spritzed with Champagne after a World Series victory or wooing the free agent Reggie Jackson. 
 His decades in shipbuilding have nearly been forgotten, but his seven World Series championships are vivid memories, along with his feuds with players, manager firings, suspensions and Pattonesque world view.
 ''Losing a man like George cannot help but have an impact, but he set things up so that the Yankees organization will continue very well without him in the future,'' said Marc Ganis, a sports-industry consultant who worked on various Yankees projects. ''His stamp was on everything, even in the past few years.'' 
 Ganis said Hal Steinbrenner would surely follow his father's example as a businessman in many ways.
 ''I know they intend to follow his legacy and what they believe will be his wishes, but he won't be here to keep everyone in line,'' he added. ''The mythic figure of George Steinbrenner will only grow with time.''

HEADLINE: Imports of Consumer Goods Rise; U.S. Trade Gap Widens

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit grew in May to more than $42 billion, its widest gap in nearly two years, mostly because of a rise in imports of consumer goods, according to government figures.
 Imports rose to $194.51 billion in May, outstripping exports of $152.25 billion, the Commerce Department figures showed. The monthly report showed a trade imbalance of $42.26 billion, the largest since November 2008, when it stood at $43.8 billion.
 The deficit expansion exceeded the estimates of analysts, who suggested that companies rebuilding their inventories accounted for a large part of the increase in imports. 
 ''Under the surface it has been very good,'' said Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR Inc. ''Trade flow is growing in both directions. But how that will survive in terms of growth rates is the question.''
 Analysts said the outlook depended on whether consumer demand picked up in the months ahead -- an uncertainty given the shaky jobs market -- and how the economy fared after government stimulus expired.
 ''We need to keep a close eye on the inventory cycle and that is cooling off as an economic driver,'' Mr. Shapiro said. ''It is going to be more of a final demand story, and the signs are not particularly auspicious.''
 Paul Dales, the United States economist for Capital Economics, said his firm was revising second-quarter growth downward, to 3.5 to 4 percent, from a previous estimate of 4.5 percent, but would also take into account retail sales data due later this week.
 ''The May trade data showed that activity in the economy was strong in the first part of the second quarter, at least,'' he said. He added that an economic slowdown, including a slowing of government stimulus measures, ''will weigh on import growth in the second half of the year.'' 
 The seasonally adjusted figures showed that both imports and exports grew in May, compared with the previous month. Imports rose to $194.51 billion in May compared with $189 billion in April. Exports stood at $152.25 billion in May compared with $148.72 billion in April, the agency said.
 The largest category of import growth was in consumer goods. The United States imported $2.6 billion more in those goods in May compared with April. The seasonally adjusted figures showed increases of $2.2 billion in automotive vehicles, parts and engines, and $2 billion more in capital goods.
 The trade gap with China rose to $22.3 billion in May, from $19.3 billion in April. American exports to China rose 2.5 percent in May but imports jumped 12 percent from the previous month.
 Over all, exports of capital goods grew by $2 billion in May, while exports of industrial goods and services expanded by $600 million and consumer goods exports were $300 million.
 The latest trade figures come as economists weigh developments in Asia and in Europe, where sovereign debt troubles have dogged the economic outlook. 
 Mr. Dales said that capital goods exports were a good sign of investment spending. 
 ''One thing I did notice is that exports to Europe still seem to be pretty good,'' Mr. Dales said. ''Which is a point of interest given the fiscal crisis.''
 The trade gap with the countries in the European Union widened in May to $6.2 billion, from $5.7 billion. But Mr. Dales said it might be too soon to tell whether concerns over Europe's fiscal crisis and the prospect of austerity measures would factor into future United States trade data.

HEADLINE: As Everyone Else Has Discovered Brooklyn, So Have Hoteliers

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
Brooklyn is in a hotel-building boom, after decades in which the Marriott near the Brooklyn Bridge had the borough's lodging market mostly to itself.
 The new competitors include budget brands like Best Western, which has three locations in Brooklyn, and the Sheraton Brooklyn, which opened downtown in May. Over the last few years, Brooklyn has also welcomed boutique hotels like the Nu Hotel in Boerum Hill, Hotel Le Jolie in Williamsburg and Hotel Le Bleu in Park Slope. And Smith Travel Research, the hospitality research company, estimates that 40 more hotels are under construction in Brooklyn or in the planning stages, although some may never get off the ground if oversaturation becomes a concern.
 While Brooklyn's cachet is no doubt one reason for the boom, analysts say the main draw for developers is the same factor that has enticed bearded trend-setters and stroller-pushing parents across the river: lower real estate prices. 
 ''The biggest reason that we've seen development in Brooklyn is because the land economics are so intense in Manhattan that it's historically difficult to build there,'' said Sean Hennessey, chief executive of Lodging Advisors, a consulting firm in New York City.
 But Brooklyn's lower land costs come with several caveats. Mr. Hennessey said room rates were generally at least 15 percent below a hotel of similar quality in Manhattan, yet wages and many other operating costs were comparable. And Brooklyn is a less desirable location for the business travelers who are critical to the bottom line.
 ''The ideal hotel from an economic perspective is right next to six giant office towers,'' Mr. Hennessey said. ''Brooklyn does not have an office tower or corporate base the way Manhattan does.''
 Even so, there is little disagreement that Brooklyn is overdue for some fresh lodging options, and owners and operators of these newer properties say they are getting a mix of business and leisure travelers, including wedding guests and other small groups. Those business travelers represent a broader cross-section of the work force than the typical Midtown executive.
 ''We get a lot of bands at Hotel Le Jolie,'' said Todd Cahill, vice president of hotel operations for Globiwest Hospitality Group, which owns Hotel Le Jolie, Hotel Le Bleu and the three Brooklyn Best Westerns.
 Mr. Cahill said the Beach Boys had stayed at Hotel Le Bleu and the Neville Brothers at Hotel Le Jolie during the Fourth of July weekend, and that the Brooklyn Brewery, Urban Outfitters, Hewlett-Packard and Fujitsu were some of the companies that had accounts with his hotels.
 ''Some of their offices are in Manhattan, but they like the Park Slope area and being a block from Fifth Avenue,'' he said.
 Fifth Avenue in Brooklyn is not like Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, but for visitors who prefer being close to neighborhood restaurants, boutiques and friends or family members who live in Brooklyn, it may be more of a draw than Midtown's shops and crowds.
 Javier Egipciaco, general manager of the Nu Hotel, which opened in July 2008, said its location near the bars and restaurants on Smith Street had helped the hotel during the recession by attracting guests visiting friends nearby.
 ''People still get married, they still have their friends and family coming into town,'' Mr. Egipciaco said. ''Although we didn't get the rate that we would've liked, that did help keep us afloat.''
 Almost a third of the hotel's business comes from word of mouth in the community, Mr. Egipciaco said. Referrals are rewarded with ''neighborhood discounts'' of $60 to $80 off the hotel's rates, which are $179 to $399 a night.
 According to data gathered by Smith Travel Research, the average hotel rate in Brooklyn in May was $147, compared to $255 in Manhattan and $205 in New York City over all. Brooklyn's occupancy rate was 72 percent, versus 91 percent in Manhattan and 78 percent for the whole city. 
 That was the first month that Smith Travel had released data specifically for Brooklyn, said Jeff Higley, a company vice president. Previously, the number of hotels in Brooklyn was too low to meet the firm's threshold for disclosure. Smith Travel based its numbers on about 20 hotels in Brooklyn that shared their data. Next door to the 321-room Sheraton, Starwood plans to open in October a 176-room Aloft hotel, its less expensive brand aimed at younger and technologically savvy travelers. But the two hotels are located in downtown Brooklyn, in a less glamorous area than the brownstone Brooklyn neighborhoods where the boutique properties have settled.
 Although there are plenty of high-rise condominiums and rental towers nearby (many still not completely occupied), the area's retail options are mostly fast-food restaurants and discount stores, rather than the boutiques, cafes and restaurants that have made Brooklyn such a hot destination, first for residents and now tourists.
 Hoyt Harper, a senior vice president of brand management for Sheraton, said this location was convenient to transportation hubs and would be well positioned to attract Nets fans when the new stadium opened nearby in Atlantic Yards.
 ''We're two years ahead of the sports facility,'' Mr. Harper said, ''but we'll be in a great location to capture the business that brings to the market.''
 He also pointed out that downtown Brooklyn was undergoing a shift toward more residential development and that the long-range planning involved in developing a hotel sometimes meant getting in when the right opportunity presented itself.
 ''When you build a hotel, you're looking five to 10 to 20 years out,'' he said. ''As Brooklyn reinvents itself, we'll be in the heart of it.''

HEADLINE: A Mayor With a Full Plate

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- The Risky Business and the Manana, two shrimp boats with names that sum up much about life in this city, were on the lookout for oil in the waters leading into Lake Pontchartrain. 
 Watching them last Friday aboard the Power Nap, another shrimp boat involved in the response, was a group of BP and Coast Guard officials, unemployed fishermen, cleanup workers and Mitch Landrieu, the city's relatively new mayor. 
 Mr. Landrieu talked with almost fatherly pride about the steps his administration and the president of neighboring St. Tammany Parish had put together to block the oil, including a new kind of boom that was being deployed and a line of barges across the narrow strait that leads into the lake. 
 These efforts had mostly worked so far, though strong winds had pushed tar balls past the barges over the previous weekend. 
 It was another unexpected battle for the mayor, who took office just after the spill started and discovered far bigger problems with the city than he anticipated.
 ''The oil spill's much worse than we ever thought,'' Mr. Landrieu said. ''The budget's much worse, the dysfunction is much worse, the N.O.P.D. is much worse. But, you know, that's why I signed up.''
 During the short election season before his landslide victory in February and the long transition that followed, Mr. Landrieu promised to tackle a daunting agenda. He vowed to kick-start the stubbornly slow recovery from Hurricane Katrina and tackle the decay that dates back decades -- the high crime rate, the poor health of residents and the deteriorating infrastructure. 
 Then, on April 20, just 13 days before his inauguration, the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, about 150 miles from New Orleans. And so his first official act after being sworn in was to talk to President Obama about the oil spill.
 ''From the beginning, we've been triaging, responding to this catastrophic event and handling the other catastrophic event,'' said Mr. Landrieu, whose sister Mary is a senator and whose father, Moon, was the mayor 32 years ago.
 The other catastrophic event Mr. Landrieu was referring to is the city's finances, which he often compares to a gushing oil leak. After he took office, he discovered soaring overtime budgets in many departments, disastrously lax record keeping and a $67 million deficit, about twice what he had been led to expect before taking over.
 But the list of catastrophes goes on. The city's Police Department is so corrupt and ineffective, he said, that he formally asked the Justice Department to investigate, which it is now doing. The city still suffers from a chronic shortage of health care facilities since Hurricane Katrina, as well as glut of blighted and abandoned houses.
 All of this Mr. Landrieu highlighted in his first State of the City speech, departing from tradition and delivering it two months into his term rather than waiting for a year to pass. He detailed a series of measures his administration had already taken to reduce the city's deficit by more than half. And, with fewer specifics, he spoke of deeper cuts to be announced in the coming weeks.
 New Orleans residents say that it is early enough in the Landrieu administration -- and that memories of the previous one, of broadly unpopular C. Ray Nagin, are fresh enough -- that Mr. Landrieu can still emphasize the mess as an inheritance.
 ''There's a learning curve for anybody who comes into office like that,'' said Jon Johnson, a member of the City Council. ''You've got to allow the individual the opportunity to know where all the bones are buried. And I think that's where we are.''
 The oil is only the most recent part of that inheritance. 
 The day that White House officials came to Louisiana, a week after the rig sank and a few days before the May 3 inauguration, was the day Mr. Landrieu said he began to realize that BP and the federal government were not fully prepared. 
 ''They didn't really know what the long-term consequences were going to be because they didn't really know how to stop the problem,'' he said.
 Mr. Landrieu, a Democrat, has not been as outspoken in his criticism of the spill response -- unlike others in his state, who ''want to go on TV and scream'' -- though he shares a certain sort of swagger: this is Louisiana, and disasters are something people here are used to managing.
 Then again, Mr. Landrieu added, the city has not been on the front lines.
 New Orleans, in fact, has been in ''a little bit of an awkward predicament,'' he said.
 For most of the last two months, the oil impact in Louisiana has been hours away from the city. But New Orleans has nevertheless become home to the response command center and to news anchors who deliver reports on the cleanup with the city's riverfront as a backdrop. 
 This has led at times to an odd and seemingly contradictory message.
 On one hand, the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau makes announcements, such as one on July 12, that ''tourism remains vibrant in New Orleans,'' citing the success of the recent Essence Fest, playing down the oil impact in Lake Pontchartrain and declaring Louisiana seafood safe to eat. 
 On the other, the city has also been pushing BP, so far unsuccessfully, for $75 million for marketing efforts to persuade tourists to keep coming. Mr. Landrieu pointed out real effects, like the shuttering of a 134-year-old oyster company and fishermen who are seeing their livelihoods dwindle.
 The oil spill has also provided some political cover for Mr. Landrieu. Difficult steps, particularly the announcements of cutbacks and layoffs, have not dominated the news for days on end. 
 ''He doesn't have to worry about being second-guessed on his every move,'' said Clancy DuBos, who writes a political column for The Gambit, the local alternative weekly newspaper he publishes. 
 Still, there are plenty of people in the city who are not so easily distracted, people who have not had a police station or an emergency room nearby for nearly five years. 
 ''They don't want to hear any more excuses,'' said Mr. Johnson, whose district, which includes the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East, is lagging the furthest behind in the recovery from Hurricane Katrina. 
 That district also includes the only areas of New Orleans where oil has actually appeared -- in the marshes far to the east of the city proper. 
 Nevertheless, Mr. Johnson said, a vast majority of his constituents do not want to be told that fighting the spill will take time and energy that would otherwise be dedicated to hurricane recovery efforts.
 ''It's going to be a hard sell,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''I think people understand it. I think they're sympathetic, but their priorities are clear.''
 Mr. Landrieu said he was able to address all the problems at the same time, often discussing recovery issues and oil spill concerns in the same conversations with White House officials. He did acknowledge, however, that all of this had put a strain on the city's limited resources.
 ''When you're fighting to survive every day,'' he said, ''you can't think about where you're going to be a year from now.''

HEADLINE: Commander In Iraq Warns Of Attacks On U.S. Bases

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS and TIM ARANGO; Duraid Adnan contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Diyala and Nineveh Provinces.

 BODY:
BAGHDAD -- Gen. Ray Odierno, the commander of United States forces in Iraq, said Tuesday that Iranian-backed Shiite militias might increase attacks on American military bases this summer as thousands of American soldiers begin leaving Iraq. 
 ''There has been some intelligence of Iranian surrogates attempting to attack U.S. bases,'' General Odierno said at a Baghdad news briefing. ''For years, these groups have been talking about that they are forcing the U.S. to leave. It's not necessarily what's reality; it's what they're able to use propaganda-wise, and I feel they think this would be a huge propaganda tool for them in the future.''
 General Odierno said any attacks on bases would not disrupt the American plan to reduce the number of its troops in the country to 50,000 by Sept. 1, from about 85,000 currently. 
 ''Our assessment is that the Iraqi security forces are capable of maintaining a level of stability necessary for Iraq to continue to move forward politically and economically,'' he said.
 The Shiite militia named by General Odierno, Kataib Hezbollah, is one of several armed Shiite groups in Iraq that the United States says has ties to Iran, a charge the Iranian government denies. In recent years, Shiite militias -- which had once been feared by Sunnis and Shiites alike -- have engaged in far less violence than they had during the country's sectarian warfare in 2006 and 2007.
 Currently, the most significant threat to Iraq's political stability continues to be the homegrown Sunni insurgent group Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, General Odierno said.
 There remain elements of that group operating in the desert north of Mosul, the general said, but over all it is in disarray, with its commanders unable to communicate with Al Qaeda's leaders in Afghanistan and Pakistan. 
 Also Tuesday, in Yusufiya, a town south of Baghdad, a man fighting Al Qaeda and four members of his family were killed after gunmen stormed his house, the Iraqi police said.
 In central Baghdad, two roadside bombs exploded, apparently aimed at motorists waiting for gasoline at a service station, the police said. Two people were killed and five were wounded.
 And in Mosul someone threw a hand grenade at an Iraqi television news crew filming on a street, the police said. A police officer and eight children who had gathered to watch the television crew were wounded.

BRUSSELS -- Top European finance officials said Tuesday that results of banking stress tests would be released on July 23 but that some national regulators could take longer to release more detailed information on certain lenders. 
 ''We want this to be as broadly based as possible, involving the institutions with sovereign debt exposure,'' said Didier Reynders, the Belgian finance minister. ''We want this to give as much credibility to our banking institutions as possible.'' 
 The Committee of European Banking Supervisors, which is made up of national regulators from across the European Union, is carrying out the tests on the health of 91 banks. But national regulators will decide whether to publish additional information within two weeks after the July 23 release date. 
 Investors have been seeking maximum disclosure of the results, and that has prompted governments to deny they are shaping the tests or delaying the release of sensitive information about weaker banks to ensure the most favorable findings for their banks. 
 Markets have continued to gyrate this week on speculation about the health of European banks. The euro fell against the dollar on Monday, partly on concerns about the results of the stress tests and warnings that more needed to be done to clarify how they were being conducted. On Tuesday, the euro continued its recent rise.
 Markets rallied Tuesday on upbeat company results in the United States and after the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, hailed a bond sale as reflecting ''very positive'' budget developments. Greece sold 1.625 billion euros ($2.1 billion) of 26-week bills at a yield of 4.65 percent, less than the target of about 5 percent that analysts were expecting.
 The financial crisis in the European Union began in Greece, which had concealed the true level of its debts and then faced the wrath of the credit markets when its huge budget deficit came to light.
 But a dose of bad news from a credit rating agency renewed pressure on European governments on Tuesday. Moody's Investors Service said it was cutting Portugal's sovereign bond ratings to A1 -- still investment grade -- from Aa2. 
 Moody's said that Portugal's national debt had risen sharply relative to gross domestic product, reflecting spending to stimulate the economy. It warned that weak growth would weigh on government finances for two to three more years. 
 The Portuguese finance minister, Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, said the downgrade, which came after cuts by other rating agencies, was expected. ''There is no point grieving over this,'' Mr. Teixeira dos Santos said in Lisbon, according to The Associated Press. ''We have to do what the markets demand, which is swiftly put our public finances in order.'' 
 After their meeting in Brussels, European Union finance officials underlined the need for governments to create national funds, or national guarantees, to recapitalize any banks that ended up failing the stress tests. 
 George Osborne, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, said that member states needed to put ''credible plans in place'' by July 23 to protect the institutions that ended up looking the most vulnerable. ''I'm not suggesting that any institutions necessarily will look vulnerable, but if any do, then we need to be able to stand behind them,'' he said. 
 Mr. Osborne also identified financial backstops for banks as one of the most important features of the United States stress tests at the start of 2009. 
 Olli Rehn, the European Union's commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, said that governments should turn to a pan-European ''superfund'' only if absolutely necessary to help troubled banks. 
 The stress tests are meant to reassure investors that banks could cope with a worsening recession and withstand a sovereign default. But the results could also push banks to seek extra financing to increase the cushion against potential losses. 
 ''The European banking sector is, over all, resilient,'' Mr. Rehn said Monday night. ''At the same time, when we publish the stress tests we will have to prepare for any pockets of vulnerability.'' 
 On Tuesday, finance ministers from countries using the euro continued to press Slovakia to stop blocking activation of the financial safety net, or superfund. 
 Slovakia has sought to renegotiate its share of the 750 billion euro ($953 billion) package, but Finance Minister Ivan Miklos said he hoped his government would decide Wednesday on whether to sign on.

HEADLINE: An Initiative Pushes Banks On New York Foreclosures

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Hoping to succeed where Washington has largely failed, New York City's comptroller, John C. Liu, and six large unions plan to begin a campaign on Wednesday to press the biggest banks to do more to prevent foreclosures in the New York area.
 Mr. Liu said the group would send Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, among others, a letter that criticizes them for dragging their feet on modifying mortgages that are underwater or delinquent, and that urges them to do ''everything possible'' to avert foreclosures. 
 Depending on the response the coalition members get, they might move pension funds and bank deposits to other institutions, according to union officials.
 ''The federal programs in place just aren't having a desired effect,'' Mr. Liu said in an interview on Tuesday. ''People are losing their homes. It continues to be a drag on our regional economy.''
 In the letter, a copy of which was provided in advance to The New York Times, Mr. Liu and the presidents of six of New York's most powerful unions will ask the banks to immediately name a high-level official to handle appeals of borrowers who are denied mortgage loan modifications. 
 Their letter criticizes the banks for ''unanswered phone calls, delays in the modification process and multiple requests for homeowners to resend paperwork already submitted.''
 ''Banks like you can do more,'' the comptroller and union presidents write. 
 The coalition will officially announce the effort a news conference on Wednesday. The unions involved are the United Federation of Teachers, the 1199 health care workers union, the Transport Workers Union, the District Council 37 municipal employees union, the New York Hotel and Motel Trades Council, and Local 32BJ of the service employees union. 
 The group said that 265,000 mortgages in New York State -- 13 percent of all mortgages in the state -- are past due or already in the foreclosure process. 
 The officials ask the banks what efforts they have undertaken to respond promptly to customers' requests about modifying mortgages and to suspend foreclosures while evaluating a borrower's eligibility for loan modification.
 Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers, said hundreds of teachers and teachers aides faced foreclosure. ''We're trying to help people who are doing the right thing,'' he said. ''It seems that the banks are not really doing a lot on this. They're not trying to negotiate in many instances.'' 
 The letter asks the banks to respond by Sept. 1, with some of the signers suggesting there will be a second letter that demands the banks take specific steps.
 Federal officials, from President Obama on down, have tried various techniques to persuade banks to make more loan modifications and take other steps to reduce foreclosures. But so far, those steps appear to have done little to stem the foreclosure flood.
 Mr. Liu said that ''it's premature to talk about sticks,'' like moving city funds out of banks that are deemed unresponsive.
 But Mr. Mulgrew said he had alerted the trustees of his union's pension fund to the situation, raising the possibility that they might take some action. Union officials say pension funds are hurt by foreclosures because they weaken the economy and hurt bank profits, helping to drive down bank share prices.
 Richard Simon, a Bank of America spokesman, said his bank had led the industry in addressing the foreclosure crisis. In an e-mail message, he said, ''Bank of America is committed to helping our customers remain in their homes, as demonstrated by 650,000 modifications we have completed since January 2008, including about 160,000 so far this year.''
 A Citigroup spokesman, Mark Rodgers, made similar comments. ''In the first quarter of 2010, our various modification and extension programs helped many families stay in their homes in New York State, outnumbering those who were foreclosed by approximately 54 to 1,'' he said in an e-mail message. ''Nationally, from Jan. 1, 2007, through March 31, 2010, Citi has helped more than 900,000 homeowners avoid potential foreclosure.''

HEADLINE: A 6-Day Winning Streak, Energized by Strong Earnings

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; James Kanter contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock indexes in the United States rose for a sixth consecutive session on Tuesday, propelled by a strong start to the corporate earnings season. 
 Financial stocks rose more than 2 percent, leading the three major indexes to gains of more than 1 percent. It was the first six-day winning streak since late April.
 The earnings period got off to a good start on Monday when the aluminum producer Alcoa posted a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit and raised its forecast for global aluminum consumption. 
 The transportation company CSX also offered a positive outlook and said that its second-quarter revenue increased 22 percent. 
 Alcoa shares were 13 cents higher at $11. CSX shares were down 74 cents at $51.72.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 146.75 points, or 1.44 percent, to 10,363.02. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 16.59 points, or 1.54 percent, at 1,095.34, while the Nasdaq rose 43.67 points, or 1.99 percent, to 2,242.03. 
 Stock in major banks, several of which report earnings this week, were higher. Morgan Stanley was up $1.10 to $25.66; Citigroup rose 19 cents to $4.30; and Bank of America gained 46 cents to $15.67.
 Some analysts injected a note of caution into the overall gains but said the results could help the market find some footing simply because they helped address unknowns.
 ''I would think that the market for a number of weeks was trading predominantly on sentiment, more so than a reflection of fundamentals,'' said Stephen P. Wood, the chief market strategist for Russell Investments.
 David M. Darst, a managing director and chief investment strategist for Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, said the market surge emerged from a period of declines and would need consistently better economic reports along with earnings, especially from large banks, to consolidate.
 ''It is up today but it is trying to establish a direction,'' Mr. Darst said. 
 The market rise on Tuesday was broad-based, with gains of more than 2 percent in consumer discretionary companies and basic materials stocks.
 On the Nasdaq, shares of Apple were down $5.49 to $251.80 after Consumer Reports said on Monday that it could not recommend the iPhone 4 because a hardware flaw in its antenna sometimes resulted in dropped calls.
 Crude oil also rose, gaining $2.20 to $77.15 a barrel in New York trading, mostly in response to Alcoa's strong results, which were considered a sign of economic recovery.
 In another indicator on Tuesday, the Commerce Department reported that both imports and exports rose sharply in May, a sign that the economy was picking up -- at least in the beginning of the second quarter. 
 Shares of General Electric, which reports earnings on Friday, rose 28 cents, to $15.21, and 3M was up $1.29 to $83.55. Dow Chemical was up 96 cents to $26.71, and Caterpillar rose $2.51, to $66.79, helped by reports of the increase in exports.
 Brian A. Bethune, chief financial economist for IHS Global Insight, said that while demand was being met by higher imports, the market appeared to be firming on sentiment that concerns over the European debt crisis and the potential for a double-dip recession might have receded.
 Even though earnings were coming in better than expected, companies were slow to hire and still needed to control costs for profit growth.
 ''Companies in general are still extremely vigilant about cost management,'' Mr. Bethune said.
 European shares were also higher Tuesday, though tempered somewhat by a credit rating downgrade to Portugal. 
 The FTSE 100 in London settled 104 points, or 2 percent, higher while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 113.94 points, or 1.87 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 70.10 points, or 1.96 percent. Asian markets finished mixed.

HEADLINE: Living Week to Week in a Dried-Up Market

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
DESTIN, Fla. -- Dedra Barker raised her hand and took the mood of the room from somber to tearful.
 At a meeting last month for residents of Destin to learn about filing claims against BP, Ms. Barker's voice quavered as she asked about her options. As general manager of a small business that rents a dozen vacation homes in town, she was seeing cancellations even though the town's white beaches were still unspoiled. 
 ''I live week to week,'' she said. ''What do I do in the next week or two, when I can't do my job and can't pay my mortgage? Do I live in my car with my 12-year-old daughter?'' 
 The company she works for, Beach Reunion, caters to family reunions and weddings, with a dozen houses that sleep as many as 30 people and can cost $8,000 a week. Normally at this time of year, each home would be packed and the business would be booking reservations for fall weddings. ''Our phones have quit ringing,'' Ms. Barker said. 
 Ms. Barker's full-time salary of $750 a week, with bonuses, has been whittled to an hourly wage that leaves her take-home pay at less than $160 a week. 
 So Ms. Barker has gone to BP's local claims office, but the process has been slow and frustrating. ''I've gone round and round,'' she said. ''Us little people that aren't associated with the fishing industry, we're being pushed to the wayside.''
 At first, a caseworker told her she would be paid only for money she had already lost, then said she could be paid in advance to make up most of her lost salary, but not the commissions and bonuses. ''That's still in review,'' Ms. Barker said.
 ''If it was just me, I wouldn't be that upset,'' she said. ''But I still have a daughter, and it's not fair to her. She just doesn't understand.'' 
 Her daughter, Abbey, just had her 13th birthday. ''Usually, I'd take a few days off to take her to Universal'' in Orlando, Ms. Barker said. ''We can't do that anymore.'' 
 Ms. Barker's troubles are part of a ripple effect hitting the local economy: shopping trips to the Commons, a nice mall, are out, as are dinners at Abbey's favorite Mexican restaurant, Pepitos; grocery runs have become taut expeditions.
 Meanwhile, Ms. Barker, who is 47, has been to the emergency room. ''My whole left side was numb,'' she said. Doctors told her she had developed migraines with stroke-like symptoms. 
 Stress, they said. 
 Ms. Barker posts photographs of the beach on the company's Web site, with updates intended to counter the gloom from television reporters who stand on the most fouled shorelines elsewhere. ''Our Beaches remain OPEN today and remain OIL FREE,'' she wrote recently. ''Yesterday we had just a few tar balls wash ashore which were picked up and disposed of within a couple hours.''
 But CNN speaks louder than beachreunion.com. ''They're still not calling,'' Ms. Barker said.
 And she sighed, reflecting on Destin's motto: ''The luckiest fishing village.''

HEADLINE: Food Policy Chief Leaves Job, And City Seeks a Successor

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
New York's first food czar, serving in a position considered groundbreaking when the city established it in 2007, quietly left the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg late last month.
 The food czar, Ben Thomases, 35, who came to City Hall as food policy coordinator to take charge of a campaign to combat hunger and unhealthy eating, is now the chief operating officer of Wildcat Service Corporation, a nonprofit work force development contractor. 
 He took the job, he said in a telephone interview, because it was a good opportunity to advance his career. Before coming to City Hall, he had been president of FirstSource Staffing, which, as part of the Fifth Avenue Committee in Brooklyn, helps find jobs for unemployed people with difficulties entering the work force. 
 ''I'm tremendously proud of what the city achieved in the area of food policy,'' he said Tuesday. ''Many low-income New Yorkers already have substantially improved access to healthy foods and those improvements should continue for years to come.''
 The city is looking for a successor to Mr. Thomases and has advertised the position, with a salary range of $75,000 to $120,000.
 Mr. Thomases, whose role was created at the urging of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, drew praise from city officials and food policy experts for establishing or accelerating programs involving many agencies. Those include creating nutritional standards for the 225 million meals and snacks that the city serves each year and new zoning to encourage the development of high-quality supermarkets in neighborhoods that lack them.
 ''Often cities think about food in singular ways -- as it relates to hunger, of course, as it relates to nutrition -- but rarely do you have a city step back and try to look soup-to-nuts, if you will, at food and food system issues,'' Ms. Quinn said, crediting Mr. Thomases with starting to accomplish that task.
 But some food policy advocates said the city had not gone far enough, defining the coordinator's role too narrowly and emphasizing public health issues, a strong personal interest of the mayor, giving less attention to the broader economic pressures. 
 ''In general there was more progress on the food locations and food quality issues than on the poverty-related affordability and hunger side,'' said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. ''To the degree that the mayor sees something as public health, he's been A-plus. To the degree he sees a poverty issue, in my opinion he's a B-minus at best.''
 And Nevin Cohen, an assistant professor of environmental studies at the New School who has studied urban food systems, said that the next food coordinator could achieve even more if he or she were not tethered to the cluster of health and human services agencies.
 ''My research suggests that other cities are able to figure out more effective ways to coordinate the work of different city agencies to address the food issue,'' he said. ''I think there's real opportunity now to not just rethink the position, but also to think about how food can be a part of a broader economic development, jobs creation and sustainability initiative.'' 
 Both Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services, who was Mr. Thomases' supervisor, and Ms. Quinn said they planned to sharpen the focus on the economic aspects of the food system. And Ms. Gibbs dismissed criticism of the job's structure.
 ''Whether or not the position has authority over the entirety of city government to achieve the goal I really think is a misplaced criticism of a group of people that have started to really appreciate how broad the potential is,'' she said. ''I actually think having a food policy coordinator in the mayor's office is all you need to say.''

HEADLINE: Obama Says Budget Nominee Is Fit for 'Hall of Fame'

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; David M. Herszenhorn contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Jacob J. Lew packed up his office on his last day as White House budget director in January 2001, he left behind a tidy sum of $236 billion in surplus funds for his successor. Nine years later, he is returning to a White House some $1.3 trillion in the hole.
 For the second time, a president has tapped Mr. Lew to manage the nation's finances but under radically different circumstances. The flush Treasury he oversaw during a robust economy under President Bill Clinton has been drained by recession, tax cuts, two wars, entitlement programs, bailouts and stimulus spending. And now it will be his job to refill it. 
 ''Jack Lew is somebody who has proven himself already equal to this extraordinary task,'' President Obama said Tuesday as he announced his nomination of Mr. Lew as director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. ''If there was a Hall of Fame for budget directors, then Jack Lew surely would have earned a place for his service in that role under President Clinton when he helped balance the federal budget after years of deficits.'' 
 Mr. Lew, currently a deputy secretary of state, served as budget director from 1998 to 2001 and presided over three years of surpluses after a generation of deficit spending. But not every Hall of Famer achieves the same success the second time around, and the challenges awaiting Mr. Lew are daunting, should he be confirmed by the Senate to succeed Peter R. Orszag. After 18 months of spending to avert a depression, Mr. Obama is under pressure to bring the deficit under control.
 A Treasury Department report on Tuesday showed that the government ran up $1 trillion in deficit spending during the first nine months of the fiscal year, down 8 percent from the same period a year ago, but still on pace to finish the year at around $1.3 trillion, the second-highest on record.
 ''Most of the big-ticket spending items for the next few years have already been spent, so Jack will have to preside over a lot of the less-fun belt tightening,'' said Brian Riedl, an analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research organization.
 Republicans on Tuesday demanded a cap on discretionary spending that they called $26 billion below the president's budget request. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, and his party's Appropriations Committee members vowed to oppose spending measures that exceed the limit.
 ''The American people are saying to us, 'You're spending too much, you're running up too many debts and we expect you to do something about it,' '' Mr. McConnell said. 
 In the House, the Republican leader, Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, chided Democrats for not passing a formal budget blueprint, the first time the House has failed to do so under rules adopted in 1974. ''The president's words on fiscal responsibility will continue to ring hollow until he demonstrates real leadership and calls on Democratic leaders in Congress to pass a budget,'' he said.
 Democrats noted that Republicans failed to pass a budget through both houses three times when they controlled Congress. And Mr. Obama pinned blame for the red ink on his predecessor, President George W. Bush. ''The day I took office, eight years later, America faced a record $1.3 trillion deficit,'' he said.
 A New York native, Mr. Lew, 54, earned degrees from Harvard and Georgetown before going to work on Capitol Hill, where he was a top aide to Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the House speaker. He went to work in Mr. Clinton's White House, working his way up to budget director.
 As Mr. Obama's deputy secretary of state for management and resources, Mr. Lew served as chief operating officer, running the department while Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton travels the world and focuses on diplomacy. His departure was a blow to Mrs. Clinton, who resisted losing him to the White House.
 ''This news is obviously bittersweet,'' Mrs. Clinton wrote in an e-mail message to employees. ''While I was hoping never to have to replace Jack, the president and our country need his leadership at O.M.B.''
 Mr. Obama joked about it. ''I was actually worried that Hillary would not let him go,'' he said. ''I had to trade a number of No. 1 draft picks to get Jack back at O.M.B.''

HEADLINE: Financial Reform Bill Limps Toward Vote

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was supposed to be the one major piece of legislation this year that Republicans and Democrats could see eye to eye on, and vote aye on together in broad numbers. Instead, the sweeping overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system, a response to the economic crisis of 2008, will barely squeak through the Senate. 
 Senate Democrats on Tuesday said they had cobbled together the bare minimum of 60 votes needed to close off debate and advance to a final vote later this week. Supporters included three Republican centrists from the Northeast, Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Susan Collins of Maine and Olympia J. Snowe, also of Maine. 
 The three Republicans may be joined by others, but the bill is still certain to fall far short of the wide bipartisan majority that some Congressional leaders had predicted given the unanimous agreement among lawmakers in both parties that the rules for Wall Street needed to be rewritten. 
 In the House, only three Republicans supported the bill. ''I think it's just the times we're in,'' said Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, a main author of the legislation along with Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Financial Services Committee. 
 With a fiercely competitive midterm election cycle under way, the shared goal of tightening regulation of the financial industry gave way to charges by Republicans that Democrats were overextending the reach of government and failing to address the root cause of the crisis by not dealing with the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. 
 Democrats levied countercharges that Republican Congressional leaders were more interested in blocking President Obama's legislative agenda and denying Democratic lawmakers the ability to boast of another achievement during the fall campaign than they were in safeguarding the financial system and protecting consumers. 
 In the end, even lawmakers known for working across the aisle said they were perplexed -- and discouraged -- that the financial regulation bill ultimately did not generate wider bipartisan support. 
 ''It's disconcerting,'' Ms. Snowe said. ''It doesn't engender the kind of public confidence in an initiative of this scope without having broad support because it raises questions.'' 
 Instead of joint news conferences heralding passage of the bill, Senate leaders have bickered for weeks and engaged in protracted procedural skirmishing that delayed the measure, which Mr. Obama had hoped would be done before the Fourth of July. 
 Mr. Obama on Tuesday declared the securing of the needed Senate votes ''a breakthrough'' and praised the Republicans who agreed to support the bill. 
 ''Three Republican senators have put politics and partisanship aside to support this reform, and I'm grateful,'' he said, adding ''What members of both parties realize is that we can't allow a financial crisis like this one that we just went through to happen again.'' 
 But Democrats struggled even to hold their own ranks; Senator Ben Nelson, Democrat of Nebraska, seemed to waver at the last minute, after previously voting in favor of the bill. He later announced on Tuesday that his concerns had been addressed and that he would stand with his party in delivering the needed 60 votes to close debate. 
 A fourth Republican who voted for an earlier version of the bill, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, said in a Bloomberg television interview on Tuesday that he remained undecided.
 The bill seeks to avert future crises by giving government regulators the power to seize control of failing financial institutions, break them apart, sell off the assets and put them out of business, with shareholders and creditors taking losses. 
 The legislation would create a system risk council comprising the most senior government regulators to try to identify potential dangers in the financial system. It would create a powerful consumer financial protection bureau to be housed in the Federal Reserve and would impose a new regulatory framework on the trading of derivatives, the complex instruments that were at the center of the 2008 downturn. 
 The bill would also strengthen the Securities and Exchange Commission by giving it new authority over credit rating agencies, hedge funds and private equity companies. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said that Democrats were to blame for their unwillingness to compromise on numerous provisions in the bill, and that the legislation would still allow financial institutions to be so big and interconnected that their collapse could endanger the entire system. 
 ''I think what happened with financial regulation is the bill stayed on the far left and therefore was not in the end appealing to most of my members,'' Mr. McConnell said at a news conference at the Capitol. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said Republicans had turned their backs on Americans by voting against the financial regulatory bill and by blocking an extension of unemployment benefits. 
 ''Wall Street reform is preventive care; unemployment insurance is emergency care,'' Mr. Reid said, adding, ''I'm grateful that a few brave Republicans are doing the right thing for our country, but it's still disappointing that you can count on one hand the number of Republicans willing to fix the system that caused the recession.'' 
 A procedural vote on ending debate is scheduled for Thursday morning, and Mr. Reid expressed hope that a final vote could be held later that day. If Republicans object, he said, the vote could be scheduled for Saturday -- a highly unlikely prospect in the summer of a midterm campaign year.

HEADLINE: The Spies Who Loved Us

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
I was on vacation when the story broke that 11 Russians had been charged as sleeper agents planted in America by Moscow's spy agency to gather intelligence on the United States and to recruit moles who could gain access to our top secrets. My first reaction was: This may be the greatest gift to America by a foreign country since France gave us the Statue of Liberty. Someone still wants to spy on us! Just when we were feeling down and out, the Russians show up and tell us that it's still worth briefcases of money to plant people in our think tanks. Subprime crisis or not, some people think we've still got the right stuff. Thank you, Vladimir Putin! 
 Upon reflection, though, it occurred to me that this is actually a good news/bad news story. The good news is that someone still wants to spy on us. The bad news is that it's the Russians. 
 Look, if you had told me that we had just arrested 11 Finns who were spying on our schools, then I'd really have felt good -- since Finland's public schools always score at the top of the world education tables. If you had told me that 11 Singaporeans were arrested spying on how our government works, then I'd really have felt good -- since Singapore has one of the cleanest, well-run bureaucracies in the world and pays its cabinet ministers $1 million-plus a year. If you had told me that 11 Hong Kong Chinese had been arrested studying how we regulate our financial markets, then I'd really have felt good -- since that is something Hong Kong excels at. And if you had told me that 11 South Koreans were arrested studying our high-speed bandwidth penetration, then I'd really have felt good -- because we've been lagging them for a long time.
 But the Russians? Who wants to be spied on by them? 
 Were it not for oil, gas and mineral exports, Russia's economy would be contracting even more than it has. Moscow's most popular exports today are probably what they were under Khrushchev: vodka, Matryoshka dolls and Kalashnikov rifles. No, this whole spy story has the feel of one of those senior tennis tournaments -- John McEnroe against Jimmy Connors, long after their primes -- or maybe a rematch between Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston in their 60s. You almost want to avert your eyes. 
 You also want to say to Putin: Do you mean you still don't get it? 
 Everything the Russians should want from us -- the true source of our strength -- doesn't require a sleeper cell to penetrate. All it requires is a tourist guide to Washington, D.C., which you can buy for under $10. Most of it's in the National Archives: the Bill of Rights, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. And the rest is in our culture and can be found everywhere from Silicon Valley to Route 128 near Boston. It is a commitment to individual freedom, free markets, rule of law, great research universities and a culture that celebrates immigrants and innovators.
 Now if the Russians start to find all that and take it home, then we'd have to start taking them more seriously as competitors. But there is little indication of that. Indeed, as Leon Aron, director of Russian studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted in a recent essay, President Dmitri Medvedev of Russia just announced plans to build an ''Innovation City'' in Skolkovo, outside Moscow. This ''technopolis'' is planned as a free-enterprise zone to attract the world's best talent.
 There is just one problem, notes Aron: ''Importing ideas and technology from the West has been a key element in Russia's 'modernizations' since at least Peter the Great in the early 18th century. ... But Russia has tightly controlled what it imported: Machines and engineers, yes. A spirit of free inquiry, a commitment to innovation free from bureaucratic 'guidance' and, most important, encouragement of brave, even brash, entrepreneurs who can be confident they will own the results of their work -- most certainly no. Peter and his successors sought to produce fruit without cultivating the roots. ... Only a man or woman free from fear and overseers can build a Silicon Valley. And such men and women are harder and harder to come by in Russia today. ... Disgusted and scared by the lawlessness and rampant corruption. ... Russian entrepreneurs are investing very little in their country beyond their immediate production needs.''
 No, everything the Russians should want from us is everything they don't have to steal. It is also everything we should be celebrating and preserving but lately have not: open immigration, educational excellence, a culture of innovation and a financial system designed to promote creative destruction, not ''destructive creation,'' as the economist Jagdish Bhagwati called it.
 So, yes, let's swap their spies for ours. But let's also remember that being spied on by the Russians today is not an honor. It's just an old habit. Because they are no longer our peers, except in nuclear weapons unlikely to ever be used. The countries we need to be worried about are the ones whose teachers, bureaucrats, savers, investors and innovators -- not spies -- are beating us in broad daylight at our own game.

HEADLINE: A New, and Necessary, Moratorium

 BODY:
Despite legal challenges from industry, complaints from local politicians and bad rulings from unsympathetic judges, the Obama administration has rightly chosen to reaffirm its decision in May to suspend deep-water drilling activities in the Gulf of Mexico. On Monday, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar issued a second moratorium to replace an earlier ban that was tossed out in federal court. It is as strong as the first ban and, if anything, more tightly argued. 
 Whether the new ban can withstand legal challenges remains to be seen. The important point is that the administration has reaffirmed one of the basic lessons of this mess: that industry claims cannot be accepted at face value. BP was tragically unprepared to deal with this spill; indeed, a new and tighter cap that everyone hopes will stop the leak altogether is only now being installed, 13 weeks after the blowout. Until the industry shows it can drill safely in deep waters, and respond swiftly and surely to an accident, it should not be allowed to go forward with that kind of operation.
 Drilling, in short, cannot be resumed on faith alone. Mr. Salazar said he would invite input from industry and the public, and was open to modifying the order. But first, he said, industry must ''raise the bar on its practices and answer fundamental questions about deep-water safety, blowout prevention and containment, and oil spill response.'' 
 The original May 27 moratorium banned new deep-water drilling in the gulf and suspended existing operations at 33 exploratory deep-water wells for a period of six months. The new moratorium applies the same restrictions for the same time period, ending Nov. 30, unless the administration decides otherwise.
 The biggest difference involved the way in which Mr. Salazar cast his argument. The original moratorium focused mainly on depth, proscribing any drilling at depths exceeding 500 feet. The district court judge who overturned the ban, Martin Feldman, in effect said that focusing only on depth was too narrow to be persuasive.
 Mr. Salazar chose this time to emphasize uncertain technologies. The new ban covers all floating rigs, like the BP rig, using subsurface blowout preventers, as well as floating rigs that use blowout preventers on board the rig itself. This pretty much covers every deep-water rig with the capacity to drill in the gulf. 
 There were howls from the usual quarters -- from industry, predictably, and from Mary Landrieu, the Democratic senator from Louisiana, who said the new moratorium would cost ''thousands of hard-working Louisianians'' their jobs.
 One must sympathize with the battered residents of Ms. Landrieu's home state. But one cannot ignore the fact that most of the gulf's 3,000 producing platforms and shallow-water drilling rigs are still in business, or that President Obama has earmarked $100 million specifically for relief of unemployed oil workers. 
 The main thing that cannot be overlooked is that it would be folly to resume drilling until everything has been done to make drilling as safe as it can be and to ensure a rapid response when systems fail.

HEADLINE: Closing the Skills Gap Among High School Students

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 It's an inescapable fact: a high school education no longer adequately equips American workers for the high-skill jobs that now drive the global economy. That reality was starkly illustrated in your July 2 front-page article ''Jobs Go Begging as Gap Is Exposed in Worker Skills.'' 
 Increasingly, as the article shows, businesses demand workers with mathematical knowledge and specialized technological skills. And tragically, those are skills that many new graduates, and the long-term unemployed, do not possess.
 This widening skills gap threatens our nation's productivity as businesses struggle to fill jobs and spend millions on training, often teaching workers things they should already know. We need no further anecdotal evidence that our high schoolers must be better prepared. But what exactly do they know? And what do they need to know to succeed? We have created a national commission specifically to answer those crucial questions -- so that we can build education reforms based on solid data.
 Toward that end, the National Assessment of Educational Progress (the Nation's Report Card) is redesigning its 12th-grade reading and math tests so they can serve as reliable national indicators to show whether high school graduates are prepared for job training and higher education. Remarkably, no such benchmarks currently exist.
 The N.A.E.P. High School Achievement Commission is also promoting awareness of a number of research studies based on this assessment, with results to be released this fall. The studies should provide valuable information to parents, policy makers and employers as they work to close the skills gap and to maintain United States competitiveness around the world.
 Ronnie Musgrove Ridgeland, Miss., July 8, 2010
 The writer, the former governor of Mississippi, is chairman of the National Assessment of Educational Progress's High School Achievement Commission.

HEADLINE: A New Approach to Immigration Raids

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Illegal Workers Swept From Jobs in 'Silent Raids' '' (front page, July 10):
 You report that the Obama administration's use of audits to force employers to fire and not rehire illegal immigrants is leading some employers to complain that it's creating a shortage of cheap labor. These employers claim that they cannot attract legal American workers to perform work, like farming, for low wages.
 These employers need to understand that in a free-market capitalist system, as we have here in the United States, any shortage of labor can be overcome by raising wages until a balance between demand and supply is achieved. Raise the wages offered and legal American workers will gladly take the jobs. If it turns out that these companies cannot make a profit without paying a below-free-market wage, then they are not viable businesses and should be abandoned. 
 Denis A. Grabowski Philadelphia, July 10, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Not all recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids have been ''silent.'' On June 29, I.C.E. agents raided Terra Universal in Fullerton, Calif. Dozens of agents stormed the factory, locked all entry and exit doors, backed the approximately 150 workers up against a wall, and handcuffed and arrested more than 40 workers, who were promptly put in deportation proceedings.
 I.C.E. is performing an audit of the factory's hiring practices and investigating exploitative labor conditions. But by traumatically rounding up workers and initiating deportation proceedings, these workers (already victims of exploitation) and their families will pay the greatest price, while their employer may walk away only paying a fine it can surely afford.
 For these jobless workers now facing separation from dependent children who are American citizens, I.C.E.'s pledge to make enforcement against unscrupulous employers its priority rings hypocritically hollow.
 Jennie Pasquarella Los Angeles, July 10, 2010
 The writer is a staff attorney for the A.C.L.U. of Southern California, which is helping coordinate legal representation for the workers in their deportation proceedings. 
 To the Editor:
 Your article should warn us to look beyond immigration reform. The country has been here before.
 In the late 1950s, after hundreds of thousands of Mexicans here illegally were forced back across the border in Operation Wetback, American growers turned to Mexican workers imported for agricultural work under the Bracero Program. Wages for the braceros were set by law, around $1 an hour in California, and in effect established an artificial ceiling on the wages of American farm workers, keeping them in poverty.
 The Catholic Church, labor unions and major Hispanic groups, fighting for the domestic farm workers, brought the Bracero Program to an end in 1964. Subsequently, organizing campaigns led by Cesar Chavez resulted in wages and benefits that for the first time provided a decent living for American farm workers. But because we failed to enforce our borders, the golden age of farm employment was short-lived, ending in the 1980s as the growers found illegal immigrants to be a cheaper and readily available source of labor.
 With legalization, the United States will recreate a work force in agriculture that has not existed aboveground in three decades. We need to be better prepared to protect the chances of this new generation to achieve and maintain the American dream than we were the last time. That includes being willing to enforce our borders and to place restrictions on the importation of foreign workers.
 Michael G. Harpold Ketchikan, Alaska, July 12, 2010
 The writer is retired after a 35-year career in the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
 To the Editor:
 Should illegal workers be legalized and find a way to climb the ladder of employment, businesses will continue to import and hire new illegal workers. There will be no end to it. It will become the cycle we are already familiar with.
 The country becomes flooded with illegal immigrants. The government offers amnesty, then business brings in more illegal immigrants to replace the ones who can now apply for better jobs.
 The only way to stop illegal immigration is to stop the incentives for it. No jobs, no health care, no education or citizenship for their kids.
 Michael Melcher Highland Park, Ill., July 10, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Every few weeks I see a couple of news articles that illustrate the quiet and intelligent way the Obama administration moves behind the scenes making changes to benefit the country. Two front-page articles on July 10 are perfect examples: ''Illegal Workers Swept From Jobs in 'Silent Raids' '' and ''Swap Idea Emerged Early in Case of Russian Agents.''
 Thank you, Mr. President, for clever and pragmatic solutions to these problems.
 Coale Johnson Lone Pine, Calif., July 10, 2010

Phone calls and visitors and, yes, dreams from around the world are pouring into the small offices of the Friends of the High Line on West 20th Street in Manhattan these days.
 Detroit is thinking big about an abandoned train station. Jersey City and Philadelphia have defunct railroad beds, and Chicago has old train tracks that don't look like much now, but maybe they too...
 The High Line's success as an elevated park, its improbable evolution from old trestle into glittering urban amenity, has motivated a whole host of public officials and city planners to consider or revisit efforts to convert relics from their own industrial pasts into potential economic engines. 
 In many of these places there had already been some talk and visions of what might be, but now New York's accomplishment is providing ammunition for boosters while giving skeptics much-needed evidence of the potential for success. The High Line has become, like bagels and CompStat, another kind of New York export. 
 ''There's a nice healthy competition between big American cities,'' said Ben Helphand, who is pushing to create a park on a defunct rail line in Chicago. ''That this has been done in New York puts the onus on us to do it ourselves and to give it a Chicago stamp.''
 The High Line, an elevated freight spur that runs along the West Side of Manhattan and overlooks the Hudson River, was also nothing more than a crumbling eyesore 10 years ago. But since it opened as a park last year, its plantings and vistas, tasteful design and intricate weave through the redbrick bastions of New York's meatpacking past and contemporary buildings by Frank Gehry and Jean Nouvel have been a hit. Though the High Line is not fully completed -- plans have it potentially extending as far north as West 34th Street -- more than two million people have already visited.
 Developers from Rotterdam and Hong Kong have come looking for ideas. Officials from Jerusalem are hoping to visit. Recently a team from Singapore (Is there really anything old and rusty in Singapore?) spent time on the landscaped walkways that stretch from Gansevoort Street to West 20th Street. 
 ''We could have a full-time job if we wanted to just do tours,'' said Lisa Tziona Switkin of James Corner Field Operations, the lead designer on the project. She has walked the park with people from Memphis, Atlanta, Chicago and elsewhere. Many of these visitors are interested in the potential for using outmoded infrastructure to add green space and transportation options as well as to promote cultural and commercial revitalization. Part of the fascination with the High Line, which is operated by the city and the nonprofit Friends group, is that it is more than just a pretty place. The neighborhoods it runs through -- the meatpacking district and Chelsea -- were already glamorous with many restaurants, bars and art galleries. But the opening of the High Line has made those areas even more of a destination and encouraged the Whitney Museum of American Art to build a museum there. 
 In the early days the founders of the Friends of the High Line, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, drew their own inspiration from the development of the Promenade Plantee in Paris, an elevated park built beginning in 1988 on an abandoned railroad viaduct.
 Now their success is encouraging others. In Philadelphia the idea is to turn the Reading Viaduct, which is 60 feet wide, into an elevated park and bike path.
 ''Our viaduct is much wider, which gives us more opportunity in some way,'' said Paul R. Levy, the president of a business improvement group that is exploring the plan there.
 The proposal is the brainchild of John Struble, a furniture maker, and Sarah McEneaney, an artist, who live near the viaduct and who met Mr. David in 2003 when he walked the span with them.
 ''He totally inspired us,'' Ms. McEneaney said. ''We got a lot of advice early on.'' Still, she said, the project had little momentum until the High Line opened. ''That sparked a lot more interest from the city administration,'' she said.
 Now the business-improvement quarter, known as the Center City District, is conducting a feasibility study focused in part on whether building the park would bring new development to the neighborhood, where many buildings are vacant. 
 ''I was a nonbeliever until I actually walked on the High Line,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It was a complete turnaround for me.''
 Alan Greenberger, the deputy mayor for economic development in Philadelphia, expressed caution about whether what was done in New York could be reproduced elsewhere. ''People do look at the economic success and say that's inspiring,'' he said. ''Can you replicate it? That's another story.''
 In Chicago, Mr. Helphand is president of Friends of the Bloomingdale Trail, a group modeled after the organization that Mr. Hammond and Mr. David direct. He acknowledged that Chicago does not have the army of private philanthropists that New York does, but said there was still lots of enthusiasm.
 ''We don't have Diane von Furstenberg,'' he said, referring to a prominent supporter of the High Line, ''though we do have a celebrity chef.'' (The first two sections of the High Line cost $152 million, $44 million of which was raised by Friends of the High Line.) 
 Recently, Chicago commissioned a design master plan from a team that includes a firm that was a runner-up in the competition to design the High Line.
 Not everyone in Chicago, or other cities for that matter, embraces the notion that all good ideas start in New York. Janet Attarian, a project director for the Chicago Transportation Department, said that the plan for the Bloomingdale Trail has been around since the late 1990s. ''It is something that we have been cogitating for a while,'' she said.
 The Bloomingdale Trail is almost three miles long, twice the length of the High Line, and is wide enough to accommodate bike traffic, which will give it a certain functionality that the High Line lacks.
 ''In the mornings there will be a rush hour of bicycles,'' Mr. Helphand predicted. ''It's the east-west nonmotorized transportation route that we don't have.''
 Jersey City officials, who can practically see the High Line across the Hudson River, want to turn a downtown railroad embankment into an elevated park and transportation corridor. The effort is complicated by a legal battle with a developer that is now in mediation. The City Council on Wednesday voted to raise funds to acquire the embankment should the city win the fight.
 Maureen Crowley, a coordinator for the Embankment Preservation Coalition, said that Mr. David and Mr. Hammond have advised the group, and that Mr. Hammond recently joined its advisory board.
 The coalition organized a tour of the High Line last year for Mayor Jerramiah T. Healy and several other Jersey City officials, who were impressed, Ms. Crowley said. 
 Other recent participants in a High Line tour were from Paris, a group of officials from La Defense, that city's business district. They sought ideas for shaping development in their own neighborhood. The group's leader, Philippe Chaix, had been involved in developing the Promenade Plantee, the High Line's muse a decade ago.
 ''When we were beginning to take the High Line around,'' Mr. David recalled, ''being able to point to the Promenade Plantee was huge to us. It's exciting that the High Line can act in the same way -- be something that other projects can point to and say, 'This may sound unusual, but look, they've done it here, and look how successful it is.' ''

HEADLINE: Economics Behaving Badly

BYLINE: By GEORGE LOEWENSTEIN and PETER UBEL. 
George Loewenstein is a professor of economics and psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. Peter Ubel is a professor of business and public policy at Duke and the author of ''Free Market Madness: Why Human Nature Is at Odds With Economics.''

 BODY:
IT seems that every week a new book or major newspaper article appears showing that irrational decision-making helped cause the housing bubble or the rise in health care costs. 
 Such insights draw on behavioral economics, an increasingly popular field that incorporates elements from psychology to explain why people make seemingly irrational decisions, at least according to traditional economic theory and its emphasis on rational choice. Behavioral economics helps to explain why, for example, people under-save for retirement, why they eat too much and exercise too little and why they buy energy-inefficient light bulbs and appliances. And, by understanding the causes of these problems, behavioral economics has spawned a number of creative interventions to deal with them. 
 But the field has its limits. As policymakers use it to devise programs, it's becoming clear that behavioral economics is being asked to solve problems it wasn't meant to address. Indeed, it seems in some cases that behavioral economics is being used as a political expedient, allowing policymakers to avoid painful but more effective solutions rooted in traditional economics. 
 Take, for example, our nation's obesity epidemic. The fashionable response, based on the belief that better information can lead to better behavior, is to influence consumers through things like calorie labeling -- for instance, there's a mandate in the health care reform act requiring restaurant chains to post the number of calories in their dishes. 
 Calorie labeling is a good thing; dieters should know more about the foods they are eating. But studies of New York City's attempt at calorie posting have found that it has had little impact on dieters' choices. 
 Obesity isn't a result of a lack of information; instead, economists argue that rising levels of obesity can be traced to falling food prices, especially for unhealthy processed foods. 
 To combat the epidemic effectively, then, we need to change the relative price of healthful and unhealthful food -- for example, we need to stop subsidizing corn, thereby raising the price of high fructose corn syrup used in sodas, and we also need to consider taxes on unhealthful foods. But because we lack the political will to change the price of junk food, we focus on consumer behavior.
 Or take conflicts of interest in medicine. Despite volumes of research showing that pharmaceutical industry gifts distort decisions by doctors, the medical establishment has not mustered the will to bar such thinly disguised bribes, and the health care reform act fails to outlaw them. Instead, much like food labeling, the act includes ''sunshine'' provisionsthat will simply make information about these gifts available to the public. We have shifted the burden from industry, which has the power to change the way it does business, to the relatively uninformed and powerless consumer.
 The same pattern can be seen in health care reform itself. The act promises to achieve the admirable goal of insuring most Americans, yet it fails to address the more fundamental problem of health care costs. Instead of requiring individuals to pay out of pocket if they choose to receive expensive and unproven interventions, the act tries to lower costs by promoting incentive programs that reward healthy behaviors. 
 Prevention is certainly a worthy goal; it is much better to prevent a case of lung cancer than to treat it. But efforts to improve public health, even if enhanced by insights from behavioral economics, are unlikely to have a major impact on health care costs. Studies show that preventive medicine, even when it works, rarely saves money.
 Our over-reliance on behavioral economics is not limited to health care. A ''gallons-per-mile'' bill recently passed by the New York State Senate is intended to help drivers think more clearly about the fuel consumption of the vehicles they purchase; research has shown that gallons-per-mile is a more effective means of getting drivers to appreciate the realities of fuel consumption than the traditional miles-per-gallon. 
 But more and better information fails to get at the core of the problem: people drive large, energy-inefficient cars because gas is still relatively cheap. An increase in the gas tax that made the price of gas reflect its true costs would be a far more effective -- though much more politically painful -- way to reduce fuel consumption. 
 Similarly, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain recently promoted behavioral economics as a remedy for his country's over-use of electricity, citing what he claimed were remarkable results from a study that reduced household electricity use by informing consumers of how their use compared to that of their neighbors. 
 Under closer scrutiny, however, tests of the program found that better information reduced energy use by a mere 1 percent to 2.5 percent -- modest relative to the hopes being pinned on it. 
 Compare that with the likely results of a solution rooted in traditional economics: a carbon tax would instantly bring the price of energy into line with its true cost and would unleash the creative power of the marketplace to generate cleaner energy sources. 
 Behavioral economics should complement, not substitute for, more substantive economic interventions. If traditional economics suggests that we should have a larger price difference between sugar-free and sugared drinks, behavioral economics could suggest whether consumers would respond better to a subsidy on unsweetened drinks or a tax on sugary drinks. 
 But that's the most it can do. For all of its insights, behavioral economics alone is not a viable alternative to the kinds of far-reaching policies we need to tackle our nation's challenges.

HEADLINE: A Risky Campaign Tactic: Unpleasant Truth

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
WARWICK, R.I.
 There's a lot of talk in Washington these days about ''hard choices''-- specifically, about why no one ever seems to make them. A lot of policy experts and former members of Congress (who no longer have to run) will assure you, for instance, that the only way to shrink the national debt is through some combination of higher taxes and reduced spending on entitlement and military programs. The problem is that politicians generally want to keep their jobs, and they highly doubt the proposition that voters can be persuaded to embrace even modestly painful solutions in an unforgiving political environment.
 This is precisely the proposition being tested, however, in this tiny state, where Lincoln Chafee is running for governor as an independent. Mr. Chafee, you may recall, served seven seemingly tortured years as a Republican senator opposed to his own president's agenda, before the voters -- exasperated with Republicans, period -- cut him loose in 2006. Adrift like other Republican moderates, Mr. Chafee broke with the party altogether and has now decided to run his own kind of highly unusual campaign, based on the risky premise that unpleasant times demand some unpleasant truths. 
 Like other old industrial states that have been slow to leave the factory age behind, Rhode Island is taking this recession in the teeth. Unemployment is among the nation's highest, hovering above 12 percent. The state faces a shortfall of at least $400 million out of a total budget of $7.8 billion -- a gap that might be twice as big were it not for federal stimulus dollars.
 Everyone agrees that the ultimate answer for a state like Rhode Island is to raise more money principally by creating more jobs, which is why Mr. Chafee is promoting a new transportation hub near the state's major airport. In the short term, though, Mr. Chafee is against any further cuts in spending on social programs or any additional tax cuts, both of which have been the trend in recent years. Instead, he is telling voters he would seek to eliminate a series of exemptions to the state's sales tax, effectively raising the cost of food, clothing and other items by 1 percent -- a proposal he says would raise $100 million more.
 This would not seem like an especially radical idea, since it follows years of income and corporate tax reductions that would remain in place, and it means that $200 in school clothes would cost an extra two bucks. At the very least, you would expect proposals for these kinds of modest increases to be a subject of spirited debates around the country. They aren't.
 In fact, Mr. Chafee appears to be the only statewide challenger this year -- that is, a candidate who does not already have to balance a budget -- promising to pursue a specific tax increase. Whether or not more sales taxes make sense for Rhode Island (it would, after all, close only a quarter of the projected budget gap while adding to the burden of low-income families), the rarity of Mr. Chafee's argument -- and the fact that is comes from an independent -- tells us something about the boxes in which both parties find themselves at the moment. 
 A lot of Democrats around the country might be philosophically inclined to support some tax increases, but politically they could not be more disinclined, so fearful are they of being smacked with the old ''tax and spend'' label. In some ways, this generation of Democrats is still traumatized by the experience of Walter F. Mondale, who told voters in 1984 that he was a truth-teller who would raise their taxes -- and who might as well have been paraded through the streets as an object of derision for the next 20 years.
 The leading Democrat in the Rhode Island governor's race at the moment, General Treasurer Frank T. Caprio, summarized his pitch to voters at a recent forum this way: ''If you want to pay more taxes, support Senator Chafee. If you don't want to pay taxes, support me.''
 Republicans, meanwhile, so defined themselves as tax-slashing conservatives in better times that they seem loath now to consider any deviations from the policy, for fear that their own grass-roots activists will revolt. All Republican candidates for governor in more than a dozen states (and 97 percent of all Republicans seeking federal office) have signed a pledge, circulated by the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform, not to support any new taxes. This explains, along with the party's hard line on social issues, the near extinction of New England Republicans like Mr. Chafee, whose more traditional notion of fiscal responsibility has fallen out of favor with conservatives. 
 There are reasons to think Mr. Chafee's unlikely campaign could succeed, which might, in turn, lead to less confined policy debates everywhere else. He still personifies a powerful political brand in Rhode Island, where his father, John Chafee, was a towering figure as governor and senator. Linc, as he is known locally, remains an object of personal warmth; even on the day he lost his Senate seat, voters in exit polls overwhelmingly said they still admired him. Recent polls show him essentially tied with Mr. Caprio, his closest competitor.
 Even so, Mr. Chafee knows what's coming. His proposed tax would affect such incidental items as coffins and flags. It's not hard to envision the 30-second ad protesting the ''funeral tax'' or featuring an Iraq veteran who wants to know why Mr. Chafee is slapping a levy on patriotism. It is a staple of the times.
 Mr. Chafee may not have the money he needs to answer those attacks, but he knows what he will say: Give me a better idea.
 ''This is no time for nonspecifics,'' he said in an interview last week. ''Are you going to let the murderers out of the correctional institution? Are you going to put Granny and Grandpa out of the nursing home? Are you going to close a state park or two or three? Tell us something.''
 His plea, here and in Washington, hangs uncomfortably in the air.

HEADLINE: Germany Raids Bank Offices in Tax Evasion Inquiry

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BERLIN -- Credit Suisse's offices in Germany were searched Wednesday as part of an investigation into accusations that its employees might have helped clients evade taxes, prosecutors in Dusseldorf said. 
 About 150 police officers, prosecutors and tax inspectors searched all 13 Credit Suisse offices and branches in Germany, said Johannes Mocken, a spokesman for the prosecutor's office. 
 Mr. Mocken said it would take weeks to sift through the files that were seized. The searches were prompted by data contained on a compact disc the authorities recently purchased from an informant, Mr. Mocken said. He said the authorities were looking into the accounts of 1,100 customers of Credit Suisse. 
 ''Credit Suisse is working in close cooperation with the relevant local authorities,'' said Marc Dosch, a spokesman for Credit Suisse in Zurich. ''As this concerns an ongoing investigation, we can provide no other comment.'' 
 UBS, the largest Swiss bank, avoided prosecution in the United States last year after admitting that it had helped clients evade taxes from 2000 to 2007. It paid a $780 million fine and agreed to disclose the account details of more than 4,700 clients. 
 Of all the European Union member states, Germany has taken the toughest stance against tax evaders. German officials have called on the bloc to adopt a strict policy that would pressure Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to give up their banking secrecy systems. 
 Berlin's position led to serious tensions with Switzerland earlier this year. The Swiss authorities were furious after Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister, agreed in February to pay a Swiss bank employee 2.5 million euros ($3.2 million) for a CD that was said to contain the names of 1,500 Germans with Swiss bank accounts who might have evaded taxes in their own country. 
 The German authorities also bought a disc containing information on thousands of clients of UBS and Credit Suisse that was offered to the state of Baden-Wurttemberg in February. 
 A former finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, also had no qualms about paying for information on German taxpayers with accounts in Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Luxembourg. In 2008, Germany purchased data on potential tax evaders from a banker in Liechtenstein. That caused a diplomatic furor with the Liechtenstein authorities over the stolen data. 
 One tax evader uncovered by the German investigations was Klaus Zumwinkel, who was forced to resign as chairman of Deutsche Post as a result. He was given a suspended sentence and fined 1 million euros for evading that amount of taxes by using a trust in Liechtenstein. 
 Some German politicians have challenged the way the government has obtained the information. The Free Democrats, partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government, have said they are uneasy about buying stolen data. By buying the information, party officials say, the government benefits from a crime, and may encourage more people to steal information. 
 Last January, a German real estate broker, Elmar Bernhard Schulte, was awarded 7.3 million euros in damages by a Liechtenstein court. Mr. Schulte's account details were on a disc of data stolen by an employee of a Liechtenstein bank and sold to the German finance ministry in 2008. Mr. Schulte argued that the bank should have warned him that his account information had been stolen, so he could have settled with the German authorities. Instead, a German court found Mr. Schulte guilty of tax evasion and fined him 7.5 million euros.

HEADLINE: Markets Finish Flat After Fed's Report

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Major indexes ended largely unchanged Wednesday as investors took note of a report that the economic recovery was likely to be slower than expected.
 The market wavered between losses and gains for most of the day as weak retail sales offset optimism from corporate results. 
 The indexes turned decidedly lower after the Federal Reserve released minutes of its June meeting, which indicated the pace of economic expansion through 2011 would be slower than first thought. 
 By the end of the day, the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index edged back up, just barely preserving a seven-day winning streak. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed less than a point lower.
 Paul Ballew, a former Federal Reserve economist who is a senior vice president for Nationwide Insurance, said the Fed remarks sent a message to the market it was cautious about the recovery.
 He said the market had been fragile for the last few months as the Standard & Poor's index approached 1,200 with the economic growth under pressure. ''The market is digesting all that,'' Mr. Ballew said. ''So we expect this to be a bit of an uneven ride here in the second half.''
 The Fed report ''encouraged some profit-taking on short dollar positions,'' said Marc Chandler, the global head of currency strategy for Brown Brothers Harriman. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 3.70 points, or 0.04 percent, at 10,366.72, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 0.17 of a point, to 1,095.17. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.81 points, or 0.35 percent, to 2,249.84. The index was helped by results from Intel, the world's largest computer chip maker, which announced record sales during its second quarter and forecast that sales in its third quarter would end up far better than expected, as large companies finally started to buy new PCs. Intel's shares were up 35 cents, to $21.36. Cisco Systems rose 65 cents, to $23.74.
 The rally of the last six days has brought the market only part of the way back to its high in late April. ''In my view, stocks could rebound more over the next few days given how depressed shares were ahead of earnings season,'' Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading for Guggenheim Partners, said in a research note. 
 A report on Wednesday on retail sales also offered a reminder that the recovery would be slow. The Commerce Department reported that retail spending dropped 0.5 percent in June. Shares of J. C. Penney, Macy's and Target all pulled back after the report, though much of the drop in retail sales was the result of a fall in auto sales. 
 ''Looking ahead, with household balance sheets still overleveraged, the key determinant of consumer spending growth going forward will be the pace of the recovery in the labor market,'' Joshua Shapiro, the chief United States economist for MFR, said in a research note.
 There were positive signs in the report as department stores posted a 1.1 percent gain in sales. But the underlying trend of the data suggests only modest growth because of the tight jobs outlook. Also, the Census Bureau said on Wednesday that inventories rose 0.1 percent in May, the smallest gain this year.
 Nick Kalivas, the vice president of financial research at MF Global, said that technology earnings were strong but stocks had given up some gains. New concerns have emerged over the banking sector after Whitney Holding warned Tuesday that it expected to record a provision for credit losses, he said. 
 ''The majority of the second quarter's provision expense continues to be related to ongoing issues in the commercial and residential real estate markets in Florida,'' the bank holding company said in a statement. It also set aside reserves for the effect of the oil spill on tourism along the Gulf of Mexico. The company's shares fell $1.79, to $8.18.
 Technology, industrials and consumer staples stocks rose. 
 Financial stocks ended down almost 1 percent. Citigroup fell 9 cents, to $4.21. Regions Financial dropped 23 cents, to $7.15, and PNC lost $1.45, to $61.29. 
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 21/32, to 103 27/32. The yield fell to 3.04 percent, from 3.12 percent late Tuesday.
 Crude oil prices were little changed, ending down 11 cents, at $77.04, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
 In Europe, the FTSE 100 in London was down 17.50 points, or 0.33 percent, to 5,253.52, while the DAX in Frankfurt rose 18.63 points, or 0.30 percent, to 6,209.76. The CAC 40 in Paris fell 4.78 points, or 0.13 percent, to 3,632.98.

HEADLINE: The Google Algorithm

 BODY:
Google handles nearly two-thirds of Internet search queries worldwide. Analysts reckon that most Web sites rely on the search engine for half of their traffic. When Google engineers tweak its supersecret algorithm -- as they do hundreds of times a year -- they can break the business of a Web site that is pushed down the rankings. 
 When Google was a pure search engine, it was easy to appear agnostic about search results, with no reason to play favorites with one Web site or another. But as Google has branched out into online services from maps and videos to comparison shopping, it has acquired pecuniary incentives to favor its own over rivals.
 Google argues that its behavior is kept in check by competitors like Yahoo or Bing. But Google has become the default search engine for many Internet users. Competitors are a click away, but a case is building for some sort of oversight of the gatekeeper of the Internet.
 In the past few months, Google has come under investigation by antitrust regulators in Europe. Rivals have accused Google of placing the Web sites of affiliates like Google Maps or YouTube at the top of Internet searches and relegating competitors to obscurity down the list. In the United States, Google said it expects antitrust regulators to scrutinize its $700 million purchase of the flight information software firm ITA, with which it plans to enter the online travel search market occupied by Expedia, Orbitz, Bing and others.
 The accusations in Europe may or may not have merit. Google says it only tweaks its algorithm to improve its searches. Some Web sites that have accused Google of unfair placing are merely collections of links with next to no original content of their own, precisely the kind of sites that Google's search algorithm screens out to better answer queries. Antitrust regulators in the United States could well let Google buy ITA because it does not now provide online travel services.
 Still, the potential impact of Google's algorithm on the Internet economy is such that it is worth exploring ways to ensure that the editorial policy guiding Google's tweaks is solely intended to improve the quality of the results and not to help Google's other businesses.
 Some early suggestions for how to accomplish this include having Google explain with some specified level of detail the editorial policy that guides its tweaks. Another would be to give some government commission the power to look at those tweaks. 
 Google provides an incredibly valuable service, and the government must be careful not to stifle its ability to innovate. Forcing it to publish the algorithm or the method it uses to evaluate it would allow every Web site to game the rules in order to climb up the rankings -- destroying its value as a search engine. Requiring each algorithm tweak to be approved by regulators could drastically slow down its improvements. Forbidding Google to favor its own services -- such as when it offers a Google Map to queries about addresses -- might reduce the value of its searches.
 With these caveats in mind, if Google is to continue to be the main map to the information highway, it concerns us all that it leads us fairly to where we want to go.

HEADLINE: G.M. to Offer 8-Year Guarantee for New Electric Car's Battery

BYLINE: By TOM ZELLER Jr.

 BODY:
In an effort to lure early adopters who might hesitate at dropping more than $30,000 on a mass-market electric car, General Motors said on Wednesday that it would guarantee the battery on its forthcoming Chevy Volt for eight years or 100,000 miles -- better than the typical five-year or 100,000-mile warranty it typically offers for the powertrain on its conventional cars. 
 The warranty will cover all 161 battery components, according to Tony DiSalle, the marketing director for the Volt, as well as other electric-drive components and the battery's liquid thermal management system, which heats or cools the battery while charging in a variety of weather conditions. 
 Battery warranties within the nascent electric vehicle market have been a matter of much speculation -- not least because consumers familiar with lithium-ion technology in cellphones, computer laptops and other devices learned long ago that the batteries can be finicky, lose their charge and eventually die.
 ''Everybody has been sensitized to batteries and battery-life issues,'' said Philip G. Gott, director of automotive consulting for IHS Global Insights, a market research firm. ''You don't want to be stuck with a four-year-old car that needs $4,000 worth of work.'' 
 G.M.'s move will probably set the bar for competitors like Nissan, the Japanese car giant, which plans to begin rolling out its Leaf electric vehicle this year. Nissan has not yet revealed its warranty terms but has said they will be competitive. 
 Tesla, a Silicon Valley-based maker of electric cars, provides a three-year or 36,000-mile warranty on its Roadster sports car. 
 The Volt and the Leaf are at the leading edge of a major introduction of electric vehicle technology in the United States, even though a public infrastructure for charging the cars is far from being sorted out. Both cars will include some form of home-charging system. 
 The Volt is expected to be available for retail sale in four markets -- California, the District of Columbia, the New York City metropolitan area and Austin, Tex. -- by the end of the year, with availability in all 50 states aimed for 12 to 15 months after that. 
 G.M. said this month that it planned to produce 10,000 Volts by the end of next year, with an additional 30,000 cars planned for 2012. 
 The official retail price for the Volt -- which has an advertised range of up to 40 miles on a single charge, plus a gasoline-assisted ''range extender'' feature -- has not yet been announced, but estimates are in the range of $35,000 to $40,000. Federal tax credits are likely to shave off several thousand dollars for many buyers. 
 The Nissan Leaf, a fully electric car with a marketed range of up to 100 miles per charge, will retail for just under $33,000, and the same credits could help. 
 The warranty announcement came a day ahead of President Obama's arrival in Holland, Mich., where he will attend groundbreaking ceremonies for a new plant that will manufacture the Volt's battery packs. 
 The battery company, Compact Power, is a subsidiary of the South Korean battery maker LG Chem, and the plant is expected to employ roughly 300 people. Ford Motor announced this week that it, too, would be using batteries manufactured by Compact Power in the electric version of its Ford Focus, which it plans to begin marketing next year. 
 The Obama administration carved out $2.4 billion in grants from last year's economic stimulus package to help pay for research and production on advanced battery and electric vehicles. That money has gone to some four dozen projects developing batteries and electric drive-train components in over 20 states. 
 About half of the estimated $300 million price tag for the Compact Power site, which is to open in 2012, came from the stimulus grants. 
 Beyond creating sorely needed manufacturing jobs, the administration has hoped to drive down the costs of advanced battery technology, which will play a significant role in the clean-energy economy well beyond the transportation sector. 
 Energy storage could also help make wind and solar power a more practical and streamlined part of the diversifying electric grid -- largely by collecting the excess energy created at times of high winds and ample sunshine, and then delivering it back to the power grid when conditions are less favorable. 
 Administration officials have been visiting a variety of sites that received funds as part of last year's Recovery Act. Last week, the president visited Smith Electric Vehicles, an all-electric truck manufacturer in Kansas City, Mo. Smith received a $32 million stimulus grant to help it reconfigure a former jet engine plant at the Kansas City International Airport for building its zero-emissions trucks.
 ''All told, we expect energy investments alone to generate 700,000 jobs over the next few years,'' Mr. Obama told the crowd during the Smith visit. ''And this is not just going to boost our economy in the short term,'' he said. ''This is going to lay a platform for the future.''

HEADLINE: Russia Plan To Help Iran Challenges Sanctions

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia's energy minister announced a broad program of cooperation with Iran in the oil, natural gas and petrochemical industries on Wednesday that appeared to invite Russian companies to contravene sanctions the Obama administration adopted just two weeks ago. 
 The sanctions were meant to be an additional means of punishing Iran for refusing to unwind its secretive nuclear program after the United States was able to persuade Russia and China to agree to only limited new trade restrictions in a fourth United Nations Security Council resolution against Iran, passed in June. Australia, Canada and Europe also decided to put additional measures against Iran in place.
 While clearly intended to discourage the type of investment the Russian minister discussed, the United States sanctions law provides a presidential waiver for companies in countries otherwise seen as cooperating in discouraging Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. 
 Iran, though a major exporter of crude oil, imports tens of thousands of gallons of gasoline daily to make up for its faltering refining capacity, limited by years of international isolation.
 The American sanctions impose penalties on foreign entities that sell refined petroleum to Iran or assist Iran with its domestic refining capacity, a focus intended to exact a harsh financial toll on the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, the hard-line group that oversees the country's nuclear and missile programs and controls much of its oil industry.
 Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, voiced opposition to adding any sanctions beyond those imposed by the United Nations, and the Foreign Ministry warned the United States against trying to punish Russian companies under the new unilateral sanctions.
 On Wednesday, Russia's minister of fuel and energy took the most overt stance against the American sanctions so far, announcing the plans for closer cooperation between Russian and Iranian petroleum interests.
 The minister, Sergei I. Shmatko, met in Moscow with his Iranian counterpart, Massoud Mir-Kazemi, and issued a joint statement praising ''active cooperation between Russian and Iranian companies in the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors, which are developing and widening in their joint work.''
 But it was unclear how immediately action would be taken. The Russian statement suggested that a working group be formed to identify areas of deeper cooperation in the oil and petrochemical industries, proposing a study for a Russian-Iranian joint venture oil company and a binational bank to finance such projects. The statement suggested Iran market its crude oil on Russian commodity exchanges.
 The oil dealings between the countries would force the United States to make difficult choices only if Russian companies followed through on the broad plans with specific agreements, Cliff Kupchan, a research director at the Eurasia Group, said in a telephone interview.
 And this seemed unlikely, at least at the moment, he said, given the recent warming in bilateral relations with the United States, Russian backing for the United Nations sanctions against Iran and the successful spy swap this month.
 Sergei A. Karaganov, a dean of the faculty of international relations at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said Russia would resist sanctions that could harm the economic well-being of a wide portion of Iran's population and add to political turmoil. 
 The gasoline embargo imposed by the United States could do both, Mr. Karaganov said.

HEADLINE: Singapore Forecasts 15% Economic Growth

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Singapore is on pace to be among the world's fastest-growing economies this year, after a spurt in the first half prompted the government on Wednesday to project an expansion of as much as 15 percent for 2010. That would be four times the pace at which the United States economy is expected to grow.
The new forecast, issued by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, is much higher than its earlier estimates of 7 to 9 percent growth and highlights the speed with which many parts of the Asia-Pacific region are bouncing back from the global financial downturn. 
With the notable exception of Japan, most of the region is experiencing solid growth this year, even though momentum is likely to ebb as the year progresses.
Australia also raised its projection on Wednesday for economic growth, to 2.25 percent for the year, from a previous forecast of 2 percent.
And Thailand nudged up its main interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to 1.5 percent, joining the half-dozen other Asia-Pacific countries that have begun to raise borrowing costs in recent months as their economies have picked up steam.
China, at 10.5 percent, and India, at 9.4 percent, have the fastest-growing major economies in the region, according to projections issued by the International Monetary Fund last week.
Analysts expect that statistics to be released Thursday will show that the Chinese economy expanded 10.5 percent in the second quarter, from the level of a year earlier -- a slightly softer pace than the 11.9 percent expansion in the first quarter.
Still, it easily outpaced growth elsewhere in the world. The I.M.F. expects the United States to grow only 3.3 percent this year and the euro zone to manage a mere 1 percent.
Singapore is one of the Asia-Pacific region's most open economies, serving as a major financial center and as an important production and research hub for pharmaceuticals and electronics.
Singapore's dependence on overseas demand meant its economy was hit particularly hard by the global financial crisis -- the economy contracted 1.3 percent last year -- but it also means it is now exceptionally well positioned for a rebound.
Data for the second quarter of this year, released Wednesday, showed that the Singaporean economy had soared 19.3 percent from the same quarter a year earlier and 26 percent on a quarter-on-quarter annualized basis -- streaking past analysts' expectations.
The main driver was the manufacturing sector, which expanded 46 percent, thanks to gains in biomedical production, as well as strong growth in the electronics cluster, which benefited from healthy worldwide demand, the Ministry of Trade and Industry said.
The services sector benefited from tourism inflows after the opening of two casino resorts this year.
''The casinos obviously did their bit,'' Frederic Neumann, regional economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, said in a note. ''We have long been bullish on Singapore's growth outlook this year. But these numbers are running well ahead of even our estimates'' of 9.7 percent growth in gross domestic product this year.
''Exports and broader activity, of course, are bound to slow over the second half of the year,'' he added. ''Still, domestic demand continues to expand briskly, which should help to offset some of the emerging weakness in export markets.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 2010, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on July 15 about economic expansion in Singapore reported its second-quarter growth incorrectly. The economy expanded 19.3 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, not from the first quarter, and 26 percent on a quarter-on-quarter annualized basis, not from the second quarter of 2009.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Soliciting Comment On Investor Proxy System

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission said Wednesday that it wanted to hear from the public about several issues related to the proxy system, the process by which shareholders elect directors and vote on corporate governance proposals. 
 The commission voted unanimously to issue what it calls a concept release, which seeks comment on three broad areas of the proxy system: the accuracy, transparency and efficiency of the voting process; communications and shareholder participation; and the relationship between voting power and economic interest.
 The inquiry could lead to the first overhaul of the system in 30 years.
 Commissioners noted on Wednesday that significant changes had occurred in recent decades in shareholder demographics, technology and the structure of share holdings.
 The S.E.C. chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, said the commission was also seeking information about the role of proxy advisory firms, which advise institutional shareholders, like pension funds, how to vote on corporate matters.
 ''Both companies and investors have raised concerns that proxy advisory firms may be subject to undisclosed conflicts of interest, may fail to conduct adequate research or may base recommendations on erroneous or incomplete facts,'' Ms. Schapiro said, adding that the inquiry ''will fully probe these issues.''
 The commission has been examining the proxy system for some time. It has proposed a rule that would require a company, under certain circumstances, to include in its proxy materials a shareholder's or group's nominees for director. 
 Also, the financial regulation bill approved by the House of Representative and awaiting final action in the Senate authorizes the S.E.C. to issue rules that would give shareholders the ability to nominate directors and make use of company proxy materials. 
 Comments on the proxy issues will be accepted for 90 days at www.sec.gov.

HEADLINE: A Mining Bellwether

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

 BODY:
BLAIR, W.Va. -- Federal officials are considering whether to veto mountaintop mining above a little Appalachian valley called Pigeonroost Hollow, a step that could be a turning point for one of the country's most contentious environmental disputes. 
 The Army Corps of Engineers approved a permit in 2007 to blast 400 feet off the hilltops here to expose the rich coal seams, disposing of the debris in the upper reaches of six valleys, including Pigeonroost Hollow.
 But the Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration, in a break with President George W. Bush's more coal-friendly approach, has threatened to halt or sharply scale back the project known as Spruce 1. The agency asserts that the project would irrevocably damage streams and wildlife and violate the Clean Water Act. 
 Because it is one of the largest mountaintop mining projects ever and because it has been hotly disputed for a dozen years, Spruce 1 is seen as a bellwether by conservation groups and the coal industry. 
 The fate of the project could also have national reverberations, affecting Democratic Party prospects in coal states. While extensive research and public hearings on the plan have been completed, federal officials said that their final decision would not be announced until late this year -- perhaps, conveniently, after the midterm elections. 
 Environmental groups say that approval of the project in anything like its current form would be a betrayal.
 ''Spruce 1 is a test of whether the E.P.A. is going to follow through with its promises,'' said Bill Price, director of environmental justice with the Sierra Club in West Virginia.
 ''If the administration sticks to its guns,'' Mr. Price predicted, ''mountaintop removal is going to be severely curtailed.''
 Coal companies say politics, not science, is threatening a practice vital to local economies and energy independence. ''After years of study, with the company doing everything any agency asked, and three years after a permit was issued, the E.P.A. now wants to stop Spruce 1,'' said Bill Raney, president of the West Virginia Coal Association. ''It's political; the only thing that has changed is the administration.'' 
 While the government does not collect statistics on mountaintop mining, data suggest that it may account for about 10 percent of American coal output, yielding 5 percent of the nation's electricity. The method plays a bigger economic role in the two states where it is concentrated, Kentucky and West Virginia. 
 The proposal to strip a large area above the home of 70-year-old Jimmy Weekley, Pigeonroost Hollow's last remaining inhabitant, was first made in 1997 by Arch Coal, Inc., of St. Louis. The legal ups and downs of Spruce 1 have come to symbolize the broader battle over a method that produces inexpensive coal while drastically altering the landscape. 
 Spruce 1 started as the largest single proposal ever for hilltop mining, in which mountains are carved off to expose coal seams and much of the debris, often leaking toxic substances, is placed in adjacent valleys. 
 After years of negotiations and a scaling back of the mining area to 2,278 acres, from its original 3,113 acres, the Spruce 1 permit was approved by the Army Corps of Engineers in 2007 and limited construction began. But this spring, the E.P.A. proposed halting the project.
 The announcement caused an uproar in West Virginia. The E.P.A. held an emotional public hearing in May and stopped accepting written comments in June. Arch Coal has objected publicly, but did not respond to requests to comment for this article. 
 The Obama administration's E.P.A. has already riled the coal companies by tightening procedures for issuing new mining permits and imposing stronger stream protections. But environmental groups were worried in June, when the agency approved a curtailed mountaintop plan in another site in Logan County, W.Va. Now, as negotiations between the E.P.A. and Arch Coal continue, the Spruce 1 battle is being closely watched as a sign of mountaintop mining's future. 
 Feelings run high in the counties right around the project area. 
 ''Spruce 1 is extremely important to all of southern West Virginia because if this permit is pulled back, every mine site is going to be vulnerable to having its permits pulled,'' said James Milan, manager of Walker Machinery in Logan, which sells gargantuan Caterpillar equipment. 
 The loss of jobs, Mr. Milan said, would have devastating effects on struggling communities. 
 Maria Gunnoe, an organizer for the Ohio Valley Environmental Coalition and a director of SouthWings, which organizes flights to document environmental damages, said that if Spruce 1 went forward, ''it's going to mean the permanent erasure of part of our land and our legacy.''
 ''We can't keep blowing up mountains to keep the lights on,'' said Ms. Gunnoe, a resident of nearby Boone County who has received death threats and travels with a 9 millimeter pistol. 
 Mr. Weekley, whose house is in sight of the project boundary, remembers the day in 1997 when he decided to fight it. Nearby mining under previous permits had filled his wooded valley with dust and noise.
 ''You couldn't see out of this hollow,'' he recalled. ''I said, Something's got to be done or we're not going to have a community left.'' 
 He and his late wife became plaintiffs in a 2008 suit claiming that the project violated environmental laws. A ruling in their favor was overturned, setting off litigation that continues. 
 Mr. Weekley said that he had rejected offers of close to $2 million for his eight acres and that he had seen the population of the nearby town of Blair dwindle to 60 from 600, with most residents bought out by Arch Coal. 
 A rail-thin man who enjoys sitting on his porch with a dog on his lap, Mr. Weekley uttered an expletive when told that coal industry representatives, including Mr. Raney in an interview, referred to the upper tributaries filled in by mining as ''ditches'' that can be rebuilt. In fact, some of the streams to be filled by Spruce 1 are intermittent, while others, including Pigeonroost Creek, flow year-round. 
 ''I caught fish in that stream as a child, using a safety pin for a hook,'' Mr. Weekley said. ''If they get that permit, there won't be a stream here.'' 
 In documents issued in March, the E.P.A. said the project as approved would still smother seven miles of streambed. 
 Filling in headwaters damages the web of life downstream, from aquatic insects to salamanders to fish, and temporary channels and rebuilt streams are no substitute, the agency said. The pulverized rock can release toxic levels of selenium and other pollutants, it noted. 
 The effects of Spruce 1 would be added to those of 34 other past and present projects that together account for more than one-third of the area of the Spruce Fork watershed, the agency said. 
 The debate over Spruce 1 and other mountaintop mine permits has been a source of division and anguish among local residents. 
 Michael Fox, 39, of Gilbert, is a mine worker who like many other miners here thinks the objections are overblown. ''I have three kids I want to send to college,'' Mr. Fox said. 
 One former mountaintop miner who says he now regrets his involvement is Charles Bella, 60. He is one of the remaining residents on Blair's main street, along the Spruce Fork, which is fed in turn by Pigeonroost Creek. 
 ''I know it put bread on my table, but I hate destroying the mountains like that,'' Mr. Bella said.

 At least, that's what he will tell you over lunch at the Park Avenue headquarters of JPMorgan Chase, the descendant of the House of Morgan that came through the global financial crisis bigger, stronger and healthier than its rivals.
 But taking a victory lap, or even basking in the adulation he has received while his fellow bank chiefs have been pounded, is the last thing Mr. Dimon claims to want. He knows all too well the dangers of swaggering in the footsteps of former Wall Street kings like Sanford I. Weill, his onetime mentor, who helped build Citigroup into an institution so unwieldy it nearly went bankrupt, or Lloyd C. Blankfein, the Goldman Sachs chief whose crown has been tarnished by accusations of double-dealing under his watch. 
 Instead, Mr. Dimon worries openly that new financial regulations, which are expected to be passed by the Senate on Thursday and signed by Mr. Obama shortly thereafter, will cost his bank billions and that the jittery economy may suffer another setback. And that rivals, lurking in every corner of the world, are devising new ways to ''clean our clocks.'' 
 In fact, in a lunchtime interview, his outlook was so cautious, his tone so subdued, that it prompted a senior aide to gently interrupt: ''Jamie, how about mentioning a few of our positives, too?''
 For all the talk of gloom and doom, the postcrisis era looks brighter than Mr. Dimon is willing to acknowledge. In Washington, the financial industry was largely successful in blunting the toughest legislative proposals. On Wall Street, the deluge of losses is slowing and ultra-low interest rates are helping all banks make money. 
 JPMorgan, in particular, is poised to increase its profit and gain market share in several businesses as many of its competitors continue to struggle to get back on their feet. 
 The crisis cemented Mr. Dimon's reputation as a financial superstar -- a bold dealmaker who buys when others are selling, a strict risk manager who resisted the type of exotic businesses that felled others and a charismatic leader who charms lawmakers and credit traders alike. He is now commonly referred to by a single name, like Pele or Madonna. 
 ''Right now, there are virtually no giants on Wall Street except maybe Jamie,'' said David M. Rubenstein, a founder of the Carlyle Group and a longtime financial and political hand.
 Mr. Dimon earned that distinction by playing as much defense as offense during the housing boom, which insulated JPMorgan more than most when the boom went bust. Then, when the bust became a full-blown financial crisis, Mr. Dimon went hunting for bargains, significantly expanding his position in investment and retail banking while others were shrinking.
 Now, those efforts are paying off. Even with a slowdown in trading, analysts are forecasting a profit of 70 cents a share when JPMorgan reports its second-quarter earnings on Thursday, about the same as a year ago.
 At age 54, Mr. Dimon has only begun trying to build the kind of global banking empire he initially set out to create with Mr. Weill at Citigroup. While JPMorgan's share price fared better than most of the banking sector through the turbulence of the last few years, at around $40.35, it remains roughly where it was when Mr. Dimon took over as chief executive in December 2005.
 And analysts point out that while JPMorgan's overall operation is in better shape than most, the bank does not enjoy a top position in any single business. 
 ''They are not Wells Fargo when it comes to retail banking. They are not American Express when it comes to credit cards. They are not BlackRock when it comes to asset management,'' said Michael Mayo of Credit Agricole Securities. ''And JPMorgan is not Goldman Sachs in emerging markets.''
 Mr. Dimon is trying to make up that lost ground. Over the last three years, he has plowed more than $10 billion into his main businesses. He recently announced plans to build up his corporate bank and make an aggressive push into Brazil, China and a dozen or so other emerging markets that were growing at a faster pace than developed economies. That would put him toe to toe with banks like Citigroup, HSBC and Standard Chartered, which have been in these markets for decades. 
 ''We are prepared, and we are already good at it,'' says Mr. Dimon, ever-confident but also careful not to overpromise. (He notes the plan will unfold over several years.) 
 It is an approach right out of the Dimon playbook, mixing competitive paranoia with hardball deal-making and careful management of investor expectations. He made a name for himself as Mr. Weill's young operations whiz, helping assemble Citigroup in the late 1990s through a series of flashy mergers. After arriving at Bank One in 2000, he spent the next few years fixing the ailing regional lender. Then, after Bank One's merger with JPMorgan in 2004, he orchestrated a similar turnaround.
 He spent three years stitching together the banks' disparate computer systems and getting a handle on the financial risks lurking on its balance sheet. Every step of the way, he told investors that he was focused not on lifting quarterly profits but on building a strong company for the long haul. Mr. Dimon has refined that formula in recent years, seizing more than a few opportunities to reposition his bank while his rivals were in deep distress.
 With his purchase of the teetering Bear Stearns -- subsidized by taxpayers and steeply discounted at $10 a share -- Mr. Dimon filled in crucial gaps in his investment bank. Where JPMorgan had traditionally been a big bond house, the addition of Bear invigorated its stock and commodities trading operations and added a lucrative prime brokerage business, which provides financing to hedge funds, that had been high on his wish list. 
 He took Washington Mutual off the government's hands for a mere $1.9 billion, giving his retail bank a giant share of the nation's deposits and turning it, overnight, into a major player in California. (It helped, of course, that nobody else entered a bid.) 
 As panic gripped the financial industry, consumers and big corporations saw JPMorgan as a safe place to park their cash, even if it meant accepting a savings rate close to zero percent. With few competitors free to lend, JPMorgan's bankers demanded big premiums from corporate borrowers to finance deals. 
 While rivals were retrenching during the crisis, Mr. Dimon ordered his lieutenants to expand. Although they closed scores of Washington Mutual branches, Chase opened more than 300 new retail locations over the last three years and added about 3,000 bankers to its ranks. One of every 13 bank branches opened since 2009 has been a Chase branch, according to SNL Financial. 
 Chase Card Services, meanwhile, has introduced three new types of credit cards in the last year. In the second quarter alone, it mailed out an estimated 164 million applications, according to data from Synovate, a research firm. That was more than twice the number sent out by American Express, the next most active issuer, and made up nearly one-third of the industry's total mailings.
 When the head of the credit card division offered to scale back as losses spiraled, Mr. Dimon was emphatically opposed. ''We don't want to do stupid things because we are losing a lot of money,'' Mr. Dimon said, anticipating a rebound in the card business. ''Hell no. We are going to do the right thing as fast as we can.''
 Mr. Dimon was aggressive in dealing with Washington, too. Whereas the heads of Citigroup and Bank of America struck a conciliatory tone with policy makers, Mr. Dimon was downright confrontational. JPMorgan's 12-person Washington office was spending more than $7.7 million on lobbying over the last five quarters, more than any other bank, according to the Center for Public Integrity. 
 Meanwhile, in speeches and in private meetings with lawmakers, he criticized credit card legislation, protested a proposed bank tax and complained that JPMorgan -- which, he reminded them, accepted bailout funds with reluctance -- was being unfairly punished for the sins of its competitors.
 The result? A sweeping financial overhaul bill that most analysts say will not fundamentally change the way the industry does business. Many of the harshest measures were significantly watered down or delayed. JPMorgan, for example, will be allowed to retain its giant hedge fund unit, Highbridge Capital Management, and its status as a derivatives powerhouse.
 Despite his semi-victory, Mr. Dimon says being the chief is less fun these days, now that politics are so intertwined with his job. 
 Mr. Dimon insists that the closeness of his relationship with Mr. Obama has been ''greatly exaggerated,'' as was the portrayal of any fallout with the White House. Still, he remains adamant that Washington's ''indiscriminate vilification'' of all banks was wrong. 
 ''What I object to is the blanketing blame,'' he said. ''I think it is not accurate and leads to bad policy.''

HEADLINE: Senate Democrats to Pursue a Smaller Energy Package

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama and Senate Democrats have decided to press ahead in the next two weeks with a scaled-back energy bill that limits carbon pollution by power plants but not by other industries in an effort to salvage the legislation before midterm elections.
 After months of gridlock, the White House and Democratic leaders have concluded that the sweeping measure they once envisioned cannot pass, so they will try to get what they can rather than pass nothing at all. The developing plan is intended to appeal to enough Republicans to overcome a filibuster but could disappoint liberals who argue that more needs to be done. 
 ''If not now, when?'' said Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, who plans to bring the compromise bill to the Senate floor the week of July 26. ''We have to move to do something about our dependence on foreign oil. That's what this legislation is all about.'' 
 Mr. Reid also presented it as a way to further stimulate the economy, saying, ''This as I've indicated is a huge jobs bill.'' 
 The strategy of pushing forward with a more limited bill acknowledges the complicated politics in the Senate and the short time on the clock with elections approaching. 
 While the House last year passed a measure capping the greenhouse gases blamed for climate change across the economy, the White House and its Senate allies will push only to limit those from electric utilities, which are responsible for about a third of the emissions produced by the United States.
 Such a measure would allow Mr. Obama to make a down payment on his larger goal.
 ''He's always believed there should be an economywide solution but recognizes that may not be where we are,'' Carol M. Browner, the president's energy and climate adviser, said in an interview. ''Getting started is hugely important, and he's willing to work with senators in that direction.''
 Passage would also give the president another legislative victory following the overhaul of the health care system passed in March and new regulations for Wall Street expected to pass this week. And House Democrats said it would be a relief for them to have at least something pass since they have been left trying to explain politically dicey votes for the broader cap.
 It remains far from certain, however, that Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid can win passage even for the limited legislation. Most Republicans remain firm in their opposition to any cap on emissions, and six Democrats recently joined an effort by Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, to pass a resolution criticizing new Environmental Protection Agency rules relating to greenhouse gases.
 ''Senator Murkowski won't support a utility cap-and-trade bill because it raises energy prices on Americans at a time when they are already struggling financially,'' said Robert Dillon, a spokesman for the senator. ''It's a light-switch tax.''
 Moreover, the utility industry has expressed reservations or sought concessions, like pulling back on new pollution rules in other areas, something White House officials rejected last week at a meeting with industry representatives on Capitol Hill.
 The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association ''has consistently called for an economywide approach,'' said Tracy Warren, a group spokeswoman.
 Some environmental advocates said they were resigned to the new approach. ''Is it adequate to address the problem? No,'' said Daniel J. Weiss, the director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research organization. ''Is it a good plan to start, given where we are with the calendar and politically? Yes.''
 By some calculations, the White House and Senate Democrats have only until the August recess to pass a meaningful energy bill this year. Few expect serious legislation to pass in the fall with members focusing on re-election campaigns.
 Mr. Obama has been pushing for the legislation by meeting with senators and holding events to highlight clean-energy projects. He plans to fly to Holland, Mich., on Thursday for the groundbreaking of a plant manufacturing batteries for electric cars, financed in part by his stimulus program.
 Several senators, including John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, are trying to create specific plans to draw enough votes across the aisle. 
 Mr. Reid outlined four main elements: responding to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, promoting greater energy efficiency, developing more clean-energy production and curbing power plant emissions.
 He said he was prepared to incorporate a plan championed by T. Boone Pickens, the oil and gas executive, to sharply expand the use of natural gas as a transportation fuel in large vehicle fleets. The proposal, supported by Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, would provide tax breaks for natural-gas-powered vehicles and fueling stations. 
 ''This legislation, it's not all green stuff -- you know, Sierra Club stuff,'' Mr. Reid said. ''We're importing 70 percent of the oil that we use. We have a need to change the paradigm in America. And that is, we need to have a move to renewable energy.'' 
 The White House and Senate Democratic leaders hope to appeal to several Republicans, like Senators Olympia J. Snowe and Susan M. Collins of Maine, Scott Brown of Massachusetts, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and George LeMieux of Florida. 
 Democrats said that if the utility cap was drawn narrowly enough, they hoped to win over Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who helped draft the initial plan by Mr. Kerry and Mr. Lieberman before withdrawing his support.
 But Democratic aides conceded that they could lose even more Democrats from coal-producing states. If the utility cap fails to win the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster, the White House and Senate Democrats will be faced with a tough choice: go ahead with the rest of the bill or pull the whole thing. 
 Some Democratic senators worry that a so-called energy-only bill investing in alternative-energy development without any limits on carbon emissions would effectively give away the popular policy items necessary for any eventual deal.

HEADLINE: Fed Leaders Show Split On Deflation

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve disclosed on Wednesday that its chief policy makers were divided on whether the weak economy faced a new, potentially dangerous threat in the form of deflation. 
 The dissent within the Fed emerged as the White House released a report estimating that its economic stimulus program had saved or created 2.5 million to 3.6 million jobs since it was enacted, over nearly unanimous Republican opposition, at the start of President Obama's term. 
 The estimates in the report were in line with those of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and independent experts. But Senate Republicans, who have blocked legislation to extend unemployment benefits, continued to portray the administration as fiscally reckless and the stimulus as ineffective. 
 ''I know what they're against, but I don't know what they're for,'' Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said of the Republicans as he unveiled the report. ''I mean that literally.'' 
 With Congress deadlocked over fiscal policy, attention has shifted to monetary policy as a tool for attacking the 9.5 percent unemployment rate. But on that score, the Fed is also divided, though its disagreements are expressed in a far more genteel manner. 
 On Wednesday, the Fed lowered its estimate of economic growth for this year, to a range of 3 to 3.5 percent, from the 3.2 percent to 3.7 percent forecast in April. Inflation has been running well below the Fed's unofficial target of nearly 2 percent, so much so that a few officials fear that the United States is at risk of the kind of deflationary spiral that has hobbled the Japanese economy for the better part of two decades. 
 The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has not embraced that view, but even those who disagree with it say the Fed, whose modern institutional culture was built around fighting inflation, now confronts a distinctly different problem of high joblessness.
 ''If federal fiscal policy is approaching its political or economic limits, some believe that the Federal Reserve should do more, including expansion of its balance sheet,'' Kevin M. Warsh, a Fed governor who is close to Mr. Bernanke, said in a recent speech to the Atlanta Rotary Club. ''In my view, any judgment to expand the balance sheet further,'' by acquiring mortgage bonds and debt, ''should be subject to strict scrutiny.''
 The central bank has already held interest rates lower for longer than at any time since the Great Depression, keeping the benchmark short-term interest rate near zero since December 2008. Since the start of the financial crisis, the Fed has more than doubled its balance sheet, to $2.3 trillion, by buying mortgage bonds and Treasury debt to keep long-term interest rates low. 
 But, as Mr. Bernanke pointed out in a speech in 2002, when he was a Fed governor, a central bank that has run out of ordinary tools to prop up the economy, like lowering short-term interest rates, still has other options to prevent deflation. 
 By resuming its purchases of assets or by being more explicit about its intentions to keep interest rates low, the Fed could lower inflation expectations and long-term interest rates. That could further stimulate borrowing and spending by companies and individuals.
 The minutes released Wednesday from the June 22-23 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's crucial policy body, cited the threat of deflation in the United States for the first time in a year. 
 ''A few participants cited some risk of deflation,'' the minutes noted. ''Other participants, however, thought that inflation was unlikely to fall appreciably further, given the stability of inflation expectations in recent years and very accommodative monetary policy.'' 
 The minutes, which are carefully worded to avoid the appearance of discord, nonetheless made clear a growing divergence in views. 
 ''Several participants noted that a continuation of lower-than-expected inflation and high unemployment could eventually lead to a downward movement in inflation expectations that would reinforce disinflationary pressure,'' the minutes stated. ''By contrast, a few participants noted the possibility that a potentially unsustainable fiscal position and the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet could boost inflation expectations and actual inflation over time.'' 
 The direction of monetary policy will probably be raised at a hearing on Thursday, at which the Senate Banking Committee will take up the nominations of Janet L. Yellen, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; Peter A. Diamond, an economist; and Sarah Bloom Raskin, a banking regulator, to seats on the Fed's seven-member board of governors. 
 While the Fed debate continues, the White House is combating skepticism over the $787 billion stimulus program. 
 In the latest CBSNews poll, almost three-quarters of Americans said the stimulus had not improved the economy. A new poll by The Washington Post and ABC also found that more than half of respondents said the government should not provide additional stimulus.
 ''More debt only subtracts capital from the private markets that could be used for loans, to hire more people and create more jobs,'' Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, the chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, said in an interview. 
 He said the administration's proposals on health care, regulation, energy and trade had discouraged private sector growth. 
 To shore up support for the stimulus program, the White House has been promoting what Mr. Biden has called the ''summer of recovery.'' 
 The new report, by the Council of Economic Advisers, showed that the pace of fiscal stimulus had accelerated, with spending growing to $116 billion in the second quarter, from $108 billion in the first quarter and $80 billion in the final three months of 2009. 
 The report also estimated that gross domestic product, a measure of overall economic output, was 2.7 to 3.2 percent higher than it would have been without the stimulus. 
 ''I am absolutely confident we are moving in the right direction, absolutely confident,'' Mr. Biden said. He said federal money had been used to stimulate emerging industries like clean energy.
 ''None of this would have been possible if our friends on the other side -- as my mother would say, God love them -- our friends on the other side had gotten their way,'' Mr. Biden said.
 The report used historical data and statistical modeling to arrive at the estimate of jobs saved or created, but Christina D. Romer, chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledged that there was some uncertainty over the job estimates, which rely on reporting from recipients of federal aid. 
 ''I suspect the true effects of the act will not be fully analyzed or fully appreciated for many years,'' she said, adding that most experts agreed that the stimulus had had a ''significant, beneficial impact on employment and output over the past year.'' 
 Mr. Biden acknowledged public frustration over the economy, but noted that the crisis predated the administration. ''Before we walked in the West Wing, we were handed a deficit, a bill for that year, for over $1 trillion,'' he said.
 Real G.D.P. started growing in the second half of last year, and private sector payrolls have increased by nearly 600,000 since their low point in December. But that has been barely enough to keep pace with the normal rate of growth of the work force.

HEADLINE: For Concert Beast, Some Humble Pie

BYLINE: By ROB COX and EDWARD HADAS

 BODY:
 Who's still afraid of Live Nation? The January merger of America's leading concert promoter with the dominant ticket seller, Ticketmaster, was supposed to create a dangerously powerful monster in the rock 'n' roll business. That's why critics like Bruce Springsteen turned the dial up to 11 on their unsuccessful protests of the deal.
 But a handful of stumbles -- and a decline of as much as 40 percent in the value of the combined group since April -- have humbled the music behemoth, which is led by Irving Azoff, who is meeting Thursday with investors at Irving Plaza in Manhattan. 
 Ticket sales for the biggest musical acts, where Live Nation reaps the bulk of its money, have fallen short of expectations. This isn't simply a reflection of the economy's broader woes, though the concert industry is suffering. In the first half, the concert trade publication Pollstar estimated that ticket sales for the Top 100 tours fell 17 percent, to a combined gross of $966 million.
 But as Pollstar noted, ''Larger shows are feeling the economic pain more than their smaller counterparts.'' Club shows, it said, are still attracting sizable audiences.
 The worry for Live Nation is that while concert-goers may be avoiding the expensive, highly commercialized events the firm organizes in giant arenas for 40,000 or more fans at a time.
 There's evidence of this in the success of some less mainstream productions. For instance, the Electric Daisy Carnival, a two-day electronic music party, drew 185,000 people to the Los Angeles Coliseum. While the event was marred by the death of a teenager, apparently drug-related, its promoters are taking the show to Puerto Rico in August; tickets are $15 and $40 plus service fees.
 Or there's this weekend's Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago. Three-day passes, at the low cost of $90, sold out long ago. But the curators of the event at Pitchfork, the musical criticism Web site, said they were determined to cap ticket sales at 18,000 a day to keep the experience low-key, even if that means missing out on profit. On Wednesday, Pitchfork even asked customers needing to sell their tickets to ''do the right thing for the music community and only ask for face value'' rather than scalping them at a profit.
 As a big public company, Live Nation can't do business that way. Concert-goers, fed up with sky-high ticket prices and added Ticketmaster fees, may be starting to understand that. That's a risk Live Nation's executives must address at Thursday's meeting.
 A Little Optimism
 A strong economic recovery is beginning. Ask the folks at Intel. The chip maker is smiling because companies ''have some breathing room in the economy and their budgets,'' said Paul S. Otellini, the chief executive at Intel.
 Or, maybe it's the end of a weak recovery. Tom Albanese, chief executive of the mining company Rio Tinto, has noted ''fears about a possible double-dip recession'' in developed countries and ''a slight slowdown'' in China.
 Both chiefs are optimistic for the long term. Why not? If their companies can enrich most of the world's five billion or so relatively poor people, it will be great news for suppliers of both the most basic raw materials and sophisticated electronic components.
 But for the next few quarters, investors have much to worry about. Tech companies may be doing better -- the Dutch chip equipment maker ASML increased its forecast for 2010 on Wednesday -- but the macroeconomic data from the United States and much of Europe remains mediocre. Euro zone industrial production in May, released Wednesday, grew less than expected.
 Investors are torn. They've been optimistic for almost two weeks, but that hardly makes a trend. The improvement in mood came after a pretty bad second quarter. Since last September stocks have been up and down, but have generally made little progress while credit spreads have widened.
 Financial markets look more fragile than markets for goods, despite nearly the best possible fiscal and monetary support from governments and central banks -- or maybe because that support could end. Modest tightening in China is probably hurting asset prices there and in commodity markets. The fear of similar policy moves elsewhere, especially if they come before economic growth is well established, seems to be restraining investors' exuberance.
 It would not take much to darken the market's mood -- a misstep from a central bank here, a bit too much deflation there or an unexpected bank problem somewhere else. But for now, liquidity is still ample and there are just enough signs of growth to keep up investors' spirits.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) -- British Airways, American Airlines and Iberia won European Union antitrust clearance on Wednesday to deepen their Oneworld alliance on trans-Atlantic routes and better compete with rival groups. 
 The European Commission, the union's competition watchdog, also cleared a British Airways merger with Spain's Iberia.
 The alliance memberswant to broaden their pact to take advantage of the ''Open Skies'' agreement between the United States and the European Union, which liberalizes trans-Atlantic aviation.
 The carriers offered in March to give up a number of lucrative trans-Atlantic slots in a bid to ease competitive concerns by the European Commission about the Oneworld deal.
 The European Commission said the concessions were sufficient to ease competition concerns and that it was dropping an investigation it had opened in April last year.
 ''Today's decision will enable the airlines to put in place the trans-Atlantic alliance they have long aspired to while ensuring that the around 2.5 million passengers ... continue to benefit from a choice of frequencies and competitive prices,'' the competition commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.
 The three carriers agreed to cede some landing and take-off slots for routes between London and Dallas, Boston, Miami and New York.
 Other concessions include allowing access to their frequent-flyer programs on those routes and submitting data on their cooperation plan to the commission. The commitments are for 10 years.
 Virgin Atlantic has criticized the strengthened alliance, saying the proposals are woefully inadequate.
 The commission said the combined British Airways and Iberia would not significantly impede competition in the European Economic Area.
 The Department of Transportation in February tentatively allowed the three airlines antitrust immunity on trans-Atlantic routes. A final decision will come after a period of consultation.
 Star Alliance, which includes Lufthansa and United Airlines, and SkyTeam, with members Air France and Delta, have already been granted American antitrust immunity.

HEADLINE: The Roots of the Misery in Gaza

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Trapped by Gaza Blockade, Locked in Despair'' (front page, July 14) clearly and graphically describes the deplorable conditions in Gaza -- the squalid, listless existence of its inhabitants -- and the intense discord between Hamas, which controls Gaza, and the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank. 
 Add to this the rampant corruption and ineptitude of the leadership of both groups, and the fact that Hamas denies Israel's right to exist, aptly expressed by a resident of Gaza: ''All the land is ours. We should turn the Jews into refugees and then let the international community take care of them.''
 All of which raises the question: What is the point of pushing for any peace talks when the likelihood of anything positive resulting from them is virtually zero?
 At an absolute minimum, the Palestinians need to put their own house in order and unequivocally recognize Israel's existence. Without that, peace talks that once again raise unrealistic expectations may be worse than no talks at all.
 Jerry Rapp New York, July 14, 2010
 To the Editor:
 The situation in Gaza as described by your article illustrates the real tragedy the Palestinians face in Gaza: leadership that prefers to demonize Israel and the Palestinians controlling the West Bank, to build nostalgia for a Palestine of the past and to hold a kidnapped Israeli soldier, Gilad Shalit, than to offer positive steps for economic and social development.
 These leaders point with pride to a tunnel-based smuggling culture and prepare for the next war instead of teaching the people of Gaza about peace. Instead of fulminating about the Israeli occupation, we need to help the Palestinian people to overthrow the Hamas leadership that has brought them war and despair.
 Samuel Heilman New Rochelle, N.Y., July 14, 2010
 The writer is a professor of sociology and Jewish studies at Queens College, CUNY, and the Graduate Center.
 To the Editor:
 The most chilling part of your report from Gaza is this observation: ''Direct contact between the peoples, common in the 1980s and '90s when Palestinians worked daily in Israel, is nonexistent.''
 Travel restrictions between Israel, Gaza and the West Bank not only undermine the economic stability of the region, but also foster a continued ''us versus them'' mentality. Imposed by Israel as security measures, they will ironically undermine Israel's security by prolonging and deepening the conflict.
 Ryan Gee Brooklyn, July 14, 2010
 To the Editor:
 Heart-wrenching civilian deprivation in Gaza is paralleled by similar and worse conditions in many other places in the world where despotic regimes reign. Innocent residents of Gaza, though, have the right to feel particularly dejected, as their murderous, peace-rejecting Hamas government came about through votes cast by a majority of their fellow Gazans.
 May we one day soon see a broad Arab endorsement of peaceful co-existence with Israel, after which prosperity will quickly come to Gaza and the entire region.

HEADLINE: As Dellums's Support Fades, the Black Vote Splits

BYLINE: By RICHARD PARKS. 
rparks@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
Teola Sanders has supported Mayor Ronald V. Dellums of Oakland for over 40 years.
 That includes Mr. Dellums's 13 victorious Congressional campaigns and the race four years ago, when a coalition of Oakland residents, including Ms. Sanders, a prominent black activist, persuaded him to give up a lucrative Washington lobbying practice to run for mayor.
But Ms. Sanders said her support had run its course.
 ''He should not ever run again,'' she said. ''Oakland needs a stronger mayor. He doesn't do his job.'' 
 Mr. Dellums, 74, has not said whether he will seek re-election in November. But after presiding over a crippling budget crisis and, this month, police layoffs and street disturbances, Mr. Dellums has seen his reputation suffer while many longtime supporters flee to other candidates.
 Mr. Dellums indecision -- and the widespread perception that he has been a disengaged and ineffective mayor -- has created a vacuum among Oakland's black political leadership. Although declining in numbers, blacks remain nearly one-third of the city's population, and a black candidate has finished first or second in every mayoral race since 1973. Three of the last four Oakland mayors have been black.
 The three front-runners, none of whom is black, have managed to fragment Mr. Dellums's base.
 Jean Quan, a City Council member, is backed by Sandre R. Swanson, a member of the State Assembly who worked in Mr. Dellums's Congressional office for 25 years. Rebecca Kaplan, another City Council member, has gained the endorsement of Geoffrey Pete, who spearheaded the effort to persuade Mr. Dellums to run in 2006. And Don Perata, the former state senator, has the support of prominent members of Oakland's black religious community, including Bishop Bob Jackson of the influential Acts Full Gospel Church.
 ''The people who have an interest in directing the political future of Oakland are making their choices without Ron in the mix,'' said Mary King, the former Alameda County supervisor who ran for mayor in 1998. ''I don't think that there's anybody of prominence that would say they've got the black vote.''
 In an interview last week at City Hall, Mr. Dellums said he would wait until Aug. 6, the last day to file, to announce whether he will run again.
 ''I can't afford the luxury of dancing on the winds of political expediency,'' he said. ''People have the right to expect that I will do my job.''
 Mr. Dellums said Oakland had made progress under his leadership, including a drop in crime for three consecutive years. He compared his situation with that of President Obama, noting that both ''came in right when the bottom dropped out of the economy.'' 
 ''Then,'' he continued, ''people said, 'Be a miracle worker.' ''
 On Tuesday, Mr. Dellums announced that negotiations with the police union had collapsed, forcing the city to lay off 10 percent of the police force.
 Mr. Dellums, an Oakland native, served in the Marine Corps and was elected to Congress in 1971. He became a leading opponent of the Vietnam War, and in 1986 drafted the landmark Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act, which called for sanctions against South Africa and stated preconditions for lifting them, including the release of all political prisoners. In 1997, he announced he was retiring from Congress in the middle of his term. After a stint as a lobbyist, he was coaxed back to Oakland with the hope that he could help solve the city's endemic crime and economic problems. 
 ''Some thought he was going to walk on water,'' said Mr. Pete, a member of the Oakland Black Caucus, who helped persuade Mr. Dellums to run. ''Then he didn't.''
 Disillusioned supporters say the Dellums administration has been characterized by a hands-off approach to governing. Many of those people -- blacks and others -- said the absence of leadership had been felt most acutely during a series of recent crises.
 For weeks, Oakland has been gripped by the murder trial of Johannes Mehserle, a white transit officer who shot and killed Oscar Grant III, an unarmed black man, on a station platform on New Year's Day 2009. When Mr. Mehserle was convicted on a lesser charge of involuntary manslaughter last week, demonstrations were relatively peaceful, but several businesses were looted and 78 people were arrested.
 Two mayoral candidates, Ms. Quan and Ms. Kaplan, remained in the crowd during the protests, exhorting people to remain peaceful. Mr. Dellums, meanwhile, made his only public statement at a news conference away from the protests. He acknowledged this week that some people wondered why he had not been on the streets.
 ''Nobody needs to validate your right'' to protest, he said. ''My responsibility is to see that the rights are not impeded.''
 Less than a week after the protests, the city failed to negotiate a last-minute agreement with the police union. Critics have said Mr. Dellums was not involved enough in the negotiations. But at a news conference last month, the mayor bristled and described himself as ''the master strategist'' who left the negotiations to underlings.
 The dual crises have solidified the perception of many former Dellums supporters that the city needs a younger, more practical mayor.
 Desley Brooks, a City Council member who endorsed Mr. Dellums in 2006, said the budget crisis will not be resolved if Oakland elects another ''name-recognized'' mayor who ''is not going to be able to get the job done.''
 ''I know I would not be supporting his candidacy for another round,'' Ms. Brooks said. 
 Mr. Dellums's departure would leave no clear successor in local progressive black leadership. People involved in the movement said Mr. Swanson; Van Jones, the environmental advocate; and Robert Bobb, the former city manager, are black politicians who could win the black base. But all three harbor ambitions that have already taken them out of Oakland.
 ''As an African-American, I'd like to see another African-American mayor,'' said Keith Carson, an Alameda County supervisor politically aligned with Mr. Dellums. ''Is there an emerging charismatic black representative? At this point, I don't think that I believe there is in Oakland.''
 It may be a reflection of the times. The Oakland black vote is losing potency as the city mirrors a nationwide trend of declining inner-city black populations. In the 2000 census, nearly 36 percent of Oakland's population identified as black or African-American. By 2008, that number had shrunk to under 30 percent.
 Two blacks have announced their candidacy for mayor -- Orlando Johnson, a member of the Oakland Community Action Network, and Terence Candell, executive director of a college preparatory academy -- and neither has emerged as a major candidate. Mr. Candell recently spoke at a City Council meeting to address the proposed police layoffs and drew jeers from the crowd when he included the name of a dead officer while denouncing high salaries and overtime pay.
 Mr. Candell, who supported Mr. Dellums in 2006, said that the mayor could gain the ''elite'' black vote if he decided to seek re-election but that ''that's O.K. because they don't represent registered voters.'' 
 Mr. Dellums said that regardless of whether he ran, the election would hinge on the policies his administration had put forward in the past four years.
 ''People in the community have to make judgments about where they want this community going,'' he said. ''You know that old adage: if it ain't broke, don't fix it.''

PERSON: Arnold Kramish 

HEADLINE: Arnold Kramish, 87, Did Work on Atomic Bomb

BYLINE: By JASCHA HOFFMAN

 BODY:
Arnold Kramish, a physicist who survived an explosion while working on the Manhattan Project and later became an expert on nuclear proliferation and espionage, died on June 15 in Washington. He was 87 and lived in Reston, Va. 
 The cause was a neurological disorder, his son, Robert, said. 
 Before graduating from college, Mr. Kramish worked in the special engineering division of the Manhattan Project at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, Los Alamos National Laboratory in Nevada and the Philadelphia Navy Yard. 
 It was in Philadelphia, on Sept. 2, 1944, that he was severely burned when a uranium enrichment device exploded near him. As two colleagues lay dying on the floor, he refused the last rites offered by a priest before losing consciousness. 
 Although the fact that the accident was caused by uranium was kept secret for decades, Mr. Kramish later pushed the government to recognize his colleagues who died in the blast.
 After the war Mr. Kramish became a nuclear intelligence and policy expert. He served with the Atomic Energy Commission until 1951, when he joined the staff of the RAND Corporation as a nuclear weapons research strategist.
 ''He was one of the first to find out the nature of the Soviet nuclear weapons program after World War II,'' said Samuel Cohen, the physicist who invented the neutron bomb. ''He got hold of good intelligence and tried desperately to send the word up to the top.'' 
 Mr. Kramish traveled frequently and rubbed shoulders with spies and scientists. 
 ''He worked with Edward Teller on the hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s, and he was the only scientist who participated in the interrogation of the Soviet spy David Greenglass, brother-in-law of Julius Rosenberg,'' said Richard Rhodes, author of ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb.'' ''After the war he was the Atomic Energy Commission's liaison with the C.I.A., working on Soviet espionage. He was a scientist involved with the more clandestine parts of the government.'' 
 In later years Mr. Kramish developed an interest in the history of atomic espionage. He wrote ''The Griffin,'' about the life of Paul Rosbaud, a spy who passed information about the German atomic bomb effort to the British during World War II. 
 Arnold Kramish was born in Denver on June 6, 1923. He graduated from the University of Denver in 1945 and received a master's degree in physics from Harvard in 1947.
 In the 1970s Mr. Kramish worked as an arms control adviser for the State Department in Paris. Under President Ronald Reagan, he directed a White House study that approved of the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as Star Wars. 
 ''Everyone who wrote about the Manhattan Project and atomic espionage eventually contacted Arnold Kramish,'' Robert Norris, a nuclear weapons expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, said in an e-mail message. Although he witnessed many important events surrounding the bomb, Mr. Norris wrote, Mr. Kramish had a secretive side. ''I only wish he had been more forthcoming and generous in sharing what he knew,'' he added. 
 In addition to his son, Robert, of Berkeley, Calif., Mr. Kramish is survived by his wife, Vivian Raker; a daughter, Pamela Jones of Hickory, N.C.; a sister, Elaine Dillon of Denver; and four grandchildren.
 In a reminiscence published more than 50 years after the Philadelphia explosion, Mr. Kramish attributed his unlikely survival to a large jar of chicken soup that his mother carried on a three-day train ride from her home in Denver to his bedside in a Philadelphia naval hospital. 
 ''When she arrived, she pushed the guards away, charged into my room, raised my oxygen tent and fed me the well-matured chicken soup,'' he wrote.
 This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Data Shows the Factory Sector Slipping and the Economic Recovery Slowing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- New evidence of a slowing economic rebound emerged Thursday in reports that manufacturing activity was slowing after helping push the early stages of the recovery.
 Factory output fell in June, according to a government report on industrial production. It was the sharpest monthly drop in a year. And two regional manufacturing indexes sank this month.
 Production of automobiles, home-building materials and processed food all fell in June. The data sent stocks falling. 
 Federal Reserve officials took note of the weakening recovery when they met last month and lowered their forecast for economic growth, according to minutes released Wednesday.
 Manufacturing helped the economy start to recover last year and has since been one of the strongest sectors. June's decline in output was the first in four months. Overall industrial production ticked up for the month, but that was mainly the result of hot weather that increased demand for electricity from utilities.
 ''Today's report supports the view that the manufacturing recovery lost some momentum,'' said Peter Newland of Barclays Capital Research.
 The decline in factory output came as new data offered a mixed picture of the recovery. Applications for unemployment benefits fell to 429,000, the lowest level since August 2008, the Labor Department said Thursday. But much of that was the result of seasonal factors like manufacturers skipping their usual summer shutdowns.
 Separately, the Labor Department said wholesale prices fell for a third month. Prices were pulled down by a drop in energy costs and the biggest decline in food costs in eight years. But excluding those two volatile commodities, inflation was nearly flat.
 The Federal Reserve report on industrial production showed that overall output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percent in June. It was the fourth consecutive monthly gain. But factory output -- the largest component of industrial production -- dropped 0.4 percent.
 Adding to concerns in the manufacturing sector were steep drops reported Thursday in the Empire State and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing indexes.
 Economists viewed the reduction in factory output as further evidence that the economy was weakening as it entered the second half of this year.
 ''It is pretty clear that a slowdown is in process,'' said Brian Bethune, chief United States financial economist for IHS Global Insight. ''The healing process from a severe recession is still under way. But given the kind of trauma the economy was subjected to, it isn't going to bounce back on a sustained basis right away.''
 The latest data on jobless claims looked promising on the surface, as initial claims fell by 29,000. But much of that was the result of seasonal factors. A Labor Department analyst said manufacturing companies reported fewer temporary layoffs than usual this time of year. General Motors said last month that it would forgo its customary two-week summer factory closings, which it uses to retool plants for new car models.
 That usually causes a spike in temporary layoffs and jobless claims in early July. Other manufacturers also reported fewer temporary layoffs than expected, the analyst added.
 Last week's drop in initial claims ''is very encouraging,'' Jennifer Lee, an economist at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. ''But it likely won't last'' because much of it resulted from seasonal factors.
 Claims had been stuck above 450,000 all year, after dropping steadily last year from a peak of 651,000 in March 2009. In a healthy economic recovery with rapid hiring, claims usually fall below 400,000.
 Before seasonal adjustment, the number of jobless claims rose last week. But since they did not rise as much as they usually do this time of year, the seasonally adjusted number fell.

HEADLINE: For Securities Industry, Finance Law Could Bring New Light to Derivatives

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
When financial markets came unglued two years ago, few Americans had heard of derivatives, much less their more esoteric forms like credit-default swaps and collateralized debt obligations. Since then, derivatives have been central to the debate over how tightly to regulate Wall Street's freewheeling ways.
 Now, many people in the securities industry are wondering if the strict new requirements that the financial regulatory legislation imposes on the $600 trillion derivatives market will truly bring light and order to a corner of the securities market that has long functioned in the shadows. 
 The answer will not be known for at least a year -- the amount of time that regulators say will be needed at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission to write the ground rules for derivative trading.
 Obama administration officials and securities regulators say they are confident that the new regulations will remove or contain much of the risk that left so many firms in trouble, but others say it may simply transfer that risk to other market participants that themselves could require assistance in the next crisis.
 For now, some derivatives participants on Wall Street express optimism that the bill will provide some benefits, even though the industry generally opposed many proposed provisions of the derivatives legislation.
 Blythe S. Masters, who oversees the global commodities business at JPMorgan Chase, said at a securities industry conference on Thursday that in many respects the changes ''are actually going to be very beneficial for the industry and derivatives market participants.''
 ''It's important not to lose sight of the fact most of the best minds in the field have believed for years that there has been the need for reform in the market,'' she said.
 Derivatives are securities whose value is based on the value of another commodity or financial instrument -- commodities like wheat or copper. Swaps, a special kind of derivative, are used by investors to trade one kind of risk for another -- a fixed-interest rate for a variable rate, for instance. 
 The financial overhaul bill, which the Senate cleared Thursday and sent to the president, imposes multiple new regulations on the derivatives market generally and the swaps market in particular. It requires that standardized derivatives contracts be traded on an open exchange, with prices and volumes reported publicly. The contracts must also be cleared through a third party, an intermediary who guarantees that if one party defaults, the investor holding the other side of the trade will still be paid.
 Clearinghouses will perform that function by requiring parties in a derivative trade to put up collateral, or margin, to protect against a default. The bill also requires securities firms that trade derivatives to maintain certain levels of capital. Overseeing all this activity is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in the case of derivatives involving commodities like soybeans, oil or metals, and the S.E.C. for security-based transactions. 
 Those regulators are also empowered to monitor markets for fraud and abuse and to set limits on how much of a contract a single firm can control.
 ''Derivatives should reduce risk, not magnify it,'' Neal S. Wolin, deputy Treasury secretary, said at the conference. ''They should be a force for stability, not contagion. By bringing the derivatives markets out of the shadows, the legislation will benefit every business that uses derivatives to manage real risks.''
 The financial bill also requires that banks, which are major participants in the swaps market, segregate those operations from their commercial banking business. Senator Blanche Lincoln, Democrat of Arkansas, was the primary author of that provision of the bill. 
 She said in a statement Thursday she believed that after the financial crisis it was imperative to make sure that taxpayers were not financing risky derivatives trading through their federally insured bank deposits.
 But some participants in the derivatives business are worried about unintended consequences. The bill provides for the possibility that some derivatives clearing firms may be so important to the financial system that they are designated ''systemically important'' firms, much like the biggest banks and Wall Street companies. 
 A systemically important clearing firm could, in the case of another financial crisis, be allowed to access the Federal Reserve's emergency lending ability, a situation that opponents of the bill characterized as leaving the door open for another bailout.
 ''We nearly went off a cliff in 2008,'' Gary Gensler, the chairman of the C.F.T.C., said Thursday. ''Derivatives played a role in this. And we have to lower risk and increase transparency.''

HEADLINE: Carving With Color on Canvas

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
The Museum of Modern Art's extraordinary ''Matisse: Radical Invention, 1913-1917'' is not your garden-variety Matisse exhibition. It contains few signs of the artist who said a painting should be the equivalent of a soothing armchair. By the end of this show you may wonder if that Matisse ever really existed, despite his much-quoted, overinterpreted words to that effect. 
 Instead ''Matisse: Radical Invention'' offers a view of a driven, even tormented Matisse, who second-guessed himself, rethought and reworked his images and often left them looking bracingly fresh and conditional, even unfinished. We see an artist increasingly interested in making clear not just his painting process, but also a kind of emotional concentration that, while hardly Expressionist, did not exactly exemplify the Olympian detachment habitually attributed to him. 
 With more than 100 paintings, sculptures, prints and drawings, the Modern's show, which opens Sunday, offers a close reading of four of the most arduous years of Matisse's long career, as well as the six or so preceding them. It was organized by John Elderfield, a veteran of several major Matisse exhibitions and the Modern's chief curator emeritus of painting and sculpture, and Stephanie D'Alessandro, curator of modern art at the Art Institute of Chicago. 
 The ensemble highlights Matisse's inspired shuffling of mediums, his even-handed willingness to take from one to stir up another. In several paintings boldly drawn black lines disrupt planes of color, like armatures that refuse to stay put. 
 Matisse's four great ''Back'' reliefs that usually haunt the Modern's garden are on hand, their increasingly distilled forms looking in this context more like maquettes for paintings than cast bronzes. They confirm why Matisse the painter was called a carver of color and space. 
 Works large and small, major and minor all make their points sooner or later. The great ''Portrait of Yvonne Landsberg'' -- whose masklike face, hemmed-in torso and superannuating arcs of radiance are more scratched than painted -- may sharpen your appreciation of the insistent lines and textures in several drawings and a lithograph of female nudes in the show's opening gallery. Matisse could carve with the brush, but at times he also used it like a pencil.
 The thorn in Matisse's side for most of the years encompassed by this show was Picasso's ferocious ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' of 1907 and Cubism, its more refined aftermath. Until the ''Demoiselles,'' conveniently located downstairs at MoMA, Matisse had been riding high. Inspired by African art -- to which he introduced Picasso -- he almost single-handedly revived European sculpture with a new bluntness and distortion of form. As first among the Fauves -- or Wild Beasts -- he, along with Georges Braque and Andre Derain, revolutionized painting with a new emphasis on stark color: color for color's sake. His bright, raw contributions to the autumn salons of 1905 and '06 had scandalized the public, to his satisfaction. 
 But ''Demoiselles'' changed things. Braque and Derain shortly became, in the words of Gertrude Stein, ''Picassoites and were definitely not Matisseites.'' Stein also changed sides, which wounded Matisse. 
 By 1910 Matisse had withdrawn from the hurly-burly of the Paris art world. He rented a house in the suburbs, built a studio in its garden and refueled with travel. He saw a mind-boggling show of Islamic art in Munich and Russian icons in Moscow. In Spain he encountered Moorish architecture and the works of Velazquez, El Greco and Goya. During long sojourns in Morocco in 1912 and early 1913, he reaffirmed his faith in the marriage of light and color. But by January 1914 he was back in Paris. He an his wife moved into an apartment at 19 Quai Saint-Michel. It was one floor below the studio in which he had worked from 1894 to 1907, with the same view of the Seine and Notre Dame. 
 In the next years Matisse pushed his art to even greater extremes of scale, stand-alone color, formal power, surface roughness and emotional undertow. He confronted Cubism by becoming more aggressively and transparently himself.
 Spaciously arrayed in five large galleries, the MoMA show includes a bumper crop of Matisse's most important canvases and one by Cezanne: the small, powerful ''Three Bathers'' of 1879-82. Matisse purchased the work from Ambroise Vollard in 1899, though he could ill afford it, and cherished it as a talisman until giving it to the Musee du Petit Palais in the 1930s. 
 Hanging near the show's entrance, ''Bathers'' signals Matisse's early understanding of Cezanne's importance -- an awareness that only became widespread with Cezanne's 1906 memorial retrospective. It also suggests that Matisse shared more than a little of Cezanne's well-known doubt while also indicating one of the show's larger themes: Matisse's link to the grand French tradition of painting nudes in landscapes. 
 This first gallery includes Matisse's snarling ''Blue Nude'' of 1907 -- which sent Picasso back to the studio to toughen up ''Demoiselles'' -- and the eternally strange ''Bathers With a Turtle'' (1907-08), dominated by a proto-Brice Marden background and an alpha female who is either devouring her hands or about to regurgitate food for the turtle. The show concludes with Chicago's monumental ''Bathers by a River,'' which Matisse grappled with off and on for most of the period covered by this exhibition. He began it in 1909-10 and returned to it in 1913 before finally completing it in 1917. With its immense dolmen-tree-trunk figures in shades of gray, blue and pink, it remains one of the most difficult, least ingratiating of modernist masterpieces. 
 The show is full of marvelous pairings and clusters of paintings executed close to the same time in which Matisse approaches and sometimes takes a timeout from ''radical invention.'' A particularly stunning gallery contains seven paintings made in the first six months after returning to Quai Saint-Michel, including the Landsberg portrait. The greatness of the Modern's ''Goldfish and Palette'' -- its scale, startling pentimenti and flirtation with abstraction -- has never been clearer than when seen next to ''Interior With Goldfish,'' a more conventional, if still glorious version of the same view. The group culminates in the divine economies of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's ''Branch of Lilacs,'' a bouquet of soft thin smudges of color and bare canvas, and the Modern's ''View of Notre Dame,'' an intimation of sky and stone that is still unsettlingly cursory after all these years. 
 Everything looks fresh. Matisse's nearly Baroque 1915 rendition of his 1893 academic copy of Jan Davidsz. de Heem's ''Desserte'' is a MoMA staple that has always seemed mercilessly clogged to me. Here it reads as a blithe lexicon of the paint treatments that can be found throughout the show. 
 Matisse's small monotype portraits from World War I stand out as ''carved'' with a few clean, deft needle-fine lines. And they stand up to their neighbors, a series of imposing charcoal and pencil portraits of women in which clouds of erasures are as crucial to the sense of form and personality as the drawn lines. In the show's second-to-last gallery the melons, turbans and minarets of ''The Moroccans'' -- a painting almost as truculent as ''Bathers by a River'' -- are foreshadowed by monotypes and then paintings of apples and other fruit on tables. 
 ''Demoiselles'' was the Big Bang that helped Matisse become more fully himself, but Cubism barely grazed him. Cezanne's ''petites sensations'' inspired Picasso and Braque to shatter Renaissance space into so many little pieces as to be atomized. Fittingly William S. Rubin, who ruled the Modern's department of painting and sculpture for nearly two decades could characterize Analytic Cubism -- which he adored -- as the last stage of old master painting. 
 Matisse was not so interested in shattering, or in small pieces. He focused on wholeness, simplicity and monumentality, in planes that bent and angled in ways that suggest fragments of Cubism writ large. He built on Cezanne as surely as the Cubists did, but balanced that influence with an abiding admiration for the flat colors of Giotto's frescoes, landmarks of the early Renaissance, which he saw in Padua during a trip to Italy in 1907. Giotto showed Matisse how to make color live big, enabling him to turn Cezanne's petites sensations into something grand. 
 It is not every museum exhibition that begins with blown-up reproductions of small, sometimes minute details of 15 of the paintings displayed inside. This amazing show keeps your eyes on their toes. Attention paid is profusely and profoundly rewarded.

HEADLINE: Revival of Demand Cuts Loss for A.M.D.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shrank its second-quarter loss on reviving sales of computers that use its chips and a wrenching years-long effort to shed costs. 
 A.M.D. would have made money were it not for a loss related to its investment in factories it spun off a year ago into a separate company, according to results released Thursday.
 Two days earlier, A.M.D.'s rival, Intel, reported the highest revenue and profit margins in the company's 42-year history. A.M.D.'s chips are inside 20 percent of the world's personal computers and servers. Intel supplies nearly all the rest.
 Intel cited bigger corporate spending on PCs and servers that use expensive chips -- an encouraging sign for the semiconductor industry that shows technology budgets are being reinflated. A.M.D. said it notched record shipments of laptop chips in the latest period.
 Many analysts are worried that economic turbulence in Europe could upset the computer industry's resurgence in the last year.
 A.M.D.'s net loss was $43 million, or 6 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 26, from $330 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, A.M.D. would have earned 11 cents a share. On that basis, analysts expected a profit of 6 cents a share.
 Revenue was $1.65 billion, an increase of 40 percent over the period a year ago. Analysts expected $1.55 billion.
 A.M.D. shares rose 24 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $7.74 in extended trading, after the release of the results.
 The company, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., is benefiting from the same forces that lifted Intel to its record quarter -- better spending by corporations on PCs and servers after one of the worst slumps in the industry's history.
 Servers are computers that run Web sites, process e-mail messages and perform other back-office tasks, and their chips are among the most profitable for A.M.D. and Intel. Intel's revenue from server chips jumped nearly 50 percent in the latest period, stunning many analysts. A.M.D. did not break out how much of its revenue came from server versus PC chips.
 A.M.D.'s numbers reflect major changes the company had made to cut expenses. The biggest change was spinning off its chip-making factories into a separate company called GlobalFoundries in 2009 with the backing of the Persian Gulf state of Abu Dhabi.
 The move was done to unload debt and cut costs. Semiconductor factories require multibillion-dollar upgrades every few years to keep their edge. A.M.D. had lost billions of dollars and was seeking a way to resuscitate its balance sheet.
 Until the last two quarters, A.M.D. had been consolidating the two companies' results. It now reports only A.M.D.'s results as a stand-alone company. Still, A.M.D. owns about 30 percent of the spinoff and has to account for the investment in its results. In the latest period, A.M.D. recorded a $120 million noncash charge related to GlobalFoundries. That figure dragged down its net income but did not affect revenue.

HEADLINE: How to Tell A Nation Is at Risk

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Which governments will not be able to pay their bills?
 The ones with private sectors that are not doing well enough to bail out the government.
 That should be one lesson of the near default this year of the Greek government. Government finances are important, but in the end it is the private sector that matters most.
 If so, those who focus on fiscal policy may be missing important things. Spain appeared to be in fine shape, with government surpluses, before the recession hit. Now Spain is being downgraded and has soaring deficits.
 ''Academics and market practitioners have not had an impressive record of predicting serious financial downturns or of providing adequate early warnings of impending sovereign economic and financial problems,'' says Edward Altman, a professor at New York University who has long studied debt defaults by companies and governments. 
 Mr. Altman's answer is fairly simple: ''One can learn a great deal about sovereign risk by analyzing the health and aggregate default risk of a nation's private corporate sector, a type of bottom-up analysis.''
 After that analysis, using a system he developed with a company called Risk Metrics, Mr. Altman's ranking of European governments now differs a little from conventional wisdom. He sees Britain and the Netherlands as the safest governments, ahead of Germany. Greece is at the bottom, of course, with Italy, Portugal and Spain looking better than it does, but not particularly good.
 Looking at corporate strength, he argues, does a better job of forecasting debt problems than do traditional macroeconomic indicators, like gross domestic product growth and debt levels relative to G.D.P. 
 That analysis is sharply at odds with much current political discourse, which focuses on debt-to-G.D.P. levels and purports to see disaster looming for both Britain and the United States if something is not done immediately to restore fiscal discipline. 
 It may seem odd to talk of businesses bailing out governments, when the reverse is what appeared to happen over the last couple of years. But government credit, in the end, is based on its ability to collect taxes. A healthy private sector will provide the taxes, if they are to be provided at all.
 That is something the bond rating agencies understand, but it is also the opposite of a traditional ratings practice, which was to treat a country's debt rating as a ceiling for the ratings of companies from that country. In fact, the reverse has something to be said for it.
 The old ceiling view did make sense under some circumstances. Defaulting governments have sometimes required companies to default as well, as a way of protecting dwindling foreign currency reserves at a time of crisis. 
 The overseas debt of most countries is denominated in currencies the governments cannot print and its citizens do not use, which is one reason crises can sneak up on traditional analyses. Argentina's debt-to-G.D.P. ratio was about 50 percent, recalled Albert Metz, a managing director of Moody's, shortly before the nation defaulted in the 1990s. The currency collapsed, and the ratio tripled overnight.
 That distinction is one that has gained less attention than it should. In practice, it means that a crisis such as Argentina experienced, or as Thailand did a few years later, cannot sneak up on nations like Britain, which borrows pounds, or the United States, which borrows dollars. 
 Greece did not face that risk either, because it borrows euros. But it cannot print the currency, so new credit could dry up. It was that threat that forced the crisis. 
 There is another lesson of the recent crisis that should be understood. The obligations of a country's financial sector are, in extremis, contingent obligations of the government. Allowing the financial system to collapse is simply not an acceptable alternative.
 Much of the rhetoric about the new financial reform bill in the United States dealt with politicians claiming, or denying, that future bailouts would be prevented. The real answer hinges on whether the new regulatory regime, combined with the lessons bankers should have learned, will prevent a new financial crisis.
 If not, there will be bailouts, whatever laws are passed. Or at least there should be. The world tried going without them in the 1930s. It did not work out well.
 It is profoundly discouraging to see American politicians screaming that TARP -- the bank bailout -- is to be blamed for deficits. In fact, the bailout worked. Had something like it not been done, the debt of the United States government might be lower now, but the nation's credit would be far worse.
 Federal debt, as reported, has skyrocketed during the Obama administration. But a large part of that stems from decisions made years before most Americans knew who Barack Obama was, and certainly before he had any power. Those decisions were made by banks and brokers. They were made by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when they were not under direct government control. 
 Other parts of the spending come from efforts to keep the economy from collapsing under the weight of the proof that those earlier decisions were horrendously bad ones.
 The economic debate now should be focused on keeping the federal government from someday being similar to Greece, with a weak private sector and a bloated government that cannot collect taxes to meet its obligations.
 There is no risk of that in the near term. The United States government can print dollars to avoid default, but it is not having to do so. It can borrow at low rates because investors around the world still trust it. 
 To keep that trust in the longer term, the economy must grow. It is possible, though not proved, that significant new stimulus is needed. If it is, that spending, too, will partly be to clean up messes made before.
 The American economy currently is doing better than it would sound from the rhetoric on both sides of the political spectrum. The two demonstrable signs that the recovery has slowed are in areas -- housing and cars -- where temporary stimulus programs were artificially spurring growth. It was obvious that there would be brief declines when those programs expired.
 But pessimism is intense. There was talk of depression just before the latest stock market rally began, and surveys of investors show levels of bearishness normally seen only after years of market declines. In fact, the market is up sharply from early 2009, and about 20 percent above where it was a year ago.
 In Washington, nobody seems to want to see good news. When government employment rose because of Census hiring, that was dismissed as obviously temporary. Now that the Census Bureau is letting people go, that is seen as bad economic news.
 The left wants more stimulus spending, and sees economic optimism as playing into the hands of its opponents. The right wants proof that President Obama is doing a bad job, which it hopes will lead to large Republican gains in November, and sees economic pessimism as in its best interests.
 In fact, there are few signs of a double-dip recession. As Daniel Gross asked in Slate this week, ''Retail sales are up, and credit card debt is down. Why is that bad news?'' Americans are spending about 5 percent more than a year ago, even with this week's retail sales numbers that were pronounced disappointing by some. But it appears that the spending is coming more from those who can afford it than from those who need to borrow.
 The important goal now is a healthy economy, and there are signs that it is arriving. Corporate profits were surprisingly strong in early 2010, and early second-quarter reports are encouraging. 
 It is the success, or failure, in obtaining that goal that will determine whether there is a real crisis in federal debt.

HEADLINE: Canada Plans to Buy F-35s, but Hurdles Remain

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN and CHRISTOPHER DREW; Ian Austen reported from Ottawa and Christopher Drew from New York.

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- The Canadian government is expected to announce on Friday that it will buy 65 F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin. 
 The announcement of a multibillion-dollar commitment by a foreign government would be a big boost for the jet program, which has been plagued with delays and substantial price increases. It is also being made without bids from other manufacturers.
 But long before any announcement was imminent, the purchase became politically controversial in Canada. On Thursday, the Liberal Party said that it would oppose the purchase. An alliance of opposition parties could stall or block the deal. 
 ''I'm not suggesting that this may not be the best fighter aircraft for the Canadian forces,'' said Ujjal Dosanjh, a Liberal member of Parliament responsible for defense issues. ''But we don't know that without going through a process.''
 ''It's nice to have the latest and the greatest, said Jack Harris of the New Democratic Party. ''But do we need that to protect our country? We're not, as we were in the cold war, facing off against the Soviet military.''
 The offices of Stephen Harper, the prime minister, and Peter MacKay, the defense minister, did not respond to requests for comment.
 Canada is one of eight countries that are helping the United States build the fighter, which will be less detectable by radar than older planes and versatile enough to attack ground targets. The Canadian government has announced that it will phase out its recently updated fleet of CF-18 jets beginning in 2017. 
 Kim M. Testa, a spokeswoman for Lockheed Martin, said that Canada would complete the procurement in 2014 and begin accepting delivery of the first F-35s two years later. 
 Canada is likely to pay at least $4 billion for the planes, and one factor that may determine the political fate of the deal is Lockheed's willingness to buy parts from Canadian suppliers. 
 Ms. Testa said that Lockheed would buy about $10 billion of components and parts from Canadian aerospace companies as part of the deal. That is in line with Canada's usual demand that foreign companies spend about $2 in Canada for every dollar they receive through government contracts.
 Other nations have also debated the necessity of an aircraft as costly and sophisticated as the F-35. Opposition leaders in Denmark and the Netherlands are questioning whether they can afford to buy such a plane at a time when their economies are under pressure. Lockheed, however, needs to hold onto the foreign sales to lower the cost of the planes. 
 The American defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, recently revamped the F-35 program and removed the general in charge, after the Pentagon's projected costs soared by 64 percent to $382 billion for 2,457 planes. The eight allies have invested a total of $4 billion in developing the plane and could buy hundreds of the planes through specific orders, most of which remain to be negotiated.
 But Lockheed Martin's chief executive, Robert J. Stevens, said in June that the company was cutting its costs and improving the efficiency of its production. 
 Though recent Pentagon estimates have placed the cost of a single F-35 as high as $112 million, Mr. Stevens said Lockheed believed it could lower the cost, by 2014 or 2015, to be comparable to updated and fully loaded versions of older fighters, like Boeing's F/A-18 and Lockheed's own F-16. That would reduce the price of each F-35 to about $65 million.
 Ms. Testa, the Lockheed Martin spokeswoman, said that the final price would be determined through negotiations between Canada and the United States. But she said Lockheed expected to sell planes for around that price or a little more. That could amount to about $4.2 billion to $4.5 billion for the 65 planes, not accounting for inflation, maintenance or parts.
 Politicians in Canada have repeatedly cited estimates from the Canadian news media ranging from 9 billion Canadian dollars ($8.7 billion) for the basic contract and up to 16 billion Canadian dollars ($15.5 billion) when service costs are included.
 While Canada did not call for tenders, Boeing has been lobbying the Canadian government and opposition politicians to consider the F/A-18, an update of the aircraft that is the basis of the government's current CF-18s. And a consortium of European manufacturers has been promoting the Eurofighter Typhoon. 
 The Canadian military has been remarkably absent from the public debate. While it is believed that its leadership is not opposed to the government's plan to buy new aircraft, there are indications that some have concerns about the F-35.
 Canada's air force rarely flies combat missions, arguably making some of the F-35's advanced features, like radar-evading stealth, seem like frills.
 Unlike the twin-engine CF-18, the F-35 has only one engine. Its failure could leave pilots exposed to the harsh Arctic environment as they await rescue.

HEADLINE: Questions About Path Of AIDS Walk Money

BYLINE: By SCOTT JAMES. 
Scott James is an Emmy-winning television journalist and novelist who lives in San Francisco. sjames@baycitizen.org

 BODY:
A crowd of 25,000 is expected to trek through Golden Gate Park on Sunday for the annual AIDS Walk, which promises to raise nearly $3.5 million ''benefiting the San Francisco AIDS Foundation and other H.I.V./AIDS organizations serving the Bay Area counties,'' according to the event's slogan. 
 While a majority of the money collected at the event goes to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation itself, only a small fraction in recent years has actually gone to those other local H.I.V./AIDS charities. 
Instead, an analysis of government tax filings shows that a significant part of past donations has gone to an international AIDS charity -- as much as $1 million during one recent year. By comparison, that same year 26 local organizations split $340,000.
 The disparity -- foreign spending versus local -- has led to concerns that the walk's benefits to Bay Area charities have been misrepresented, according to leaders in the local H.I.V./AIDS care community who would not speak publicly for fear of losing the financing they currently get.
 When asked about this possible lack of clarity, Barbara Kimport, the interim chief executive of the foundation, which oversees the walk, said, ''We could do a better job of that.''
 But Ms. Kimport also bristled at the criticism, saying, ''It saddens me that our own community is back stabbing about money when we should be collaborating together.'' 
 The Foundation's annual operating budget is more than $20 million, which is spent on a wide variety of local help and prevention programs. The group's other main sources of income are the government and about $5 million from the annual AIDS/Lifecycle bike ride fund-raiser. 
 In 2001 the foundation created the Pangaea Global AIDS Foundation, a separate nonprofit focused on H.I.V./AIDS in Cambodia, China, Ukraine and five countries in Africa. The two foundations share office space and a few employees.
 Pangaea reported $3 million in expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2008, the most recent tax return made public. 
 That same year, according to I.R.S. records, of the $1.7 million the AIDS Foundation gave in grants to outside organizations, $1 million, or roughly 57 percent, went to Pangaea. The remaining money was apportioned to 62 Bay Area nonprofits, with most receiving $10,000 or less. The second-largest grant that year was $65,000 to the AIDS Health Project at the University of California, San Francisco; the smallest was $756 to the California Prevention and Education Project in Oakland. The walk in that fiscal year raised $4.4 million.
 In the next fiscal year, ending June 30, 2009, the walk raised $4.1 million, and the foundation decreased the total given in grants to $1.2 million. Pangaea received $910,000 -- about 73 percent total. 
 Ms. Kimport said that in recent years the foundation's support of Pangaea had come from other sources of money, not AIDS Walk donations. The walk last July raised $3.5 million. Foundation records show only $246,000 in grants to local groups in the 2009 calendar year. During the same period, the records show, Pangaea received $500,000. 
 Using locally raised money in the international fight against AIDS draws mixed views. 
 David Pritikin of Campbell, who said he had raised $30,000 for the foundation in cycling events, said he knew about Pangaea and supported the cause. ''I recognize that the epidemic is universal,'' Mr. Pritikin said.
 But others feel misled. Last year Jamie McPherson of San Francisco walked and raised $1,200. ''I have friends who are positive,'' Mr. McPherson said, believing that the money would go to support them.
 ''Does it bother me?'' he said. ''Yeah, it does. You've got to take care of home first.''
 There is certainly plenty of local need.
 Mike Smith, president of San Francisco's H.I.V./AIDS Providers Network, which represents 40 nonprofit groups, said the recession had strained budgets and fund-raising. ''We have the highest density of people living with H.I.V. in the nation,'' Mr. Smith said -- 35,000 people infected in a city with a population of less than 800,000. ''It's staggering.'' 
 Ms. Kimport said the grants did not tell the whole story about the AIDS Walk. About 10 groups will host their own fund-raisers during Sunday's event -- walks within the walk -- and keep all those proceeds.
 But will local charities receive a larger share of the walk's expected total donations of $3.5 million? 
 ''It all depends on how the board sets our priorities for moving forward,'' Ms. Kimport said.

HEADLINE: A Tale of Two Targets

 BODY:
The Senate spent this week searching for ways to water down the modest greenhouse gas emissions targets in the House-passed energy bill, which opponents claim -- wrongly and shortsightedly -- will injure the economy. The British, French and German environmental ministers showed a lot more sense this week. 
 They issued a bold call in The Financial Times for all European Union governments to approve stricter emissions targets, arguing that it would encourage private investment in low emissions technology and hone Europe's export edge in low carbon goods and services.
 Ministerial exhortations are one thing; binding legislation is another. Europe has generally talked a better climate-protection game than it has delivered. Yet this week's contrast in directions is embarrassing for President Obama, who once pledged to fight for the stricter House targets, and for the United States. 
 At December's climate conference in Copenhagen, most countries agreed in principle to try to hold global temperature increases to 2 degrees Celsius, by midcentury, which mainstream scientists regard as the threshold for preventing potentially catastrophic climate changes. 
 Achieving that will, they believe, require reducing worldwide greenhouse gas emissions by some 80 percent by 2050. Every nation will have to contribute, though not necessarily in equal measure. The House version of this year's energy bill called for a 17 percent cut from 2005 emissions levels by 2020. The three ministers, by contrast, call for reinstating a European target of 30 percent reductions from much lower 1990 levels by 2020. 
 The European Union deferred that target, in part because of the economic strains of the global recession. But the ministers point out that the recession, by slowing economic activity across Europe, has actually made the original 30 percent target easier and cheaper to achieve. And they rightly note the potential export benefits for Europe of being a leading low-carbon producer.
 Nobody expects the Senate to go as far as the European ministers advocate. But there is no excuse for the Senate's backward march. We all live on the same planet, and it is getting warmer.

HEADLINE: City's Unemployment Rate Fell to 9.5% in June, the 6th Straight Monthly Dip

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
Despite the end of thousands of jobs for federal census takers, New York City's unemployment rate ticked down again in June, the sixth straight monthly decline, to 9.5 percent, the State Labor Department reported on Thursday. 
 The city added 8,300 jobs in the private sector last month, a significant increase in the wake of a deep recession, but still only about 70 percent of the average gain over the last 10 Junes, said James Brown, principal economist with the Labor Department. The strongest gains came in two of the most economically sensitive sectors: construction, and leisure and hospitality.
 The city's unemployment rate hit its recent peak of 10.5 percent at the end of 2009, and it has been steadily declining. It dropped from 9.6 percent in May to match the national unemployment rate of 9.5 percent for June.
 New York State's unemployment rate fell in June to a 14-month low of 8.2 percent, from 8.3 percent in May. That decline occurred despite a simultaneous decline in the number of employed state residents, the Labor Department said. All told, the number of jobs in the state fell by 22,500 in June, almost half of which were with the Census Bureau.
 But the number of unemployed state residents also declined, falling below 800,000 for the first time in more than a year.
 Hiring appeared to be stronger in the city, where there were about 5,000 more residents with jobs and about 6,000 fewer residents without jobs than there had been in June 2009. The city's labor force -- all those working or looking for work -- remained close to four million people, about as big as it has been in the 35 years that records have been kept.
 The labor force often shrinks in a weak job market as some people become discouraged and stop looking for work. People who are not seeking work are not accounted for in the unemployment statistics.
 In New York State, the number of people collecting unemployment insurance each week has been falling, largely because many people have exhausted their benefits and Congress has not approved another extension. Only 357 state residents were collecting extended benefits in mid-June, down from almost 62,000 a year before.
 One of those who dropped off the benefit rolls was Carmen Massiah, of Corona, Queens.
 Ms. Massiah, 62, lost her job doing administrative work at a nursing home in Hempstead on Long Island in January 2009. She had been collecting the maximum unemployment benefit available to New Yorkers of $430 a week while looking for work for nearly a year and a half. But three weeks ago, she ran out of unemployment insurance. Since then, she has been living on the Social Security payments that she said she reluctantly applied for.
 ''I still have my rent to pay, and bills, a lot of bills,'' said Ms. Massiah, who came to the city from her native Antigua 24 years ago. Her television was tuned to C-Span, where she could monitor whether Congress would pass another extension of benefits that would help people like her.
 ''I don't like to stay home,'' Ms. Massiah said. ''I've never been home. If I get a part-time job right now, I'll take it. I have hopes that somebody will call me. I have high hopes.''

HEADLINE: Scrutiny of a Senate Candidate Includes Her Pro Wrestling Hat

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and JOSHUA BRUSTEIN

 BODY:
In his heyday, Allen Ray Sarven appeared regularly on the World Wrestling Entertainment circuit, flattening opponents with diving leg drops from atop the ropes.
 But years of bounding around the ring took a toll, leaving Mr. Sarven with neurological damage that caused numbness on his right side, hearing loss and memory problems.
 Eventually, Mr. Sarven, 46, met the fate of other wrestlers considered no longer of use to the W.W.E.: his contract was not renewed and he was eliminated from the company's wrestling roster -- with no health insurance or retirement benefits to show for his years in the ring.
 ''Everybody believes that, physically, wrestling is fake; that nobody gets harmed,'' said Mr. Sarven, who said his experience suggested otherwise. 
 Over the past quarter century, Vince and Linda E. McMahon have built the W.W.E. from a small regional operation into a $1.2 billion empire operating in 145 countries. But along the way, the McMahons have become known for hard-nosed tactics and have been accused of putting profits ahead of the well-being of the wrestlers who attract millions of fans with their daredevil stunts and cartoonishly sculpted physiques.
 With Ms. McMahon all but certain to be the Republican candidate for the United States Senate in Connecticut, the W.W.E., its treatment of its work force and the way it came to dominate the industry are drawing renewed scrutiny.
 ''It is a very financially successful company,'' said Dave Meltzer, the editor of Wrestling Observer Newsletter, which covers the industry. ''But, boy, there were a lot of bodies discarded in the building of that company.''
 Ms. McMahon defended her record at the company and said she and her husband had always looked out for the health and safety of those who worked for them.
 ''We of course had a responsibility to our shareholders,'' she said. ''But every good chief executive understands that in addition to maintaining profitability, companies that hope to be successful in the long term absolutely have to put people first.''
 Ms. McMahon, who is making her first bid for public office, highlights her stewardship of W.W.E., saying it gave her the skills needed to create jobs and stimulate the economy.
 And in an interview, she described the W.W.E. as her ''life's work,'' adding, ''One of the things missing today in some of our leaders is real-life experiences.''
 Ms. McMahon, 61, has generated excitement among Republicans nationally, with her splashy advertisements and vast wealth. She has already poured more than $20 million of her own money into the race.
 There is no question the McMahons showed boldness and shrewdness as they led the W.W.E. during a period of tremendous growth. The cable channel's highest-rated show draws 5.5 million viewers a week. The company also generates millions from sold-out live shows broadcast on pay-per-view television, and from merchandise that includes action figures and sleeping bags.
 Transforming Wrestling
 The McMahons entered the industry in 1982, after a series of bad investments and a bankruptcy filing. They took over a small wrestling operation from Mr. McMahon's father, one of many regional outfits that generally stuck to their own territories at the time.
 They then shook up the industry by going national, producing events all around the country and engendering bitterness from rivals.
 And while their competitors made much of their money through sales of tickets to live events, the McMahons were among the first to seize on new revenue sources: television syndication of wrestling events, followed by closed-circuit and pay-per-view broadcasting, which led them to develop their own cable television programming.
 But one of the shrewdest strategies the company pursued was spearheaded by Ms. McMahon, when the W.W.E., in the 1980s, confronted a thicket of regulations from various state athletic commissions, requiring things like physical exams of wrestlers weeks before they would appear, and the stationing of state-approved doctors ringside during matches.
 Ms. McMahon told regulators something few in the industry would say openly at the time: wrestling matches were scripted shows and not athletic competitions that required the kind of oversight that, say, boxing required. The strategy worked. Today, the W.W.E. operates in 29 states without the supervision of state athletic boards or commissions, which also frees the company from the licensing fees imposed by some states.
 ''This was the first public admission by somebody in that business that they were an entertainment and not a sport,'' said Dick Ebersol, the chairman of NBC Universal Sports, who has collaborated on projects with the McMahons. ''Her work in this area got them out of a lot of needless sporting regulation.''
 But the McMahons' approach toward its wrestlers has drawn criticism from former wrestlers, government officials and others.
 Like many other wrestling promoters, they classify their wrestlers -- they have some 140 or 150 under exclusive contract at any one time -- as independent contractors, rather than employees, freeing the company from paying health insurance, Social Security and Medicare contributions and unemployment insurance.
 That means the wrestlers, many of whom experience injuries and long-term health problems, must find health insurance, and they have no automatic retirement benefits to lean on when they can no longer climb into the ring, according to industry experts.
 While big stars in the W.W.E. can land contracts worth more than $1 million annually, others earn less, with base salaries starting at about $35,000 for wrestlers in the developmental program. ''Most of them are not wealthy and have relatively short careers,'' Mr. Meltzer said. ''It's a hard profession.''
 Mr. Sarven, the former wrestler, said: ''The health care industry does not really care for wrestlers or athletes because they consider them obviously high risk for injuries. If you're able to get a company to insure you, the premiums are exorbitant.''
 The company has also been accused of looking the other way as wrestlers, feeling pressured to maintain the pumped-up bodies showcased in the W.W.E., turned to steroids.
 The most damaging accusations grew out of a Congressional committee investigation in 2007 into professional wrestling, which concluded that steroid use was ''pervasive'' among wrestlers and that the industry had refused to address the problem.
 The findings, from Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, who was then the chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight, was especially critical of the W.W.E., describing how, six months after announcing a steroid-testing policy, the company relaxed the rules to let wrestlers suspended for steroid use appear at W.W.E. pay-per-view events.
 The company said it did so merely to allow wrestlers to finish story lines that were under way, and later reinstated the policy.
 In an interview with the committee's staff, Ms. McMahon was pressed to explain why the W.W.E. had abandoned another drug testing program in the 1990s. She told them the program was too costly, and few wrestlers were testing positive.
 ''You are doing this and expending these resources and you are coming back almost all the time to negatives,'' she said, according to a transcript. ''It really became at that time, O.K., let's utilize these dollars more in our marketing effort. Let's build our pay-per-view business. Let's redirect these dollars, so that the cost-effective aspect of it just didn't seem to be there.''
 The committee staff asked her husband whether there were any known health risks associated with steroids. ''I don't know; I am not a doctor,'' Mr. McMahon responded.
 Jerry McDevitt, a lawyer for W.W.E., criticized the inquiry, saying Mr. Waxman had already made up his mind about the issues and that the committee staff member who questioned Mr. McMahon was trying to put words in his mouth.
 ''He's a blowhard,'' he said of Mr. Waxman.
 Obstacles to Organizing
 Other challenges to the McMahons have come from the wrestlers themselves, some of whom have sought to obtain better conditions for themselves and their colleagues.
 But those efforts have made little progress, in part because wrestlers are wary of crossing the couple; the McMahons dominate the business, and require wrestlers to sign exclusive contracts, meaning that those who want a career in the industry have few other options for employment.
 In the 1980s, Jesse Ventura, then a W.W.E. wrestler and later the governor of Minnesota, tried to organize his fellow wrestlers in a union, but found it hard to find wrestlers willing to join him.
 ''It just about cost him his career,'' Kevin Nash, a former W.W.E. star known as Big Sexy, said of Mr. Ventura.
 Mr. Ventura declined to be interviewed.
 Irvin Muchnick, who has written several books on the wrestling industry, said wrestlers had little leverage without a union. Noting that the W.W.E. has a near-monopoly on the industry, he said, ''So you don't have 30 different teams vying for top talent as you do in other sports.''
 But wrestling culture is infused with a tough-minded individualism, and some are ambivalent about organizing. Mr. Sarven, the former W.W.E. wrestler, said that while he believed wrestlers needed better benefits and protections, they were willingly taking the risks that went along with this work.
 ''It would be nice if the promoters were responsible for it, but let me ask you this: Was the promoter responsible for the wrestler becoming a wrestler?'' said Mr. Sarven, who worked briefly as a W.W.E. trainer after being dropped from the wrestling roster. He now wrestles for other promoters.
 In 2008, a group of former wrestlers filed a suit against the W.W.E., claiming that it had deprived them of benefits by misclassifying them as independent contractors instead of employees. The case was dismissed.
 Booker T. Huffman, a W.W.E. veteran, said he left the W.W.E. a few years ago because of the relentless pace.
 ''I didn't want to be one of those guys who gets chewed up and spit out,'' Mr. Huffman, 45, said in an interview. ''Every other sport has off seasons. But with the W.W.E., it's brutal. It's taxing, mentally and physically.''
 In interviews, W.W.E. officials and the McMahons defended the company and its treatment of wrestlers, saying they had transformed and modernized the industry, offering wrestlers lucrative contracts, merchandising deals, royalty payments and appearance fees unheard of 25 years ago.
 Ms. McMahon said that much of the criticism came from people who were simply unaware of how much the industry had changed. And while the company does not provide health coverage to its wrestlers, she said that it did pay for treatment of injuries that they sustained in the ring.
 ''This particular industry has had a lot of evolution,'' she said. ''W.W.E. clearly wants to maintain the health and wellness of this particular talent.''
 Ms. McMahon also defended the company's classification of its wrestlers as contractors, noting that they are often represented by agents and should be viewed like singers, golfers or tennis players. It is a longstanding practice in the industry, W.W.E. officials said, adding that the company holds regular seminars to help wrestlers pick appropriate health insurance plans and manage their finances.
 The McMahons also point out that they have instituted measures intended to ensure the well-being of its former and current wrestlers. In 2006, W.W.E. established a drug, alcohol and cardiac screening program after one of its biggest stars, Eddie Guerrero, 38, was found dead in his hotel room. An autopsy found that he had heart disease that critics say may have been related to the abuse of steroids and pain medication.
 Ms. McMahon, who worked as a legal secretary, a supermarket cashier and a jewelry store manager before joining the wrestling industry, rejects the notion that she was driven by the bottom line at W.W.E., saying the company could not have succeeded had it not looked after its employees. She and her husband own 59 percent of the company's publicly traded stock.
 Aid Efforts Criticized
 The company has also pledged to provide treatment for current and former wrestlers struggling with addictions. But some wrestlers and their families deride that effort as window dressing.
 In 2008, Chris Klucsarits, a former W.W.E. star, sought help through the assistance program. At the time, Mr. Klucsarits, known as Chris Kanyon in the ring, was suffering from depression, which he had battled for several years after being dropped from the W.W.E. roster because of injuries.
 But Mr. Klucsarits never heard back from the company and, in April, was found dead in his Queens apartment alongside a suicide note, according to his brother Ken. ''It didn't seem like they were interested in dealing with him at any level,'' his brother said in a recent interview, referring to W.W.E.
 Company officials said they did not contact Mr. Klucsarits after his inquiry because at the time, Mr. Klucsarits was involved in the lawsuit against the W.W.E. over the wrestlers' status as independent contractors. It did reach out to his lawyer, and noted that the rehab program is for substance abuse not mental health issues.
 Many current and former wrestlers declined to speak on the record for this article, expressing worry that they would anger the McMahons.
 Others said they had given up on the company changing and were trying a different approach.
 Dawn Marie Damatta, who was at one time on the W.W.E. roster, recalled attending an event in Chicago a few years ago where retired wrestlers were signing autographs for fans.
 There, she spotted a legend of the sport dozing off behind an autograph table before the man's agent pushed him into the bathroom in a wheelchair.
 ''I said, 'This man should be enjoying his life, he should be enjoying the fruits of his labor,' '' she said. ''Instead, he is there signing autographs for $20.''
 Ms. Damatta started a charity called Wrestlers Rescue, to help cover health care and other basic needs of retired wrestlers. Still, she wishes that there was some oversight of the industry.
 ''Who calls this entertainment? Vince McMahon,'' she said. ''Why? When sports regulators come after W.W.E., he can say we are entertainment. But this is as grueling as football, and it has a huge impact on the brain and body.''

HEADLINE: Shares Struggle on Weak Manufacturing Reports

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The markets struggled to gain ground on Thursday amid economic worries and concerns about the effects of legislation that Congress passed governing on the financial sector. 
 Bank stocks were among those that closed down. But the dampening effect came mostly from the new manufacturing and business outlook indexes that recorded declines in June and July, raising the possibility of another slowdown this year. The reports overshadowed strong earnings posted by JPMorgan Chase.
 At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.41 points, or 0.07 percent, at 10,359.31. But the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.31 points, or 0.12 percent, to 1,096.48. 
 The Nasdaq composite index was down 0.8 points, or 0.03 percent, at 2,249.08; in after-hours trading, Google took a big drop after reporting weaker-than-expected earnings.
 After the markets had closed, news emerged that Goldman Sachs agreed to pay $550 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission to settle charges of securities fraud linked to mortgage investments. That sent the investment bank's shares up more than 5 percent after hours. 
 The market had little notable reaction to the final approval Congress gave to a broad overhaul of the nation's financial regulatory system, intended to address the causes of the 2008 economic crisis. The legislation now heads to President Obama for his signature.
 The legislative process has been in the works for some time, but there were still questions as to what the regulatory policy would look like.
 ''A lot of that is still a work in progress,'' said Doug Roberts, the chief investment strategist for Channel Capital Research. 
 ''Everybody knew it was Swiss cheese and has a whole bunch of things that need to be worked out,'' he said. ''It's 2,300 pages, and there is a question of really what is in it.''
 But throughout the trading session, the manufacturing reports were particularly worrisome, analysts said, because the sector had been a strong point in an otherwise weak recovery. Exports in May rose 2.4 percent, the government reported earlier this year. The government's industrial production report said there was a 0.4 percent drop in manufacturing output in June compared with the previous month.
 In contrast, consumer spending has been erratic and is expected to remain so given the uncertainty in the job market.
 ''Much will depend on the consumer, and we feel that the headwinds for consumer spending remain too brisk to expect substantial help on this front as the year progresses,'' Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR, said.
 Daniel J. Meckstroth, the chief economist for the Manufacturers Alliance-MAPI, said he expected a slower pace of manufacturing growth well into next year, considering the year-on-year rate was 7.9 percent.
 ''It is not a boom out there,'' he said. ''This is not going to be a V-shaped recovery.''
 Among the companies reporting earnings on Thursday, JPMorgan Chase turned in results that easily exceeded expectations. Analysts have said that investors would be extrapolating those results to the other big banks reporting on Friday and next week, but they were still not enough to overpower the message the economy was slowing.
 JPMorgan Chase shares rose 11 cents, to $40.46. Bank of America fell 28 cents, to $15.39, and Citigroup fell 5 cents, to $4.16.
 Google reported net income was up 24 percent in the second quarter, to $1.84 billion, or $5.71 a share, from $1.48 billion, or $4.66 a share. Excluding the cost of stock options and the related tax benefits, Google's second-quarter profit was $6.45 a share. Though Google's second-quarter revenue beat analysts' expectations, its profit missed expectations. Its shares were down more than 4 percent after hours.
 Treasury rates fell as investors looked for havens; the yield on the 10-year note slipped below 3 percent to close at 2.99 percent. The price rose 14/32 to 104 9/32.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Settling Its Complaints With Goldman

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN and LOUISE STORY; Sewell Chan reported from Washington, and Louise Story from New York. Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Goldman Sachs has agreed to pay $550 million to settle federal claims that it misled investors in a subprime mortgage product as the housing market began to collapse, officials said Thursday. 
 If approved by a federal judge in Manhattan, the settlement would rank among the largest in the 76-year history of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but it would represent only a small financial dent for Goldman, which reported $13.39 billion in profit last year.
 News of the settlement sent Goldman's shares 5 percent higher in after-hours trading, adding far more to the firm's market value than the amount it will have to pay in the settlement.
 Even so, the settlement is humbling for Goldman, whose elite reputation and lucrative banking business endured through the financial crisis, only to be battered by government investigations that shed light on potential conflicts of interest in its dealings. 
 ''This settlement is a stark lesson to Wall Street firms that no product is too complex, and no investor too sophisticated, to avoid a heavy price if a firm violates the fundamental principles of honest treatment and fair dealing,'' said Robert S. Khuzami, the commission's director of enforcement. 
 The civil suit brought by the S.E.C. focused on a single mortgage security that Goldman created in 2007, just as cracks appeared in the housing market. That security, called Abacus 2007-AC1, enabled a prominent hedge fund manager, John A. Paulson, to place a bet against mortgage bonds. 
 The commission contended that Goldman misled investors, who were making a positive bet on housing, because Goldman did not disclose Mr. Paulson's involvement in creating the deal. Mr. Paulson has not been accused of wrongdoing.
 Though Goldman did not formally admit to the S.E.C.'s allegations, it agreed to a judicial order barring it from committing intentional fraud in the future under federal securities laws.
 In addition, Goldman acknowledged that the marketing materials for Abacus ''contained incomplete information'' and that it was ''a mistake'' not to have disclosed Mr. Paulson's role. As part of the agreement, the bank also said it ''regrets that the marketing materials did not contain that disclosure.''
 Goldman's general counsel, Gregory K. Palm, signed the S.E.C. settlement on Wednesday, though it was not announced until after markets closed on Thursday. Officials said the timing was not affected by the Senate's approval of an overhaul of financial regulations. 
 Word that Goldman had settled the case began leaking about 30 minutes before the markets closed and appeared to please investors; some analysts had expected a settlement by this Monday, when Goldman, which had been under pressure by shareholders to reach a settlement, was expected to deliver a formal response to the commission's complaint. 
 ''We believe that this settlement is the right outcome for our firm, our shareholders and our clients,'' Goldman said in a written statement on Thursday. 
 When the commission filed its case in April, Goldman took a notably defensive stance. The bank had apparently been surprised that investigators did not warn its executives about the case and give them a chance to settle at that time. 
 Yet Goldman began holding settlement talks with the S.E.C. immediately after the complaint was filed. As the weeks and months dragged on, Goldman executives heard concerns from clients and former executives. 
 Goldman was bound to face another round of questions from analysts next week, when the bank is scheduled to report its earnings. 
 The settlement removes a significant problem looming over Goldman, but it could still face other legal problems.
 Though Goldman said that it understood the S.E.C. was not planning to bring other cases, the commission continues to investigate collateralized debt obligations, like the Abacus security, issued by Goldman and other banks, and could still take action. 
 The Justice Department also had been reviewing the Abacus deal, and the S.E.C. could refer other findings to prosecutors. 
 Goldman faces private lawsuits related to multiple mortgage securities and to its decision not to tell its shareholders last year when it received formal notification that the S.E.C. was investigating the Abacus deal. 
 ''Goldman played fast and loose in the Abacus deal, misled its clients, and got called on it today,'' said Senator Carl M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who led a separate Congressional investigation that examined the Abacus deal. 
 ''A key factor in the settlement is that Goldman acknowledges wrongdoing, in addition to paying a fine and changing its practices,'' Mr. Levin said in a written statement. ''I hope the Goldman settlement together with the new financial reform law -- which prohibits additional unethical practices and conflicts of interest -- signal an end to the abusive practices that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis and the beginning of needed Wall Street reforms.''
 The settlement announced on Thursday awaits approval by a federal judge, Barbara S. Jones, in the Southern District of New York. A year ago, the S.E.C. suffered a black eye when a different judge in that district rejected a settlement between the commission and Bank of America. The commission settled with the bank later on, after substantially increasing the fine.
 Under the proposed settlement, Goldman would pay back the $15 million in profit it made from the Abacus deal and also pay a civil penalty of $535 million. The money would be given to the two banks that had losses on the deal -- $150 million to IKB Deutsche Industriebank and $100 million to the Royal Bank of Scotland Group -- with the rest, $300 million, going to the United States Treasury as a fine.
 Goldman's settlement requires it to make changes in how it reviews and approves offerings of certain mortgage securities. 
 Cornelius K. Hurley, director of the Morin Center for Banking and Financial Law at Boston University and a former Federal Reserve lawyer, said the dollar amount would not dent the public anger at the banks. 
 ''You have to consider the symbolism of the S.E.C.'s case. When it was filed back in April, it completely changed the dynamic on Capitol Hill,'' Mr. Hurley said. ''Now comes the settlement and it's $550 million. Well, two weeks ago we were talking about a $19 billion tax on the likes of Goldman. The public wanted to see either more financial pain or actually have a trial.''
 Goldman was not the only Wall Street firm to create complex mortgage securities that allowed investors to make negative bets, and the commission continues to look at other deals from across the industry. 
 Fabrice P. Tourre, the Goldman vice president who was named in the S.E.C. case, was not included in the settlement. 
 Mr. Tourre took a leave from Goldman after the case was filed. When he appeared before a Senate committee in April, he said he should have pointed out Mr. Paulson's involvement in Abacus in the deal's marketing materials. The lawyer for Mr. Tourre did not return a phone call seeking comment on Thursday.
 The Goldman settlement would be larger than the $400 million the mortgage giant Fannie Mae, accused of inflating its earnings while lavishing its executives with bonuses, agreed to pay in 2006, but smaller than the $750 million the telecommunications company WorldCom was ordered to pay in 2003 after an accounting scandal. Fannie Mae was seized by the government in 2008, and WorldCom, after emerging from bankruptcy, eventually became part of Verizon.

HEADLINE: As Profits Grow, Google Investors Ask What's Next

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Like an impatient audience at intermission, Google's investors are waiting for its second act. 
 Google continues to dominate in its core business, search advertising, which accounts for more than 90 percent of its revenue. But as Google grows and search becomes increasingly competitive, analysts and investors are beginning to wonder what is next for the company. 
 In a sign of their impatience, Google's stock price has sunk 17 percent over the last three months. It fell about 4 percent, to $474, in after-hours trading on Thursday after its announcement that both revenue and net income rose 24 percent in the second quarter, which ended June 30. 
 The company said its net income rose to $1.84 billion, or $5.71 a share, from $1.48 billion, or $4.66 a share. Excluding the cost of stock options and the related tax benefits, Google's second-quarter profit was $6.45 a share. 
 Its revenue rose to $6.82 billion, from $5.52 billion in the year-ago quarter. Net revenue, which excludes commissions paid to advertising partners, was $5.09 billion, up from $4.07 billion a year ago. Google said that in the second quarter, paid clicks on Google sites and other sites that run Google ads grew 15 percent from the same period last year, and decreased 3 percent over the first quarter of 2010. 
 Though revenue beat analysts' expectations, its profit missed expectations. 
 ''It's an incredibly talented pony, possibly the most talented pony we've ever seen, but we're waiting for that second trick,'' said Jordan Rohan, a managing director at Stifel Nicolaus and an Internet and digital media analyst. 
 Google has been testing out new tricks, including display ads and mobile phones, with its Android mobile operating system and acquisition of AdMob, the mobile advertising company, which was completed during the quarter. 
 Customers are activating 160,000 Android mobile devices a day, up from 65,000 last quarter, said Jonathan Rosenberg, senior vice president of product management at Google, in a call with analysts. And Google is developing new kinds of mobile ads. For instance, when Carnival Cruise Lines included a phone number in its mobile ad, bookings almost tripled, he said. 
 The display ad business is also growing well, Mr. Rosenberg said. Google is experimenting with new types of display ads, like expandable ads on YouTube and ads aimed at a specific audience, like young women who like basketball. More advertisers are running campaigns that include search, display and mobile ads. Google also announced that it had formed a partnership with Omnicon Media Group, the advertising company, to create a trading desk for display ads. 
 But none of these new businesses are generating significant revenue for the search giant yet. 
 ''Search has slowed down and Google has more competition, but Google's non-search business is not enough to move the needle,'' said Sandeep Aggarwal, senior Internet and software analyst at Caris & Company. 
 In May, Google shuttered its online store selling the Nexus One mobile phone after poor sales. And while Google has hinted that YouTube, a hub for display ads, is on the verge of profitability, it did not announce on Thursday that the video site was profitable, as some analysts expected it might. 
 ''What I can tell you is we're incredibly pleased by its trajectory,'' said Patrick Pichette, Google's chief financial officer. YouTube videos with ads are viewed a billion times a week, he said. 
 As Google expands into new businesses, it continues to face increasing competition from many directions. 
 ''Investors are curious about what Google feels like in a world where Apple controls a big chunk of the mobile world, Facebook controls a big chunk of the social world, and Google and Amazon vie for control of the commercial world,'' Mr. Rohan said. 
 Google's ambitious hiring and spending on acquisitions cut into its profit margins, even though the investments may pay off over the long term, analysts said. The company added 1,184 employees during the quarter, mostly in engineering and sales, bringing the total to 21,805 employees. 
 Google is also racking up legal and lobbying costs as it faces increased pressure from regulators. Most recently, antitrust regulators said they were looking into Google's planned acquisition of ITA, which makes flight information software. 
 The company's international business, which accounts for just over half of its revenue, has recently received good news. China renewed Google's license to operate a Web site there after a standoff over the country's Internet censorship rules, and business in Brazil, India and Russia grew during the quarter.

HEADLINE: CONGRESS PASSES MAJOR OVERHAUL Of FINANCE RULES

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress approved a sweeping expansion of federal financial regulation on Thursday, reflecting a renewed mistrust of financial markets after decades in which Washington stood back from Wall Street with wide-eyed admiration.
 The bill, heavily promoted by President Obama and Congressional Democrats as a response to the 2008 financial crisis, cleared the Senate by a vote of 60 to 39, largely along party lines, after weeks of wrangling that allowed Democrats to pick up the three Republican votes to ensure passage. 
 The vote was the culmination of nearly two years of fierce lobbying and intense debate over the appropriate response to the financial excesses that dragged the nation into the worst recession since the Great Depression.
 The result is a catalog of repairs and additions to the rusted infrastructure of a regulatory system that has failed to keep up with the expanding scope and complexity of modern finance. 
 The bill subjects more financial companies to federal oversight, regulates many derivatives contracts, and creates a panel to detect risks to the financial system along with a consumer protection regulator. It leaves a vast number of details for regulators to work out, inevitably setting off another round of battles that could last for years. 
 Over the last half-century, as traders and lenders increasingly drove the nation's economic growth, politicians of both parties scrambled to get out of the way, passing a series of landmark bills that allowed financial companies to become larger, less transparent and more profitable.
 Usury laws were set aside. Banks were allowed to expand across state lines, sell insurance, trade securities. The government watched and did nothing as the bulk of financial activity moved into a parallel universe of private investment funds, unregulated lenders and black markets like derivatives trading.
 That era of hands-off optimism was gaveled to an end on Thursday as the Senate gave final approval to a bill that reasserts the importance of federal supervision of financial transactions.
 ''The financial industry is central to our nation's ability to grow, to prosper, to compete and to innovate. This reform will foster that innovation, not hamper it,'' Mr. Obama said Thursday. ''Unless your business model depends on cutting corners or bilking your customers, you have nothing to fear.''
 The White House said Mr. Obama would sign the legislation next week.
 Democrats, who celebrated with high fives and handshakes as the bill was packed in a blue box for delivery to the White House, argue that the government's expanded role will improve the stability of the financial system without sapping its vitality. But that project faces considerable challenges. Many investors have withdrawn from markets like commercial paper that were once seen as safe. Lenders have lost faith in borrowers. Politicians and central bankers are struggling to repair economies and restore the flow of credit.
 Even the bill's political luster no longer seems certain. Despite public anger at Wall Street, the vast majority of Republicans opposed the bill with loud confidence, betting ahead of hotly contested midterm elections that the public dislikes government even more.
 Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of Alabama, described the bill as ''a 2,300-page legislative monster.''
 ''It creates vast new bureaucracies with little accountability and seriously, I believe, undermines the competitiveness of the American economy,'' Mr. Shelby said on the Senate floor before the final vote. ''Unfortunately, the bill does very little to make our system safer.''
 The three Republicans who voted in favor were New England moderates, Olympia J. Snowe and Susan Collins of Maine and Scott Brown of Massachusetts. The one Democratic holdout was Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, who said he voted against the bill because it was not tough enough.
 The bill expands federal banking and securities regulation from its focus on banks and public markets, subjecting a wider range of financial companies to government oversight, and imposing regulation for the first time on ''black markets'' like the enormous trade in credit derivatives.
 It creates a council of federal regulators, led by the Treasury secretary, to coordinate the detection of risks to the financial system, and it provides new powers to constrain and even dismantle troubled companies.
 It also creates a powerful new regulator, appointed by the president, to protect consumers of financial products, which will be housed in the Federal Reserve. The first visible result may come in about two years, the deadline for the consumer regulator to create a simplified disclosure form for mortgage loans.
 Officials are already working to prepare for the expansion of government, including finding buildings in Washington to house the new agencies.
 The rhythms of Washington have long dictated that crises beget legislation, but Democrats insisted Thursday that these changes also represented a long-overdue response to the evolution of the financial industry.
 ''This is a public sector response to transformative changes in the private sector,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and a crucial author of the legislation. ''You have to have rules that allow you to continue to get the benefit of the innovation but curtail abuses.''
 Democrats divided initially over how to pursue that goal. Some pushed to break apart large banks and curtail risky kinds of trading. Others sought a grander overhaul of federal regulation. The administration's approach, which prevailed, instead is focused on giving existing regulators additional powers in the hope that they will produce better results.
 The legislation is painted in broad strokes, so like actors handed a script, those regulators have broad leeway to shape its meaning and its impact.
 ''This is a framework that has the potential to be as modern as the markets, but its efficacy will certainly depend upon the judgments that regulators make,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, the president's chief economic adviser.
 The legislation, for example, requires many derivatives to be traded through clearinghouses, a form of insurance for the traders, and it requires traders to disclose pricing data to encourage competition. But regulators will decide which derivatives, and how long traders can wait to disclose pricing information. 
 The administration can shape that process through the appointment of new leaders for the various agencies. The Senate held confirmation hearings on Thursday for three nominees to the Fed's board of governors. In addition to appointing a new consumer regulator, the president will nominate a new comptroller of the currency, responsible for regulating national banks. 
 The same groups that fought to shape the legislation -- bankers and business groups, consumer advocates and trade unions -- already have turned their attention to the rule-making process, seeking a second chance to influence outcomes. Much of the work must be completed over the next two years, but the bill sets some deadlines more than a decade from now.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, who as banking committee chairman was a main architect of the legislation, said its success ultimately would depend on regulators' performance.
 ''We can't legislate wisdom or passion. We can't legislate competency. All we can do is create the structures and hope that good people will be appointed who will attract other good people,'' Mr. Dodd said.
 Mr. Dodd said he would hold hearings beginning in September to check up on that work before he retires at the end of the year.
 The legislation will be carried out mostly by the same federal workers who were on duty as the financial system collapsed. The new consumer bureau, for example, mostly will be staffed with employees transferred from the consumer divisions of the existing banking regulators, which have been excoriated by Congress and other critics for failing to protect borrowers from obvious and widespread abuses.
 Administration officials said they were confident that providing new leaders for those employees and granting them new powers, would produce better results.

HEADLINE: Obama Pushes an Agenda, Disregarding Polls That Disapprove

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- If passage of the financial regulatory overhaul on Thursday proves anything about President Obama, it is this: He knows how to push big bills through a balky Congress. 
 But Mr. Obama's legislative success poses a paradox: while he may be winning on Capitol Hill, he is losing with voters at a time of economic distress, and soon may be forced to scale back his ambitions.
 The financial regulatory bill is the final piece of a legislative hat trick that also included the stimulus bill and the landmark new health care law. Over the last 18 months, Mr. Obama and the Democratic Congress have made considerable inroads in passing what could be the most ambitious agenda in decades. 
 Mr. Obama has done what he promised when he ran for office in 2008: he has used government as an instrument to try to narrow the gaps between the haves and the have-nots. He has injected $787 billion in tax dollars into the economy, provided health coverage to 32 million uninsured and now, reordered the relationship among Washington, Wall Street, investors and consumers.
 But as he has done so, the political context has changed around him. Today, with unemployment remaining persistently near double digits despite the scale of the stimulus program and the BPoil spill having raised questions about his administration's competence, Mr. Obama's signature legislation is providing ammunition to conservatives who argue that government is the problem, not the solution.
 What Mr. Obama and his allies portray as progressive, activist government has been framed by his opponents as overreaching and profligate when it comes to the economy. 
 Even before the November elections, the White House is being forced to recalibrate. This week, Mr. Obama and Senate Democrats decided to press ahead with a scaled-back energy bill, having concluded after months of gridlock that the sweeping measure they once envisioned simply would not pass. It is a tactic that the president will likely have to employ more and more after the November elections, when Democrats will almost certainly lose seats -- and may even lose control of the House or Senate.
 ''They clearly made a decision that political capital was something that should be used, not saved,'' said Steven Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked for years as a senior leadership aide on Capitol Hill. ''The reality is, he talked before the election about what he wanted to do, and he's done it. He didn't trim his sails, he didn't change his philosophy. He didn't compromise. The test will come in the fall: can he and Democrats in Congress make the case to the American people that what he did was the right thing to do?''
 That is a difficult case to make, though Mr. Obama is trying. The latest CBS News poll found that while a majority of Americans supported increasing regulations on banks and financial institutions, nearly three-quarters said Mr. Obama's stimulus bill had not improved the economy, and only a little more than a third approved of the health care law. 
 ''You know, sometimes these pundits, they can't figure me out,'' the president said last week, campaigning in Kansas City, Mo., for the Democratic Senate candidate there. ''They say, 'Well, why is he doing that?' That doesn't poll well. Well, I've got my own pollsters, I know it doesn't poll well. But it's the right thing to do for America.''
 It is an argument that sounds eerily similar to the one Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, made to justify an unpopular war in Iraq as he watched his own poll numbers sink lower. Mr. Bush and his aides often felt they could not catch a break; when the economy was humming along -- or at least seemed to be humming along -- the Bush White House never got credit for it, because the public was so upset about the war. 
 In Mr. Obama's case, people are up in arms over the economy. Just 40 percent of Americans now approve of Mr. Obama's handling of the economy, the CBS News poll found. More than half said he was spending too little time on the economy. In one of the most striking findings, nearly two-thirds said the president's economic policies had no effect on them personally -- just 13 percent said they had helped them. 
 ''Voters don't have a checklist that they tick off, of what an elected official promised and then delivered,'' said Charlie Cook, the editor of The Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan newsletter that tracks Congressional races. ''They were enormously frustrated last year by the fixation on health care when they wanted a focus on the economy, with Democrats losing the messaging fight on whether what they did was right and effective or not.''
 Part of the problem for Mr. Obama is that he came to Washington vowing to change the partisan tone in the capital, something he has thus far been unable to do. Just three Senate Republicans voted for the financial regulatory bill on Thursday, continuing a pattern that began early in Mr. Obama's presidency when just three Republicans joined him on the stimulus bill. 
 At this point, relations between the president and the opposing party are no better than they were when Mr. Bush left office. Within hours of the bill's passage on Thursday, Democrats including Mr. Obama were reminding voters that the House Republican leader, Representative John Boehner of Ohio, had called for its repeal. As Mr. Obama traveled to Michigan on Thursday to promote his economic policies, Mr. Boehner accused him of ''a bunch of fuzzy math.''
 If Republicans reclaim control of the House, the Senate or both, Mr. Obama will find himself in a situation similar to that of the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, who lost control of the House in 1994 in a historic realignment. Mr. Clinton responded by steering toward the center, searching for issues on which he could find Republicans to cooperate. 
 If Mr. Obama's new tack on the energy bill is any guide, he may be willing to refashion himself as a pragmatist who will compromise in exchange for smaller victories. The coming elections may answer the question of how far the president, having had a taste of big things, is willing to bend.
 ''It could be a prescription for real gridlock, or it could be a prescription for great compromise,'' said John Feehery, a Republican strategist, ''and I don't think we know the answer.''

HEADLINE: Redo That Voodoo

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Republicans are feeling good about the midterms -- so good that they've started saying what they really think. This week the party's Senate leadership stopped pretending that it cares about deficits, stating explicitly that while we can't afford to aid the unemployed or prevent mass layoffs of schoolteachers, cost is literally no object when it comes to tax cuts for the affluent.
 And that's one reason -- there are others -- why you should fear the consequences if the G.O.P. actually does as well in November as it hopes. 
 For a while, leading Republicans posed as stern foes of federal red ink. Two weeks ago, in the official G.O.P. response to President Obama's weekly radio address, Senator Saxby Chambliss devoted his entire time to the evils of government debt, ''one of the most dangerous threats confronting America today.'' He went on, ''At some point we have to say 'enough is enough.' ''
 But this past Monday Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate, was asked the obvious question: if deficits are so worrisome, what about the budgetary cost of extending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, which the Obama administration wants to let expire but Republicans want to make permanent? What should replace $650 billion or more in lost revenue over the next decade?
 His answer was breathtaking: ''You do need to offset the cost of increased spending. And that's what Republicans object to. But you should never have to offset the cost of a deliberate decision to reduce tax rates on Americans.'' So $30 billion in aid to the unemployed is unaffordable, but 20 times that much in tax cuts for the rich doesn't count.
 The next day, Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, confirmed that Mr. Kyl was giving the official party line: ''There's no evidence whatsoever that the Bush tax cuts actually diminished revenue. They increased revenue, because of the vibrancy of these tax cuts in the economy. So I think what Senator Kyl was expressing was the view of virtually every Republican on that subject.''
 Now there are many things one could call the Bush economy, an economy that, even before recession struck, was characterized by sluggish job growth and stagnant family incomes; ''vibrant'' isn't one of them. But the real news here is the confirmation that Republicans remain committed to deep voodoo, the claim that cutting taxes actually increases revenues.
 It's not true, of course. Ronald Reagan said that his tax cuts would reduce deficits, then presided over a near-tripling of federal debt. When Bill Clinton raised taxes on top incomes, conservatives predicted economic disaster; what actually followed was an economic boom and a remarkable swing from budget deficit to surplus. Then the Bush tax cuts came along, helping turn that surplus into a persistent deficit, even before the crash.
 But we're talking about voodoo economics here, so perhaps it's not surprising that belief in the magical powers of tax cuts is a zombie doctrine: no matter how many times you kill it with facts, it just keeps coming back. And despite repeated failure in practice, it is, more than ever, the official view of the G.O.P.
 Why should this scare you? On paper, solving America's long-run fiscal problems is eminently doable: stronger cost control for Medicare plus a moderate rise in taxes would get us most of the way there. And the perception that the deficit is manageable has helped keep U.S. borrowing costs low. 
 But if politicians who insist that the way to reduce deficits is to cut taxes, not raise them, start winning elections again, how much faith can anyone have that we'll do what needs to be done? Yes, we can have a fiscal crisis. But if we do, it won't be because we've spent too much trying to create jobs and help the unemployed. It will be because investors have looked at our politics and concluded, with justification, that we've turned into a banana republic.
 Of course, flirting with crisis is arguably part of the plan. There has always been a sense in which voodoo economics was a cover story for the real doctrine, which was ''starve the beast'': slash revenue with tax cuts, then demand spending cuts to close the resulting budget gap. The point is that starve the beast basically amounts to deliberately creating a fiscal crisis, in the belief that the crisis can be used to push through unpopular policies, like dismantling Social Security. 
 Anyway, we really should thank Senators Kyl and McConnell for their sudden outbursts of candor. They've now made it clear, in case anyone had doubts, that their previous posturing on the deficit was entirely hypocritical. If they really do have the kind of electoral win they're expecting, they won't try to reduce the deficit -- they'll try to make it explode by demanding even more budget-busting tax cuts.

HEADLINE: Congress Passes Financial Reform

 BODY:
There was more than enough in the financial reform bill -- now on its way to President Obama -- to merit broad support. Yet, for Thursday's final Senate vote on the bill, 60 to 39, just three Republicans joined 57 Democrats to support reform. In the House, only three Republicans voted for the bill when it passed that chamber in June, 237 to 192. 
 Republican opponents would have you believe that lack of bipartisanship was evidence of the bill's unworthiness, but the margin of victory was really about partisan politics and not the bill's content. That made the vote an even greater victory for Mr. Obama, who has had to fight for every inch of progress against entrenched Republicans (who have been willing to deny unemployment benefits to millions of Americans rather than cooperate with Democrats on anything). 
 As was the case with last year's economic stimulus and this year's health care overhaul, Republican opposition to the bill was primarily an attempt to drag down Mr. Obama by killing any legislative accomplishment.
 When that effort was headed for failure, Republican leaders disparaged the bill on ideological grounds. On Thursday, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, lashed out at what he called a ''government-driven solution,'' while the senior Republican on the banking committee, Richard Shelby of Alabama, bemoaned ''vast new bureaucracies.'' 
 Those are convenient and time-tested bugaboos to campaign by, but they ignore the urgent needs the bill addresses, and its achievements. Those include resolution procedures to help ensure that shareholders and creditors -- not taxpayers -- bear the losses when big financial institutions fail; new capital requirements for banks and other curbs to help quell speculative excess, including the regulation of derivatives and restrictions on proprietary trading.
 To get all that, the bill had to withstand a lobbying juggernaut. Since January 2009, the financial sector has spent nearly $600 million to weaken reform, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The lobbyists notched some victories, to be sure, mainly in the defeat of reforms that would have broken up large banks and done more to constrain risk-taking throughout the financial system. 
 But they also lost, especially on consumer protection. The new consumer financial protection bureau established in the bill is a milestone, not only for its intent and power to rectify lending abuses, but because it will institutionalize the insight that the safety and soundness of banks cannot -- and should not -- be measured by profitability alone, but by the impact that bank practices ultimately may have on consumers.
 Having earned this victory, the Obama White House and the bill's Congressional supporters still have another fight ahead of them -- over implementing the bill. The legislation requires regulators to write hundreds of rules and conduct dozens of studies, a process that occurs largely outside of public view. 
 Complicating public trust in the process is the fact that some of the regulatory bodies -- the Federal Reserve comes most prominently to mind -- are still run by the same people who were blind-eyed as the financial crisis developed. And because the implementation phase is labor- and resource-intensive, public-interest groups, including consumer and investor advocates, will be outmatched by the financial lobby. Congress will have to be unceasingly vigilant during the rule-making to ensure that resulting regulations reflect lawmakers' intent and the public's needs.
 The administration also must supply top-level fire power, and use the president's bully pulpit, to guarantee that the bill's promise is fulfilled. 
 Supporters of this much-needed financial reform bill took a well-earned bow on Thursday. Now they have to get back to work.

HEADLINE: Aid to Haiti: The View From the World Bank

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Finishing Haiti's Unfinished Work,'' by Jean-Max Bellerive, the prime minister of Haiti, and former President Bill Clinton (Op-Ed, July 12), makes clear that success in Haiti will be measured in tangible results that improve the lives of the Haitian people. 
 Of the $5.3 billion pledged in New York at the end of March, about $500 million was pledged to the Haiti Reconstruction Fund, for which the World Bank is trustee. As of Thursday, only $98 million has been contributed from five donors: Brazil, Norway, Australia, Estonia and Colombia. Other donors, including the United States, should quickly follow suit.
 Within one day of the first meeting of Prime Minister Bellerive's and Mr. Clinton's Reconstruction Commission in June, the Reconstruction Fund allocated $30 million to help the government of Haiti fill its budget gap to provide vital services and social assistance. This money will leverage an additional $30 million of International Development Association grants from the World Bank for budget support.
 The United States Congress and many parliaments have made clear that funds given to Haiti should be managed in the most efficient way and to the highest governance standards. Speed is of the essence, but so are controls to ensure that funds are not misspent. That means we need to know who will get the money and how it will be spent. Projects must truly benefit the poor. The record of aid to Haiti over the last 20 years demands nothing less.

HEADLINE: With Settlement, Blankfein Keeps His Grip

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY

 BODY:
The word spread through Wall Street just before 3:30 Thursday afternoon: It looked as if Lloyd C. Blankfein had finally struck a deal. 
 Even before the official announcement arrived an hour later -- that Goldman would pay $550 million to settle federal claims that it had misled investors in a complex mortgage investment -- the financial markets gave Mr. Blankfein, Goldman's leader, a resounding thumbs up. 
 Goldman's share price jumped nearly 4.3 percent on hopes that Mr. Blankfein and his bank had, in a stroke, put one of the most embarrassing episodes in the bank's recent history behind them. 
 The news that Goldman Sachs had struck a deal was viewed by many on Wall Street as a something of a victory for Mr. Blankfein. 
 Only weeks ago, as Goldman's negotiations with federal authorities dragged on and the bad publicity mounted, some speculated that Mr. Blankfein might lose his grip on Goldman. 
 Instead, Mr. Blankfein will, at least for now, remain both chairman and chief executive of the bank, the most profitable in Wall Street history. Some had speculated the legal dustup would at least cost him the chairmanship. 
 Indeed, the settlement, while one of the largest in financial history, was half the size that many analysts had originally predicted. It represents a mere 15 days of profits, based on Goldman's 2009 earnings. 
 Whether Goldman will ultimately change senior management in light of the humbling settlement is uncertain. But few inside or outside Goldman see an immediate threat to Mr. Blankfein, who, for many Americans, has become the public face of Wall Street excess. 
 Mr. Blankfein's remarkable and controversial success in guiding Goldman through the financial crisis, punctuated by his claims that Goldman was doing ''God's work,'' made him an object of public scorn. But on Wall Street, where money is the ultimate measure, he seems to have delivered once again. 
 ''It looks like a big win for Goldman,'' said David Smick, a Washington-based financial adviser. ''It seems like a paltry sum.''
 Mr. Smick continued: ''I assume Blankfein's future is determined by the Goldman stock price. So far he gets an A.''
 Goldman's share price, beaten down after the Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud claims against the bank in April, snapped back on Thursday. The stock rose $6.16, to $145.22. The stock is still down nearly 14 percent this year. 
 Coming on the same day that the Senate passed an overhaul of the financial regulation, the long-awaited settlement sweeps aside some of the dark clouds hanging over Goldman and Mr. Blankfein, who has helped transform the bank into a trading powerhouse. Yes, Goldman got a black eye. But it was not bloodied nearly as badly as many had expected, or perhaps hoped. 
 Goldman and its leader may not be free and clear, however. It is possible that investors or Goldman shareholders may yet file civil claims against the bank. 
 ''I don't know what this means for Blankfein,'' said Bert Ely, a banking analyst. ''There has been scuttlebutt for months about whether he would survive this.''
 But he said the fact that Goldman's share price rose as word spread about the coming announcement meant investors thought the settlement was good for Goldman.
 ''Goldman appears to have put its government problems behind them, but they are not over this by any means,'' Mr. Ely said.
 For many, the timing of the settlement, coming so soon after the passage of the financial regulation bill, seemed more than coincidental.
 ''Were they told, 'Sit on your hands, don't fight reform, and we will agree a settlement?' '' wondered Mr. Smick.
 But he said there were still questions ahead for Goldman, in particular its continuing status as a bank holding company, which gives it the tremendous advantage of access to the Federal Reserve discount window and cheap money. He said that issue had not been addressed in the financial bill.
 After the announcement, banking analysts rushed to affirm their glowing outlook for Goldman stock -- analysts at Credit Suisse confirmed their ''outperform'' rating for Goldman, saying the deal removed an overhang for Goldman. 
 ''For Goldman, we do not anticipate any material long-term impact to the firm's client franchise,'' Howard Chen, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a research note. Nor, Mr. Chen wrote, did Credit Suisse envision senior management changes related to the settlement.

HEADLINE: From an Oyster in the Gulf, a Domino Effect

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY

 BODY:
BAYOU GRAND CAILLOU, La.
In Gulf of Mexico waters deemed safe, at least for now, the two metal claws of a weather-beaten flatboat rake the muck below for those prehistoric chunks of desire, oysters. Then the captain and his two deckhands, their shirts flecked with the pewter mud of the sea, dump the dripping haul onto metal tables and begin the culling.
They hammer apart the clumps of attached oysters and toss back the empty shells and stray bits of Hurricane Katrina debris. They work quickly but carefully; a jagged oyster will slice your hand for not respecting its beautiful ugliness.
The men sweep their catch onto the boat's floor, not far from a pile of burlap sacks. Their day will be measured by the number of full sacks their boat, the Miss Allison, carries to shore. Each 100-pound sack means $14 for the captain and $3 apiece for the deckhands. 
The rocklike oyster and the burlap sack. As basic as it gets in the gulf, yet both are integral to a complex system of recycling and ingenuity, a system now threatened, along with most everything else, by the continuing oil-spill catastrophe in the gulf.
The disaster's economic fallout has had a sneaky domino effect, touching the lives of everyone from the French Quarter shuckers who turn oyster-opening into theater to the Minnesota businessman who grinds the shells for chicken-feed supplement. Some victims were unaware that they were even tiles in the game, so removed were they from the damaged waters.
Take the burlap sacks on this oyster boat, for example, bearing the markings of Brazilian, Costa Rican and Mexican coffee companies. They come from a simple business, Steve's Burlap Sacks, run out of a hot warehouse in Waveland, Miss., 120 miles away. And if you were to go there today, you would find the warehouse quiet, and the work-hardened owner trying very hard to keep it together.
''I don't think the Lord's looking this way no more,'' he says.
Before a distant and fatal oil-rig explosion nearly three months ago, here is how the symbiotic sack-and-oyster system worked:
Coffee companies in Florida, Louisiana and Texas would unload the raw beans shipped from around the world, then sell their sacks in bulk to just about the only person who wanted them, a callused former oysterman from Louisiana named Steve Airhart.
Burlap sacks have long seemed almost divinely designed to hold oysters. Resilient, ventilated, able to handle the wet, and when past their use, they even burn well enough to keep the docks free of the pesky bugs called no-see-ums. But two decades ago, when Mr. Airhart was still raking for oysters, he could never find enough sacks.
After a friend's relative helped him get some sacks from a large coffee importer, Mr. Airhart sensed opportunity. Within a year, he was harvesting sacks rather than oysters, sorting and stacking them in his driveway and then reselling them to oyster operations. From Bayou La Batre, Ala., to Galveston, Tex., he became known as the burlap-sack guy.
He had to start all over after Hurricane Katrina, living in a tent for several months while building a new warehouse in Waveland. But soon his employees were unloading truckloads of sacks, then laying the undamaged ones into a baler, 500 to a bale, each a ragged postcard from some faraway place.
''Produce of Indonesia.''
''Produce de Cote D'Ivoire.''
''Cafes do Brasil.''
Mr. Airhart's six employees -- Ben, Clyde, Jessica, Paula, Tommy and Tyler -- would work from 7 a.m. until whenever, breathing in the fine coffee dust, sweeping up the stray green beans, taking in the smell that was like wet dog, earning $13 a bale. Then a trucker would deliver the baled sacks to Misho's Oyster Company, in San Leon, Tex., or to Crystal Seas Seafood, in Pass Christian, Miss., or to Motivatit Seafoods, in Houma, La.
Motivatit is owned by two brothers, Mike and Steve Voisin, whose family has dedicated several generations to the pursuit of a living thing in a forbidding shell; a thing that poses a faint risk when consumed raw, yet evokes the wildness of the ocean.
''You're getting a real bite of the sea,'' Mike Voisin says.
Motivatit is one of the gulf's dominant oyster operations. Before the spill, it managed 10,000 acres of oyster beds and processed 60,000 pounds of oysters a day. But to collect these craggy surprises of nature, the company hires boats like the Miss Allison.
Several times a week, the Miss Allison pulls away from a dock near a small place called Theriot, La., bound for where porpoises sometimes provide escort. Its captain, Santos Rodriguez, sun-baked and 44, has churned these waters for 26 years, long enough to wonder whether he's raking up the same shells and bottles; long enough to measure a bag's weight by hand rather than by scale.
And yes, the captain eats oysters. Using a short knife, he pops the seal of a just-harvested oyster with safecracker elan, makes a cut, and slurps the wild goop down.
But with the oil spill forcing the shutdown of oyster beds throughout the gulf -- including about 60 percent of Motivatit's acreage -- he has never seen the catch so low. Yes, the price for a sack is up, but the total number of sacks is down. Normally, he and his crew will return to shore with about 60 sacks; now, a good day is 35.
His two muck-spattered deckhands, Luis Gomez, 24, and Cesar Badillo, 23, reflect the changed life, having recently moved to Houma after oyster beds elsewhere in Louisiana shut down. Mr. Gomez wears a cross around his neck, Mr. Badillo wears a burlap sack for an apron, and both wear gloves over their shell-scarred hands.
After a piece of machinery breaks, the Miss Allison turns around. By the time it reaches shore, to a dock paved with crushed oyster shells, the crew has 30 sacks filled and knotted -- about $90 each for the deckhands, and about $420 for the captain, who has paid for the gas and food and must now fix the broken equipment.
Early the next morning, amid the din of the Motivatit plant in Houma, a stocky woman in a blue construction hat weighs these bags and others by hook. She then dumps their contents, which look like bits of construction debris, onto a conveyor belt to begin a process that involves tumblers, washers and dozens of employees. Wearing hairnets and aprons adorned with their first names and hand-drawn hearts, they shuck and shuck.
But because the oil spill has forced the shutdown of so many of Motivatit's oyster beds -- most of them out of precaution, some of them because of the presence of oil -- these workers are processing about half the normal number of oysters. ''With the lower amount of product, we're having to cut most of the orders,'' Mike Voisin says. ''We've had to minimize.''
This means that Motivatit now employs about 80 workers, two dozen fewer than usual. The entire night shift has been suspended.
This means that the weekly deliveries to Los Angeles, by way of El Paso, Tucson and Phoenix, have stopped, as have the deliveries to Las Vegas, where clients prefer smaller oysters from beds that are now off limits.
This means that Warehouse Shell Sales, in Newport, Minn., may have to adjust. Several times a year, it has 1,500 tons of gulf oyster shells, including many from Motivatit, barged up the Mississippi River to be crushed and sold as poultry feed mix; chickens draw calcium from the oyster-shell bits sitting in their gizzards, hardening the shells of the eggs they produce.
But the oil spill has the shell company's owner, Gary Lund, worried about supply. He says he is now exploring other options.
Finally, this means disaster for the burlap-sack guy, Steve Airhart.
Four months ago, his hot and dusty warehouse in Waveland was humming, with loose sacks coming in and baled sacks going out: 135,000 sold in March, 139,000 in April, and the busy summer season coming up. Then it stopped.
Mr. Airhart, 49, did what he could for a few weeks, but finally he had to lay off Paula, Jessica and the others. ''One of the hardest days of my life,'' he says. ''But they knew it was coming. They heard me on the phone, begging to make sales.''
Now the warehouse is mostly empty, save for the few stacks of bales no one wants, and a boat that Mr. Airhart suddenly had the time to finish. He says that BP, the oil company responsible for the spill, has paid him $20,000 so far for lost business, but that is nowhere near enough to cover the $320,000, plus sweat equity, that he has invested in the company.
The former oysterman is looking forward to sliding this boat he's built into the damaged waters. He wants to help clean up what has broken so many fragile systems.

HEADLINE: Sponsor Of Flotilla Tied to Elite Of Turkey

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY and SEBNEM ARSU

 BODY:
ISTANBUL -- The Turkish charity that led the flotilla involved in a deadly Israeli raid has extensive connections with Turkey's political elite, and the group's efforts to challenge Israel's blockade of Gaza received support at the top levels of the governing party, Turkish diplomats and government officials said.
The charity, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation, often called I.H.H., has come under attack in Israel and the West for offering financial support to groups accused of terrorism. But in Turkey the group has helped Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan shore up support from conservative Muslims ahead of critical elections next year and improve Turkey's standing and influence in the Arab world.
According to a senior Turkish official close to the government, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the political delicacy of the issue, as many as 10 Parliament members from Mr. Erdogan's governing Justice and Development Party were considering boarding the Mavi Marmara, the ship where the deadly raid occurred, but were warned off at the last minute by senior Foreign Ministry officials concerned that their presence might escalate tensions too much. 
When leaders of the charity returned home after nine Turks died in the Israeli raid, they were warmly embraced by top Turkish officials, said Huseyin Oruc, deputy director of the charity, who was aboard the flotilla.
''When we flew back to Turkey, I was afraid we would be in trouble for what happened, but the first thing we saw when the plane's door opened in Istanbul was Bulent Arinc, the deputy prime minister, in tears,'' he said in an interview. ''We have good coordination with Mr. Erdogan,'' he added. ''But I am not sure he is happy with us now.''
The raid has caused a rupture between Turkey and Israel, and heightened alarm in the United States and Europe that Turkey, a large Muslim country and a major NATO member, is shifting allegiance toward the Arab world. Turkey has warned that its cooperative ties to Israel could be irreparably damaged unless the Israelis apologize and accept an international investigation, steps Israel has so far refused to take.
The charity's mission, political analysts said, has advanced Mr. Erdogan's aim of shifting Turkey's focus to the Muslim east when its prospects for joining the European Union are dim.
The government ''could have stopped the ship if it wanted to, but the mission to Gaza served both the I.H.H. and the government by making both heroes at home and in the Arab world,'' said Ercan Citlioglu, a terrorism expert at Bahcesehir University in Istanbul.
Turkish officials said that the charity operated independently and that its leadership had refused to drop plans to break Israel's naval blockade of Hamas-controlled Gaza, despite requests from the government. The officials said they had no legal authority to stop the work of a private charity.
Egemen Bagis, Turkey's minister for European affairs, said in an interview that the charity and the Justice and Development Party, called the AK Party, had no substantive ties, even if people in politics often became involved in charitable groups. ''The I.H.H. has nothing to do with the AK Party, and we have no hidden agenda,'' Mr. Bagis said.
But critics say such statements belie the close connections between the party and the charity, as well as the extent to which Turkish officials were closely attuned to the details of the flotilla's mission before its departure.
''How can such a large country as Turkey, with interests in four continents, and with an export- and investment-driven economy requiring extra caution all around the globe, be dragged to the brink of war by a nongovernmental organization?'' asked Semih Idiz, a columnist for the Hurriyet Daily News in Turkey, in a June 7 editorial. The answer, he added, is that the charity is a ''GNGO'' -- a ''governmental-nongovernmental-organization.''
Many of the 21 people listed on the charity's board have or had close links to the AK Party. In January, Murat Mercan, chairman of Parliament's foreign affairs committee and a senior party official, joined an overland aid convoy to Gaza organized by the charity that tried to force its way through the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza.
A trustee of the charity, Ali Yandir, is a senior manager at the Istanbul City Municipality Transportation Corporation. The corporation sold the Mavi Marmara, with a capacity for 1,090 passengers, to the charity for about $1.2 million. In 2004, Mr. Yandir was an AK Party candidate for the mayor's office in Istanbul's Esenler District.
The charity's board includes Zeyid Aslan, an AK Party member of Parliament and the acting head of the Turkey-Palestine Interparliamentary Friendship Group; Ahmet Faruk Unsal, an AK Party member of Parliament from 2002 to 2007; and Mehmet Emin Sen, a former AK Party mayor in the central Anatolian township of Mihalgazi.
Those ties partly reflect the common agenda of the party and the charity. Both are involved in relief work among the poor and are bound by a common Islamic ideology. Many of the 60,000 people the charity claims as members come from the religious merchant class that helped Mr. Erdogan sweep to power.
The Humanitarian Relief Foundation was founded in the early 1990s, first as a charity for the poor in Istanbul, and later for Bosnian war victims. It works in more than 100 countries and sent 33 tons of aid to Haiti after its January earthquake. The charity has one branch in the West Bank and another in Gaza, where Turkish families help pay for the care and education of 9,000 orphans.
On Monday, Germany banned the charity's offices there, citing its support for Hamas, which Germany considers a terrorist organization. Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the charity abused donors' good intentions ''to support a terrorist organization with money supposedly donated for charitable purposes.'' The newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung said that from 2007 the charity collected $8.5 million and transferred money to six smaller organizations, two belonging directly to Hamas and four with close ties to it.
The charity called the ban a ''disgrace'' and ''misanthropic'' and said it would challenge it in court.
A June 21 letter signed by 87 United States senators urged the White House to investigate whether the charity should be designated a foreign terrorist organization. Israel has accused the charity of bolstering Hamas. It also says the group has links to Al Qaeda and has bought weapons, accusations the charity denies.
A senior Turkish government official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, called such allegations false and said they would not persuade politicians who supported the group's causes to shun it.
''We are not trying to disengage ourselves from I.H.H. because of the current allegations on their terror links -- we are simply not related with them,'' the official said. ''We consider Israeli efforts to link I.H.H. with terror in light of fake intelligence reports and hence hold AK Party government responsible for the killing of nine innocent people as extremely cheap and improper tactics.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 23, 2010, Friday

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Friday about the connections between Turkey's political elite and I.H.H., the Turkish charity that organized the Gaza-bound aid flotilla stopped by a deadly Israeli raid on May 31, contained several errors.
Because of an editing error, the article misstated the effect of a ban on I.H.H. in Germany, where a charity that operates under the same name and was founded by the same people became legally separate in 1997. The ban applied only to the German charity, not the Turkish one.
The article also misstated the price paid by the Turkish charity for the lead flotilla vessel, the Mavi Marmara. It was $1.2 million, not $1.8 million.
And the article referred incorrectly to the relationship between Istanbul Fast Ferries, the municipal agency that sold the Mavi Marmara to the Turkish charity, and the Istanbul City Municipality Transportation Corporation, another city agency. While both are controlled by Turkey's ruling AK party, the transportation corporation is responsible for land transit; it does not oversee the ferry agency.

- Trio 3 (Sunday) This avant-garde supergroup, with Oliver Lake on alto saxophone, Reggie Workman on bass and Andrew Cyrille on drums, has been working on and off for 20 years.

HEADLINE: Fed Nominees Support Expanded Duties

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Hours before the Senate approved a far-reaching overhaul of Wall Street regulations on Thursday, President Obama's three nominees to the board of the Federal Reserve said they were prepared to help the central bank handle its vastly expanded duties to ensure financial stability and oversee financial institutions.
''We must work together, and in cooperation with central banks and governments around the world, to mitigate systemic risk in the financial and payments systems so that our country never again suffers such a devastating episode of financial instability,'' Janet L. Yellen, the nominee for vice chairwoman of the Fed, testified to the Senate banking committee. 
If Ms. Yellen and the two other nominees are confirmed, which appears increasingly likely, they would provide the Fed with its first full complement on the board of governors since 2006. The appointments come at a time when the Fed's traditional mandate -- keeping inflation low and stable while promoting employment -- is being enlarged to include financial stability and oversight for all ''systemically important'' financial institutions, not just big banks.
The paradox that the Fed, after failing to rein in the subprime lending boom, is getting broad new powers was not lost on Ms. Yellen, who was on the Fed's board from 1994 to 1997 and has been president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco since 2004. Under questioning, she was blunt in admitting the central bank's shortcomings.
''We failed completely to understand the complexity of what the impact of the decline -- the national decline -- in housing prices would be in the financial system,'' she told Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee. ''We saw a number of different things and we failed to connect the dots. We failed to understand just how seriously the mortgage standards, the underwriting standards, had declined, what had happened with the complexity of securitization and the risks that were building in the financial system around that.''
Only part of the hearing focused on monetary economics, the Fed's traditional bailiwick. The three nominees all expressed concern about the high unemployment rate, but did not weigh in on a debate within the Fed over whether the central bank -- having lowered interest rates nearly to zero and made trillions of dollars in loans and asset purchases -- could do more to stimulate the economy.
''With unemployment still painfully high, job creation must be a high priority of monetary policy,'' Ms. Yellen said.
The second nominee, Sarah Bloom Raskin, who is the Maryland state banking regulator, noted the ''pervasive social costs'' of joblessness. She said the Fed's success in the last 30 years in curbing inflation was ''only a partial victory when many American households continue to face the perils of unemployment and many small businesses struggle with weakened consumer demand and reduced access to credit.''
The third nominee, Peter A. Diamond, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, taught Ben S. Bernanke, now the Fed chairman, when Mr. Bernanke was a graduate student there. ''A central theme of my research career has been how the economy deals with risks, both risks at the individual level and risks that affect the entire economy,'' Mr. Diamond said.
The confirmation hearing was sparsely attended by the senators: the committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and the committee's top Republican, Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, both had to leave to vote on the regulatory legislation.
Mr. Dodd noted the surprising turnaround in the Fed's status since he released draft legislation last year in response to the financial crisis. ''To be very blunt, that draft bill contemplated removing all of the Fed's authority in areas where it had performed poorly, leaving it with responsibility primarily over monetary policy,'' he told the nominees. ''However, as we worked through the legislative process, it became clear that the political will of the Congress was to retain and strengthen the Fed's supervisory role.''
Mr. Diamond acknowledged the challenge, saying, ''The Fed will have major work to do to implement the tasks that the legislation is placing at the Fed.''
The nominees received only a few tough questions, from Republican senators.
Mr. Shelby asked Ms. Yellen about the failures of about 65 banks, with estimated loss of $28 billion, since 2004 in the San Francisco Fed district.
Ms. Yellen said that ''our regulatory oversight was careful and appropriate,'' but noted that most of the failed institutions were community banks with high exposure to commercial real estate. More broadly, she said, ''The regulatory response was insufficient over a period of years.''
She added: ''There is a need for all of us in regulation to act in a timely way, to take away the punch bowl, and to require more stringent capital requirements.''
Ms. Raskin, who was a staff lawyer for the Senate banking committee under a former chairman, Paul S. Sarbanes, said that regulators did not devote enough attention to the importance of capital and of banks' off-balance-sheet assets leading up to the crisis.
''For those of us on the ground level, we saw quite a number of disturbing trends in housing markets,'' including the sometimes weak regulation of mortgage originations, she said.
Mr. Shelby, who noted that Mr. Diamond had once described himself as a ''card-carrying behavioral economist,'' elicited a response that suggested that personal financial literacy would continue to be a focus for Mr. Diamond, who is an authority on Social Security and pensions.
''Behavioral economics draws heavily on cognitive psychology, and cognitive psychology is very aware of the difficulty for inexperienced people in interpreting complicated elements,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Oil-Friendly Texas Remains Stoic as Spill Hits Its Shores

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
GALVESTON, Tex. -- The crayons and paper were out, but not too many children made it to family day at the Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig and Museum.
Granted, the exhibits of pipelines and seismic vessels may have been over the heads of many grade-schoolers. And despite a few cheerful displays about marine life around rigs and all the bounty that oil helps provide -- including Barbie dolls and cellphones -- the message of the museum is that offshore drilling is complicated and potentially risky, a big business overseen by grave-looking men whose mostly unsmiling faces line the Hall of Fame.
This island city, a tourist destination surrounded by drill operations and refineries, is being reminded anew about those risks, now that oil and other mysterious substances have been washing up on the shores -- the first time the impact of the oil spill has touched Texas.
The mayor, Joe Jaworski, began a whirlwind of promotional events and appearances, canvassing beaches and creating a video to remind people that it was still business as usual in town. 
''O.K., so tar balls have washed up, and I think we'd all agree, it's not a disaster, it's a nuisance,'' Mr. Jaworski said in an interview, after doing a radio broadcast with a visiting Houston D.J. from the lobby of one of Galveston's largest resorts.
''This thing put everyone on alarm,'' he said. ''We're dealing with it in the best way we can.''
For weeks, officials in Texas have expressed sympathy for those hit hard by oil contamination in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana without having to confront how it would effect their shores. Now the arrival of the spill -- albeit in small amounts -- has demanded a reaction that puts a twist on the complicated and lucrative relationship Texans have with big oil companies.
Will we ''continue this perpetual cycle of disaster -- is that what we're going to do? -- frustration, the blame game?'' Gov. Rick Perry asked in a speech on July 6, two days after the tar balls were discovered in Galveston. He announced the formation of the Gulf Project, a research group that monitors the offshore industry, adding: ''Frankly, we don't have time to waste.''
But he also called on the industry for support, noting its ''professional insight and much-needed funding.''
Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Governor Perry, said the state was taking ''aggressive steps'' to deal with the spill. ''Now that the oil has reached our shores, we expect both BP and the federal government to treat Texas the same as other states that have been impacted by this disaster,'' she said.
Keeping tourism afloat is crucial for Galveston, which is still recovering from the devastating impact of Hurricane Ike in 2008. In the aftermath, 10,000 of the city's 60,000 residents permanently fled. Many who stayed are still awaiting federal money to rebuild. Tourist shops offer books documenting ''The Storm'' and businesses have signs pointing to the high-water mark. Some reopened barely a year ago.
''This is not what I needed this summer,'' said Cheryl Jenkines, the manager of her family's antiques and accessories shop, Hendley Market, a downtown fixture for 30 years. She began to cry. After Ike, she explained, her store was flooded with 10 feet of water; she was knee-deep in mud during the cleanup. The store reopened in May 2009, but only for three days a week and at a third of its original size.
Coupled with the economic slump, Ms. Jenkines, 51, worried that any negative attention from the oil spill would torpedo her business. ''There are a lot of sleepless nights,'' she said.
Some are hoping to get BP to help ease the financial strain.
Katie's Seafood Market is a sliver of a shop that sits dockside in the shadow of the oil rig museum. Three of its boats are still working the gulf, 150 miles out, picking up fillings for the fish tacos in Galveston's cafes and red snapper to supply the East Coast.
But Keith Guindon, the owner of Katie's Seafood Market and treasurer of a trade group, the Gulf of Mexico Reef Fish Shareholders' Alliance, said he was preparing to file a claim with BP for lost income. ''I'd be foolish not to be nervous,'' Mr. Guindon, 54, said. ''Just the perception can really hurt things now.''
Last week, a representative from BP came to the Galveston City Council meeting. ''He seemed like a credible fellow,'' Mayor Jaworski said. ''He came right up and listened to us and said he would help us pay for public relations.'' A spokeswoman for BP said no deal had been reached yet.
Others are shrugging off the news about the beaches, which have seen oil many times before. In the 1970s and '80s, slicks and tar balls were such a common sight on the beach that owners of vacation houses stocked their patios with baby oil and WD-40 for guests to clean off with, and regular visitors kept a separate pair of ''tar sandals.''
Teresa Sauer came to the beach from nearby Santa Fe, Tex., with her sister, Melisa Packard, and five children between them. ''It's been on the news and we decided to get up and come today, just to have a little fun in the sun,'' Ms. Sauer said. ''I don't think it's harmful to have a few tar balls. I think it's normal, with all the ships coming through.''
She added: ''I'm alert, but I'm not alarmed.''
Galveston's tangled relationship with the energy industry -- and with BP in particular -- is made thornier by the explosion at the company's refinery in neighboring Texas City in 2005, which killed 15 workers and injured more than 170.
Alongside accounts of the oil washing up, The Galveston County Daily News carried articles about a $3.4 million grant BP was about to give a local school system as a penalty payout.
''I think people generally are very concerned with BP's safety record, and that's no big secret,'' Mayor Jaworski said, though he added that there was still a ''loyalty'' to the energy industry among his constituents.
Ted Williams, 58, a construction worker who lives in Texas City, watched a stretch of the Galveston beach cleaned of plants covered in oily goo. He said he believed that BP executives should be jailed. ''The message would be, 'You can't cut corners,' '' he said.
But others were more forgiving of a company that has poured money into the local economy.
S. C. Inman III, 64, an owner of five businesses in Galveston, including a surf camp and restaurants, praised BP's contributions to the community. A team from the oil giant always participates in his cook-offs. ''They're a good neighbor,'' he said.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about the effect of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill on the Texas coast misstated the origin of tilapia sold at Katie's Seafood in Galveston. The fish were farm-raised in fresh water in China, they were not caught in the Gulf.

HEADLINE: Student Challenge Favorite | Cheating

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: We invite students to tell us weekly what interested them most in The Times and why, then we choose a &#8220;favorite&#8221; comment to feature. This is our seventh. 

 BODY:
Our Student Challenge will continue all summer long, and we'll regularly choose a "favorite" student comment to feature. You can still enter this week's Challenge here. 
For the week of July 5-11, we've chosen a comment by Amanda D. 
Because we had so many entries this week - 39 - we called in some extra judging help in the person of Shannon Doyne, one of our regular lesson-plan writers. Here's what she wrote about the entries in general, and Amanda D.'s post in particular:
I like that so many students are thinking critically about our culture and even the premise behind the stories. Amanda D. (#14) took on the topic of academic cheating after reading "To Stop Cheats, Colleges Learn Their Trickery," pointing out that the culture of bending the rules - from political leaders caught having affairs to questionable lending practices that contributed to the current mortgage crisis - affects students from the time they are old enough to steal (download?) music. As she points out, some cheating isn't identified as such because kids don't see the cheating for all the blurred lines.
And now, Amanda D's entry:
Wow, the article "To Stop Cheats, Colleges Learn Their Trickery" shows how many colleges are now fighting back against the many students who cheat. 
I read this article and realized that students won't stop cheating because they believe they are justified in what they do. Students are going through a tough time right now where taking a class over again is not an option due to the recession. Failing is not acceptable to colleges, their peers, their parents, or themselves. Cheating means success to many persons. 
Also, the high upstanding people in the United States have not been the type of role models us, young adults, need. The bank crisis that caused many people to foreclose on their homes was caused by greedy people who sought to take advantage of people that could not possibly afford the homes they were being sold to. Also, John Edwards had an affair with an aid while his wife was fighting breast cancer. I could go on, but these two examples show the point I am trying to make. 
If ethics can't be shown by the people we aspire to be someday how are young adults supposed to cure their cheating habits? Or even, how is cheating wrong compared to what these "role models" do? The surveys conducted show a decrease in cheating, but I believe like Mr. McCabe that students now consider certain things that were once called cheating not cheating anymore. It's like how my friends download from Limewire all the time but never consider that they are downloading illegal music. I appreciate what the colleges are trying to do, but I believe that cheating will not be so easily discouraged.
We also want to recognize others who wrote gracefully or made interesting connections or, in the case of Kelly, questioned an article and its scope. Besides Kelly, those students are Liliana R,Sylvia,BenJCHS and Monica_Ms.B_Crvr. 
As always, keep writing in: we've been amazed by the thoughtfulness of your responses!

HEADLINE: Wealthy Reduce Buying in a Blow To the Recovery

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
The economic recovery has been helped in large part by the spending of the most affluent. Now, even the rich appear to be tightening their belts.
Late last year, the highest-income households started spending more confidently, while other consumers held back. But their confidence has since ebbed, according to retail sales reports and some economic analysis.
''One of the reasons that the recovery has lost momentum is that high-end consumers have become more jittery and more cautious,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody's Analytics.
That cautious attitude stems in part from concerns about global instability, especially in Europe, and in part from the volatility of the stock market in recent months. Major stock indexes fell sharply on Friday, after several big companies announced disappointing earnings. Bank stocks were the biggest losers as investors wrestled with the twin issues of lower trading profits from Citibank and Bank of America and the prospect that new financial regulation would further crimp their businesses. 
Though stock performance has a bigger psychological and financial impact on high-income households, consumers of all income levels are fretting more about their financial future, perhaps bracing for the possibility of another economic contraction. Consumer confidence slumped in July to its lowest point since August 2009 in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index released on Friday.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 261.41 points to 10,097.9 on Friday, for a loss of 2.52 percent. For the year, broad-based stock indexes in the United States all show losses of more than 3 percent.
Even Federal Reserve policy makers have acknowledged that the recovery is losing steam and suggested that should conditions worsen further, additional stimulus may be needed, according to minutes of their last meeting, released on Wednesday.
Especially at this stage of a recovery, businesses and economists want to see people of all incomes spending more, because the demand for goods and services would in turn encourage companies to hire workers. The American consumer accounts for an estimated 60 percent of the country's economic activity.
But the Top 5 percent in income earners -- those households earning $210,000 or more -- account for about one-third of consumer outlays, including spending on goods and services, interest payments on consumer debt and cash gifts, according to an analysis of Federal Reserve data by Moody's Analytics. That means the purchasing decisions of the rich have an outsize effect on economic data. According to Gallup, spending by upper-income consumers -- defined as those earning $90,000 or more -- surged to an average of $145 a day in May, up 33 percent from a year earlier.
Then in June, that daily average slid to $119. ''I think a lot of that feeling that the worst was over has sort of abated,'' said Dennis J. Jacobe, Gallup's chief economist.
Although real estate brokers in Manhattan and the Hamptons report that buyers at the high end have returned, and Mercedes sales in the United States are up 26 percent this year, other indicators suggest a slowdown.
At the high end, luxury hotel chains like the Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton said bookings were much stronger earlier this year but had recently slowed. And upscale retailers, including Saks and Neiman Marcus, said sales growth eased in June. Overall retail sales slid in June from May, the government said this week.
To the extent that the wariness of the affluent is driven mainly by nerves and sentiment, economists hope that it will be temporary. ''If growth is actually solid, those fears will dissipate,'' said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays Capital and a former senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board.
The worry, of course, is that consumers will stop spending because of their concerns about a slowdown, and that economic growth will slow because consumers have stopped spending.
After virtually shutting down during the financial collapse in late 2008, the wealthy began to open their wallets wider last year, in part because a stock market rally helped them feel better off financially.
By spring of last year, the savings rate -- which represents the percentage of after-tax income not spent -- of the top 5 percent of income earners had turned negative, according to the analysis by Moody's Analytics. That meant the group was spending more than it made.
Less well-off consumers remained more frugal, most likely constrained by unemployment, declines in home values and the disappearance of easy credit. So the savings rate actually rose last year for those in middle-income brackets as they cut spending.
Job losses have disproportionately hit those at the lower end of the wage scale. According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate among people in management, business or financial occupations was 4.8 percent in June, compared to 9.5 percent over all, 18.2 percent in construction and 12.1 percent in production.
As a result, the affluent generally maintained their spending power at a time when others were losing it. ''High-income households drove the economy out of recession into recovery and powered the recovery through its first year,'' Mr. Zandi concluded. He added that although the incomes of the richest people might have been affected by swings in dividend payments or bonuses, the change in their savings rate was most likely driven by increased spending.
Affluent spenders ''began to come out of the bunker about this time last year,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''and part of it was related to the revival in the stock market.''
Other economists suggest that while Mr. Zandi's conclusions make some sense, the data is hazy on the precise role that the rich have played in consumer spending. ''We have tried to do other things like look at consumer expenditures on products mainly purchased by the rich and could never get anywhere,'' said Barry P. Bosworth, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
On the ground, those whose sales depend on affluent buyers have seen definite patterns. Last year and early this year, when the major stock gauges were rising, ''everybody seemed to be a little bit more optimistic,'' said Tom Hauswirth, general manager and partner of Moritz Cadillac, BMW and Mini in Arlington, Tex., near Dallas.
''Then I think everybody was affected when they saw the stock market go below 10,000,'' he said. ''Even though it may not affect their ability to buy or not, it affects their thinking.''
Mr. Hauswirth said that those who had recently bought new cars were sometimes fearful of being labeled as conspicuous consumers. A few, he said, insisted on buying new cars in the same color as their old models.
''They didn't want their employees to know they bought a new car,'' he said. ''It doesn't look good during a wage freeze or when they're cutting people.''
Moritz laid off about 15 percent of its sales staff last year, and Mr. Hauswirth said that he did not yet feel comfortable hiring back until sales improved more.
Linda Dresner, the owner of a clothing boutique for women that carries designers like Dries van Noten and John Galliano in the upscale suburb of Birmingham, Mich., has reduced her inventory and says customers often say their husbands have asked them to rein in spending.
''They are wealthy people who live well,'' Ms. Dresner said. ''But their businesses have suffered some, and they are pulling back.''
Policy makers are divided on what may be needed to spur economic growth, with a current debate raging over whether to extend unemployment benefits, payments that are usually spent immediately. .
Sam Pizzigati, associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning research center, cautions against simply boosting the spending power of the rich through tax cuts or other measures. ''Otherwise, we find ourselves in an 'Alice in Wonderland' world,'' he said, ''and the solution to the hard times that the economy is going through is to help the people that are not going through hard times.''
For now, some affluent spenders are getting thrifty. Linda Stasiak, who sells high-end skin care products to retailers like Whole Foods, said that her biggest sales increase had been for a $15.95 tube wringer, made to get every last drop out of a bottle of lotion.
''During peak time, I don't even really remember selling them,'' Ms. Stasiak said.

HEADLINE: More Delicate Diplomacy for the Overseer of the Compensation Fund

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS -- Kenneth R. Feinberg, hopping in and out a Learjet, a helicopter and several S.U.V.s, took his gift for oratory to four towns in southern Louisiana on Thursday to make his pitch to locals: He has a big chunk of a $20 billion fund from BP to compensate those harmed by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and they should get their share.
Even with that kind of bankroll to pay claims, he was playing the role of salesman and politician.
''This program I am running is absolutely voluntary -- nobody has to do it,'' he said at one stop. ''It's my opinion you are crazy if you don't participate.'' 
Mr. Feinberg knew he was facing many skeptics -- and cynics -- who no doubt wondered if they could get more money from the oil company, not to mention satisfaction, in the courts. He acknowledged the doubters, noting that they were being asked to sign up for ''a program that's never been tried, never been tested and that they view with some skepticism.''
But Mr. Feinberg has brought people to the table many times before, including the families of the victims of the Sept. 11 attacks, Vietnam veterans injured by the herbicide Agent Orange and women harmed by the defective Dalkon Shield birth control device.
Such high-stakes mediation involves powerful, conflicting forces. In this case, BP hopes to settle disputes with money from the fund with as many people as it can to minimize the question of liability hanging over the company.
Federal officials hope they choose that route, too, because that will ensure that BP can keep paying its obligations. Courtroom litigation raises uncertainty -- about the ultimate cost for BP, and for the victims who choose to fight in courts.
Despite his 64 years, Mr. Feinberg shows no sign of slowing down as he cajoles people to steer clear of the courts. His campaign stops are high-energy affairs. He jabs the air, punches up words to drive home a point and gets laughs with self-deprecating references to his Boston accent.
''It's a campaign,'' he said. ''It's a road show. It's a seminar.''
And it is a long day.
Flying on a private jet paid for by BP, Mr. Feinberg arrived in New Orleans early, though it was already his second stop of the day, after a 7 a.m. visit with Gov. Bob Riley of Alabama.
At the Jefferson Parish Council chambers in Harahan, he told a crowd of civic leaders and business people that he was there because his years of experience in administering compensation funds taught him a lesson.
''You cannot do this from Washington,'' he said. ''You've got to be down here in the gulf.''
He assured them that while he was approved by the president and is spending BP's money, ''I am not beholden to the Obama administration, I am not beholden to BP -- I am an independent administrator, calling the shots as I see them.''
He described the two-part claims process. It begins with the relatively easy process of getting emergency payments, available without obligation to eligible claimants who can prove their losses, up to six months' worth of damages at a time. (BP has paid out more than $200 million from 36 claims offices to more than 32,000 claimants so far.)
Then, 90 days after the well is finally plugged, comes the tougher phase of the three-year program: negotiating with each claimant for the lump sum to cover economic losses from the spill. Those who accept the payment will have to sign a waiver stating that they will not sue BP.
''If you think the lump sum payment is inadequate, don't sign,'' he said, adding that the litigation route in court will mean uncertainty, years of delay and a big cut for the lawyers. ''I am determined to come up with a system that will be more generous, more beneficial, than if you go and file a lawsuit.''
His message is blunt, but he wins many people over. Rather than saying ''cheese'' when he posed for a photo with four police officers, he said, ''Everybody file a claim?''
Later that morning, in Houma, he faced an audience of oil rig workers and commercial fishermen. He acknowledged that many people run an all-cash business, explaining that his standards of proof, especially for emergency payments, were not crushing. ''Show me a tax return,'' he said in mock dialogue, and drawled in response, ''Well, I lost it,'' which elicited knowing laughs.
Mr. Feinberg said he could get to yes. ''Do you have a profit and loss statement? Do you have a checkbook? Check stubs?'' he said. ''No? Well, then, tell the captain of the boat, or your priest, to vouch for you.''
During the Q. and A., Wade Bonvillain, who has a soft-shell crab business, claimed angrily that the gulf would be dead for 30 years. ''Is BP or the government going to come eat those crabs?'' he asked.
''I don't know if I'm going to eat the crab or not,'' Mr. Feinberg said, and then outlined the process that would be used for estimating and negotiating for lost revenue into the future.
Mr. Bonvillain, wearing a black T-shirt with images of the wrestler John Cena and the words ''Hustle-Loyalty-Respect,'' stalked out of the hall. Outside, he declared that he would not join the fund, which he called ''selling yourself out cheap.''
Back inside, Jerri G. Smitko, a local lawyer, held a sign reading ''BP -- A Bayou Degradable Company.'' She said she would urge her clients to join the fund for the relative certainty of a payment. ''It would be silly not to go through the process,'' she said.
The crowd was ethnically mixed, with Cajuns, African-Americans and Vietnamese in the church social hall, with its large crucifix and electronic bingo board.
After the talk, Joseph Buras complained that documenting income would be unfair because the last two years have been cruel to shrimpers, with low prices and high costs.
Mr. Feinberg replied, ''If business was bad before the spill, I'm not a magician. I can't change that. At some point I have to say, 'Don't blame the spill -- life's unfair!' ''
At the Lafitte civic center stop in late afternoon, a woman waved a sheaf of receipts at him to claim that this was going to be a bountiful year for shrimping, so reimbursement should be higher than might be judged from the previous two disappointing years.
''Don't give it to me now,'' Mr. Feinberg answered, adding that they needed to prove it at the claims office. ''You can't go in and say, 'Trust me.' ''
That evening, at the New Orleans airport, Mr. Feinberg slumped in an armchair, his blue suit wrinkled, his shirt soaked through, and reflected on his latest challenge.
BP approached him in June about the fund, which was fast becoming a matter of contention as complaints about delays piled up. The White House approached him, too.
While he ran the 9/11 fund without charge, he is getting paid for this work, though he declined to say how much.
The job is only for those who can deal with the pain of others. After 9/11, a firefighter's widow once told him, ''I spit on your children,'' he recalled. ''You can't let it get to you.''
Emotions run high across the gulf, with people seeing their way of life disappearing. ''If you're not willing to go into the lion's den and confront the emotion and the hurt, you shouldn't do it,'' he said.
The plan has come under attack from some public officials, who argue that the three-year program for the fund ignores the potential long-term effects from the spill.
''This is going to go on for three, five, 10 years after the spill is stopped,'' the Mississippi attorney general, Jim Hood, told The Mobile Register this week. Mr. Feinberg ''can't treat it like 9/11,'' which, he said, for all of its horror, took place on a single day.
Mr. Feinberg said he would work with experts to project the long-term effects. Most people, he knows from experience, will accept the lump-sum payment once it is offered.
''The question is, is the payment sufficient'' to account for damages into the future, he said. ''Am I offering the right amount?''
He finished a cup of coffee and got up to go. He had a dinner meeting, and the next day was flying off to do it all again in Mississippi.

HEADLINE: When Being Out of Work Becomes a Chronic Condition

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics on his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
IN the United States, unemployment has typically been a relatively brief affair. The vast majority of people who lost jobs soon found new work.
That is not the way it has been in many other developed countries. In Europe and Japan, long-term unemployment is far more common. At any given time, most of the unemployed people in many European countries have been out of work for more than six months.
Now the United States appears to be becoming similar to Europe. Even as the overall unemployment rate has begun to drop -- falling to 9.5 percent in June from a peak of 10.1 percent last October -- the proportion of the work force that has been out of work for more than six months has risen to 4.4 percent, as can be seen in the accompanying charts. 
The long-term unemployment rate has not approached such a level since the government began keeping the statistic in 1948, although the rate was almost certainly much higher during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Only in the early 1980s did the figure ever climb above 2 percent.
The latest figures indicate that 46 percent of Americans classified as unemployed -- meaning they are out of work and actively seeking a job -- have been unemployed for at least six months. That is nearly twice the previous post-World War II high, set in 1983.
But it remains below the proportion in much of the developed world. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 27 industrialized countries, estimates that the average among its members in the first quarter of this year was almost 50 percent.
Historically, the differences among countries reflected different safety nets. In some countries, laws made it hard to fire workers, but those who did not already have jobs found little protection.
In Germany, which traditionally has had high long-term unemployment relative to overall unemployment, government subsidies helped prevent layoffs in the recession by encouraging companies to reduce work hours while keeping people on the payroll. The German unemployment rate did not begin climbing until months after rates in other countries rose. But now that a recovery has started, hours are being lengthened, rather than new jobs being created. For those who are out of work, that leaves few opportunities.
European safety nets are now in jeopardy to some extent because of the need in many countries for austerity measures to deal with deficits. ''With recovery, schemes to protect existing jobs should move to programs to encourage new hiring,'' like temporary reductions in payroll taxes for new employees, Stefano Scarpetta, the deputy director of employment, labor and social affairs at the O.E.C.D., said in an interview.
In a new report, ''2010 OECD Employment Outlook,'' Mr. Scarpetta and his colleagues forecast that it will take years for most countries to return employment to prerecession levels.
''Despite signs of recovery in most countries, the risk remains that millions of people may lose touch with the labor market,'' said Angel Gurria, the organization's secretary general, as he released the report earlier this month.
For the United States, that risk may be greater than it was after previous recessions. It is common for the long-term rate to keep rising after recessions end, as can be seen from the chart, but the number of long-term unemployed now is already far greater than it was after those downturns.

HEADLINE: G.E. Revenue Falls Short of Forecasts, Despite Strength in Finance and Health

BYLINE: By SUSANNA G. KIM

 BODY:
General Electric reported on Friday that its second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, but revenue fell below analysts' expectations and, with the stock market in a broad decline, G.E.'s shares fell 4.59 percent.
Analysts said that although earnings were positive, particularly in its finance and health care segments, improvement was still needed in its power generation and aviation businesses.
''Airlines postponing maintenance is significant,'' said Scott R. Davis of Morgan Stanley. ''Eventually you have to maintain a plane, but airlines are not spending cash and that's hurting G.E.'' 
Mr. Davis said his greatest disappointment in G.E. this quarter was that orders for equipment were not significantly greater than shipments.
G.E. said demand for its industrial equipment was stronger, but aviation equipment and service orders were down. Total service orders, which tend to produce higher marginal revenue, decreased 1 percent.
''Airlines are still cautious about spending and pushing back as much maintenance work as they can,'' said Richard Tortoriello, an analyst with Standard & Poor's Equity Research.
Aviation equipment orders decreased 8 percent, the only category of five to fall, while aviation service orders decreased 5 percent.
General Electric reported second-quarter net income of $3.03 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with $2.61 billion, or 25 cents a share, in the quarter a year ago. Earnings per share for continuing operations were 30 cents.
Revenue, however, declined 4 percent, to $37.44 billion, from $39.11 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 27 cents a share on revenue of $38.4 billion.
Shares of G.E. fell 70 cents, to $14.55 on Friday.
The chief executive, Jeffrey R. Immelt, said in a statement that business was improving. ''Losses and impairments declined $0.5 billion from the prior quarter, with consumer losses down $0.4 billion and real estate losses in line with our expectations,'' Mr. Immelt said in the statement. ''We have strengthened the franchise over the past year and GE Capital's earnings recovery should continue.''
G.E., based in Fairfield, Conn., is often considered the largest proxy for industrial America.
''If the overall global recovery takes place, you can argue G.E. will be the largest beneficiary,'' said Mr. Davis. ''Not only does it have a large subset of manufacturing businesses, but it has a large finance subsidiary.''
GE Capital profit increased 93 percent and the company said its earnings recovery should continue, though revenue from GE Capital Services decreased 2 percent, to $13.1 billion.
''Commercial real estate business remained the one tough area of GE Capital as expected,'' Keith S. Sherin, chief financial officer, said during a conference call. The real estate segment lost $524 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of $237 million a year ago.
The company did not have an update on the sale of NBC Universal to Comcast, which was announced in December. Mr. Sherin said G.E. had no news while the merger was being reviewed by federal regulators.
''I hate to predict when it's going to close just because we don't control it,'' Mr. Sherin said regarding the deal. The European Union approved the transaction on Wednesday.
Total orders and equipment orders increased for the first time since the third quarter of 2008, with the latter increasing 17 percent in the quarter.
''This is significant because growth in G.E.'s heavy-equipment businesses tends to lag growth in the overall economy,'' Mr. Tortoriello said. ''Thus this data gives us an indicator that economic growth is on track.''
Mr. Davis had estimated the increase in equipment orders to be more than 10 percent, in part because of a $1 billion order from Iraq for 25 gas turbine units, but also because of greater activity from hospitals.
''The recovery in health care equipment has come a lot faster than expected,'' Mr. Davis said. ''A lot of businesses held off until President Obama's health care bill passed.''

HEADLINE: STOCKS & BONDS; Wall Street Stumbles on Disappointing Bank Earnings

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
A week that began with Wall Street confident in the prospects for corporate profits ended with a rout on Friday, as discouraging results from two of the nation's largest banks sent the stock market into a tailspin.
Banking shares plunged after Citigroup and the Bank of America Corporation reported second-quarter results that cast doubt over the banks' growth and the outlook for the broader economy. Mixed results from General Electric added to the glum mood.
The broad stock market fell nearly 3 percent, more than erasing its gains for the week. Friday's decline left the market down about 1 percent for the week and had anxious investors wondering if they had been overly optimistic about the rush of earnings results scheduled to pour out over the next week. Once again, investors rushed out of the stock market and into relatively safe United States Treasury securities. 
Citigroup and Bank of America both reported that revenue declined during the second quarter and that income from trading -- which has powered the financial industry's rapid return to health -- had faded. ''The market is more focused on revenue growth, and that is not growing in line with expectations,'' Nick Kalivas, vice president of financial research at MF Global, said.
Disappointing economic news did not help. The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan report showed confidence among consumers declined in July to the lowest level since August 2009. The index decreased to 66.5, from 76 in June.
Jason Arnold, a research analyst for RBC Capital Markets, said bank lending remained sluggish and that banks continued to be beset by problem loans.
''So the concern is that if the banks are not saying we have got great things to expect in terms of lending and credit performance getting substantially better, that impacts the market,'' Mr. Arnold said.
Mr. Kalivas said he believed the market was falling because it was not clear how banks were going to increase profit in the coming quarters.
''Most of the profits seem to be coming out of declining provisions for loan-loss declining,'' Mr. Kalivas said of the results.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 261.41 points, or 2.52 percent, to 10,097.90. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 31.60 points, or 2.88 percent, to 1,064.88. The Nasdaq dropped 70.03 points, or 3.11 percent, to 2,179.05.
Banking stocks were hit hardest, falling 4.4 percent as a group. Industrial and materials stocks fell more than 3 percent.
Bank of America shares were down $1.41, to $13.98, while Citigroup's declined 26 cents, to $3.90. JPMorgan was down $1.46, to $39. Goldman Sachs, however, rose 95 cents, to $146.17.
Energy prices also declined. Crude oil prices were down 61 cents, to $76.01.
Tom di Galoma, the United States head of fixed-income rates trading for Guggenheim Partners, said investors were second-guessing their equity positions in favor of bonds.
''The Michigan number this morning was horrendously bad,'' Mr. di Galoma said. ''What is taking place is people are bracing for another economic dip. The numbers we are seeing this morning are actually quite recessionary.''
He said buyers had been dipping into safer investments. ''Today it has been forceful buying out to 10-year notes by a variety of equity investors,'' Mr. di Galoma said. ''And I think what is taking place is asset reallocation back to bonds.''
''The stock market could not stand on its own,'' he said.
General Electric, often considered a bellwether of the economy, also reported Friday that its second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, to $3.3 billion. Net revenue, however, declined.
G.E. shares were down 70 cents, at $14.55.
Google also declined after reporting weaker-than-expected earnings after the market closed on Thursday. It fell $34.42, to $459.61.
In contrast, the Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 20/32, to 104 29/32, and the yield fell to 2.92 percent, from 2.99 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Espada, Under Investigation, Faces a Well-Financed Opponent

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK

 BODY:
Pedro Espada Jr., the State Senate majority leader, has already been accused by New York's attorney general of using his network of health clinics for personal gain and is under investigation by federal prosecutors.
Now Mr. Espada faces a new problem: a well-financed political opposition with a history of defeating incumbents that is looking to unseat him in the Democratic primary in September.
The left-leaning Working Families Party, which has evolved into arguably the most powerful third party in the state, has decided to focus its considerable organizational resources on ousting Mr. Espada and electing a little-known candidate who is running his first race -- Jose Gustavo Rivera, 34, a former aide to Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand. 
Still, despite the corruption charges swirling around Mr. Espada, he retains deep support in his low-income district in the northwestern Bronx and will be difficult to defeat.
To counter Mr. Espada's advantages in name recognition and finances, the Working Families Party plans to raise money, knock on thousands of doors and recruit leaders of religious, tenants' and civic groups.
''Pedro Espada represents everything that's wrong with Albany,'' said Dan Cantor, the party's executive director. Defeating Mr. Espada in the September primary, Mr. Cantor said, ''is our No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 priority.''
The Working Families Party has a record of helping insurgents topple established incumbents. In 2008, it played a crucial role in State Senator Daniel L. Squadron's victory against Martin E. Connor, who had been in office in for 30 years -- since before Mr. Squadron was born. That campaign, Mr. Cantor said, will serve as a model for the party's effort against Mr. Espada.
Vincent J. Montalbano, a veteran lobbyist and political consultant, said the Working Families Party's support could prove decisive. ''In local races, the candidate they get behind, I think, has a tremendous advantage,'' Mr. Montalbano said. ''I think it is the overwhelmingly main factor in making it a competitive race.''
Founded in 1998, the Working Families Party is a coalition of unions and liberal groups that rarely runs its own candidates. Instead, it endorses other parties' candidates, almost always Democrats, and then sends its workers into the field.
But the party brings its own baggage to the race: federal prosecutors are investigating it for possible campaign-finance violations. The inquiry could become ammunition for Mr. Espada as he tries to fend off accusations of corruption.
Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, the Democratic nominee for governor, filed a civil suit in April accusing Mr. Espada of steering millions of dollars from his nonprofit health care network to pay for vacations, meals, and housing and campaign expenses. Federal prosecutors are also investigating Mr. Espada and his health care clinics.
Last week, the state Democratic Party officially moved to oust him from the party.
Mr. Espada's campaign did not return a call for comment.
At the moment, Mr. Espada has a far larger campaign war chest than Mr. Rivera. In campaign filings submitted this week, Mr. Espada reported having about $323,000 on hand, compared with $38,000 for Mr. Rivera. Still, Mr. Rivera reported raising over $65,000 since entering the race in May, while Mr. Espada raised about $82,000 since the start of the year.
The Working Families Party will work to help close the gap, and the New Roosevelt Initiative -- a statewide reform project started by Bill Samuels, a technology entrepreneur and a top Democratic donor -- has endorsed Mr. Rivera and pledged to spend up to $250,000 to defeat Mr. Espada.
Mr. Rivera has worked as a political strategist for several campaigns, including Jose M. Serrano's successful 2004 race for a State Senate seat representing East Harlem and parts of the Bronx. In addition to his role as an aide to Ms. Gillibrand, he served as chief of staff for State Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester County Democrat.
He also has ties to the powerful Service Employees International Union.
Mr. Rivera said his campaign would focus on fighting the area's high unemployment rate, providing rent protection for low-income families and addressing school crowding.
Despite the party's support, Mr. Rivera faces other obstacles, including two other Democratic candidates, who could split the anti-Espada vote. They are Fernando P. Tirado, the district manager of a local community board, and Daniel Padernacht, a lawyer and a member of another community board.
A fourth candidate, Desiree Pilgrim-Hunter, dropped out of the race this week because of difficulty raising money.

HEADLINE: Was Steinbrenner Just Lucky?

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Before he bought the New York Yankees, George Steinbrenner tried to buy the Cleveland Indians.
The year was 1971. Mr. Steinbrenner, then in his early 40s, was a shipbuilder, having bought out his father's interest in a small shipbuilding company, which he then expanded through a series of acquisitions. By the early 1970s, Mr. Steinbrenner's company, American Shipbuilding, was generating about $74 million in revenue a year, according to ''Steinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball,'' the new best-selling biography by Bill Madden.
Learning that the Indians were for sale, Mr. Steinbrenner rounded up a group of investors and offered $8.6 million for the money-losing team. But in the climactic meeting, the Indians owner, the frozen food magnate Vernon Stouffer -- who, according to Mr. Madden's book, was drunk -- turned down the Steinbrenner offer. ''You and your friends are trying to steal my team,'' he said. ''I know I can get at least $10 million for it. So forget about it.'' 
A little more than a year later, Mr. Steinbrenner, with another group of investors in tow, bought the Yankees instead. The seller was CBS, which had also been losing money on its team and wanted to get out. The purchase price was $10 million, of which $6 million was borrowed. The rest, as they say, is history.
In the days since Mr. Steinbrenner's death at the age of 80, commentators have marveled at the incredible value he created from that $10 million purchase. According to Forbes magazine, the Yankees today are worth $1.6 billion; only the Dallas Cowboys and Manchester United are worth more. When you add the YES Network and a sports hospitality business that are also largely owned by the Yankees, the value of the empire Mr. Steinbrenner built rises to $3.4 billion (again, according to Forbes), making it, almost surely, the most valuable franchise in sports. If Mr. Steinbrenner didn't die a billionaire, he must have come pretty darn close.
In reading Mr. Madden's account of Mr. Steinbrenner's life, though, I couldn't help wondering something else. What would have happened if Mr. Stouffer had been sober that December day in 1971, and had said yes to Mr. Steinbrenner? Would Mr. Steinbrenner have been as successful if he had owned his hometown Indians rather than the storied New York Yankees? Or was his success due mainly to the fact that he just happened to buy the No. 1 franchise in the biggest television market in the country -- at the exact moment the value for sports franchises was about to take off? To put it another way, was George Steinbrenner a good businessman, or just a lucky one?
''John McMullen'' -- the late former owner of the Houston Astros -- ''used to tell me that you only have to make one good deal in your lifetime to be successful,'' said Fay Vincent, the former baseball commissioner. ''George certainly did that.''
The truth is, though, that virtually anyone who bought a sports franchise in the United States in the last 30 years, and then held on to it, has made a pile of money. As sports teams have become trophy assets -- playthings for wealthy men, really -- their value has skyrocketed. Well-run team, poorly run team, big market, small market: they've all increased in value.
Robert Kraft, who turned the New England Patriots into a model franchise, has seen the team's value grow to $1.4 billion from $172 million since he bought the team in 1994. Yet Donald Sterling, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, perhaps the worst-run team in sports, has also made a fortune in his three decades of ownership (though, admittedly, not as large a one). So score one for luck: buying and holding doesn't take much business acumen.
Here's another bit of luck: Mr. Steinbrenner bought the Yankees just before the dawn of free agency. In the early years of free agency, many owners frowned on throwing millions of dollars at baseball players. Not Mr. Steinbrenner. He signed Catfish Hunter even before free agency officially began, when Charlie Finley, the Oakland Athletics' owner, made a mistake that allowed Mr. Hunter to gain his freedom. ''He was very aggressive early on,'' said Andrew Zimbalist, the sports economist at Smith College and author of the forthcoming book, ''Circling the Bases: Essays on the Challenges and Prospects of the Sports Industry.'' Other owners had no choice but to follow him.
According to Mr. Zimbalist, the Yankees' pursuit of free agents was far more a reflection of Mr. Steinbrenner's fanatical desire to win than a business strategy. But it wound up being good business, too. In the early 1970s, the marquee baseball team in New York was the Mets, not the Yankees; polls conducted by Major League Baseball showed that two out of three New York baseball fans rooted for the Mets. Mr. Steinbrenner's signing of prominent free agents like Catfish Hunter, Reggie Jackson and many others helped swing the city back toward the Yankees, which, in turn, put money in Mr. Steinbrenner's pocket.
''The Mets had the same lucky circumstances as the Yankees,'' said Marc Ganis, a sports consultant. But the Mets became a team that for many years focused on controlling costs. Mr. Steinbrenner could not have cared less about cost control. That attitude may have cost him his original company, American Shipbuilding, which went bankrupt in 1993, in part because Mr. Steinbrenner lacked the business discipline to keep it viable as the shipbuilding industry declined. But it was the perfect attitude for building the Yankees. ''He was in the one place where he was rewarded for spending money, which was always his instinct anyway,'' Mr. Zimbalist said.
Most years, in fact, the Yankees under Mr. Steinbrenner didn't even break even, much less make a profit. So how, then, did he get so rich -- and the franchise become so much more valuable than other teams?
The answer was radio and television money. Mr. Steinbrenner's early TV and radio deals, like everyone else's, were for peanuts. But in 1987, he renegotiated his radio deal, extracting $50 million, far more than any other team. The following year, he agreed to move the Yankees' television rights from Cablevision to the regional sports network MSG for nearly $500 million over 12 years -- an amount that stunned the baseball world. Finally, in 2001, Mr. Steinbrenner formed the YES Network, which televises virtually all Yankees games, and in which the team holds a 60 percent ownership stake, according to Leo Hindery Jr., the original president of YES.
There was nothing particularly innovative about any of these contracts. Many teams had moved their rights to regional sports networks before Mr. Steinbrenner signed on with MSG. And in the 1980s, the Boston Red Sox had pioneered the concept of a team owning its own sports network. What Mr. Steinbrenner did was use the power of the Yankees brand -- a brand he had clearly done a lot to enhance -- to extract far more money than any owner had ever done before. (The Mets have long been playing catch-up in this area as well.)
It was business as brute force, which was always Mr. Steinbrenner's preferred style. Today, most sports business experts say they believe that the YES Network, on a stand-alone basis, is worth more than the Yankees. Still, without its affiliation with the Yankees, it would have little value at all.
Mr. Vincent noted that Mr. Steinbrenner never had much interest in being on any of the various owners' committees. ''George was never one of the active owners,'' he said. Whenever the players would go on strike, he was the one calling for a quick settlement, knowing that no matter what the outcome, the Yankees could afford it. If other teams couldn't, well, that was their problem.
Indeed, in 1997, Mr. Steinbrenner pulled off one deal that really was innovative. It also completely infuriated the other owners, who viewed Mr. Steinbrenner's move as an attempt to line the Yankees' pocket at their expense. That year, Mr. Steinbrenner signed a $93 million licensing deal with Adidas. He did so even though all licensing deals were supposed to go through Major League Baseball, and all ensuing revenue was to be shared equally (a concept Mr. Steinbrenner had no use for, in any case).
When Major League Baseball objected, Mr. Steinbrenner sued, complaining that he shouldn't have to share the value created by the Yankees logo with the other owners. Although the suit was eventually dropped, the outcome was a good one for Mr. Steinbrenner: Adidas became an official Major League sponsor, but the Yankees got to keep most of the money the deal generated.
Since his death on Tuesday, many people have noted how his bold, brash, blustery personality was perfect for this city. But so was his bold, brash, blustery approach to business. In a way few other cities could, New York played to his strengths and hid his weaknesses. New York is not a place for penny pinchers; it's a place where people with big egos ''shoot for the moon,'' as Mr. Zimbalist put it.
In Oakland, the Athletics' general manager Billy Beane built a reputation for finding young talent that he could get on the cheap, knowing he would probably lose them to wealthier teams like the Yankees as soon as they became expensive free agents. That's the way the most successful small market teams operate; they have no choice.
Mr. Steinbrenner could never have thrived in that kind of environment. He needed to be able to spend money without worrying about whether he was overpaying for this player or that one. He could do that in New York. Indeed, Mr. Steinbrenner's willingness to spend large sums of money on his payroll helped created the distinction between big market and small-market teams.
At every Yankees game, they play the famous Frank Sinatra version of ''New York, New York,'' with the line everyone knows: ''If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere.'' The great irony of George Steinbrenner's business life is that he represented the opposite phenomenon.
He could make it there, all right. But ''anywhere?'' That was a lot less likely.

HEADLINE: Avoid Fly-by-Night Cleaners By Making a Phone Call First

 BODY:
MAINTAINING a home is expensive, as we all know, but if you upgrade a kitchen or replant the garden, at least you have something tangible to look at and appreciate. It's when the boiler goes or you need a new roof that home maintenance feels particularly unrewarding -- so much money, so little to show for it.
I realize, of course, that these repairs are necessary, but if the problem is hidden, it's especially easy to put your faith in the wrong hands. About five years ago, I wrote about the need to watch out for unscrupulous chimney sweeps who promise low-price cleaning and then, after glancing up your chimney, proclaim in a concerned tone that you need a new liner or chimney cap to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning or a raging fire.
Well, there are similar swindlers out there feeding off your house's various needs. Here are a few to watch out for. 
One are the companies that promise to inexpensively clean your air ducts -- the vents for air-conditioning in the summer and heat in the winter. If you have radiators, you don't have air ducts.
Like the chimney sweeps, many companies, often fly-by-night, offer to come and clean the entire system for one low price. But once they're in your house, they ''discover'' mold and, looking worried, tell you that it needs to be destroyed lest it sicken your entire family.
Michele Mason, president of the Better Business Bureau of Northern Alabama, described how a company named Pure Kleen operated in her state. ''They would run full-page ads in local papers saying they would clean up to 10 ducts for $89.95,'' Ms. Mason said. ''That's considerably lower than we would expect.''
One of the many complaints that the Better Business Bureau received about the company was from a woman ''who said two technicians walked in to her house and said, 'You have mold.' When she asked how they knew, they said, 'We could smell it.' By the time all was said and done, they were quoting her a price of $6,000 to $7, 000,'' Ms. Mason said. ''But if she acted now, it would only be $5,000.''
The woman wrote a check, but after thinking about it, stopped the payment.
Pure Kleen is no longer operating, Ms. Mason said. The national Better Business Bureau said, however, that the company had re-emerged across the country under different names.
Joseph Knoch, president of Air Essentials, a company also in northern Alabama that cleans air ducts, knows firsthand the consumer complaints about companies like Pure Kleen because he also sits on the board of the Better Business Bureau.
An average air duct cleaning job should cost about $600 to $1,000, he said, depending on the equipment, area of country and size of the house.
It also takes a half day to do a good job, Mr. Knoch said. ''Some companies are in and out in half an hour. It takes that long for us to set up.''
A proper cleaning should involve the entire system, including the heating and cooling coils, he added, not just the ducts.
And don't get taken in by the mold scare. ''You can't just look at something and know 100 percent that it's mold,'' said John M. Schulte, executive director of the National Air Duct Cleaners Association, a trade group.
Mr. Knoch said some of these companies brought their own tests to prove mold existed, but he warned homeowners to be wary. ''Some have tests that always come back positive.''
Mr. Schulte suggested asking if a company had been certified by his organization, since members are required to carry insurance, sign a code of ethics and have at least one person in the company certified as an air systems cleaning specialist, which involves an exam.
Finally, the air duct cleaning shouldn't be a yearly event. Mr. Knoch suggested having the ducts inspected every two to four years. But if you don't smoke or cook frequently or have pets, you could possibly go seven to 10 years without a cleaning.
Some of the unscrupulous air duct cleaning companies have also branched out into carpet cleaning. Again, they offer an initial low price and then come in and claim much heavier cleaning needs to be done -- at a much higher cost, of course.
Beware of any company that offers a per-room price, said Elizabeth B. Goldsmith, a professor of consumer economics at Florida State University, who has written ''Carpet Cleaning Tips for Dummies,'' and other books.
A good company should come out and measure the square footage, she said. When the cleaners arrive, they should first vacuum. Furniture should not be moved back in until the carpet is fully dry, she said. I learned this the hard way, when the metal bottoms of some chairs were placed on a damp rug and caused rust stains. In addition, stain from furniture legs can sometimes run onto the carpet, Professor Goldsmith said.
The other option, as my carpet cleaners now do, is to place little plastic patches under all furniture legs to protect the freshly cleaned carpet.
I asked Professor Goldsmith my burning question: Is Scotchgarding really necessary? I often debate whether to spend the extra money. Her answer: ''I lean toward not Scotchgarding. It adds a little more protection, but it's not worth the extra chemicals.''
And for those who have put off rug cleaning? It's probably a good idea to clean those carpets every year or two, she said.
Finally, what about wet basements? I grew up in Southern California and didn't see a basement (or radiator for that matter) until we moved out of state. Now, we have both. And damp basements are a big topic of conversation.
Beware, beware, beware, yet again, of scams, say the experts.
Many people think -- or are told -- that their basement is wet because of a rising water table and need expensive drains installed.
But, ''nine out of 10 times when a basement leaks, it's after a rainstorm or big snow melt,'' said Tom Kraeutler, co-host of the nationally syndicated program, ''The Money Pit Home Improvement Radio Show.''
Therefore, it is far more likely to be a problem of clogged gutters, misplaced downspouts or poor landscaping than a rising water table, he said.
People often get quotes for $10,000 to $15,000 to tear up their basement and install drains, said Carmen Santora, executive director of the New York watchdog group Better Contractors Bureau.
''But we go out and inspect and we can take that estimate down to $1,000 or even less,'' Mr. Santora said.
Often, Mr. Kraeutler said, all that is necessary is to check that your gutters aren't stopped up and that downspouts are at least four feet from the house, so that rainwater doesn't seep into basement walls or the foundation.
Also, make sure that soil hasn't eroded around your basement so that the ground slopes toward your home.
Mr. Kraeutler's co-host, Leslie Segrete, remembers when her basement was saturated after a downpour because a gutter was disconnected from a pipe and a downspout was clogged.
Once those problems were resolved, the basement never flooded again. ''Now I pay someone to clean those gutters five times a year,'' she said.
With all these situations, it's a good first step to check with the Better Business Bureau to see if a company you intend to hire has complaints filed against it. And don't fall prey to hysteria.
''With chimney sweeps, they say your house will burn down,'' Mr. Kraeutler said. ''With duct cleaners, you won't be able to breathe. With waterproofers, the foundation will collapse. They're peddling panic.''
