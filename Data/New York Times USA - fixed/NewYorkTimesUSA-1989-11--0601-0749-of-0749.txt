HEADLINE: Too Many Dammed Rivers

BYLINE: By Stewart L. Udall and W. Kent Olson; Stewart L. Udall was Secretary of the Interior from 1961 to 1969. W. Kent Olson is president of American Rivers, an conservation organization.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Of the 3.5 million miles of river that once laced this continent, an estimated 15 percent now lie dead behind 60,000 dams of all kinds. For every river mile preserved under the national Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 65 have been extinguished.
Today, in parts of the northeast, barely one river in 20 runs damless to the sea. New York's rivers are plugged by no fewer than 188 hydropower projects. Although the state enacted its own scenic rivers law, the actual protection is minimal. Even watercourses in Adirondack Park are vulnerable, including the spectacular Oswegatchie, whose main stem and tributaries are burdened with 20 hydropower dams already. New York's Black River is threatened by poor operation of some of its 12 existing hydropower plants, and the Raquette, with 18 dams, faces a proposed new one. On the Genessee, developers want to add a hydropower facility to a water storage dam, which would drown a recreationally important reach of free-flowing river. 
This is ''hydromania'' and, in New York and elsewhere, the hydropower push is on. Many dam builders enjoy special treatment under Federal laws, and rare, free-running rivers are being sacrificed for minuscule amounts of electricity.
In some cases, private dam builders can get extended tax credits and accelerated depreciation - subsidies amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars so far - and they can confiscate streamside property. These producers even get a guaranteed market - big utilities must buy it whether or not it's needed.
In some states, utilities purchase the power at rates exceeding the costs of alternatives. The small hydropower industry benefits from protectionism, courtesy of the taxpayer. That, not consumer demand for power, is what drives hydromania.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which oversees non-Federal hydropower projects, approves nearly 250 new licenses annually. Since 1978, the agency has received more than 6,500 hydropower applications. Roughly 1,000 are likely to pass the commission's environmental criteria and hundreds of live river segments will soon be converted to static lagoons.
Some experts believe that if all the feasible small hydropower proposals were put on line, the total electric output would equal that of a single coal-fired plant. The new dams would produce 0.03 percent of the nation's present fossil fuel usage. Are Americans willing to lose yet more rivers for so meager a payoff?
Hard-bitten economists are starting to understand that streams enhance the value of nearby property; communities are discovering that accessible river banks make a town comely. Rivers and their environs give places to fish, hunt, boat and hike, and provide natural corridors for animal and plant wildlife - all for free. They are functionally beautiful elements of the living landscape.
Fortunately, because of recent amendments to the Federal Power Act, citizens can have a say in hydropower proceedings. The law says dam operators ''shall give equal consideration'' to power production, wildlife and recreation.
More hydropower dams won't better our national energy picture. In light of the extinction of rivers -600,000 river miles buried behind concrete so far - we should scratch new dams from the list of alternatives to atomic plants and get on with preserving more natural streams.
At a time of giving thanks, there is no better way to do it than to contemplate moving water, which mirrors the flow and play of life, and recall the words of Henry Thoreau: ''Man is rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone.''

HEADLINE: Dinkins Moves To Find Names For Chief Posts

BYLINE: By ARNOLD H. LUBASCH

 BODY:
David N. Dinkins appointed five committees yesterday to look for candidates to head major agencies in New York City, but his transition aides noted that all the jobs will not be filled by the time the Mayor-elect takes office on Jan. 1.
''I am not going to hazard a timetable yet,'' said Nathan Leventhal, the chairman of the transition team. ''We should have a lot of key positions announced before Jan. 1, a great number before then.''
Mr. Leventhal said a new administration can never select all its officials before entering office. 
About 150 people are on the search committees announced yesterday. Several are associated with the man Mr. Dinkins defeated in the Democratic primary, Mayor Edward I. Koch; other names are well known, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's son, Andrew, and another Democratic mayoral candidate, Richard Ravitch.
 
Labor Leaders and Ministers
The committees are composed of a wide range of New Yorkers. Most are from outside government, Mr. Leventhal said, so that the committees can choose a broad spectrum of candidates, including labor leaders, lawyers, financiers, ministers, academics and heads of civic groups. Mr. Leventhal said they represent ''a reasonable demographic mix of the city'' but added that no attempt was made to achieve ''a political balancing act.''
He said he will meet on Tuesday with Mr. Dinkins, who is to return on Monday from a vacation in Puerto Rico.
Mr. Leventhal said the committees announced yesterday will divide themselves into subcommittees, search for job candidates, interview them as early as possible and prepare lists of the names they think Mr. Dinkins should consider.
Mr. Leventhal stressed that the Mayor-elect will take ''final responsibility for selecting people for his administration.'' He said the search committees themselves were selected from lists drawn up by Mr. Dinkins and the transition committee.
While Mr. Dinkins was on vacation, The Daily News reported this week that there was dissension within the transition committee.
That was disputed yesterday by Mr. Leventhal, who said that members of the committee have ''lively discussions'' but that the talks are conducted in ''a spirit of cordiality.''
''The concept that there is dissension or personal animosity is absolute and total nonsense.'' he said.
Barbara Fife, special senior assistant to Mr. Dinkins, also denied that there was discord.
She and Mr. Leventhal said there had been some discussion of whether Mr. Dinkins should come back from his vacation early to work on normal transition matters. That proved to be unnecessary, she said.
 
Koch's Manager on One Panel
Each search committee has two chairpeople and from 21 to 35 members.
Among the members are Paul Crotty, who managed Mr. Koch's campaign in the Democratic primary; F. A. O. Schwarz Jr., former Corporation Counsel for the city and head of the Charter Revision Commission; Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers; the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, and the Rev. Herbert Daughtry. There will be five committees. One will seek candidates for economic and financial agencies. It is headed by Ron Gault, public finance director of The First Boston Corporation, and Peter Goldmark, president of the Rockefeller Foundation.
Another will seek candidates for planning, environmental and quality of life agencies. It is headed by Max Bond, an architect in the firm of Bond Ryder James, and Linda Davidoff, executive director of The Parks Council.
 
Lawyer and a Law Professor
A third panel will deal with legal and law-enforcement services. It is headed by Peggy Davis, a law professor at New York University Law School, and Victor Kovner, a lawyer with the firm of Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford. Mr. Kovner is expected to be Corporation Counsel in the Dinkins administration.
A fourth committee will deal with social service agencies. The group is headed by Dr. June Jackson Christmas, head of the Manhattan Borough President's Commission on Youth, and Dr. Isaura Santiago, president of Hostos Community College in the Bronx.
A fifth panel will seek candidates to lead agencies for service delivery and personnel. It is headed by Ellen Chesler, president of the Parks Council, and Dr. Rafael Lantigua, a doctor at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.
Mr. Dinkins also named Dr. Gerald Lynch, president of John Jay College, as chairman of a subcommittee seeking candidates for Police Commissioner. In addition, Dr. James Dumpson, of the New York Community Trust, was named chairman of a subcommittee that will search for candidates for the job of Commissioner of the Human Resources Administration.

HEADLINE: State Plans Ads for New York City

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
The state will try to help New York City bring in tourist dollars with a $3 million advertising campaign using network television, national magazines and direct-mail advertising, Vincent Tese, the state's Director of Economic Development, announced Thursday.
Mr. Tese said the city would receive extra money for the four-month winter advertising campaign from the state's I Love New York program, even though the budget for the program's own advertising and marketing division had been cut.
''New York City's tourism industry needs our help more than ever before,'' he said. The city is suffering from lower hotel-occupancy rates and lower ticket sales for the theater and many other events, he said. 
The state campaign will ''remind travelers of New York City's special charms,'' Mr. Tese said.
 
Television Commercials Planned
Through the end of March, the state plans to run 30-second commercials on popular programs on the three major networks, including the Tony Awards, the Grammy Awards, specials featuring David Letterman and Barbara Walters, ''The Cosby Show,'' ''Cheers'' and ''L.A. Law.'' The advertisements will show glimpses of Broadway shows, museums and shops and other sights.
Commercials showing the lighting of the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center and other special events will be shown through March 25 on the Cable News Network, Arts & Entertainment, Discovery and USA networks.
Viewers will be invited to call a toll-free number for a New York City vacation kit of a city guide, map and directory of tour packages.
Color advertisments, featuring the stars of musicals under the slogan ''No other city has so much character,'' are planned for Architectural Digest, Bon Appetit, The New Yorker, Travel and Leisure and Vanity Fair. The magazines have a total circulation of 57 million, Mr. Tese's office estimated.
Citing successful direct-mail experiments in the state's spring and summer advertising, the state announced that it will also use that medium, including advertisements in the Carol Wright mailer, Bloomingdale's spring catalogue and a booklet by A.T.&T.
Finally, couples planning to marry will be reminded of honeymoon packages in the city with an advertisement in Bride's magazine.

HEADLINE: Adirondack Park Panel Seeks Balanced Future

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

 BODY:
The Adirondack Park, six million acres of forests, mountains and lakes in the heart of New York State, is many things to many people: a slice of wilderness, a livelihood, a home. Members of New York State's Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century have traveled around the state to hear residents discuss their visions of the park. Now the commission must develop a plan for the park's future to present in the spring to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The commission chairman, Peter A. A. Berle, said in a recent interview that the commission sees its mission as balancing a wide array of interests, including ''protecting the wilderness, marking sure the hamlets are places that people want to live in and can provide a sound economic base for the residents, and providing growth as long as it is in scale.'' 
The park, a checkerboard of public and private land, is not a park along the model of Yellowstone or Central Park. In the 1890's, the State Legislature, recognizing that the land was a resource that needed to be protected, designated it a park and set a boundary around it known as the Blue Line.
The state has made it a priority to buy land within the Blue Line, and though its acquisition program has come under criticism from environmentalists who say the purchases are moving too slowly, it now owns about 40 percent of the acreage. Privately held land within the park is subject to a special set of zoning requirements. Another Long Island? The commission's last of more than a dozen hearings was held this month on Long Island, a place as symbolically distant from the Adirondacks as can be found in New York. Many Adirondacks residents regard Long Island, with its dense development, as the embodiment of what they do not want their region to become. And many Long Island residents look to the Adirondacks as a place to make up for past mistakes.
Typical of the opinion expressed at the hearing, held in Mineola, was that of Carl Waswo, 80 years old, a native of Shoreham, L.I. ''What happened to Long Island was stupid and greedy,'' he said, ''and it's the same thing that is happening to the Adirondacks.''
Alvin Hauser, who spoke on behalf of the 6,000 members of the Long Island Sierra Club, said that open space on the island had shrunk so severely that the club's most recent land-acquisition fight was over a plot of just 20 acres.
''The Adirondack Park preserve was bought and paid for by all the people of New York,'' he said. ''It belongs to all New Yorkers, and all New Yorkers must continue to be represented'' in decisions about it.
 
Snapshots on the Lawn
But if people around the state see the Adirondacks as a place where development must be stopped at any cost, those who live in the park, many of them blue-collar workers with modest incomes, often resent the interference. Protective of their property, many residents say they know how to govern their land better than people who live hundreds of miles away and come only to visit.
At an earlier meeting in Saranac Lake, within the park, Mary Ellen Keith, the Supervisor of the nearby town of Franklin, told the story of a neighbor who returned home one day to find a group of tourists setting up cameras on her lawn to photograph the sunset.
The neighbor asked them to move because she could not get into her front door. She said the tourists responded, ''This is just as much our park as it is yours.''
The majority of those at the Long Island meeting had visited the park and been struck by its beauty. As a result, many members of the Long Island audience did not take it kindly when Barbara Stolen of Chestertown, in the Adirondacks, said the downstaters were treating the Adirondacks as ''a great playground.''
 
'Hey, You, Move Out'
''I'm really moved by the lack of feeling for the people who try to make a living in the Adirondacks,'' Mrs. Stolen said. ''It's like going down to Jones Beach State Park and saying to the people who live nearby, 'Hey, you, move out.' ''
But Mrs. Stolen was criticized by other speakers, who said the park's residents had to be prepared to give up some land-use and development privileges enjoyed by people in more populated areas.
Kim Elliman, vice chairwoman of the Adirondack Council, an environmental group, said, ''Those who live in the park may have to realize that their choice of life style may not afford as many economic opportunities'' as in other areas.
And D. C. Shakeshaft of Lloyd Harbor, L.I., said: ''The Adirondacks is not the place you go to start a business. I as a taxpayer have supported the area as a pristine park, and I would like to see it kept clean and pristine.''
While there was often a clear disparity between the desires of those within and outside of the park, Mr. Berle said that what struck him about the meetings was that the two sides appeared to be coming together. Twenty years ago, when there was an earlier round of discussions that laid the groundwork for the park's current management plan, the relationship between upstaters and downstaters was much more bitter, he said.
 
Support for Preservation
Now, Mr. Berle said, there is a common commitment to protecting the environment and insuring orderly planning in the park.
''The thing that is quite different now is the breadth of support for the need to preserve the values and character of the park,'' Mr. Berle said.
With the hearings over, he said, the commission's next step is to work on the plan for Governor Cuomo. Mr. Berle said the plan would be specific, with suggestions on the regulatory structure for the park and how its land would be managed.
The commission will be taking an especially close look at the Adirondack Park Agency, established more than 25 years ago to deal with zoning questions. The agency has come under fire from critics on both sides - some saying that it is too intrusive, and others that it is not vigilant enough.
Mr. Berle said the hearings were meant to get a feel for New Yorkers' views about the park. But, he said, with all the competing interests, ''whether you can make everyone happy is very unlikely.''

HEADLINE: An Acquisitive Utility Spreads in the West

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE M. FISHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore.

 BODY:
Pacificorp, the company bidding $2.08 billion for the Arizona Public Service Company, has grown through acquisitions from a little-known Oregon company into the third-largest utility in the West. In the process, it is becoming known as a leader in the trends toward distributing power across many states and diversifying into non-utility businesses.
In January Pacificorp completed the $1.8 billion acquisition of the Utah Power and Light Company, the largest merger of two utilities in 50 years.
The Utah deal and the proposed Arizona deal are part of a strategy to acquire transmission lines to deliver cheap hydroelectric power from the Northwest to hungry southern markets where it can command a premium price. Demand in markets like Arizona and Southern California peaks in the summer for air-conditioner use, while Oregon demand peaks in the winter. Serving both regions would enable Pacificorp to channel excess power where it is needed over its own lines. 
That ability to transfer power could help Pacificorp avoid the expense of building new power plants for some time.
What is more, the acquisitions can add to efficiency. Pacificorp says that the economies of the Utah merger alone will give it pretax savings of $50 million this year, with annual savings of as much as $160 million within five years.
But Pacificorp's acquisitions have also generated debate. Some rate-payer groups are troubled by the size of its seven-state transmission area. Acquiring the Arizona utility would give Pacificorp operations in every Far Western state except Nevada.
These groups say that an acquisition of a Nevada utility would give Pacificorp the ability to dominate the flow of power into California and to dictate prices to the West's two largest utilities: Pacific Gas and Electric, which serves Northern and Central California, and Southern California Edison.
''In less than two years, Pacificorp will have changed from an obscure utility serving sparse areas in seven Northwest states to a utility which controls the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power from Canada to Mexico,'' said Scott Hempling, an attorney with the energy project of the Environmental Action Foundation in Washington.
''You can condition every deal so that by themselves they're harmless, but when you're done you still have one company controlling vast areas,'' Mr. Hempling said. Conditions Put on Deal His group successfully sought protections for consumers from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in the Utah deal. For one thing, Pacificorp agreed to allow any competitor to use its transmission lines at cost.
Traditionally a company that controlled transmission lines could deny access to others or charge them a premium price for making the connection, a ''wheeling charge'' in industry jargon.
The conditions imposed by the Federal regulators even require Pacificorp to build transmission lines if a customer asks for them.
So far the conditions apply only to firm contracts, not the spot market, and only to other utilities, not end users. Nevertheless, Pacificorp's acceptance of the conditions raised a storm of protest from executives of other utilities, who feared a precedent was being set.
 
Concerns About Competition
Utility industry leaders fear that ''open wheeling'' by Pacificorp will encourage competition not only from other utilities but also from independent power producers. The independents, who are less bound by Federal and state regulations, could operate with a far more leveraged capital structure, allowing them to undercut the utilities in pricing electricity.
A. M. Gleason, Pacificorp's president and chief executive, conceded that other utilities were ''fighting tooth and nail'' against open wheeling. He also said that Federal regulators would probably impose similar conditions in an Arizona deal, but he added that he did not consider the conditions to be a precedent. Pacificorp accepted them, he said, because the costs of carrying power for competitors are easily offset by savings like those realized in the Utah merger.
''We simply don't see the same bogeyman that the rest of the industry does,'' he said. ''We don't think that we're setting a standard. The conditions were set by F.E.R.C. and simply not found objectionable by us.''
 
The Arizona Offer
While the Arizona Public Service bid is in many ways a twin of the Utah offer, its timing was dictated not by Pacificorp but by the troubles of the Pinnacle West Capital Corporation, Mr. Gleason said. Pinnacle, the parent of Arizona Public Service, desperately needs cash to prop up its Merabank unit, an insolvent savings and loan institution. Pinnacle's board is evaluating Pacificorp's unsolicited offer.
Arizona Public Service has said it needs a 20 percent increase in its rates in order to bring the second of its three nuclear reactors into service, but Pacificorp's bid stipulates that it will increase rates only 8 percent, spread over the next four years.
Jill Jenkins, an analyst with Sutro & Company in San Francisco, said ''regulators in Arizona are really pushing this, out of concern that Pinnacle will go under, leaving Arizona Public Service tied to a bankrupt holding company.'' She said that another bidder could emerge and that Pacificorp's offer was at a 15 percent discount to book value, while most utility mergers were at premiums of 1.8 to 1.9 times book value.
Ms. Jenkins added that she had ''a lot of respect for Pacificorp management'' and assumed that the price differential was based on uncertainty about Merabank and Arizona's three Palo Verde nuclear power plants.
She described Pacificorp as ''one of the most successfully diversified public utilities,'' with strong performance at its telephone subsidiary, Pacific Telecom, and its coal mining company, Nerco. She also applauded Mr. Gleason for deciding to scale back the company's financial-services unit.
 
Acquisitions by Other Units
Other divisions of Pacificorp have been active acquirers as well. Earlier this month Pacificorp and Pacific Telecom agreed to acquire North-West Telecommunications Inc. for $250 million. Under the agreement, shareholders of North-West, which operates telephone and cellular telephone services in Wisconsin, would receive 90 percent of the purchase price in Pacificorp stock, with the balance in cash.
Executives at other utilities declined to discuss Pacificorp's acquisition activity, but described the company's management as shrewd.
''They are well thought of in the industry,'' said Joe L. Gremban, chairman, president and chief executive of the Sierra Pacific Resources Corporation, a utility based in Reno. He added that he was not worried about Pacificorp making a bid for his company.
Nor should he be, Mr. Gleason said. Asked whether Pacificorp had its sights set on either Sierra Pacific or the Nevada Power Company of Las Vegas, he said no.
 
Views on Strategy
He described the company's history of growth by acquisition as more a matter of opportunism than any desire to dominate its market.
''It's not part of any grand strategy,'' Mr. Gleason said.
Some analysts think Pacificorp's acquisition strategy is to some extent a defensive one. ''I don't think Pacificorp wants to control transmission so much as to insure that it has access,'' said James V. Smith, an analyst with Duff & Phelps in Chicago.
While some analysts have predicted that there will eventually be only 50 utilities nationwide as increased competition forces small companies to merge, Mr. Gleason said that so far there had been only two or three significant mergers. A proposed merger between Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric is proceeding very slowly.
''I've always taken the position that there won't be a lot of utility mergers,'' Mr. Gleason said. Because the industry is so highly regulated by state and Federal agencies, ''there won't be huge premiums over book values because you can't earn enough to pay for it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Stocks Post Broad Gain; Trading Off

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks gained strongly yesterday in exceptionally slow post-Thanksgiving trading.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.77 points, to 2,675.55. The bellwether indicator spurted to a 15-point gain within the first hour of trading, added seven more points by noon, and remained stable until slipping shortly before the close. For the week, the Dow rose 22.89 points, or slightly less than 1 percent. 
Blue-chip stocks held their gains after the Federal Reserve apparently moved to ease credit on Wednesday by adding reserves to the banking system. Analysts perceived the new target for Federal funds to be 8 1/4 percent. Yesterday, in an unexpected move, the Fed moved to arrest the decline in rates by draining some of those reserves from the banking system, but market analysts discounted the move as technical.
 
Prime Rate Cut Expected
''I think the major banks will reduce their prime rates a half a point, to 10 percent, early next week,'' said William M. Lefevre, investment strategist at Advest Inc. ''The recent strength of the long-neglected high-tech stock sector tends to improve the possibility for a significant year-end rally.''
Yesterday, major technology stocks were narrowly mixed, with I.B.M. up 1/4, to 100 3/8; Motorola up 5/8, to 58 1/4; Hewlett-Packard unchanged at 44 3/8, and Digital Equipment off 5/8, to 89 1/2. In over-the-counter trading, Intel was up 1/4, to 34 3/4, while Apple Computer was unchanged at 44 3/4.
Volume on the Big Board plunged to 86.3 million shares, its second-lowest turnover this year, from 145.7 million shares Wednesday. The slowest day so far this year was on July 3, when only 68.9 million shares were traded.
Advances on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered declines by more than a 2-to-1 ratio, with 931 issues up in price and 447 down.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.06 points, to 343.97, while the Big Board composite index added 1.08 points, to 190.29.
Interest rates declined in the credit markets. Prices of long-term Government bonds, which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, rose modestly, putting their yields by late in the day at 7.86 percent.
Among individual stocks, Primerica rose 1/2, to 28 1/2. The company announced that it had agreed to acquire BarclaysAmerican/Financial, the American consumer lending unit, from Barclays Bank for $1.35 billion in cash.
 
Texas Instruments Up 1 3/8
Texas Instruments jumped 1 3/8, to 37 7/8, in active trading. The stock continued to be spurred by Japan's recent awarding of a semiconductor patent to the company.
General Motors edged up 1/4, to 43. The company estimated an after-tax gain of about $82 million from the sale of a small part of its current 40.2 percent stake in Isuzu Motors Corporation Ltd.
Unisys was the most active Big Board stock, jumping 1 1/2, to 16, on a volume of nearly 3.5 million shares, including a block of one million shares. Earlier this week, it said a Defense Department contract could be worth $700 million.
 
Active Blue Chips Rise
Among actively traded blue chips, McDonald's rose 1/4, to 32 7/8; Philip Morris 1/8, to 41 1/2; Unocal 1/2, to 27 5/8, and Bristol-Myers 1/4, to 56 3/8. General Electric was unchanged at 60 1/8.
Gold and precious metal stocks continued strong, this time buoyed by a $7.90-an-ounce rise in the Comex spot price of gold, to $418.90 an ounce. Homestake Mining was up 1 1/8, to 19 3/8, while ASA added 1, to 57 1/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index gained 1.42 points, to 373.14, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.49 points, to 456.63.
Texas Air jumped 1 1/8, to 13, on the Amex. Pilots and flight attendants ended their strikes against the company's Eastern Airlines subsidiary.

HEADLINE: OPEC Seeks Kuwait and Emirate Oil Cut

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 24

 BODY:
An OPEC majority tried today to persuade two Persian Gulf Arab states, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, to agree to cut oil output, for fear that their excess production could weaken prices early in 1990.
Oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries were huddled in caucus groups in their hotel suites here on the second day of talks aimed at setting new output quotas, effective Jan. 1.
 
'Plenty of Ideas'
''There have been plenty of ideas, but we're still working,'' Iraq's oil minister, Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalaby, said. 
Kuwait and the Emirates, which are among the wealthiest members, have effectively boycotted OPEC accords for most of 1989 because the majority would not give them quotas as generous as they wanted. They have produced as they pleased, taking total OPEC output above 23 million barrels a day.
But other members are concerned that unless producers exercise some restraint in their output, prices could fall in the early part of next year.
''OPEC will have to agree to a cut in output of around 1.5 million barrels a day to have any chance of maintaining current prices,'' said Steve Turner, an oil analyst with a London brokerage firm, Smith New Court.
The global economy is expected to slow down, and that is expected to brake the rebound in demand for OPEC oil. In addition, North Sea oil is now flowing steadily after recent interruptions caused by accidents.
A Gulf Arab source said most of the 13 members believed that a ceiling on total OPEC supply could be safely set at 21.5 million barrels daily and perhaps as high as 22 million if all members agreed to stick to the rules.
The ministers are now grappling with the problem of getting Kuwait and the Emirates in under that ceiling. A compromise would require the two states to cut their output and oblige other members to cede some of their share of the total allowable OPEC volume.
The biggest exporter, Saudi Arabia, has so far refused to accept anything less than its current 24.46 percent share of whatever OPEC sells and shows no sign of easing that stance.
 
Another Makeshift Package
A failure to compromise would force OPEC to settle for a ''pro rata'' deal. That is shorthand for another makeshift package, probably again excluding Kuwait and the Emirates, in which new quotas would be assigned on the basis of existing percentage shares.
Consumers are not likely to be affected much either way. Current world prices range from $17 to $20 a barrel after averaging $14 in 1988.
New York futures for the January contract on the United States benchmark crude, West Texas Intermediate, remained today at $19.82 for a 42-gallon barrel.

HEADLINE: Farm Exports At $39.7 Billion

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The nation's exports of farm products in the fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 came close to the $40 billion forecast by Agriculture Department experts three months ago.
According to a detailed report by the department's Economic Research Service, the value of shipments in the 1989 fiscal year was almost $39.7 billion, up 12 percent from $35.3 billion in 1988. 
That was the biggest export value since the record $43.8 billion in 1981. It also marked the third consecutive year-to-year increase since exports plunged to $26.3 billion in 1986.
Officials said the 1989 export surge came despite a sharp cutback in the department's Export Enhancement Program, which subsidizes selected exports to designated overseas markets.
Agricultural imports, meanwhile, were valued at a record $21.5 billion, up from about $21 billion in 1988, the previous high. Vegetables, grain and grain products, sugar and rubber showed the largest increases, the report said.
As expected, the actual volume of 1989 exports of key commodities was down from the previous year. But higher unit prices for many items offset the decline in shipment tonnages.

HEADLINE: Drop Noted In Housing

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The F. W. Dodge Group, an industry research subsidiary of the McGraw-Hill Information Services Company, reported yesterday that 6 percent percent fewer homes were started in the United States in the third quarter of 1989 than in the corresponding period a year earlier.
''Housing starts have been running a steady 6 to 7 percent below last year's output since early in 1989, and the latest quarter brought no sign of an expected improvement,'' George Christie, chief economist at Dodge, said. ''But it's only a matter of time before the recent decline of mortgage rates stimulates a higher volume of building.''
Third-quarter starts totalled 364,369 units, compared with 387,758 a year ago.
The Government reported last week that housing starts surged 12 percent in October, for the biggest gain in three years. Housing starts react to changes in interest rates and are viewed as a leading indicator of activity in the real estate industry.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Weaker As Rise in Mark Continues

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar weakened against most major currencies in quiet activity yesterday, trading near an 11-month low against the West German mark.
Currency dealers said the dollar's decline was largely a result of the mark's continuing strength.
The dollar slipped to 1.8040 marks in Europe, down from 1.8157 late Thursday, and the lowest level since it stood at 1.7955 marks on Jan. 5. 
In New York, the dollar traded at 1.8010 marks, down from 1.81275 marks late Wednesday. Financial markets in the United States were closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Louis Quilici, a dealer with the Harris Trust Company in Chicago, said the New York close was the lowest since Jan. 5, when the dollar closed at 1.8003 marks.
The mark has risen on anticipation that West Germany might have to raise interest rates to keep its economy from overheating. It is widely believed that West German growth will accelerate as East Germans continue to pour into the country after the recent political changes in East Germany.
Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on mark-denominated investments and stimulate demand for marks.
Concerns that American interest rates would fall because of weakness in the economy also helped depress the dollar, dealers said.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.80 yen, down from Wednesday's 143.88 yen. The market in Japan was closed Thursday for a holiday. The dollar traded at 143.57 yen in London, but rose to 143.60 yen in New York, up from 143.10 Wednesday.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. A pound cost $1.5635 in London, up from $1.5610 late Thursday. But in New York, the pound traded at $1.5625, down from $1.5655 late Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday, included: 1.6095 Swiss francs, down from 1.6110; 6.1415 French francs, down from 6.1835; 1,326.75 Italian lire, down from 1,337.00, and 1.16725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16875.

HEADLINE: CONSUMER'S WORLD;
Is It Time to Buy Your Phone? Maybe

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is planning to raise rental rates for telephone equipment early next year, and consumer advocates are urging people who lease their home phones to buy them.
Most American households now own their telephones instead of leasing them from A.T.&T. or other private phone companies, as they had to do under the Bell System monopoly that was dismantled in this decade.
But about 30 million households still rent telephones from A.T.&T., which said last week that it planned to raise its leasing rates by an average of 12 percent in the first quarter of 1990. The increases would range from 25 cents to 95 cents a month, depending on the phone model. 
Nevertheless, not everyone should rush out and buy a phone; there are advantages to leasing for some consumers, and you can always change your mind and buy a phone.
 
Reasons for Leasing
 One reason to continue leasing is that no matter what happens to the phone, A.T.&T. will replace it, the company said. Households with young children should consider renting at least one phone that might be subject to accidents or abuse.
Another benefit of leasing is that consumers can experiment with different styles and colors. That is because A.T.&T. allows customers to exchange the rental phones at will.
Based on cost alone, the Consumer Federation of America, a consumer advocacy group in Washington, has advised residential consumers to buy their telephones because rental fees would cover the purchase price in less than two years. Renting A.T.&T.'s Touch-Tone phone at $5.10 a month for 10 months, for example, would cover the $49.95 price.
 
Quality of Phones Varies
 Gene Kimmelman, a spokesman for the consumer group, said, ''There's no question that you pay more for your phone if you lease it so it makes economic sense to buy.''
People buying telephones should be aware that there are more than 25 manufacturers of residential telephone equipment for the United States market, and their products vary in quality and performance.
Although most telephones that are for sale, including those from A.T.&T., come with a warranty of from one to five years, such coverage does not include damage to the phone from external sources; manufacturers will repair only malfunctions that occur in normal operation.
Sales representatives at electronics and telephone stores in New York recommend that consumers buy a phone with a well-known brand name that has at least a two-year warranty and easily accesible repair service.
Consumers will have to spend $20 to $60 for a decent telephone, and should avoid features they do not need. The store representatives recommend a touch-tone phone with a lighted dial pad and memory dialing, which allows emergency numbers to be put into the phone to be automatically dialed as needed.
A.T.&T. makes about 25 percent of the residential telephone equipment bought in the United States; sales of more than $1 billion for all brands are expected this year. The industry, which will produce 22 million residential phones this year, is highly fragmented. It includes big companies like Panasonic, Radio Shack, General Electric, Goldstar, Northern Telecom and Swiss Telephone, and also many small foreign and domestic concerns with little-known names.
''A lot of people buy A.T.&T. phones because of the name, and they think A.T.&T. phones will work better,'' said Yash Jesrani, president of the Phone Boutique in Manhattan, which competes with A.T.&T.'s stores. ''But that's not necessarily true, because these people are thinking of the old A.T.&T. electromechanical phones that were meant to last 30 years in the rental market. When you buy an A.T.&T. phone today, you are buying an electronic phone that will not take the beating that these older phones have taken.''
A spokeswoman for A.T.&T., Jo Johnston, said, ''If we were to make a phone that was guaranteed to last 20 years, the cost would be more than people are willing to pay.''
The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs said consumers should be aware that several discount electronic stores have been selling refurbished telephones at the same prices they charge for new phones. If you buy a phone from a discount electronics store, ask if it is refurbished. By law, the store must inform the consumer if that is so.
A.T.&T. has expanded the products it leases to include cordless telephones, speaker phones, answering machines, facsimile machines, two-line phones and memory telephones. A cordless phone rents for $11.95 a month and costs $169 to buy; an answering machine leases for $8.50 a month and sells for $129, and a facsimile machine rents for a minimum of 12 months at $111.73 a month; after a year, it can be bought for $1, said Toni Mallozzi, manager of the Phone Center store on Staten Island.
Jeannette Noyes, research director for consumer communications at the Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston, said, ''The future of the leasing market will be in offering these products, which give consumers an opportunity to sample equipment they are curious about but are not certain they want to buy.''
 
TO BUY OR LEASE?
 
LEASING
 
* Companies that lease pones will usually repair rental equipment no matter what happens to it.
 
* Rental phones canbe readily exchanged for different colors and styles.
 
* Telephone answering machines, cordless phones, facsimile machines and other divices can all be rented.
 

 
BUYING
 
* Cheaper than leasing. Monthly rental fee would cover the cost of buying a phone in less than two years.
 
* Buyers have a greater selection of styles, features and colors, including novelty phones.

HEADLINE: New Japan Car War Weapon: A 'Little Engine That Could'

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Having attracted American buyers for years with high quality and reliability, Japanese auto makers are now moving to win sales with a new competitive edge: technically advanced engines that burn fuel more efficiently and produce more power than most American engines.
The new engines, already available in many Japanese models, could provide Japan's powerful auto makers with another tool for increasing sales, just as Detroit seems to be closing the gap in quality and durability.
That prospect is particularly worrying, many experts say, at a time when the Big Three American auto makers are struggling to sell cars and keep their factories open.
 
More Efficient Fuel Use
The new ''multivalve engines'' are compact yet use additional engine valves to aid combustion. Burning fuel more efficiently, the advanced engines may also give their producers a lead in meeting tougher Federal regulations that are expected for pollution control and gasoline conservation. 
Multivalve engines increase efficiency by adding extra valves to the cylinders. A car gets power by igniting fuel within each cylinder, repeatedly creating an explosion that drives a piston. The pistons, one in each cylinder, move the shafts and gears that propel the wheels.
In a conventional combustion engine, each cylinder has one valve that lets in air that produces explosions when mixed with fuel, and one valve that vents exhaust. Thus, a typical four-cylinder engine has eight valves. But the most familiar engines used by Japanese auto makers in cars sold here now have four valves in each of the four cylinders. Even more advanced engines have five or more valves per cylinder.
Why are four valves, or more, better than two? By increasing the number of intake valves and exhaust valves and by moving the control shafts, or camshafts, closer to the valves, the engine can be made to produce much more horsepower without adding cylinders or making them bigger. The additional valves allow more air and fuel to enter the cylinder and allow exhaust to leave faster, increasing efficiency and power at higher operating speeds.
 
Japan Pushes; Detroit Lags
While Japanese car companies have pushed hard to bring the multivalve engine to the marketplace, Detroit has lagged. Among the big American producers, only General Motors offers the advanced engine, and in just a few models. Many auto industry analysts fear that the Detroit auto makers will pay for their sluggishness.
''It's important for domestic manufacturers to get these engines into vehicles aimed at younger buyers,'' said Christopher Cedergren, senior analyst for J. D. Power & Associates, a consulting firm on automotive issues. ''The domestics are stalling for time. By the end of the 1990's, the older engine technology they use today will be completely out.''
Like the videocassette recorder and the facsimile machine, the multivalve engine was invented in America but commercialized in Japan. It was first developed in the United States early in the century. Japanese auto makers introduced it in Japan in the early 1980's and in this country a few years later. The engines are now in a significant number of Japanese cars here, including many assembled in this country.
Just this month, for example, the Nissan Motor Corporation began selling its Infiniti Q-45, a $38,000 luxury car equipped with the most sophisticated multivalve engine yet offered in the United States. The Infiniti could steal sales from Cadillac and Lincoln.
Until recently, American auto makers for the most part delayed investing the money required to develop multivalve designs and mass-produce them, reasoning that consumers do not care what engine powers their car. The Big Three will not have those engines generally available for three to five years, people in the industry said.
 
More Flexibility in Design
Automotive engineers, foreign and domestic, agree that multivalve technology gives designers more flexibility because in many cases multivalve engines are smaller than engines of comparable power.
Aware of those advantages, General Motors, Ford and Chrysler are each pursuing new multivalve engine programs. But all the while, Detroit executives and engineers continue to point out the engines' drawbacks.
Because they must operate at higher engine speeds to produce greater horsepower, multivalve engines have been criticized as too noisy and high-pitched. Big Three engineers say most American drivers are accustomed to a low-pitched, quiet rumble from conventional engines. A more important problem for the simplest multivalve engines is that while they can eventually bring the cars to higher speeds and accelerate faster at higher speeds, they offer somewhat slower pickup from a stop than a conventional engine.
 
Difficult to Repair
Multivalve engines are also more expensive to make and can be more difficult to repair. But Japanese auto makers have been steadily refining the engines and are offering models that address some of these problems.
Stiff taxes on large engines in Japan encouraged auto makers there to make small engines more powerful. The Japanese have begun to use the engines on all their cars, developing not only small multivalve engines that are peppy but also larger ones that are extremely powerful.
''You'll be seeing more and more of these engines in all cars,'' said Takashi Oka, general manager for product planning and marketing for Nissan. ''The cost of building multivalve engines is lower in Japan. All the Japanese manufacturers have been offering it, which reduces the cost, and we have a lot of experience, which also reduces the cost.''
A recent study by TRW Inc., a maker of valves, showed that every Honda car now sold in this country has multivalve technology, as do 70 percent of Toyotas, 54 percent of Nissans, 37 percent of Mazdas and 24 percent of Mitsubishis.
 
Europe Not Such a Threat
European auto makers have also begun to use such engines in high-performance and luxury cars. But these are not considered as much a threat to American models because few European models sold in the United States are in the low- and middle-price ranges.
But Japanese auto makers use the engines in the Toyota Camry and the Honda Accord, two of the most popular cars sold in this country. The newest of the engines in cars like the Infiniti Q-45 and the Honda NSX exhibit refinements that have not been matched by any manufacturer except Mercedes-Benz.
The Q-45's eight-cylinder engine has 32 valves, or four per cylinder, and uses complex electromechanical timing devices to vary the valve openings according to the speed of the engine.
With better valve control, the Q-45 accelerates quickly from a stop. This ability, in theory, removes one of the main reservations of American car makers about the multivalve engine. Most multivalve engines, however, do not have the refinements of the Q-45.
 
Big Three School of Thought
Many Big Three engineers dismiss the multivalve technology as inappropriate for a large portion of the American market and not worth the huge investment. According to this school of thought, many American consumers, particularly older drivers, prefer conventional American engines.
But the notion that consumers are not aware or are only dimly aware of new engine technology is being challenged by marketing experts. They maintain that more and more American car buyers make their decisions based on which products are more advanced technologically.
''The world's way isn't the American's way,'' said Leon Mandel, publisher of Autoweek, an enthusiasts' magazine. ''The rest of the world likes the hard-breathing little engine that could. To cling to big engines is begging for the return of the brontosaurus.''
 
Sales Are Faltering
Domestic auto makers can ill afford further erosion of customers; many assembly plants face permanent closings as sales fail to meet expectations. Since 1978 the share of the car market in the United States belonging to domestic producers has dropped from almost 84 percent to just under 69 percent in 1988.
Don Miles, chief engineer for G.M.'s Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac group, said G.M. engines ''are every bit as sophisticated'' as any in the world. Many engines produced by the Big Three are based on designs in use since the early 1960's, but there have been improvements through the introduction of electronic controls and the reduction of friction, he said.
Mr. Miles acknowledged the superior efficiency of multivalve engines, but said it comes at a cost. ''Obviously, multivalve engines are more complex, more expensive to manufacture and have higher piece value,'' meaning their more numerous components cost more, he said. For those and other reasons, G.M. rejected multivalve technology for its current line of six-cylinder Buick engines, he said.
 
G.M.'s Design
G.M. is the only American car company that makes a multivalve engine for use in this country. G.M.'s advanced engine is called the Quad Four and is offered as an option on several 1990 models, including, for the first time, some midsize cars like the Buick Regal. G.M. built about nine million engines last year in North America, about 190,000 of which were Quad Fours.
Producing these engines requires a high degree of manufacturing precision, a skill at which Japanese auto makers have proved adept, said David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's office of transportation studies. American manufacturers only recently improved their production processes enough to begin considering such projects.
Industry analysts calculate that an American car company would have to spend $500 million or more to design a plant to produce it. G.M. will not say what the Quad Four program cost, but the price is thought to be in that neighborhood.

HEADLINE: Law Professor Takes Soviets by Storm With Crisp Oratory and Hard Work

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The fastest rising political star in the Soviet Union is not a Communist Party luminary, flamboyant populist, angry dissident or smoldering nationalist.
He is a law professor named Anatoly A. Sobchak, and as the new Soviet legislature struggles to build a legal foundation under its wobbly experiment in greater democracy, it sometimes seems that the entire country has become his classroom.
Thanks to the appealing televised sessions of the Supreme Soviet, Mr. Sobchak has become the most influential of the country's radical reformers - apostles of free markets, private property and competing political parties - and seems to have eclipsed Boris N. Yeltsin, the popular Moscow maverick, in the public's affection.
When Soviet pundits and voters speculate about an eventual alternative to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the name that comes up most often now is Mr. Sobchak's - an ambition he is very careful to disavow as wild speculation. 
 
'Time for Teaching'
''Some people think in five years I'll be in jail, others think I'll be the President,'' he jokes when pressed on his plans. ''But I think in five years it'll be time for me to go back to teaching.''
In the eight months since he was elected to represent a district in Leningrad, Mr. Sobchak, who is 52, has become a national favorite by combining strong opinions and a crisp oratory with a mastery of lawmaking.
Because the Soviet Parliament has only a handful of lawyers among its 542 members - and most of those, including Mr. Gorbachev, are really career party functionaries - Mr. Sobchak's skills are indispensable as the legislature defines basic principles like the rights of ownership, freedom of the press, police powers and the mechanics of democracy.
''In the United States, I was surprised to find an ironic attitude toward lawyers,'' said Mr. Sobchak, who recently returned from his first venture to a capitalist country. ''You have so many lawyers that the people, the constituents, even the Congressmen themselves tend to smirk at them.''
 
A Neglected Profession
In this country, however, the law, like history, has been a neglected profession because promising candidates knew that the Communist Party was frequently above the law.
One result of the deficit is that it is hard to imagine the new legislature without Mr. Sobchak. He is chairman of a subcommittee that clears all legislation on the economy, sits on a committee that keeps track of new laws for compliance with the constitution and is also a member of special committees drafting a new constitution, investigating police violence in Soviet Georgia and planning next month's Congress of People's Deputies.
He bounds to the microphone to speak on almost every proposed law, citing international precedents from memory, chopping the air with his hands, and usually commanding respectful attention from his colleagues.
Early in the session, he led the battle to defeat the Government's candidate for Foreign Trade Minister, arguing that the nominee was unqualified. A majority agreed with him, and the verdict was one of the first clear signs of the new Parliament's independence.
 
On Communists' Standing
More recently, he took on Mr. Gorbachev on the question of eliminating Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which enshrines the Communist Party as ''the leading and guiding force'' in Soviet life.
Mr. Sobchak, a party member, argued for repeal, saying the party should be required to earn its power. Mr. Gorbachev contended that this would be an unwarranted slap at the party just as it is trying to coax the country in an unsettled period.
Mr. Sobchak fell two votes short and would have won except that many members abstained. He said he expected to prevail at the full congress, some 2,250 deputies from which the 542-member Supreme Soviet is chosen.
Mr. Sobchak has been aggressive in defense of free enterprise, arguing that economic power is the real front line in the battle with hard-liners in the party and Government.
 
Compromise on Cooperatives
When a group of legislators mounted an assault on private cooperatives, reflecting a general public resentment of the new and prospering entrepreneurial class, Mr. Sobchak crafted a compromise that restricted high-stakes speculators but minimized the effect on most businessmen.
Mr. Sobchak has his share of enemies in Parliament, including representatives of the official trade unions, who have recently tried to gain political ground by waging a grass-roots campaign against free enterprise.
This week, he was fiercely attacked in the union newspaper Trud for opposing a union-backed price freeze. He lost that one.
Mr. Sobchak nonetheless takes his free-enterprise argument to factories, where he tells blue-collar constituents that the reason American workers live better is because they work harder, and that is because capitalism generally punishes lazy workers and rewards productive ones.
 
Blue-Collar Popularity
''Our demagogic slogans about equality have made our people lose their love for work,'' he said.
Soviet journalists say that informal polls and letters to the press show that Mr. Sobchak's popularity among blue-collar voters is extremely high, despite the unions' attempt to paint him as a closet capitalist.
Mr. Sobchak joined the Communist Party only last year, holding out, he says, until Mr. Gorbachev vowed to withdraw all Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
Along with Mr. Yeltsin, the human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov, the historian Yuri N. Afanaseyev and others, he is a member of the fledgling parliamentary opposition, the interregional deputies group. But he has grown frustrated by the group's internecine squabbles and inability to mount legislative campaigns.
Mr. Yeltsin has all but dropped from sight, after a couple of spectacular political pratfalls, including his mysterious claim, later retracted, that abductors tried to drown him in the Moscow River. Mr. Afanaseyev, bitter at the slow pace of change, remains an outsider. Mr. Sakharov participates in legislation, slowed by age and illness.
 
Suporter of Gorbachev
''A parliament cannot exist without factions,'' Mr. Sobchak said. ''The interregional group is a prototype. But it's hard to say what will become of it.''
Although Mr. Sobchak describes himself as a fervent supporter of Mr. Gorbachev, he criticizes the Soviet leadership for wavering at moments of crisis, for being afraid to rely on the new laws it passes.
He argues, for instance, that the Government should not have dawdled in prolonged negotiations with this month's strike by coal miners in northern Siberia.
''We passed a law providing measures for dealing with strikes that are found to be illegal: close the enterprise and fire all those who took part in the illegal strike,'' he said. ''Remember how Reagan stopped the air controllers' strike. If a strike harms the interests of the people, decisive action must be taken. Not by using the troops but by using the law.''
''I think the greatest danger is indecisiveness, half-way measures, and deviations in the work of the leadership,'' he added. ''The greatest danger today, I think, is Gorbachev's loss of authority among the people. That's the greatest danger, because it's precisely the loss of authority of the present leadership could lead to dire consequences.''

HEADLINE: U.S. May Cut Dues to U.N. Over Arab Resolution

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The United States will drastically cut funds to the Rome-based United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization if the agency agrees next week to cooperate with the Palestine Liberation Organization on agricultural development in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, Administration officials say.
For the first time, Arab members have introduced a resolution in the agency's governing General Conference calling on the organization to ''provide the Palestinian people with the assistance necessary for their economic development in close cooperation with the Palestine Liberation Organization.''
If the Arabs secure the backing of a majority at the General Conference, the resolution is certain to pass, American officials say. They point out that France appears ready to back the resolution. 
''We are very concerned about this resolution and expending every diplomatic effort at this late hour,'' John R. Bolton, the Assistant Secretary of State for International Organizations, said in a telephone interview. ''If it is passed, it will be a sad day for the F.A.O.'' The resolution, due for a vote on Monday, says ''that the practices of the Israeli occupying authorities impede the basic requirements for the development of the economy of the occupied Palestinian territories.''
It ''expresses opposition to the Israeli confiscation of Palestinian land and the expropriation of Palestinian water resources.'' The resolution asks the agency to include the occupied territories in ''future programs and activities in line with present cooperation and coordination between the Palestine Liberation Organization and other United Nations agencies.''
United States officials say they strongly oppose the resolution, arguing that it amounts to ''massive politicization'' of a technical United Nations body charged with promoting agriculture in the developing world.
Since the Palestine National Council declared the existence of a Palestinian state in the occupied territories last year, the United States has successfully blocked Arab campaigns to win recognition of the P.L.O. as a government by the United Nations and several of its specialized agencies, including the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
But this time the Arab members are asking the organization to treat the P.L.O. as the Palestinian people's representative in agricultural matters.
Approval of the resolution, officials say, would trigger immediate retaliation by the United States in the form of further reductions of its payments to the agency. ''They would go to the bottom of the heap,'' one official said.
American officials point out that the P.L.O. resolution comes after the General Conference defied the United States and other Western contributors by forcing through a 3-percent increase in the agriculture agency's 1990 budget after making allowance for inflation.
This violated the major Western contributors' collective policy of seeking to impose zero real growth on all United Nations spending. The United States and other major contributors, which together pay 58 percent of the agency's costs, either voted against the new budget or abstained.
The Administration originally asked Congress to pay to the agency $61.3 million, the full assessed contribution of the United States, as well as an additional $8 million toward its accumulated arrears of $82 million. The agency's budget for next year is $270 million. The United States pays about 25 percent of the budget.
But since Congress voted less than the Administration requested for all regular dues to United Nations agencies and gave no money for arrears, the Administration is bound to cut its payments to the agency next year.
Just how much further the Administration could cut its contribution to the agency raises the sensitive question of whether the United States wants to retain full voting rights in the organization, officials say. If the United States pays less than $18 million next year, its arrears will total two years' dues and it would be liable to lose its voting rights in the organization.

HEADLINE: Polls Find Their Way to a Bigger Role in India

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 25

 BODY:
As India moves into its fifth decade of regular democratic elections, opinion surveys and the polling of voters are beginning to play bigger roles in political reporting and analysis.
Polls have begun to alter the way newspapers and magazines cover election campaigns. This year, with more polling planned, premature leaks of results could affect voting in a country where ballots are being cast over five days, some politicians fear.
Polling is being done mostly by private research groups. Political parties do not have their own polling organizations, although the ruling Congress Party is known to use the services of the country's Intelligence Bureau to assess its chances as well as monitor its opponents. A former Congress Party minister now in the opposition said that Intelligence Bureau reports also aided in determining election dates. 
The growth of polling in a country of more than 810 million people living in sharply different regions and cultures, speaking more than a dozen major languages and hundreds of local dialects, raises questions about how accuracte opinion samples can be in reflecting a common Indian view. ''There are fairly major problems here,'' Prannoy Roy, India's leading poll taker and analyst of political statistics, acknowledged in an interview this week.
The findings of polls made for two influential news magazines, India Today and Sunday, were released last weekend. Both showed the Congress Party of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi losing its majority in a 545-seat Parliament, though by differing margins. Both indicated that Mr. Gandhi would have to build a coalition of some kind to remain in power. An Indian Prime Minister is not directly elected, but chosen from the party or parties commanding a majority in the lower house of Parliament.
Mr. Roy commented on what he considers some of the essentially Indian obstacles to succesful polling. ''First, there tends to be a bias in favor of the ruling party, which has to be discounted in opinion polls,'' he said, adding that many Indian voters, the majority of whom are illiterate and rural, are apparently fearful of speaking against authority. Polling is not yet a familiar process to them, and may be mistaken for an official survey.
Some political analysts say that if this factor is taken into account, anti-Government opinions expressed in recent polls may be stronger than they appear on the surface.
Mr. Roy, who recently selected the constituencies to be included in the nationwide poll made by the private Marketing and Research Group for India Today, said that he believed that answers given to poll interviewers in India had an accuracy - or truthfulness - rate of 60 to 75 percent.
But he added that apprehension about revealing biases or what are regarded as unacceptable opinions was not uniquely Indian. He pointed to recent reports of polling skewed in the United States by white voters unwilling to admit publicly that they would vote against black candidates in mayoral and gubernatorial races.
Polling in India does encounter other problems unfamiliar to Western poll takers, according to Mr. Roy, a former adviser to the Ministry of Finance and teacher at the Delhi School of Economics who is now a member of the Policy Group research organization and a political commentator on television.
''In Hindi, or other Indian languages, there is no word for privacy,'' Mr. Roy said. ''People interviewed alone about their political preferences clam up. In groups, they don't mind talking openly about their voting behavior.'' He said that this pattern was common in talking about other personal, even intimate, concerns.
Mr. Roy said there were two ways to circumvent the Indian's unwillingness to be interviewed. One is to ask the respondent to mark a sample election ballot, an anonymous and familiar task. The other is to give in to local custom and interview people in groups.
The value of polling is not limited to election times, scholars here say. Poll results, and the analysis of electoral statistics, would go a long way in explaining to political scientists how and why Indians vote. In this use of polls, India is beginning to find its way.

HEADLINE: Europe's Changes Mean Earlier Word of Attack

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON with STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
American intelligence experts have concluded that the United States is likely to have about a month or more of warning of a full-scale Soviet attack in Europe, or far more than it previously thought, Administration officials say.
The new intelligence assessment comes as Pentagon officials are already rethinking military planning as a result of the political changes in Eastern Europe and the need to trim military spending because of the Federal budget deficit.
For years the Pentagon's basic planning document, the Defense Planning Guidance, has assumed that the West would have just 14 days' warning of a full-scale Soviet attack in Europe through monitoring Soviet troop movements by satellite and other means, military officials said.
But a new intelligence analysis indicates that the increased openness of Soviet society, Soviet cuts in conventional arms and improved American capabilities for intelligence gathering would now give the Pentagon about a month to three months of warning of a full-scale Soviet attack in Europe. 
 
Impact on Purchasing Decisions
The question of how much warning time the United States may have before an attack has an important bearing on a number of crucial military issues, including whether the Pentagon should spend billions on new planes, like the C-17 transport plane, or ships, which would take longer to move troops and supplies to Europe. In addition, it has important implications for whether the United States should depend more on reserve units, which would be mobilized in the event of an impending war.
Although Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said recently that the risk of a Soviet attack is the lowest since World War II, planning for even the remote possibility of a full-scale attack remains a central Pentagon mission.
The revised analysis, distributed throughout the Government in September, updates an earlier National Intelligence Estimate on warning of a Soviet conventional attack and reflects one of the first steps taken by the Government to adjust American national security thinking to changing conditions in Europe.
 
Disagreement on Warning
Pentagon experts disagreed, however, about the degree to which the revised warning estimate should alter military planning.
One senior Pentagon official played down the importance of the change, asserting that there was a risk that the United States might not make effective use of early indications of Soviet moves and prepare for an attack. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a couple of additional weeks of warning would not be enough to overturn basic purchasing decisions.
But other military experts said the increase in the amount of warning time was potentially significant. They said the actual warning is likely to be even greater than the month, which is the minimum of the range suggested by the new intelligence report, because of continued changes in Eastern Europe. The report reflected a consensus among the different intelligence agencies.
Experts also said the National Intelligence Officer for Warning, a Central Intelligence Agency official responsible for assessing warning time, has informed senior officials that he believes Washington would have more than 60 days' warning of Soviet preparations for full-scale war. The warning would be based on changes in the Soviet economy, mobilization of reserve units and changes in the training tempo of units.
The risk of a surprise attack, in which the Soviets would not undertake an extensive mobilization before attacking, is considered to be low because the Soviets are cutting their forces in Europe.
 
Delay in Producing Report
The changes in the intelligence estimates come as Pentagon officials have begun to redraft the planning guidance. That guidance, however, has yet to be completed even though it was scheduled to be finished by Oct. 1.
The delay in outlining new planning assumptions that could be used as a guide for budget cutting has led some military officials to complain that deliberations over budgets in future years are being carried out in a policy vacuum.
But aides to Mr. Cheney say the delay in completing the planning guidance stems from the rapid pace of change in Europe. The new planning guidance is expected to take account of Soviet cuts in their forces in Europe that would be made under an emerging conventional arms agreement by outlining changed assumptions about the rate at which the United States would then need to reinforce its units in Europe if war was near.
The question of how much warning the United States might have of a full-scale attack has been debated within the Pentagon for years.
For years the planning guidance has outlined a scenario in which a full-scale conflict would begin with a Soviet attack on Iran, which would be intended to extend the Soviet military reach to the Persian Gulf. That would be followed by an attack on central Europe. Under the planning scenario, the West would have 14 days of warning of the conflict, said Pentagon officials, who asked not be identified.
Dov S. Zakheim, a senior Pentagon official during the Reagan Administration who oversaw the preparation of the planning guidance, said some top military officials questioned the plausibilty of the planning scenario.
 
'Add Some Realism'
''An effort was made during the Reagan Administration to add some realism to the scenario,'' Mr. Zakheim said, adding that senior officials questioned the realism of the planning assumptions ''in terms of both warning time and the way in which the purported conflict began.''
Mr. Zakheim asserted that the effort to reform the military guidance foundered because it undermined major assumptions for some purchasing plans.
The issue of strategic warning came up again when the Bush Administration conducted its review of military policy this spring.
Robert B. Costello, then the Assistant Defense Secretary for Production and Logistics, pushed for a reassessment of warning time.
''It is substantially longer than assumed. We probably have months instead of weeks,'' he said in an interview this week.
Mr. Costello, who left the Pentagon in May, said that there was strong resistance to adopting new warning assumptions, which would call existing Pentagon plans into question. ''I fought like hell to get one sentence in there saying that warning time was an important issue and was not well defined,'' Mr. Costello said.
 
Exaggeration or Realistic
A senior Pentagon planner, however, asserted that Mr. Costello was exaggerating the significance of the changes in warning to buttress his case for canceling the multibillion program to produce the C-17 transport plane. The planner said other factors, like the level of Soviet forces in Europe, were more important considerations in American military planning than warning time.
Another Pentagon expert, who discussed the warning issue on the condition that he not to be identified, said the assumption of 14 days of warning of full-scale attack was a ''plausible answer in the 1970's.''
''It probably remained a plausible answer as we worked our way into the 1980's. But things began to change on both sides,'' he said, noting the effects of the Reagan Administration arms buildup and political changes in Eastern Europe.
This official argued that the Pentagon needs to be prudent in revising its military plans in case the changes by the Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev fail, leading to a reversal of Soviet policies. He also noted the difficulty that Pentagon planners have in grappling with the fast pace of changes in Eastern Europe.
''This is seen as chapter one,'' this official said of the new warning estimate. ''This story is not over.'' But Mr. Zakheim, the former Pentagon official, said the Pentagon needs to update its planning guidance despite the uncertainities. ''If the Defense Guidance is not changed materially from past few years, it will be absolutely useless to Cheney,'' he said.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST;
Scholars Say Veneer of Nonchalance Masks Worry on German Unification

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Experts at American universities say anxiety about the prospect of German reunification is widespread in Europe and the United States despite declarations by Western leaders that they are unconcerned and that the issue should be resolved by the Germans themselves.
Reached while visiting Munich, Fritz Stern, a Columbia University professor who is an authority on Germany, said ''there is concern in Europe'' despite the ''official statements from Western leaders saying they are not worried.''
Mr. Stern, the Seth Low Professor of History at Columbia, said he believed that ''an early reunification is extremely unlikely, for any number of reasons.''
''The only possibility, I would say, would be that if the magnificent and disciplined spontaneity of the East Germans gets out of hand, so to speak, and forces a decision,'' he said. ''If that occurs, then one doesn't know. Then everything's up for grabs.'' 
''At the moment, I think there is puzzlement and reluctance, even in Bonn'' about reunification, he said. ''I hope it is not ever going to happen without very careful negotiations with the four Allied powers'' - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
 
Neighbors Remember the Past
''What I'm concerned about right now is that when Germans start thinking about a future of greatness, their neighbors begin to think about the past,'' he went on. ''This has disturbing psychological implications.''
''On the other hand,'' he said, ''one ought not to forget that the circumstances in which a united Germany would find itself,'' say, at the beginning of the 21st century, ''would be very different from the conditions that existed in 1900.'' Then, he said, ''Germany faced a nonintegrated Europe, and its power was greater than that of any of its neighbors.''
Speaking from California, Gordon A. Craig, an expert on Germany and a former president of the American Historical Association, said he found ''a good deal'' of concern in the United States, as well as Europe, about reunification - concern that he said ''is offset by our admiration of the progress that democracy has made in West Germany, which is undeniable.'' Just an Enlarged West Germany? Professor Craig, who is retired from Stanford University, said, ''I don't think reunification can be avoided in the long run.'' He observed that some commentators, including Vice President Dan Quayle, ''have indicated that they believe it would be fine because a reunified Germany would be simply an enlarged German Federal Republic.''
''Other people, including myself, would consider that a singularly incautious statement,'' Professor Craig said. He noted that other analysts, including Henry A. Kissinger, have said ''they believed reunification was inevitable, but nevertheless indicated that they hoped it could be done, if it must be done, under certain restraints and not too fast, and without destroying the balance of power in Europe, which has been based, after all, on a divided Germany and has endured and given peace for over 40 years.''
Professor Craig, whose books include ''The Germans'' and ''The End of Prussia,'' suggested that the negative feelings were a growing undercurrent in the United States. He added, ''I was surprised to find in the San Francisco Chronicle a cartoon showing Adolf Hitler wearing a label saying 'Reunification.'''
The professor rejected that linkage, saying, ''We have never had any occasion to fear a sudden flare-up of the kind of nationalism'' represented by Nazism, ''or a return of an Adolf Hitler and that sort of thing.'''
 
Fear of Shift in German Thinking
But he raised questions about the thinking and politics of a reunited Germany, saying ''There is no doubt in my mind that a nation of 80 million people, united under one government, will sooner or later begin to think differently than a divided Germany of 57 million on one side and 17 million on the other.''
''How differently they will think, we don't know,'' he added. But he said there was likely to be a greater emphasis on the view that ''we Germans are a nation in the middle of Europe with our own interests, and we are not a Western nation.'''
Professor Craig, an emeritus J. E. Wallace Sterling Professor of Humanities at Stanford, added, ''It would be interesting to speculate on what the composition'' of the parliament ''would be in a new united Germany, how many new parties there would be, and what the strength of the pro-Western democratic parties would be compared with the others.''
William E. Griffith, the Ford Professor of Political Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a specialist on contemporary European history, said he felt ''there is more anxiety'' about the prospect of reunification ''in private among non-German West European and American elites than has been publically stated.''
 
Changes Wrought by Defeat
But Professor Griffith, an official of the American Embassy in Bonn in 1985 and 1986, said, ''The governments of the West are - quite correctly, in my view - supporting the concept of German unity, assuming that the East and West Germans want it.''
''The polls show that West European and American mass public opinion generally seems to endorse this,'' he said, ''and I personally think the fears of these elites are incorrect.''
He pointed to changes wrought in both Germanies by the shock of the German defeat in World War II. ''The Germans have learned the same lesson that the French learned at Waterloo,'' he said, ''that nothing fails like total failure.''
Professor Charles S. Maier of the Harvard University history department, whose books include ''The Unmasterable Past: History, Holocaust and German National Identity,'' said ''One reason you haven't heard more expressions of alarm'' about the prospect of a reunited Germany is that officially the Allied Powers ''never were opposed to the idea of reunification.''
''Indeed, they envisaged it as part of postwar development,'' he said, ''and if in 1945-46 the four powers were committed in theory to reunification, it's hard 40 years later for them to change their minds.''
 
'1989 Is Not 1939'
Another reason that more worry has not been aired, said Professor Maier, who specializes in 20th-century European history, is that ''1989 is not 1939: the power relations in the world in which a reunited Germany might one day reappear would not permit Germany that same drive for hegemony that it earlier demonstrated.''
He said that he and like-minded analysts ''who are relatively accepting of German reunification'' feel that way ''because we see it within a framework of many sorts of cross-cutting guarantees and economic connections among the European states.''
''Whether it's West Germany or reunited Germany, one faces a country with an extraordinary amount of economic muscle,'' Professor Maier said, ''and it will not always be pleasant dealing with a power to which one becomes economically beholden. But I don't see substantive danger.''
''I don't rule out that there could be a revival of an unpleasant nationalism'' in a reunited Germany, he continued. ''But the West German republic has demonstrated essentially 40 years of decent democratic behavior.'' Referring to West Germans below the ages of 35 or 40, he said ''they may eventually want a reunited Germany, but this generation of Germans is a European generation, far more than any of the earlier generations were; they don't want to lose that.''
 
Wanting to Be 'Good Europeans'
Joseph Rothschild, the Class of 1919 Professor of Political Science at Columbia University and a specialist in East Central Europe, said he did not believe the East Germans ''would want to or would be capable of reversing'' what he called the eagerness of ''the West German public to be deemed good Europeans and to participate in the further integration of the European Community.''
Andrei S. Markovits, a Professor of Political Science at Boston University and the author of ''The Politics of the West German Trade Unions,'' said, ''My head says there's nothing to worry about'' in the prospect of reunification. ''It says very clearly that the Federal Republic has become one of the most stable, reliable, liberal democracies.''
But, he added, ''My heart tells me the track record was actually pretty bad'' earlier, with ''the Germans being mainly responsible for three major wars'' in less than 75 years - the Franco-Prussian War and the two World Wars.
He said he felt some anxiety that in ''a worst-case scenario,'' the world might witness the rise of a ''nationalist, expansionist, dominating, potentially remilitarized Germany that will completely upset the balance of power.'' But he said that a best-case scenario was more likely, in which Germans eventually would become ''the vanguard in establishing liberal democracies all over over Eastern Europe.''

In Moscow, Support for Pole Is Moral but Not Financial

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Poland's Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, said today that he had achieved ''complete unanimity'' with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on key issues of European security, but he evidently won no immediate help from the Kremlin in dealing with his economic crisis.
At a news conference tonight, the Solidarity Prime Minister could cite no progress on a number of economic issues that he raised with Soviet officials, including increasing deliveries of Soviet oil and gas, cutting the share Poland pays for the upkeep of Soviet troops on its soil, postponing repayment of the country's large debt to Moscow and compensating Poles deported to the Soviet Union during and after World War II.
''I would ask you to understand that we can hardly expect that in one or two days we can solve all those issues,'' Mr. Mazowiecki told reporters. 
 
Katyn Massacre an Issue
Moscow has also withheld, so far, one concession that would allow him to return home in triumph, a change of official position on the massacre of thousands of Polish officers in the Katyn Forest during World War II.
The Soviet position, currently under review by an official commission, is that the crime was committed by Nazis in 1941 and not, as the Poles and Western historians contend, by Soviet troops acting on orders from Stalin in 1940.
Mr. Mazowiecki is to visit Katyn on Sunday, and the possibility remains that the Soviets will use the occasion to signal a change of position.
Mr. Mazowiecki seemed buoyed by his Moscow visit, which has confirmed for Poland and its neighbors that a Government led by non-Communists can have a cordial, even blossoming relationship with Moscow.
The leaders agreed heartily on maintaining the postwar borders in Europe, and Mr. Mazowiecki said he would support a statement by the four major victorious allies in the European theater of World War II - the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union -reaffirming the current boundaries as inviolable. ''Respect for the existing borders in Europe is a guarantee of stability,'' he said, adding that he and the Soviet leaders were in ''complete unanimity'' on such questions.
 
Longtime Taboos Discussed
The meeting itself, between the first non-Communist Government leader in the Eastern bloc and the Soviet leader, would have been unthinkable a year ago, and many of the subjects on the agenda were also longtime taboos.
It was clear that the most difficult issues were economic, with Poland suffering from huge foreign debts and long-range fuel shortages, but Moscow in poor condition to help.
The Poles have asked Moscow to increase natural gas deliveries in the next five years from 40 billion cubic meters to 50 billion, but Mr. Mazoweicki said tonight that deliveries were to continue at the same level. Moreover, the Poles are to move toward paying in hard currency, rather than in the easier currency of Polish-built machinery.
Mr. Mazowiecki said that he did not question the presence of 40,000 Soviet troops in Poland but that he did ask the Soviet Union to review Poland's payments for their upkeep, receiving a promise of study but no clear commitment.
Mr. Mazowiecki has also met with Poles living in the Soviet union, and in talks with Soviet officials he offered to send Polish language teachers to help them preserve their heritage.

HEADLINE: CLAMOR IN THE EAST;
Japan Will Help Poland and Hungary

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Responding to appeals from the Bush Administration and European nations, Japan has announced that it would provide $150 million in loans to Poland as an initial step to help both Poland and eventually Hungary deal with their financial crises and break loose from the Soviet bloc.
Japanese officials said the initial sum would likely be followed by more for emergency food aid and technical assistance for both Poland and Hungary, plus a ''fairly impressive'' sum of money for economic development for Poland and Hungary once they work out some of their financial problems.
In making the announcement on Friday, officials in the Government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said the money for Poland, while only a fraction of what is being raised in the United States and Europe, was considerably higher than the Foreign Ministy had expected to provide only a month ago.
 
Widening Scope of Aid
The recent dramatic opening of governments in Eastern Europe was said by the officials to have spurred them to widen the traditional scope of Japan's foreign assistance, until now generally geared to poor countries in Asia and Africa. 
Aides to Mr. Kaifu say also that Mr. Kaifu would like to visit Poland and Hungary in January to strengthen his credentials as a statesman, and that the announcement on the aid was timed to coincide with such a trip. Mr. Kaifu said recently that support for Eastern Europe was ''increasingly important for Japan.''
Japanese officials say Tokyo has moved cautiously in aiding Poland and Hungary because of budget constraints, charges of waste and fraud in its foreign aid programs, and the belief by many officials that Japanese foreign aid should be restricted to the world's poorest countries.
Some officials said that it was extremely difficult to persuade the Finance Ministry to release even the $150 million for Poland, and that one condition for its release was that it would be given in the form of low-cost loans rather than outright grants.
 
Conditions Set for Poland
Japanese officials also said the loans would be granted on the condition that Poland works out a debt rescheduling and adjustment plan with international agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund.
Tokyo has provided only nominal economic assistance over the years to countries in the Soviet bloc, except for loans to spur Japanese exports to those countries. For example, more than a billion dollars in loans were granted to Poland from the 1970's to increase, but these are now in arrears.
Japanese officials said the repayment of these would have to be rescheduled before new loans could be authorized beyond the $150 million announced today.
The $150 million is to take the form of low-interest credits for the purchase of commodities, not necessarily from Japan, with the ultimate purpose to help Poland stabilize the exchange rate of its currency, the zloty.
Poland has asked for the establishment of a $1 billion fund to set up a single legal exchange rate for the zloty, which is now sold for dollars on the black market at nearly 10 times the official exchange rate. The fund would buy and sell currencies to establish the value of the zloty as somewhere between the official rate and the black market rate.
 
More Aid Under Study
Japanese officials said they could provide no figures on the amount of emergency food aid and technical assistance for Poland, but some news reports in Japan suggest this money would be in the range of $40 million.
The Japan Economic Journal, a leading newspaper, said Japan was considering an addition $40 million package for Poland and Hungary to help it adjust from a state-controlled and state-owned economy to a free-enterprise economy.
Some officials say the Japanese aid could provide an incentive for Japan's private businesses to increase their trade and investment in Eastern Europe, although businessmen say they are wary because of the poor history of repayment on investments.
According to the Japan Economic Journal, trade between Japan and eight Eastern European countries was only 0.4 percent of Japan's total $452 billion trade in 1988. It said further that Japanese companies have only 32 joint ventures in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, compared with more than 3,000 joint ventures with other western nations.
A Japanese automobile company is considering a project to produce passenger cars, the newspaper said, but is mindful of past difficulties in setting up similar projects in other Eastern European countries, including a stalled project by Suzuki to build a passenger car plant in Hungary.

HEADLINE: Farewells and On to Moscow for Younger Set

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Aeroflot flights from here to Moscow were serving a younger-than-usual clientele this week, as dozens of Soviet teen-agers slung backpacks over faded denim jackets and bid farewell to the educational, economic and emotional realities of the United States.
While Soviet visits are hardly remarkable in an age when flights from Moscow are routinely full, American educators and Government officials believe the sheer number of Soviet high school and college students coming here - 700 this academic year, and as many as 1,500 next year, compared to fewer than 20 in 1986 - represent a fundamental shift in Soviet priorities.
Where once Soviet officials used the limited academic exchange slots for postdoctoral physicists, chemists and engineers, hoping to transplant Western scientific skills, they now use the vastly expanded exchange opportunities to send lawyers, sociologists and high school and college students. The goal, American officials believe, is to transplant less quantifiable skills: independent thinking, motivation, risk-taking and choice-making. 
 
'To Make Up for Lost Time'
''They are trying to internationalize themselves in a hurry. If they are going to enter the modern information stream, they are going to need people who've had some outside experience,'' said Alan Kasoff, who heads IREX, which for three decades has handled exchanges of Soviet and American scholars. ''They're trying to make up for lost time,'' he added.
''There is an awareness at the highest levels of the Soviet educational leadership that there are gaps in Soviet training that need to be dealt with now,'' said Dan Davidson, an official of the American Council of Teachers of Russian who heads the United States-Soviet High School Academic Partnership Program, which began last year under the auspices of an agreement signed by President Reagan and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow in 1988.
''They need developmental work on how to read critically and think independently,'' Mr. Davidson added. ''There is great admiration there for the way Americans are motivated, the way they go to work on their own.''
Of the 900 students coming to the United States on exchanges this year, 700 are in high school and are staying for about a month each, and 200 are undergraduates staying for either a semester or, in most cases, a full academic year. Several Soviet students have also matriculated in undergraduate degree programs at American universities.
 
U.S. Behind in Math and Sciences
Soviet admiration of American education, Mr. Davidson and other specialists agree, is not unalloyed. Many of the Soviet college and high school students who arrive here find their American counterparts two, three or even four years behind them in math and the sciences.
But what American students lack in depth of knowledge is balanced, Soviet exchange students and teachers said, by their ability to explore different fields and put their knowledge to practical use.
The American students' comparative freedom to explore academic alternatives was particularly alien and enticing for students brought up with a Soviet education, where the educational authorities, parents, or both, play a sometimes heavy-handed role in a student's academic career.
''Look at what's happenned in the social sciences over there,'' Ray Benson, head of the American Collegiate Consortium for Academic Exchange, said. ''The whole bunch of cant-oriented social sciences are out. A whole glossary of terms is meaningless now.'' Mr. Benson in the mid-1980's served as midwife for academic and cultural exchanges as a top official at the United States Embassy in Moscow.
 
Supervises the Exchange
This consortium, in its second year of operations, is supervising the exchange of 63 Soviet college students, about a third of the total number of Soviet undergraduates who are studying here this year.
As a result of the rapid changes in fields like history and sociology, Mr. Benson said, a whole bunch of children are changing majors in midstream. ''They find interesting the opportunity our students have to do that. They are intrigued by the freedom with which we do it, the ease with which we do it, the lack of guilt and the encouragement from parents.''
Katya Dunina, a 16-year-old Soviet student who was returning home after four weeks as a student here, said, ''You have more discussions in your lessons here.'' As she moved her luggage closer to the Aeroflot baggage counter, she said, ''In our classes, the conversations take place between the teacher and a single student at a time.''
Miss Dunina and 11 other Soviet students at the Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School in Maryland were among 700 who are coming to 50 American high schools this academic year, living with students' families, visiting American shopping malls, taking multiple-choice tests and living the multiple-choice lives of their middle- and upper-middle-class host families.
 
Living With Soviet Families
In the year, a like number of American students from the host schools will spend a month living with Soviet families in Moscow, Leningrad, Kiev and other Soviet cities.
But while Soviet educational officials are trying to equip the next generation for a society of choices and changes, their American counterparts are trying to adjust to the ever-changing realities of an academic exchange program whose growth and expansion is presenting unforeseen difficulties, sometimes giving the American partners a crash course in new and old quirks of Soviet life.
For one thing, now that Soviet universities can arrange their own exchange programs independent of the Ministry of Education - and, in some cases, can earn coveted hard currency in doing so - they are somewhat more reluctant to commit the necessary apartments, dormitory beds, and class space to the traditional exchanges.
And, on the American side, the huge backlog of visa applications at the United States Embassy and the United States Government's unbending requirement that a 16-year-old student undergo the same complicated clearances as a Soviet military officer, is making it diffcult to get Soviet students here. Last week, students from Odessa had to postpone their visit indefinitely when their visas could not be obtained before the date of their flight.
 
Costly Dental Treatment
Some American participants in the exchanges have also been surprised by the hidden agendas of the visiting Soviet students.
For instance, Mr. Benson related, college officials at Colgate University, Swarthmore College and other schools in his consortium were caught by surprise when students arrived with dental problems requiring root-canal treatment - with bills up to $1,500 going to the colleges.
''This year, again, there were some immediate complaints about teeth,'' Mr. Benson said. ''But the listeners were a little more savvy. The institutions faced them down just a little bit, and asked them to wait and see if the pain went away.''

HEADLINE: Andrew Young Going Afield to Run for Governor

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta is aggressively traveling the state these days, buttonholing all who will listen to his plans for a run at the Governor's mansion in 1990.
The main premise of Mr. Young's campaign is nonracial and remains what it has been since January, when he first hinted he might be a candidate: his ability to bring some of the same economic development to the rest of Georgia as he has helped bring to Atlanta.
But the underlying message is similar to that conveyed by L. Douglas Wilder in his successful gubernatorial campaign in Virginia: here is a pragmatic and experienced black politician who is able and nonthreatening.
''I don't know of a black candidate for any office beyond a predominantly black district, with the exception of Jesse Jackson, who has run and accelerated his blackness,'' said Stoney Cooks, a longtime confidant of Mr. Young's who has run several campaigns here and is now a consultant to the gubernatorial campaign. ''You stress qualifications and experience and, as in Wilder's case, you make the race issue difficult to raise.'' 
 
Seeking Broader Support
So aggressive is Mr. Young's quest that last week the 57-year-old Mayor traveled to a nearby roadhouse known for its jukebox stocked with country music classics and two songs with ''nigger'' in their titles. The restaurant is in Marietta in Cobb County, one of Atlanta's populous northern suburbs whose politics are heavily influenced by white, conservative blue-collar voters. It has voted heavily for Republican Presidential candidates in recent elections.
It is an area, a resident said, where ''our necks aren't exactly fire-engine red - just a little pink.''
Publicity about the visit to the restaurant prompted the owner, a supporter of Mr. Young, to remove the two songs temporarily and limit the gathering to invited guests to avoid any embarrassment for the Mayor of Atlanta.
But Mr. Young, who had insisted on that location, did not arrive wearing his sensitivities on his sleeve. Instead he brought two records, a Ray Charles song and a Hank Williams Jr. song, as possible replacements, and quietly made his point.
''If I want to be governor, I have to be governor for them too,'' Mr. Young said of restaurant customers who might not be offended by the two original song titles. ''I'll go anywhere to talk to anybody about the future of Georgia.''
Some black figures in the state, like the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, have warned Mayor Young that blacks might resent his trolling for white votes in places like the Marietta restaurant. They say that it could weaken his support among a group that represents nearly 30 percent of the registered voters and traditionally accounts for about 40 percent in the Democratic primary.
Campaign strategists are banking on nearly solid support from blacks to guarantee that the Mayor, who was President Jimmy Carter's chief representative to the United Nations and who represented Atlanta in Congress, will emerge from what is now a four-person Democratic field and at least advance to a runoff.
 
'A Tough Row to Hoe'
''He has a tough row to hoe,'' Mr. Lowery said. ''I think most black voters will understand that he has to compromise and go to a redneck bar, but if he compromises on principle he will be on shaky ground.''
When Mr. Young hands over the city government to Maynard H. Jackson in January after serving two terms, he will leave behind an eight-year record boasting sustained growth of the city's economy. While many criticize him, saying he did not spread the effects of that prosperity broadly enough, others say his leadership has created a stable environment for development that will pay future dividends.
Business leaders in the city praise him for ''bringing us all together'' and say his celebrity in national and international circles has given them an edge in the competition to attract business and investment to the city.
For his part, Mr. Young talks of the broad network of acquaintances and contacts that he says have often made the difference in the city's ability to compete. He cites Atlanta's new skyscrapers, noting that they brought jobs and did much to help the downtown compete the growing suburbs.
And he is credited with other accomplishments: new mass transit links from downtown Atlanta to the airport, a gleaming reincarnation of Underground Atlanta as a tourist attraction, plans for a domed stadium, attracting the 1988 Democratic National Convention and an international campaign to bring the 1992 summer Olympics here.
 
Help From Fellow Carter Alumni
As he enters the race for governor, Mr. Young is trumpeting his strong backing from the city's business establishment. His campaign chairman is Griffin B. Bell, the Attorney General under Mr. Carter, who is an important partner in the city's most prominent law firm. Terry Adamson, a Carter-era assistant to Mr. Bell who is supporting Mr. Young, said the presence of powerful white leaders like Mr. Bell is not merely symbolic.
''They are willing to go a step further than the routine for Andy because they believe in him,'' he said.
More than a year before the election, Mr. Young has already raised $600,000 and few people expect that he will have any trouble raising the estimated $4 million to $5 million he will need in a statewide race.
For his campaign manager Mr. Young has reached out to former Mayor Hobby Stripling of Vienna, Ga., a former president of the Georgia Municipal Association, which represents 457 cities in the state.
A poll taken earlier this month showed that Mr. Young had a higher approval rating than any other announced Democratic candidate. Thirty-eight percent of the 758 Georgians polled by The Atlanta Journal and Constitution just before the Virginia gubernatorial vote gave Mr. Young a favorable rating. Lieut. Gov. Zell Miller was close behind with a 30 percent approval rate, while State Senator Roy Barnes and State Representative Lauren McDonald got approval ratings of 4 percent. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.
His associate Mr. Cooks, shying away from labeling Mr. Young a front-runner, said the poll could reflect a ''Wilder effect,'' in which white voters inflate a black candidate's acutal support because they are reluctant to admit to poll takers that they would not vote for a black.
Charles Gentry, a farmer who owns a great deal of land in Mill Haven, near Savannah, said there are still white Georgians who identify Mr. Young more as an aide to the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. than as a former Congressman, United Nations delegate, big-city Mayor and pragmatic Democrat who has often risked offending black voters.
''The association with Martin Luther King will make it so some whites would never consider voting for him,'' said Mr. Gentry, who is white. ''But here is a guy who they give parades for when he goes to foreign countries, and if he can bring that kind of recognition to Georgia, others won't even see his color.''
Like Mr. Wilder, Mr. Young faces white opposition that is conservative and is likely to highlight his liberal positions. But Mr. Stripling believes that Mr. Young will surprise many white voters by appearing ''not as a wild-eyed liberal'' but as someone who understands their concerns. ''The civil rights movement is part of his life and we won't diminish that,'' Mr. Stripling said. ''But our strength is to show him as he is and not try to deny that he is something that he is not.''
 
Conservative Stands
Nevertheless, there are signs that Mr. Young is taking steps to present himself more conservatively than usual. He was recently photographed on a police pistol range with the new semi-automatic pistols that he and others advocated for officers, and in campaign appearances he talks about what he has done to curb crime in Atlanta and his support for new prisons.
He has stood firm in his support of abortion rights. But he recently appeared to soften his longtime opposition to Georgia's death penalty. He suggested that he would not try to change the law, although he still believes the death penalty does not deter crime.
Mr. Lowery said such statements might hurt Mr. Young among black voters. ''For many the death penalty remains the most racist element of our criminal justice system,'' he said, ''and it remains to be seen how black voters who have not really been as vocal on this issue as some black leaders will react.''

HEADLINE: Salo W. Baron, 94, Scholar of Jewish History, Dies

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
Prof. Salo Wittmayer Baron, who was recognized as one of the century's great historical scholars for his sweeping multivolume history of the Jews, died of congestive heart failure early yesterday at his home in Manhattan. He was 94 years old.
''He was undoubtedly the greatest Jewish historian of the 20th century,'' said Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi, a former student of Professor Baron's who now holds the Salo Wittmayer Baron Chair of Jewish History, Culture and Society at Columbia University. The chair was established in 1979 to honor the scholar, who had taught there from 1930 until his retirement in 1963. 
Arthur Hertzberg, another former student, who will officiate at Professor Baron's funeral tomorrow, said, ''He was equally at home in everything from ancient history to the modern era, and the major father of Jewish historical studies in the United States.''
On April 24, 1961, Professor Baron set the historic framework for the Israeli prosecution's case against Adolf Eichmann. In a manner both learned and passionate, he testified at the Nazi official's Jerusalem trial about anti-Semitism, European Jewry and what the Nazis had done to it.
 
Suffering, but Joy Too
Professor Baron wrote 13 works on Jewish history, many of them multivolume efforts. He edited four other books and produced hundreds of articles and addresses.
His magnum opus was ''A Social and Religious History of the Jews'' (Columbia University Press), which began as a series of lectures, turned into a three-volume overview of Jewish history published in 1937 and finally grew into a revised version, of which 18 volumes have been published.
Well into his 90's, Professor Baron labored on volume 19, and he had projected at least two more volumes carrying the account of Jewish life through 1650.
Besides his enormous learning and energy, Professor Baron brought very distinctive views to his scholarship. He inveighed against what he termed the ''lachrymose conception of Jewish history,'' sometimes identified with Heinrich Graetz, a great 19th-century Jewish historian who found the main elements of Jewish experience through the ages to be suffering and spiritual scholarship.
''Suffering is part of the destiny'' of the Jews, Professor Baron said in an interview in 1975, ''but so is repeated joy as well as ultimate redemption.''
He always fought against the view of Jewish history as ''all darkness and no light,'' Mr. Yerushalmi said. ''He labored mightily to restore balance.''
 
'Writing Social History'
Professor Baron also strove to integrate the religious dimension of Jewish history into a full picture of Jewish life and to integrate the history of Jews into the wider history of the eras and societies in which they lived.
''Salo Baron was writing social history, insisting that spiritual creativity and the political situation were all borne by a living society and its changing forms,'' Mr. Hertzberg said. ''Although he himself came from the rabbinic aristocracy, he was always sensitive to the creativity and courage of lower classes.''
Mr. Hertzberg compared Professor Baron to great 19th-century historians like Theodor Mommsen and Leopold von Ranke. ''He wrote history in the grand manner but with modern notions about what society is like and what is the matrix out of which ideas spring,'' he said.
 
Learned 20 Languages
Professor Baron was born on May 26, 1895, in Tarnow, today situated in Poland but then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His family was educated and affluent, part of the Jewish aristocracy of Galicia. His father was a banker and president of the Jewish community of 16,000.
At the Eichmann trial in 1961, Professor Baron put his case for the unprecedented character of the Holocaust in personal terms when he noted that 20,000 Jews lived in Tarnow before the war but that after Hitler, there were no more than 20. His parents and a sister were killed there.
As a child, the future scholar quickly made his talents evident, learning chess at 3, writing Hebrew poetry at 12, and adding Yiddish, Biblical and modern Hebrew, French and German to his first language, Polish. Eventually he learned 20 languages and could lecture - as he always did, without notes - in five.
In secondary schools, he was outstanding in physics and mathematics, but as his views swung between Polish nationalism, rigorous religious Orthodoxy and Zionism, he fixed on studying Jewish history as a way ''to do something for the Jewish people,'' he told an interviewer in 1982.
Not only did the young man pursue rabbinical studies - he was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Vienna in 1920 - but he earned three doctorates from the University of Vienna, in philosophy in 1917, in political science in 1922 and in law in 1923.
 
Teaching at Columbia
After teaching at the Jewish Teachers College in Vienna in 1926, he was invited by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise to teach at the Jewish Institute of Religion in New York. In 1930, he began to teach at Columbia in the newly established Miller Chair of Jewish History, Literature and Institutions.
Besides pursuing his scholarly work, Professor Baron was active in organizational efforts to maintain and strengthen the Jewish community both before and after World War II. From 1950 to 1968, he directed the Center of Israel and Jewish Studies at Columbia. He received more than a dozen honorary degrees from universities in the United States, Europe and Israel and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
In 1933, Jeannette Meisel, a graduate student in economics, consulted him about a dissertation she was writing. They married in 1934, and Jeannette Baron became a collaborator in his scholarly work.
''He and his wife, in their heyday, were a kind of partnership,'' Mr. Hertzberg recalled. ''She helped with every one of his books, and they signed a couple of monographs together. Their apartment on Claremont Avenue was a place to which everybody in Jewish life eventually came. To be part of their circle was somehow to be part of the great tradition of Jewish scholarship.'' Mrs. Baron died in 1985. Professor Baron is survived by two daughters, Shoshana Baron Tancer of Phoenix and Tobey Baron Gitelle of Manhattan; a sister, Tanya Horowitz of Pittsburgh; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Wellesley;
Sorority Applies For Recognition, Stirring a Debate

DATELINE: WELLESLEY, Mass.

 BODY:
The distinction between a ''society'' and a sorority has sharply divided students at Wellesley College, since a national sorority applied to be recognized on campus. If accepted, the Lambda Upsilon chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a predominantly black public-service sorority, would be the first national Greek society established at the 114-year-old women's college.
Alpha Kappa Alpha has applied to be ''constituted'' by the college government, a step that would allow it to use campus operations and receive student-organization funds and recognition in college publications.
Although the chapter is chartered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in nearby Cambridge, 16 of its 31 members are Wellesley students. Wellesley students have been joining the M.I.T. chapter since 1977 and have served as chapter presidents this year and last. 
After learning that the sorority would be among the organizations applying for official standing this year - and that the application might become the focus for a debate over the legitimacy of both sororities and societies on campus - students flocked to the weekly student government meeting. The debate became so heated that the issue was tabled to allow a subcommittee to examine the issue.
 
Societies Applying
The situation is further complicated by the existence of several on-campus ''societies,'' two of which are also applying for recognition this year. Tau Zeta Epsilon is an arts-oriented group that sponsors lectures and concerts, while Phi Sigma sponsors panel discussions and workshops.
Most of the societies were started when Wellesley was founded in 1875, mainly to foster intellectual discourse outside the classroom. Many have Greek-letter names, but none is affiliated with national sororities.
Jacqui Broughton, the president-elect of the M.I.T. Alpha Kappa Alpha chapter and a member of college government at Wellesley, sees the societies as ''Wellesley sororities'' and believes that if they have been officially recognized, her group should be as well.
Ms. Broughton, a senior in political science and black studies, said the sorority was listed as an organization in last year's College Government Student Handbook, as were all the societies, only three of which were officially constituted at the time. But she said members of the college government's publication committee had told her the Alpaha Kappa Alpha listing was a mistake.
Members of other campus societies are divided over whether their organizations are indeed sororities.
A member of Tau Zeta Epsilon, Heather McDevitt, a senior majoring in political science from Glens Falls, N.Y., sees Alpha Kappa Alpha's national affiliation as a ''crucial difference,'' although she supports its efforts to become recognized.
 
'Not Much of a Difference'
The president of Phi Sigma, Mary Griffin, a junior majoring in cognitive science from Little Silver, N.J., said that after talking to members of Alpa Kappa Alpha, she decided there was ''not much of a difference'' between the group and the campus societies. Both, she said, are geared toward serving the college, and Alpha Kappa Alpha specifically serves ''to uplift the black community at Wellesley.''
Ms. Broughton said she thought the debate over her group's status is a racial one.
Farhana Khera, vice president of the college government and a junior in political science and economics from Painted Post, N.Y., disagreed. It is, rather, ''the whole notion of a new society or sorority on campus,'' she said. Ms. Khera said she felt most students see societies and sororities as the same thing and have little tolerance for either. ''The whole notion of a new society or sorority'' is what bothers people, she said.
In an attempt to forestall other disputes over which organizations should be legitimately constituted on campus, the student government has instituted new guidelines. To merit official recognition, a group must open membership applications to all Wellesley students (societies currently exclude first-year students), must publicize all events and must hold at least one open meeting per semester. Existing societies now have to amend their rules to conform to these guidelines or risk being denied official standing, for which all campus organizations must apply every year.

HEADLINE: The Nuclear Industry Tries Again

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Right now, the American nuclear power industry appears headed for extinction. Every plant of the more than 100 ordered since 1973 has been canceled, and many others are approaching retirement. But reactor manufacturers say that fears of global warming - the greenhouse effect - are giving them a second chance.
Nuclear power advocates have, of course, been predicting the industry's rebirth for years. But the plans are becoming more specific, and political calculations are coming into play. Reactor builders are readying designs for a new generation of plants that, they say, will be far safer, less expensive and simpler to operate. The General Electric Company and the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, the two biggest reactor manufacturers, and General Atomic, a small company with an innovative reactor design, each received $50 million from the Department of Energy in September to work on their models. They are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to bring nuclear power back. And they are presenting the opposition with a tantalizing series of ''what-if's.''
* What if fundamental design changes made plants a hundred times safer? So safe that many elaborate safety features in today's plants - equipment that must be radiation-proof, fire-proof, tornado-proof and generally failure-proof - were not needed? 
* What if all the power and all the pumps and valves could fail, all the operators could be seized with indecision - and the plant would come through without further damage? Designers say such a plant is in their blueprints.
* What if, as designers promise, the parts that are most likely to fail were redesigned or even eliminated? If many of the parts that are trickiest to install - like earthquake-proof piping with flawless welds - were drastically reduced? What if cost overruns were the worry of the manufacturer, not the utility and its customers? Would such a reactor sell?
* What if plants that were licensed for construction were accepted by the gvernment once built, not subject to costly new requirements before completion, or after? New rules approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and now before Congress would accomplish as much, the industry's boosters say.
Even those in the industry agreed that utility companies are unlikely to buy new plants soon. ''Anyone suggests a nuclear reactor to a utility board of directors, they will send for the guy with the net, and with good reason,'' said Shelby T. Brewer, head of the nuclear division at Combustion Engineering Inc. - a reactor manufacturer that has agreed to be bought out by ABB Asea Brown Boveri Ltd.
But the manufacturers, who have been subsisting on paltry foreign sales, say they must prepare for a second nuclear age. With new equipment, new construction procedures and reformed regulation, they say, the orders will come. At Westinghouse, promotional material speaks of a new design ''restoring the domestic market.''
The reactor vendors are counting on growing environmental consciousness and growing demand for electricity. The world's choices of other power sources will be constrained by fears of air pollution and global warming brought on by the burning of coal, oil and gas. As Hans Blix, the director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations agency based in Vienna, asked, ''Are you more scared of nuclear than of adding more carbon dioxide?'' The next few years, reactor manufacturers believe, will bring electricity shortages in this country and higher power needs abroad.
Environmentalists are skeptical, suggesting that if there is a high-tech remedy for the greenhouse effect, it probably lies in more efficient light bulbs and motors, or photovoltaic cells and other new generating technologies. It is unclear what the leading technologies will be at the turn of the century, the very earliest that the first of a new generation of nuclear plants might be completed.
Environmentalists also point out that even if all the nation's electricity came from reactors, global emissions of carbon dioxide would be cut by only about 3.5 percent.
But utility executives say they would like a nuclear option; although mindful of public opposition and the huge cost overruns of the 1970's and 1980's, they are not lining up to buy. At a recent conference on nuclear power and the greenhouse effect, organized by the Institute for Resource Management, an environmental group, many experts said the revival of the industry was a realistic possibility, but that it depended heavily on public opinion.
As Alan Crane, senior associate project director at the Office of Technology Assessment put it at the conference: ''You can't just keep the utilities happy. There's a jury of 240 million people out there.'' Though polls show the public believes nuclear power will be important in the future, he said, ''Nobody would countenance one in their own backyard.''
Though some new reactor features have been tested, others exist only on paper. But the industry's basic selling point is that eight pounds of uranium can make as much energy as 6,000 tons of oil or 8,600 tons of coal. A single large reactor could supply 1.5 million households. If that energy had to come from coal, each household would aggravate the greenhouse effect by burning half a ton of coal each month. Among currently economical technologies, only hydroelectric power and perhaps wood replaced by replanting can provide electricity without worsening the greenhouse effect. But both sources are limited.
By themselves, these arguments sway few outside the nuclear community. Safety and cost, which killed off the market for the current generation of reactors, still must carry the day.
The United States invented the civilian nuclear reactor as a spin-off from the bomb. For decades, in the ''Atoms for Peace'' era, the nuclear industry had a near-messianic tone. The nation's resulting disillusionment was all the more severe. Now American manufacturers say this country can use standardization and other reforms to make nuclear power work again - at least as well as the French, Japanese and Koreans, who all prosper with American designs. ''As we see the world,'' said Bert Wolfe, vice president for nuclear services at General Electric, ''it's hard to see how you can meet the energy needs in the next century without nuclear power.''
General Electric's Simplified Boiling Water Reactor and Westinghouse's Advanced Passive 600 are dramatic departures from the reactors these companies have built before. They are smaller, simpler and more forgiving and reliable. ''Even the current reactors tolerate a lot of stupidities,'' said Mr. Blix, in an interview at the United Nations. ''The ones that will come in the 90's will tolerate even more.''
The designs for the 1990's differ in many ways, but all are only about half as large as the biggest now in service. General Atomic's plan is for even smaller reactors, which would be built in groups of up to four, with all four together only the size of a smallish plant today.
 
A Revolution in Design
 Down-sizing represents a revolution for reactor manufacturers, who, like auto makers, had long equated size with progress. For years the reactor designs grew larger because manufacturers thought the utilities could achieve economies of scale, generating more power with the same plant staff. But bigger plants took longer to build, raising costs and leaving utilities too dependent on single projects.
Utilities also found that they had overestimated power demand for the early 1980's; smaller plants, more quickly built, do not require such accurate long-range projections. Smaller reactors also make it easier to design cooling systems without mechanical pumps or the need for quick action by operators.
The other revolution in reactor concepts has been for vendors to complete their designs before they build. In the 1960's, utilities blithely broke ground on plants when only a quarter of the design was in hand, even when the plants were to be three or four times larger than any reactors already operating. ''Fast-tracking'' was the motto, with construction crews pouring foundations while engineers decided, in effect, where to put the kitchen and how many bedrooms to put upstairs. In a period of rapid inflation in building costs and high interest payments on an unfinished project, fast-tracking was meant to save money. Instead, it created confusion and raised costs, as piping ordered by one set of engineers often failed to fit equipment designed by another.
Fast-tracking was especially difficult because the first generation of reactors included scores of one-of-a-kind designs. ''We had 50 separate learning curves,'' said Victor Gilinsky, a physicist and former member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Virtually every plant was a prototype, and the experience of building one was of little help in building another. And there was no standardization in operations, either. ''It's as if the Navy had allowed every commander to design his own ship, hire his own contractor, designate his own ranks,'' said Mr. Gilinsky.
Standardization is essential to swift construction, the experts say. As Howard J. Bruschi, the director of nuclear plant programs at Westinghouse, complained, ''The French are using Westinghouse reactors, and they build them in five years. We've managed to stretch that to 14 in the United States.''
Westinghouse and General Electric are both seeking generic approval for their designs from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission by 1995. They also want one-step licensing, to replace the current process of applying for a construction permit and then, after construction is nearly done, applying again, for an operating license. Under the proposed changes, utilities could order a reactor the way a not-too-fussy homebuyer could order a house from stock plans, with only minor adjustments to conform to the particulars of a site.
The commission has already approved simplified licensing for standardized plants. Watchdog groups have complained about the potential loss of public say, so the industry wants to head off legal challenges by having Congress write the simplified procedures into law.
The new designs confront several other chronic problems of earlier nuclear reactors. Some examples:
* In case of accident, existing reactors automatically pump in water to cool the fuel. But a cooling system failure could be catastrophic. New designs by Westinghouse and General Electric depend on gravity and convection to inject cold water and remove heat.
* Existing reactors overheat quickly if cooling water flow is interrupted because they squeeze a large amount of fissionable uranium into a small space. Solution: Change the concentration of fissionable uranium in the fuel to lower the concentration of heat produced, by about 40 percent in General Electric plants and 30 percent in Westinghouse plants.
* The current plants were plagued with questions about the adequacy of welds. As a result, one $2 billion plant, Zimmer, a General Electric design in Moscow, Ohio, is being converted to coal. Westinghouse has designed a new plant with long, gently curving pipes that have half the welds of a conventional design.
* Reactors that boil water directly in the core now use pumps to circulate the water, but the stainless steel piping connected to the pumps has sometimes cracked. General Electric has designed a reactor that relies on natural convection instead of pumps to circulate water. This design also eliminates the need for large pipes to penetrate the reactor vessel below the level of the uranium core, so that if a pipe breaks, the water will not leak out.
* Reactors today have emergency diesel generators, which provide power for crucial instruments, pumps and valves in case of a blackout. But the diesels require expensive maintenance and sometimes fail in tests, requiring a plant to close while they are fixed. Westinghouse has designed a plant that it says shuts down safely, dissipating heat with water delivered by gravity, convection and other passive means - without the use of valves, pumps or instruments, and thus without emergency diesel generators.
 
The Cost Contest
 Even an industry that meets all the safety criteria still faces huge challenges - most of all, cost. With more and more states requiring their utilities to solicit bids for new power supplies, rather than simply building another generating station and charging customers, nuclear will have to compete with new, highly fuel-efficient gas- and oil-fired generators.
In extreme cases like New Hampshire's Seabrook nuclear plant, which recently took a major step toward operation, costs reached $5,400 per kilowatt of capacity. About $3,600 was for direct costs, the rest for interest payments. The Electric Power Research Institute, a utility research consortium in Palo Alto, Calif., believes that to be competitive, nuclear plants must be built for $1,500 a kilowatt in direct costs, a target that manufacturers believe they can meet. Westinghouse is convinced that its AP 600 can be built for $1,270 a kilowatt, not counting interest but including a 20 percent contingency fee.
To limit costs, the builders of nuclear plants must limit construction time. ''If we're going to be effective with nuclear power,'' said Mr. Bruschi in an interview, ''we have to demonstrate as an industry, unequivocally, that these things can be built in a reasonable amount of time.'' Westinghouse, he said, can fulfill this goal with a strategy not used since the mid-1960's: the ''turnkey'' plant. It is sold at a fixed price, so the builder bears the risk of cost overruns.
''I have been highly encouraged by conversations we've had with utilities,'' said Mr. Bruschi, ''But no single utility is going to stick its neck out. So we're willing to go forward with a turnkey plant.'' The risk might be shared, he said, among Westinghouse, an architecture and engineering firm, and other contractors.
Nuclear power opponents raise several other challenges. They question special subsidies and protections for the industry, like the Price-Anderson Act, which limits the liability of reactor operators for accidents. ''What distinguishes nuclear power in benefit to the United States, that it is deserving of such treatment?'' asked Charles Imbrecht, the chairman of the California Energy Commission.
The big reactor manufacturers, all of them divisions of larger companies, say Price-Anderson is a necessity for them to continue in the business. But Linden Blue, the vice chairman of General Atomic, said he is so convinced that his reactor could not cause damage beyond the plant boundaries that he would forswear the Price-Anderson benefits.
 
Suspect Subsidies
 Many energy experts question why the Department of Energy spends so much more to develop nuclear power than solar power or other technologies. Amory B. Lovins, a physicist and expert in electric efficiency, argues that skepticism over vendors' cost claims will persist ''until the promoters pay for that commercialization, and stop importuning the Treasury to put our money where their mouths are.'' If the nuclear companies paid all their development costs, he said, they would build no new reactors. The same funds invested in energy conservation and efficiency would save far more power, he added.
Another problem is nuclear waste. California has barred the construction of more reactors until the Federal Government demonstrates a way to dispose of waste. The Department of Energy is making little progress toward its goal of opening a repository early in the next century.
Then there are decommissioning costs, unmeasured even for plants now in operation. Also uncertain is how much of a hazard a decommissioned plant would be. As I.C. Bupp, a reactor expert at the Cambridge Energy Research Associates consulting firm, put it: ''The public expects the option to tear it down and make a baseball field. If that option isn't there, I think you're going to have one heck of a political problem.''
The industry is convinced it can meet these objections. The first new reactor, the thinking goes, will be built where others already exist, in a region with scarce coal but growing electric demand. The Southeast, including Florida, might provide a site.
Until now, the industry's greatest obstacle has been its own sorry record. But business will revive, industry executives say, when it becomes obvious that a standardized plant can be built quickly, under a licensing system that prevents challenges and changing requirements along the way.
With nuclear power in such disrepute, it may take more than just blueprints to persuade a utility to order that first new plant.As Mr. Wolfe of General Electric said, ''Someone is going to have to have faith that the system will work.''

HEADLINE: WEEK IN BUSINESS;
After 30 Years, Japan Patents Chips

BYLINE: By STEVE DODSON

 BODY:
Japan granted a patent that Texas Instruments Inc. had been seeking since 1960. The patent covers the basic semiconductor chip, which the company's researchers invented in 1958. The Tokyo decision requires all Japanese chip makers to pay royalties to Texas Instruments. Japanese chip makers have about 90 percent of the Japanese chip market and 80 percent of the United States market. Texas Instruments would not comment on the money involved, but analysts estimated that the patent rights, which are valid for 12 years, could bring in a total of $2 billion. Texas Instruments shares jumped on the news after having fallen earlier in the week when the company announced a $55 million charge against earnings and the elimination of 1,500 jobs. The company has about 50,000 employees.

 American industry won a ruling that Japanese and Taiwanese makers of telecommunications equipment were guilty of selling small-business telephone systems at unfairly low prices. The International Trade Commission, an independent Federal agency, acted on a complaint by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. The ruling clears the way for extra tariffs to be imposed on the foreign goods.

 Japan's construction industry was criticized for continuing cartel-like practices, but the top American trade official said she would not urge retaliatory measures for now. Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, issued a formal report required under the 1988 trade bill, which had special provisions aimed at trying to increase American access to Japan's $300-billion-a-year construction market. Mrs. Hills said abuses were continuing but there were enough signs of progress to warrant continued negotiations. The United States won its first significant victory on the issue last week. Ninety- nine Japanese contractors agreed to pay $32.6 million to settle accusations that they rigged bids on projects at American Navy bases in Japan.

 Durable-goods orders were down six-tenths of a percent in October. That was the fourth decline in six months and was seen as a sign that American industry is facing a sharp downturn. Some analysts said they were especially concerned by the revision in the September figure, which went from a gain of two-tenths of a percent to a decline of 1.1 percent . . . Consumer prices rose five-tenths of a percent in October, their largest advance since May. The October rise was a bit more than expected and resulted largely from sizable increases in the costs of housing and transportation.

 The Eastern strike crumbled, with the pilots' and the flight attendants' unions both deciding to return to work. They had walked out in early March in support of a strike by the machinists, who say they will remain off the job. Striking workers had been drifting back for some time, and they, along with newly hired workers, enabled Eastern to build back operations to about 75 percent of the pre-strike level. Eastern said strikers who return now would be put on a waiting list for jobs . . . The machinists who had been on strike at Boeing ended their 48-day walkout.

 Gold prices jumped to their highest level of 1989. Gold began the week around $395 an ounce but traded as high as $416 by week's end. The West German mark had strong gains against the dollar and other currencies. The dollar fell to near 1.80 marks, about where it was when the year began. In the summer the dollar had risen above 2 marks. Trading in stocks was light during the holiday week but hopes for lower interest rates caused prices to rise. The Dow Jones industrial average gained 22.89 points for the week, to close at 2,675.55. Bond prices had slight gains.

 A 6 percent stake in Avon has been acquired by Robert M. Bass, the Texas businessman. Avon's management was already under pressure from the disclosure earlier this month that a 6.9 percent stake was held by a group that includes Mary Kay Cosmetics. There was some speculation Mr. Bass was taking a long-term position in Avon in hopes of steering it toward a turnaround, much as he did with Walt Disney after buying into it in 1984. Avon announced that four fragrance lines - Oscar de la Renta, Uninhibited by Cher, Perry Ellis and Deneuve - would be sold to a unit of Sanofi of France for $210 million.

 Miscellanea. Time Inc. will sell its Scott, Foresman textbook publishing operation to Harper & Row for $455 million. Time had paid $520 million for the unit in late 1986 . . . Dun & Bradstreet will pay $333 million for Management Science America, a maker of business-related software. The share price of Management rose nearly 50 percent when the deal was announced . . . Great Northern Nekoosa's board rejected Georgia-Pacific's latest bid, which was raised to $3.8 billion, from $3.1 billion.

HEADLINE: The Struggle To Sell Tickets

BYLINE: By JOBETH MCDANIEL; JoBeth McDaniel is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles.By JOBETH McDANIEL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Fred Rosen keeps a stuffed wizard on his credenza, a gift from a business associate who applauded his seemingly magical transformation of a nearly bankrupt company into one of the largest entertainment ticketing companies in the nation.
But Mr. Rosen, chairman and chief executive of Ticketmaster, based in Los Angeles, gives less credit to wizardry than to his aggressive battle plan against the New York-based Ticketron, which until recently held a solid lock on the national computerized ticketing industry.
In seven years, Mr. Rosen has built the privately held Ticketmaster to estimated annual sales of $500 million on 25 million tickets. He projects revenues of $75 million this year. The firm accomplished this largely by taking away key clients of Ticketron, the industry pioneer, which reported sales of $415 million for 1988. 
The route to Mr. Rosen's success was a computer system that, unlike Ticketron's, could provide series ticketing and sales reports to entertainment clients. And instead of taking a passive role as seller, Ticketmaster also promoted and advertised the events it sold.
While Ticketmaster snatched away clients, Ticketron was suffering from the vicissitudes of its cash-starved parent, the Control Data Corporation. ''Ticketron was a misfit within the Control Data environment,'' said Robert Gorra, senior vice president of Ticketron. ''We really needed a new system, but Control Data decided the money would be put to better use elsewhere.''
Now Ticketron may be fighting back. Mr. Gorra says his company is installing a new system with help from its new owner, the Carlyle Group, a private merchant bank in Washington. Though Carlyle Group would not comment, several entertainment-related companies are reportedly interested in participating.
Analysts say it will be difficult for Ticketron to regain its top position. ''It would take someone with an enormous amount of cash and good technology,'' said Brian Fernandez of Brean Murphy, Foster Securities Inc. in New York.
Mr. Gorra says the two rivals are virtually neck and neck, with similar sales and revenues. ''This business is a capital drain. It costs a great deal of money, but has a low margin. That's true for Ticketmaster too, no matter what they say.''
Mr. Rosen attempted to purchase Ticketron for $20 million this fall, $4 million more than the reported cost to Carlyle. Why did Ticketron refuse? ''They hate me,'' he said.
Perhaps the reason is Mr. Rosen's tenacious calls to longstanding Ticketron clients. Or what seemed to be Ticketmaster's personal war through trade media.
''I made them out to be like ghouls from 'Night of the Living Dead,' '' said Mr. Rosen, 45. ''I believe business is a war.''
Ticketron was perceived by most as invincible, from its start in 1968 when it pioneered the computerized ticketing industry, to the early 1980's, when telephone ticketing brought a host of new competitors. Given its nationwide entrenchment, most challenges had been unsuccessful.
Mr. Rosen knew little about ticketing or entertainment when he took on a short-term project as attorney for Ticketmaster in 1982. The company was based in Scottsdale, Ariz., then and was struggling to sell computerized ticketing systems to arenas.
Mr. Rosen saw the potential in the company's system if it were sold as a service. He called the Chicago investor Jay Pritzker, who owned a small stake in the company, and persuaded him to ante up $1 million to build ''the biggest ticketing company in America.''
Mr. Pritzker recalls that he was a bit nervous, but when Mr. Rosen produced other interested investors, he decided to finance it even further. ''I decided to take a gamble and let him try to run it,'' said Mr. Pritzker. ''You never know in these situations whether they're 'turnaroundable.' But this has been a good investment.''
For Mr. Rosen, who had practiced law in New York since 1972, it was the golden chance to run his own business. ''If you're an entrepreneur at heart and you want to hear your own music, you've got to find a business that is what I call 'within the cracks,' '' he said.
Antagonism to Ticketron had been building in the entertainment and sports industries. ''They had the attitude of 'We have the system: you do it our way or else,''' Mr. Rosen said. ''I knew from talking with promoters and others in the business that Ticketron was vulnerable.''
Within the first six months of operation, Ticketmaster offices were moved to Chicago. Mr. Rosen commuted from New York, and Mr. Pritzker helped seal contracts from the Chicago White Sox and Cubs and the concert promoter JAM.
The going was difficult and the money ran out quickly. Projected costs of $5 million soared to between $12 million and $13 million. Mr. Pritzker unhappily bankrolled the balance. Promoters and arena managers were skeptical, having seen too many newcomers fade away in the presence of Ticketron.
The breakthrough came with a major arena in Los Angeles, the Forum, that had been Ticketron's first fully computerized client in 1968 when it opened. Throughout the year, Mr. Rosen had made relentless calls to Lou Baumeister, its manager, pointing out his system's advantages. He also made a bid, but felt it was hopeless.
He had another late-night flight East, but after he arrived, Mr. Baumeister called to say yes, the account was his.
Another call came a few days later. Ticketron had reneged on a 60-day cancellation clause, choosing to pull its systems from the Forum in 10 days. Ticketmaster jumped in. Employees worked around the clock to install its systems within seven days.
''I thought, 'They just gave me the marketplace,' '' Mr. Rosen recalled. ''It was a signal that they thought they could muscle people.'''
Mr. Rosen soon moved the company's headquarters to Los Angeles. Within a year, Ticketmaster had nailed the biggest promoters and the biggest venues in Los Angeles, said Steve Rennie, president of Eric Chandler Management . ''They came in like a blitzkrieg. When something like that happens, it means something's wrong with the other company. With Ticketron, the main problem was the service level.'' ''Word got around about Ticketmaster,'' said Jim Michaelian, vice president of the Grand Prix Association of Long Beach. ''From our perspective, there were distinct advantages. They're marketing people as well as service people.''
By 1985, Ticketmaster was in the black, with more than 50 percent of the Los Angeles market and offices in New York, Detroit, Seattle and Indianapolis. To Mr. Rosen's surprise, Ticketron still seemed oblivious.
''They gave us a huge opportunity,'' he said. ''There's no reason why this company should be alive today. There were 18 different ways we could have been stopped.''
Mr. Gorra said Ticketron had underestimated the threat. ''That happens when you control a marketplace; you get a little lax,'' he said. ''Ticketmaster offered attractive financial arrangements to clients. They were hungry and very, very aggressive.''
Mr. Rosen said Ticketron never understood the importance of the West Coast, where so many entertainment promoters are based. ''Had we not come here, I don't think this story would be the same,'' said Mr. Rosen. ''We used this as a springboard to expand back West to East.'' Ticketmaster has built field offices and acquired local ticketing agencies across the country, for a total of 100 market areas today. Mr. Rosen figures about a third of the company's sales growth has been through acquisition.
Each property has been expanded after purchase. For example, the New York office was losing $400,000 per month on sales of $30 million when bought six years ago. Now it has $100 million in sales with profits in excess of $2 million a year, according to Mr. Rosen. Ticketmaster expanded telephone operations: 50 to 150 operators, 90 to 300 lines.
Popular music has been important to Ticketmaster's success, accounting for nearly 70 percent of its ticket business today. And though Ticketmaster's gross ticket sales jumped by almost $100 million this year, Mr. Rosen contends that overall concert sales shrunk by 30 to 35 percent. ''There were more big-name concerts, but fewer shows over all,'' he said. The capacity and speed necessary for handling the biggest shows is mind-boggling. For the Rolling Stones tour this summer, Ticketmaster in New York sold out two Shea Stadium shows - 115,000 tickets for $3 million - within an hour and a half.
Even with such numbers, Mr. Rosen says there is only enough room for one national ticketing company. ''This is the kind of business that leads itself to be an oligopoly. Except for New York and L.A., I don't know that cities can support two ticket companies. Generally one wins and one loses.''
Ticketron is far from throwing in the towel. It has solid contracts with Broadway theaters, plus baseball and concert ticketing and most national parks reservations. Mr. Gorra expects the new owners to inject vitality and a more competitive spirit by being more involved in sports and entertainment.
''If Ticketron gets more competitive, who knows,'' said Mr. Rennie. ''If Ticketmaster gets complacent and lazy and greedy, it could happen to them.''

HEADLINE: The Big Battle Over Eyewear

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Dr. Alan H. Leventhal can remember when life was a lot easier. That was in the late 1970's, when the Federal Trade Commission said it was okay to advertise eyewear prices. Dr. Leventhal bought some lens processing equipment, advertised one-hour service for glasses and contact lenses, and waited. ''People went nutso. Our phones were ringing like crazy,'' recalled Dr. Leventhal, who owns 10 eyewear outlets in southern California.
Things are a lot harder for Dr. Leventhal now. Although he says his stores are doing $7 million in combined revenues a year, he is having to fight for those sales. He is advertising more heavily, and he is offering second pairs of glasses for $1. ''Because of the competition you have to give more away,'' Dr. Leventhal said. ''There's no question that the big chains are pulling market share.'' 
 
Money to Be Made
 Indeed, corporate America has caught on to what Dr. Leventhal recognized all along - that there is a lot of money to be made in eyeglasses. Companies as diverse as Grand Metropolitan Ltd., the United States Shoe Corporation and Sears, Roebuck & Company have jumped into the field, spawning chains of eyewear stores in malls, on Main Streets and in department stores. The Price Company, the country's largest wholesale buying club company, is offering eyeglasses at a ''very substantial discount'' to members at most of its 36 West Coast buying clubs, and expects to offer them at its 11 East Coast clubs within a year, according to Giles Bateman, Price's vice chairman.
The big chains have introduced specialty retailing techniques that have old-time optometrists reeling. One-hour service has become commonplace. So have cut-rate prices and ''two-for-one'' promotions. Although some stores expect customers to bring prescriptions from their eye doctors, many of the chains now have in-house optometrists or arrangements with doctors right next door.
And nearly all of the corporate-owned stores are supported by huge advertising and direct-mail campaigns. ''Doctors still think patients will find them, while we feel it is our job to seek customers,'' said David M. Browne, executive vice president of Precision LensCrafters, the U.S. Shoe subsidiary that pioneered the eyewear advertising blitz.
The eyewear market's allure is powerful. According to Jobson Publishing's 20/20 Optical Group, which tracks the opthalmic industry, eyewear is an $11 billion market. Since markups on frames and lenses can be as high as 250 percent, the potential for profits is enormous.
So is the potential for growth. The first wave of baby-boomers has hit middle age, when almost everyone needs vision correction. Moreover, glasses have become fashionable. Many people have several pairs to go with different outfits. Often, the frames sport designer names like Georgio Armani and Liz Claiborne, and designer price tags to match.
''Eyeglass stores are evolving into specialty boutiques that not only help people see better but help them look better,'' said Brian Smith, president of Cole Vision, the eyewear subsidiary of the Cole National Corporation.
 
The Dark Side
 But there is a dark side to eyewear retailing. For one thing, opening a full-service eyewear store is expensive. ''The cost of the equipment and of staff takes a big chunk out of what would normally fall to the bottom line in any other retailing business,'' said Marge Axelrad, editorial director of the 20/20 Optical Group.
For another, the market is highly fragmented - and some say oversubscribed. Jobson's 20/20 Group says that Grand Met's Pearle Inc. and U.S. Shoe's Precision LensCrafters, Nos. 1 and 2 in the industry, command about 10 percent of the market, with combined sales of $1.1 billion a year. The next 98 largest companies do a total of about $2 billion. The remaining $8 billion is split between anywhere from 25,000 to 30,000 small outlets.
''The proliferation of optical outlets in this country has far exceeded the increase in the population needing visual care,'' noted Dr. Clinton DeWolfe, president of Royal International Optical, the fifth largest eyewear chain. Dennis Telzrow, a retailing analyst with Eppler Guerin & Turner, is more blunt: ''In eyewear, this country is over-stored,'' he said.
The competition may get even worse. The F.T.C. is trying to overturn state laws that prohibit optometrists from working for corporations, from opening numerous offices, operating under trade names, or working in malls. If the F.T.C. succeeds, it will become easier for doctors to form their own chains, and for corporations to hire optometrists.
Many companies have already fallen on hard times. The Benson Optical Company, which until two years ago was owned by Revlon Inc., was slow to push eyewear as fashion or to advertise heavily. Many of its sales were siphoned away by Pearle and LensCrafters. In July, Benson filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws.
Other companies bailed out before fiscal disaster struck. In 1987, Quaker Oats sold its Eyelab chain to Cole National, the third largest chain. ''The business was profitable, but we simply did not have the scale to compete as a major player,'' said Ronald Bottrell, Quaker's senior manager of corporate communications. Apparently, Cole was similarly disillusioned - it is selling Eyelab to Pearle.
The remaining players face cutthroat competition. Until recently, the chains concentrated on densely populated areas where volume warranted expensive advertising campaigns, as well as the more than $100,000 that lens processing equipment can cost. To get economies of scale, many chains set up so-called ''superopticals,'' huge stores with as many as 15,000 frames on display and manufacturing equipment in the back. Others set up satellite systems, where a central lens grinding and finishing plant makes eyeglasses for 10 or more stores that are located close enough to the plant so that they can still offer same-day service.
But nowadays, with huge cities saturated with eyewear outlets, the trend is toward ''mini-superstores,'' stores that are still several times larger than a conventional eyewear store that has glasses made off premises, but that do not approach the supermarket atmosphere of the older superopticals. And the chains are putting these stores in sparsely populated areas as well as urban centers.
Accordingly, manufacturers of lens grinding equipment are offering scaled down versions for about $40,000, within economic reach of smaller stores and even private doctors. Apparently, the equipment is being snapped up. ''Our business has grown more than 400 percent in the last five, six years, and we just see more growth ahead,'' said John Blocha, president of Tulsa, Okla.-based Coburn Optical Industries, the largest manufacturer.
 
Bleaker Future
 Private optometrists face a much bleaker future, though. The American Optometric Association, and many individual doctors, insist that the chains do not provide quality eye care, but the public does not seem to agree - the private optometrist's share of eyewear sales, which was as high as 80 percent in the early 1980's, has dropped to well below 50 percent.
Most industry experts expect that in years to come only those doctors who learn to market themselves will survive as independents. ''Optometrists are finally recognizing that they are in a profession and a business at the same time,'' said Dr. Irving Bennett, a retired Florida optometrist who is chairman of the optometric association's information and data committee. ''They are no longer just playing doctor. They are making frame displays more attractive, suggesting that people put tint in their glasses, that they buy a second pair. They are learning to play in modern business terms.''
They are also joining forces for greater marketplace clout. Dr. Bennett says eye doctors in Michigan have formed a buying group in hopes of getting volume discounts from lens manufacturers and other suppliers. And in Tracy, Minn., Dr. Jack Von Bokern, an optometrist-turned-businessman, has formed America's Doctors of Optometry Inc., a for-profit membership outfit that, for an initial fee ranging from $2,000 to $4,000 and an annual cost that comes down to about $1 per household in the doctor's practice territory, handles advertising and direct mail flyers for about 150 doctors across the country.
Dr. Von Bokern, who has given up his own practice to concentrate solely on his business, has also started a consulting service to help doctors handle the business end of their practices. ''We recognize that the chains are going to continue to erode our markets, and the only way independent doctors can fight back is to act like businessmen,'' he said.
 
Strategic Shakeout
 The chains themselves are going through a strategic shakeout. Some are concentrating on superstores, others on smaller conventional stores, yet others on leased departments. A few are going the franchise route. And each has a different marketing plan. A few examples:
* Pearle Inc., with about $599 million in sales and about 1,000 stores, has a mix of franchised and owned stores, and of superstores and conventional stores. A lot of its future growth will come from franchises because ''that is the best way to capture some of the management talent out there,'' said R. Howard Stanworth, Pearle's chief executive. Pearle's future stores are likely to be mini-superstores that are nowhere near the 10,000 square foot size of many of Pearle's larger stores. ''As the market matures there are fewer and fewer places where monster stores are going to pay,'' Mr. Stanworth said. Pearle, which has been one of the most aggressive users of ''two-for-one'' and other discounting techniques, will continue to rely heavily on price promotions.
* LensCrafters, with about 330 stores and about $489 million in sales, is ''absolutely going the mini-superstore route'' from now on, said Mr. Browne, the executive vice president. He hopes to bring customers in primarily through advertising rather than price promotions. ''The customers we are after go for quality and convenience, not just price,'' Mr. Browne said. Unlike Pearle, Lenscrafters eschews franchising. ''There's not a franchise operation going today that, unless they have some form of incredible iron clad contract and full-time audit staff, can control quality,'' Mr. Browne insisted.
* Cole Vision, which Jobson Publishing at the end of September estimated at 680 stores and $311 million in sales, is moving away from free standing stores of any size, to concentrate on leased departments in Sears, Montgomery Ward and Elder Beerman, a department store chain based in Dayton, Ohio. Mr. Smith, the president, would say only that, ''We are following a strategy that we feel will give a better return.''
Only Royal International, a Dallas-based chain of 644 stores that did $105 million in revenues in the fiscal year ended March 31, continues to ''take a stab at going in all directions,'' as Dr. DeWolfe, its president, put it. Royal owns numerous conventional stores, and operates leased departments in several Montgomery-Ward outlets. And two months ago, Royal bought New Deal, a small Baltimore chain that owned three superstores. Now Dr. DeWolfe says he is studying those stores to see whether Royal should open a few superopticals of its own. ''We are willing to stick our toe in the water and see if a shark bites it off,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A New Industry Springs Up: Europe 1992

BYLINE: By RON SCHNEIDERMAN; Ron Schneiderman is a freelance writer based in Bedminster, N.J.

 BODY:
While many American businesses are still trying to figure out how to take advantage of the 12-nation European Community's move to a single market economy in 1992, others are already profiting from it.
Indeed, ''Europe 1992'' has become a business in itself - with seminars, books, market research, legal and financial services, executive search and newsletter publishing, all designed to generate new business.
''Don't wait until 1992 to triumph in the E.C.,'' proclaims a recent advertisement by Ted Turner's CNN International that suggests using CNN to reach business travelers.
Arthur D. Little Inc. and Booz-Allen Hamilton, the management and technology consultants, have noted a sharp increase in United States companies interested in entering European markets, and have specialists ready to offer advice. Malcolm H. Ross, an Arthur D. Little vice president, was relocated last year from West Germany to San Francisco to develop his company's European Community business with the United States electronics industry. 
Prudential-Bache Securities has opened a second office in Brussels, home of the Community's headquarters, to specialize in 1992 issues. KPMG Peat Marwick helps promote its international financial services by including 1992-related topics in the New Directions in Government Contracting seminars it runs with George Mason University. The accounting firm is also co-sponsoring a series of seminars with the American Electronics Association and Adapso, the computer software and services industry association.
There are plenty of books on the new European market as well, including at least 50 published by the Washington-based European Community Information Service. And the Bureau of National Affairs in Washington is offering two reports on IBM PC-compatible diskette: Europe Without Frontiers: A Lawyer's Guide ($95) and Europe 1992 Legislation ($295).
Need help setting up a European Community-based staff? Glou International, a Needham, Mass., executive search firm, announced earlier this year that it would assist companies to ''establish a beachhead'' in the Community.
''Eighteen months ago, there wasn't any interest in 1992,'' said Stephen G. Payne, president of the PA Consulting Group's North American operation. ''Now, there is significant growth in our activities.''
A London-based concern with offices in Hightstown, N.J., PA Consulting formally identified 1992 as a ''major opportunity'' with the publication in July 1988 of the first of a bimonthly series of newsletters. At the time, PA Consulting said the 1992 program would ''underpin the development of our own European strategy.''
Since then, the firm has built up a client list that includes Quaker Oats and the Commission of European Communities itself, for which it produced a study of the regional impact of the impending single market on financial services. The firm conducts market research and executive recruitment and is advising clients on market entry strategies, product development and standards. It also runs workshops for companies that are trying to anticipate the impact of 1992 changes on their business.
PA has focused on four industry sectors - defense-aerospace, telecommunications, health care and food, but it was also hired by a group of British financial institutions to study the housing finance market in Europe. It also helped an auto manufacturer develop a strategy for entering the retail financial services market in Europe by the end of 1992.
Ernst & Young, the international accounting firm, now has 30 people dedicated to European Community issues, stationed mainly in the United States, London and Brussels. To help promote its activities and qualifications, the firm has published a 34-page booklet, Europe 1992: The Single Market. In it, the firm notes that it has been retained by the European Community for advice and to produce brochures in every Community language setting out the aims, content and legislative status of all 300 regulatory changes planned.
In Britain, Ernst & Young formed Club 1992 as a forum for British chief executives to discuss common single market issues like relations with non-Community countries. The firm is organizing similar clubs in other European countries and in Japan.
Early this year, Ernst & Young began holding so-called Euro Seminars - two-day sessions tailored for individual client companies. Six have been held so far; more are planned. The company also joined Fortune magazine in surveying more than 2,000 chief executives of major corporations in the United States, Japan, the European Community and elsewhere on their impressions of the 1992 program and their own plans to deal with the proposed changes. Then, in April, Ernst & Young began publishing a four-page newsletter focusing on 1992-related European business activities.
A Washington law firm, Crowell & Moring, has teamed up with C&M International, an international trade and business consulting firm staffed primarily by economists, and Boodle Hatfield, a London law firm, to counsel United States and European companies on 1992 issues.
In May, the three firms began co-publishing a newsletter that has grown to 44 pages. It is loaded with information on legislative and policy developments affecting European and American businesses. There are also summaries of the status of the most significant Single European Market directives, and an offer of several information services, including a document service, customized research and legislative counseling.
The newsletter seems to be having an effect. ''We have been getting calls from American companies thinking about relocating in Europe,'' said Peter Teare, a Crowell & Moring lawyer and the newsletter's editor.
Mr. Teare said the newsletter was started with 1,500 names obtained from the United States Commerce Department. Sixty percent of the recipients of the first issue asked to be kept on the mailing list. But word got around and the newsletter's circulation kept growing. It now has 1,000 subscribers in both the United States and Europe with scattered mailings in Japan, Korea and Taiwan.
Studies are also big business. For $795, DRI/McGraw-Hill will send its Executive Briefing on How to Prepare for the Single European Market. Ogilvy & Mather, the ad agency, says in an ad that it has ''jumped the gun on 1992'' with a study into its implications, and will send that, along with a checklist on what marketing and advertising people should be doing now.
Frost & Sullivan, a New York-based market research organization, has worked 1992 scenarios into several of its newest studies, and produced six specific market reports in the past year - like Food Packaging Materials Market in Europe: The Implications of 1992, and The Regulation of European Communications Markets: 1992. Many of these reports are sold out of the firm's London office. Likewise, Dataquest Ltd., the London-based arm of the San Jose, Calif., electronic industry market research firm, included 1992 as a focal point in its annual semiconductor market conference in Munich.
Seminars are a popular medium for sharing expertise. The Washington-based European Community Studies Association, a group founded in 1987 to organize workshops and seminars, dedicated its inaugural conference to the European Community. About 500 people attended, with members paying $75 and nonmembers $100.
The military publisher Jane's Information Group and the American League for Exports and Security Assistance earlier this year co-sponsored Defense Planning for Europe/1992, a one-day seminar, for a $450 fee. The International Advertising Association organized 1992 - The Challenge Worldwide. Another one-day event, Europe 1992: a Practical Approach, was sponsored by the International Protocol Officers Association.
Frost & Sullivan held a two-day seminar in New York in April that drew 170 people at $895 each. A similar event is planned in March.
For many, the effort is only beginning to pay off. ''There will be more directives coming out of the E.C. after 1992 requiring ongoing legal representation for U.S. companies doing business in Europe,'' said Mr. Teare of Crowell & Moring. Anticipating more activity, the law firm is considering opening an office in Brussels.
Ernst & Young has similar expectations. ''This is a major event for many of our clients and for us,'' said Richard Mead, who coordinates the firm's 1992-related activities in New York. ''And we don't see this effort ending in 1992.''

HEADLINE: Prospects;
The Fed's Rate Dilemma

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
The consumer price index jumped 0.5 percentage points in October, indicating a 5.9 percent annual rate of inflation. The Federal Reserve Board has said it wants to keep inflation low. But with a weakening economy, its ability to stem inflation is limited. Four economists assess inflation and the Federal Reserve's next move.
 
Francis Schott
Chief economist, Equitable Life Assurance Society. 
 The underlying inflation pressure - because of wage and cost problems - is still upward. Nevertheless, the 1990 inflation rate will be 4.5 percent, the same as in 1989.
The Fed would like to assist the economy, which is slowing, yet it has to continue fighting inflation, which at 4.5 percent is still too high. The solution to the dilemma is a very gradual easing of interest rates which will continue to 1990.
The Fed funds rate will come down another quarter percentage point to 8.25 by year-end. The prime rate will be down to at least 10 percent by year-end. During the first half of next year, the Fed funds will be 7.5 and the prime will be 9.5 or even lower.
 
Pat Choate
Economist and vice president, policy analysis, TRW Inc.
The ability of the Fed to make dramatic cuts in interest rates is severely constrained. The Federal budget deficit swirls along and there is no prospect of shrinking it before 1991. This continues to give the economy a very massive Keynesian stimulus. In addition, the continuing demand for imports is bidding up import prices and the dramatic availability of credit won't help keep inflation low.
I think the Fed will stand pat on interest rates. The Fed wants to cut inflation to zero. They will keep rates where they are, and I think that's the right thing to do. Inflation is still very troubling for the economy.
 
Leif Olsen
President, Leif Olsen Associates, an economics consulting firm.
The pickup in inflation in October's numbers isn't that significant. I fully expect that the next consumer price index will show a substantially slower rate of inflation. If you average the numbers, you can't conclude that inflation is accelerating. However, October retail sales are down 1.5 percentage points, the sharpest decline in two years, and personal consumption expenditures will be down for October as well. Throughout the year it has been difficult to achieve sales gains in durable and non-durable goods without price discounting. This indicates less inflation and slower growth.
The Fed will ease the funds rate one-fourth percent between now and early December depending on how slow the employment gains are. If we get surprisingly slow employment gains, we could also get a discount rate reduction as well. The prime rate will move when the Fed moves.
 
Lacy Hunt
Chief economist, Carroll, McEntee & McGinley Inc.
The inflation rate appears to be heading above 5 percent, perhaps up to 5.5 percent for the next year. First of all, wages are accelerating and will be given a boost by the minimum wage law. Productivity growth remains poor, meaning that the wage increases will be passed on in higher prices. Unleashing 450 million consumers behind the Iron Curtain suggests that there will be upward pressure on food prices. One of the big offsets to inflation has been oil prices, but now it appears that oil prices are headed upward. Reinforcing this is the fact that gold has risen above $400 an ounce - a 10-month high - and other commodities are going up as well.
If there is going to be a further easing in interest rates by the Fed, it has to be now. The economy will be stronger in the first part of the year. This quarter's gross national product grew by 1.4 percent. But this quarter absorbed two major natural disasters and two long strikes. Long-term interest rates will be down by one percentage point next year while growth will be at a 3 percent or better rate.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE REMAKING OF EUROPE;
The U.S. Shouldn't Abdicate Leadership

BYLINE: By JOSEPH I. LIEBERMAN; Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, is a Democrat from Connecticut.

 BODY:
The startling changes sweeping across Eastern Europe have evoked two inconsistent reactions in Washington, an exhilarating sense of historic opportunity and a debilitating sense of the limits of our resources and power.
Some see a unique chance to help shape the post-cold war world for decades to come. Others conclude that we cannot afford to be leaders anymore, so we must step back and hope it all works out for the best.
I believe that it is both premature and self-destructive for us to abdicate leadership. We must use our great resources to smooth the transition of Eastern Europe from state-controlled Communism to Western-style market economies not only because it is our moral responsibility, but also because it is an unprecedented economic opportunity, for our private and public sectors. American business stands to gain a great deal by investing in the new markets of Eastern Europe. And the Federal Government can reap a peace dividend if we no longer need to spend $150 billion a year defending Europeans from other Europeans. 
Neither private profit nor public savings are possible if the evolving democracies and economies of Eastern Europe do not survive and flourish. That's why we must ''let deeds follow words,'' as Lech Walesa says.
Congress made a good start with the Poland-Hungary aid package, which will benefit the two countries by making them eligible for programs run by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank, and by encouraging the United States and other nations to reschedule Poland's debt, a move that would relieve the pressure of that country's Government.
But, as good as it is, the aid package is not enough. If we don't follow through with more immediate, imaginative and substantial assistance to all the emerging democracies in Eastern Europe, we risk doing little more than putting a new tie on a corpse, to quote Mr. Walesa again.
First, the Secretary of the Treasury should encourage the International Monetary Fund to move ahead with a stabilization plan for Poland, which is a first step before it can receive aid from the international financial institutions and Western nations.
Second, the Secretary of the Treasury should authorize a bridge loan to Poland from our Exchange Stabilization Fund as soon as possible. The Solidarity economic plan is based on the assumption that its implementation will coincide with receipt of cash from the international community. But that money is months away. Strikes and riots - with uncertain results - could erupt in Poland as the coming harsh winter sets in, if more immediate assistance is not forthcoming. A bridge loan would help bolster the Polish economy until Western money arrives. And, since there is little or no history of default for a loan of this type, it should cost American taxpayers nothing at all.
Third, we need to look for ways to help Eastern Europe that are ''genius intensive.'' We should establish the economic equivalent of the Peace Corps and send volunteers with Western-style, free-market business acumen to Eastern Europe to help with the transition from Communist economics to free markets. This Eastern European Entrepreneurial Corps - perhaps operating under the auspices of the Peace Corps organization - could include everyone from young business school graduates looking for an opportunity to remake the world, to older veterans of big and small American businesses who have the practical experience in entrepreneurship and management.
Fourth, we should establish an Eastern European Foundation that would provide direct support to small and mid-sized Eastern European businesses and entrepreneurs through grants and technical assistance. The model for the foundation is the Inter-American Foundation, a public corporation that reaches out to grass-roots businesses and cooperatives in Latin America.
Fifth, we must help the nations of Eastern Europe rebuild their economic infrastructure, much as the physical infrastructure of Western Europe had to be rebuilt after World War II. Poland has no private banking system. None of the nations of Eastern Europe have fully convertible currencies. The President should establish a blue-ribbon panel to develop a long-term strategy for Eastern Europe and to help those nations develop market economies. A leader like Paul Volcker or George Shultz, should be put in charge.
Helping Eastern Europe rebuild makes good economic sense for America. But there is more than just money at stake. For four decades we have promoted the virtues of a free and open society and economy to the Communist world. Now that our moral leadership has given birth to a new order, we cannot responsibly turn our backs on our ideological progeny. We must help. And if we do, we could see one-time adversaries grow to become very good friends.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL FINANCE;
A Potpourri of Questions From Readers

BYLINE: By Deborah Rankin

 BODY:
Below are answers to some recent questions from readers of the Personal Finance column.
Q.Our son will be a freshman in college next September, and we've saved $10,000 toward his tuition. The money is just sitting in a bank savings account, but we'd like to see it grow between now and then. Should we put it into the Magellan Fund, since it is doing so well? 
A. With all due deference to Fidelity's Magellan, which has a stellar 10-year record of 1,290 percent cumulative growth, the financial experts we queried say you should not be putting that money into the stock market since you are going to need it in less than a year.
''If you're going to need to draw on that money within the next three years, your guiding principle should be safety,'' said George Barbee, executive director of Price Waterhouse's Personal Financial Service in Waltham, Mass. ''You should put it in something with little or no risk of capital loss, such as bank certificates of deposit, Treasury bills or a money fund, and not aim for enormous capital appreciation. As long as you're earning a few percentage points above the inflation rate, you shouldn't worry.''
Margaret Welch, a certified financial planner and vice president with Alexandra Armstrong Advisers, a Washington financial planning firm, agreed. ''People tend to confuse the times when it's appropriate to go into risky rather than conservative investments,'' she said.
For long-term money - perhaps for your retirement - the stock market has historically offered much higher returns than C.D.'s or Treasury bills, Mrs. Welch said. If you are willing to ride out the inevitable ups and downs in the market cycle for a decade or so, the chances are that you will be able to cash out at a handsome profit.
But for money that you need so soon, you should turn to taxable money market funds, which are yielding about 8.3 percent; bank C.D.'s, yielding about 7.8 percent, or 6-month Treasury bills, also yielding about 7.8 percent.
Since you live in New York, you presumably are subject to relatively high state and local income taxes in addition to Federal tax. Treasury bills are exempt from state and local taxes. But you should also consider investing in a triple tax-free money fund that is exempt from all three levies. Fidelity's New York Free Money Market Fund, for one, is yielding about 5.4 percent.
 
Q. I understand that the Internal Revenue Service has changed the way you can report earnings from United States savings bonds. Can you explain what the change entails?
 
A. Yes, but first some background on the options that owners of E and EE bonds have regarding the tax treatment of their interest earnings. There are two ways of handling this income: you can either report it as it accrues each year, or you can wait until the bonds are redeemed or mature and report all the interest then.
Under the old rules, if you elected to report the interest annually, you had to continue to use that method until the bonds matured or were redeemed. But the I.R.S. will now allow you to change that election, and defer the reporting of interest, by filing a Form 3115 (Application for Change in Method of Accounting) with your Federal tax return for the year of change. There is one drawback though: You must use the deferred method for at least five years following the change.
''The new procedure makes it easier to switch, and is particularly beneficial for children who own savings bonds,'' said Sidney Kess, a New York tax lawyer and certified public accountant.
If your children are under age 14, they are now subject to the ''kiddie'' tax on unearned income. This means that their earnings from interest and dividends that exceed $1,000 are taxed at their parents' higher rates rather than their own lower rates. J. K. Lasser's Monthly Tax Service suggests switching those children to the deferred method if they are now reporting savings bond interest each year. ''The election will defer tax on the interest'' until they turn 14, at which point it will be taxed at their own lower rates, Lasser's said.
 
Q. Is it true that I can only claim the child-care credit if I report my baby sitter's Social Security number? She insists on being paid in cash, ''off the books,'' and I'm afraid she will refuse to give it to me.
 
A. As a result of new legislation, you will be unable to claim the credit (which is a maximum of $720 for one child and $1,440 for two or more) if your baby sitter balks. (Of course, you were required all along to pay the baby sitter on the books - and make all the necessary tax filings - in order to claim the credit legally.) The Family Support Act of 1988 requires that starting in 1989, parents who claim the dependent-care tax credit must divulge the names and taxpayer identification numbers of their baby sitters, nannies or child-care providers (only tax-exempt providers, like a licensed church nursery school, are excused from this new reporting requirement). The I.R.S. has even created a new form, W-10, that enables parents to obtain the necessary information from their care providers; however, the form is not filed with their income tax returns, but rather retained with their tax records.
If you participate in a dependent-care assistance program at work, which allows you to pay up to $5,000 in child-care expenses with pretax rather than after-tax dollars, you must also furnish your care giver's identification number; otherwise the salary that you have agreed to forgo and contribute to the assistance program will be transformed into taxable income.
In addition to cracking down on the illegal, but widespread, practice of paying care givers off the books, Congress made several other changes regarding the tax treatment of child care that take effect this year.
Practically speaking, it has abolished the practice of letting workers take advantage of both a dependent-care assistance program at work and the child-care credit; now, they must choose one or the other. If there is a choice, most parents will do better by participating in a dependent-care program rather than claiming the credit, according to Towers Perrin, a benefits consulting firm.
Another change in the law lowers the age of children whose care expenses get tax-favored treatment. Now, only care for youngsters aged 12 and under can be claimed; previously, children 14 and younger had qualified.
Finally, in order to claim a $2,000 dependency exemption, parents must obtain the Social Security number of any child age 2 or older, and report that number on their tax returns; previously, such information was required only for children who were 5 and over.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS FORUM: THE REMAKING OF EUROPE;
Invest at Home for Influence Abroad

BYLINE: By JEFFERY MADRICK; Jeffrey Madrick is a business correspondent for NBC and publisher of IRIS, a financial newsletter.

 BODY:
The United States is acting like a poor country when it is not one. Washington sits virtually paralyzed as the world is stunned daily by events in East Europe. Paris called a conference among its European colleagues and West Germany has already announced plans to spend billions of dollars on investment in East Germany. The Japanese will not be far behind, and some conjecture they will soon be ahead. By contrast, the leaders of the country that is still by far the richest in the world - the United States - are consumed by cutting a few billion dollars of spending from a $5 trillion economy.
Largely because of the budget deficit, inaction is ''in'' in Washington. Talk to an undersecretary of Commerce, or Treasury or Education and they say something like this: ''Why do you always want to pour money into everything? Money isn't always the answer. Let's do better with what we have.'' 
Washington's leadership occasionally shrouds this attitude in loftier principles. ''We must begin to understand that we are not the only nation in the world,'' goes the running line from both Republicans and Democrats. We can no longer be responsible for every country in the world.
How did we get here? In terms of gross national product, our economy is two and a half times the size of Japan's and five times the size of Germany's. But unlike them, we have spent more than we have, and now there's no money in the bank. As a result, we don't have the wherewithal to participate in the new alignment in Eastern Europe and we are less likely to profit from its growth.
The richest nation in the world has spent too much money on the wrong things and now it is in danger of losing out in Eastern Europe. But the United States is by no means a poor country and we should not sit on the sidelines as perestroika sweeps through the world. Money still talks, in Eastern Europe, in educating our young and in rebuilding our infrastructure. Here's an economic agenda to fit the new times and ensure that we remain a world leader.
* Government ''investment'' must be separated from Government spending in the budget deficit calculations. The Gramm-Rudman law should be either revised to reflect this or abolished. We have more leeway to spend than we believe because borrowing is not bad if it is spent in ways that will produce real economic pay-offs.
* Raise income taxes. A 28 percent top tax rate is destructive. Taxes will be raised anyway by the states and cities taking the biggest hit due to lost Federal aid. If Americans understand where the money is going, they will not be averse to tax hikes.
* The military budget can be cut significantly. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has opened the door, and recent cost-cutting proposals by the Bush Administration suggest at last that some headway is being made. Military spending in a full-employment economy, when no Keynesian fiscal push is needed, drains money away from productive investment. The problems of economic dislocations - from cutting the military budget - are exaggerated, just as they were after World War II.
* Forget tax proposals intended to spur more saving, like lower capital gains rates or deductions for individual retirement accounts. They don't work. America's saving rate has been remarkably steady, without them, until recent years. The tax system should be used to spur investment.
* End tax policies that encourage borrowing. They have made leveraged buyouts and corporate takeovers very attractive, but they are uneconomic investments, much like many tax shelters once were. As a result, needed investment funds have been wasted, and interest rates have been unecessarily pushed up.
* Stop all the protectionist threats. Protectionism is the ideology of the poor.
* Get the cost of capital down, and that mostly means lower long-term interest rates. High interest rates have been the most debilitating element in the economy for more than a decade. The cost of capital is much lower in Germany and Japan than it is here and it is reflected in the ease with which they can buy Rockefeller Center or invest in East Germany.
How do you get long-term rates down without igniting inflation? That is the phantom of our particular economic opera. The above proposals will help reduce the deficit. And as far a Treasury financing goes, it should be bunched in the short end of the market.
A narrow-minded pragmatism is ruling Washington, which some interpret as wisdom. Our leaders choose their historical lessons very selectively. But for the United States to fully participate in the restructuring of Europe, we must make our economy more vital and our businesses more competitive. These are times for bold thinking, not turning away. If the United States acts like a poor nation it can turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.

HEADLINE: ALONG FOR THE RIDE;
The Real Superpower At the Summit Will Be The Force of History

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH and Mikhail S. Gorbachev will meet each other off the coast of Malta next week at one of those rare moments when you can hear the pages of history turning - a moment when the 40-year-old arrangements of the postwar world are coming to an end and demanding redefinition. But Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will not be meeting to unfurl blueprints or draw lines on maps. The future is not theirs to define, as it was for Roosevelt, Churchill and Stalin at Yalta in 1945.
Those three met as winners of a war, as men in control of a world. Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, by contrast, meet as heirs to an uneasy peace whose foundations are dissolving - not through war but because individual Poles and Hungarians, East Germans and Czechs are no longer ready to accept the assumptions on which the cold war peace was based. These individual Poles, Germans, Hungarians and Czechs could not have played that role had not Mr. Gorbachev dared to unleash energies that might lift Communism from its torpor. In the longer term, many might argue, they also could not have succeeded without the steadfastness of the West. 
While 1989 will undoubtedly have its chapter in the history books, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev will appear in that chapter as much witnesses to the changes taking shape as masters of them. That is not to say that when Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev meet next weekend on the Soviet cruiser Slava and the American cruiser Belknap what they discuss will not have an enormous impact on Europe. It is simply to appreciate the constraints on them both.
''I don't think either of them can help but appreciate that as much as they have set in motion the forces that are now unfolding in Eastern Europe, as much as they can influence them at the margins, it is those forces which are now in the saddle, not either of them,'' said Michael J. Sandel, a political theorist at Harvard. ''The most appropriate response now is not caution or boldness - we are beyond all that - but attentiveness and appreciation. Because when history turns this fast, what we want from statesmen are not vain attempts to control events that have a momentum of their own, but that they be alive to the possibilities that these events will leave in their wake.''
That explains why the President is preparing for this summit more with questions than answers for Mr. Gorbachev. Although Mr. Bush and his advisers and Mr. Gorbachev and his advisers have already dealt extensively with one another, they will meet in Malta almost as strangers. It is not that they have changed but that circumstances in the last six months have changed them - assigned them new roles, bequeathed them new responsibilities and invested them with new aspirations. Indeed, Bush advisers say, all of this is reflected in the four main subjects on the President's agenda.
The first item is to ask Mr. Gorbachev: Who are you today?
''The President wants to get a firsthand sense from Gorbachev as to exactly what is his domestic agenda, how he plans to allocate resources in the coming years, how he plans to solve the problems he has identified, what he sees as his own prospects for success and how much time he thinks his own people will give him,'' an Administration official said.
The President is sure to ask Mr. Gorbachev to indicate the limits of Soviet tolerance for change in Eastern Europe. For instance, must Poland, Hungary and East Germany remain full members of the Warsaw Pact?
If so, could they remain members of the Warsaw Pact and yet leave the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance, the Soviet bloc's equivalent of the European Community? Will Moscow draw tighter limits around the freedom of East Germany than, say, that of Poland or Hungary?
''There is nothing like hearing from the great man himself about these issues,'' said a State Department expert on Europe. ''What we learn about his approach to the East bloc will speak volumes about his whole approach to security. This will clearly affect our own strategy and planning.''
Mr. Bush's second concern involves what he will tell Mr. Gorbachev. The most important message, Administration officials say, will be that the Soviet Union's behavior in regional conflicts like those in El Salvador, Nicaragua and Afghanistan will greatly influence its standing with the American public and with Congress - the same Congress that would have to ratify any arms control agreements. The President will also try to set a timetable for resolving issues in the conventional arms talks and the strategic arms talks, so these treaties can be completed by or near the date of the summit scheduled for this spring.
The third item on the President's mind will be the issues he doesn't want to raise. Administration officials insist that he will avoid anything that looks like an agreement being made by the superpowers over the heads of the Europeans - anything, that is, that smacks of Yalta. He will also avoid anything - winks and nods as well as words - that could indicate that the United States would tolerate a ''Chinese solution'' to unrest in Soviet republics like the Baltics.
Last, Mr. Bush may have a few surprises tucked at the bottom of his agenda, just in case Mr. Gorbachev starts pulling rabbits out of his attache case.
''I think the President should have in his back pocket a series of steps to help the Soviets economically,'' Charles William Maynes, editor of the journal Foreign Policy, argued. ''This is not charity. It is a way of helping those in the Soviet system who are doing the right thing. That is helping ourselves. Remember: Herbert Hoover sent massive food aid to Lenin which helped to save the Russian revolution in its infancy. If Hoover could help Lenin save the revolution, surely Bush could help Gorbachev save perestroika.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Gorbachev May Seek a Bush Vote of Confidence

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
IN a sense Mikhail S. Gorbachev may be seeking the impossible in his Mediterranean rendezvous with President Bush, trying to project the image of a confident leader as the Communist monolith melts in Eastern Europe.
Some analysts here say it will not be enough for him to display more of the showmanship of the great Oz. ''He must be more than reactive and show himself indispensable to this process,'' a diplomat said. 
He observed that however fresh a spirit Mr. Gorbachev sought to inspire in Communism, he hardly intended to program so great a political trauma in a single season.
''He needs this one right now,'' said another Westerner, speaking of the shipboard appointment. ''And he needs it far more than he first imagined for domestic consumption.''
The diplomat was looking beyond the meeting's basic goal of building a better personal relationship between the presidents and reassuring each other that there will be no cold war exploitation of the momentous turmoil. As important to Mr. Gorbachev, he said, is how the meeting plays to the Soviet public as another episode in the drama of Eastern Europe.
Almost lost in the graphic history of Communist subjects demonstrating by the hundreds of thousands for democracy elsewhere has been a complaint here, no bigger than a nettle at first, but increasingly defined: the issue of rescinding the Communist Party's monopoly over the nation's political, social and economic power.
 
Defending the Party
There are no throngs in the streets, but the issue is appearing more regularly on dissident agendas and has sparked some passionate defenses of the party from Mr. Gorbachev.
Using the Malta meeting somehow to define the Soviet party as clearly essential and different from the now disheveled satellite parties would be an important goal for him.
Western diplomats also sense that Mr. Gorbachev, while still admitting that the scope of Soviet economic problems is too large and internally rooted to be open to easy American aid, urgently needs a definitive signal of trust in this area from Mr. Bush.
A more positive encouragement from the President to American businesses to pursue trading with the Soviet Union would serve as a special sign that goes beyond the expected restoration of most-favored-nation trade status.
Mr. Gorbachev has made a habit of unveiling surprise initiatives as he approaches these meetings. But this time Western analysts are betting he senses that there have been enough shocks for both sides lately and that the substantive, personal trust he needs now is better courted by being unsurprising.
But the question is whether the events of Eastern Europe can be that humbling to such a kinetic, optimistic politician.
''He's been very adaptable to date,'' said one diplomat, wisely hedging all predictions about Mr. Gorbachev and the change that swirls around him.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
More and More, Prison Is America's Answer to Crime

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

 BODY:
OFFICIALS in California expect this week to open a new 1,000-bed maximum security prison at Pelican Bay in the northern part of the state and to open another 1,200-bed wing there soon afterward, increasing the capacity of the country's largest state prison system to 49,767 inmates.
The trouble is that the state already has 86,746 people in custody, and an additional 250 or so are added every week. Routinely operating at 175 percent of capacity, the California prisons are more overcrowded than most, putting two prisoners in one-person cells and stacking bunkbeds in gyms and day-rooms.
But most state prison systems are overcrowded, now more than ever. 
Drug crackdowns, a broadening of the offenses classified as felonies, the introduction of mandatory sentences and a tendency toward longer sentences in general are among the factors that this year raised the population of state and Federal prisons to its highest point in history, a total of 673,565 on June 30. That represented an increase of 46,004 prisoners, or 7.3 percent, since Jan. 1, a larger increase in six months than the prisons have ever experienced in an entire year.
As society grows impatient with crime and drugs, a prison industry that already consumes more than $13 billion a year is showing no sign of recession.
Experts agree that new prisons alone will never solve the problem. Some experiments are under way as alternatives to prison for less violent convicts. These include expanded halfway houses and supervised community service, sentencing guidelines that limit a term's maximum as well as its minimum, more attention to matching punishment to a particular crime's severity and electronic monitors, which enforce a prisoner's house arrest at home.
Some predict a time when the costs of imprisoning so many people will give taxpayers second thoughts. But that has not happened yet. While rejecting many initiatives last year, California voters overwhelmingly approved the fourth prison-bond referendum in recent years.
''It's been a complete sea change in the 80's,'' said Franklin Zimring, director of the Earl Warren Legal Institute at the University of California at Berkeley. ''We had declining imprisonment rates in the 60's and the early 70's. And now three-quarters of the states are at historic highs.''
Entire systems or individual prisons in more than three dozen states are operating under court orders aimed at limiting overcrowding or mitigating its impact on inmates.
In Connecticut, where 6 of 15 state prisons are under such court orders, a law requires the release of prisoners if the system operates at 110 percent of capacity for more than 30 consecutive days. Two weeks ago, with 8,760 prisoners, the system reached its 29th day of overcrowding, and officials scrambled to reduce the inmate population by a variety of means such as delaying transfers from local jails, or releasing some prisoners early, an unpopular measure. Connecticut has 23 prison construction projects under way to add 6,000 beds by mid-1992, said William E. Flower, a spokesman for the state Department of Correction. At that point Connecticut will still be 9,000 beds short, according to estimates.
The reasons for overcrowding in Connecticut and elsewhere are varied. Widespread drug use, followed by tougher enforcement, have led to more drug arrests and incarcerations.
''There's a little lag as more arrests make their way through the justice system,'' Mr. Flower said. ''But when one branch, the police, spends more on enforcement, pretty soon another has to pay more for imprisonment.'' In Connecticut, 26 percent of state prisoners are serving time for drug-related offenses.
Overall sentences are longer and so are minimum sentences, which are now often mandatory. Judges have less leeway in the sentences they impose and they grant probation much less frequently. In 1974, 15 percent of California's felony convictions resulted in prison terms, with probation and other forms of punishment accounting for the rest. Today, 35 percent of felony convictions lead to prison time.
Parole has greatly declined in political popularity, experts say, and courts are moving quickly to return parole violators to prison. Slightly more than one-third of California state prisoners are parole violators.
There are also new categories of felony, such as sexual abuse, which draw significant prison terms. And new degrees of aggravation in given offenses, such as carrying a gun in a house burglary, add mandatory extra years to a sentence.
When drunk driving is punished by incarceration, the time has usually been served in county jails. But in more states, a third drunk-driving charge becomes a felony, punishable by time in the state penitentiary. Convicts classified as habitual criminals can receive life terms in Alabama and other states for convictions otherwise punishable by shorter sentences.
And in a growing number of murder convictions, life terms without parole are emerging as a cheaper alternative to the death penalty, which entails many years of costly legal appeals. This means that more prisoners are serving longer terms, presenting new problems for administrators, guards and prison doctors unaccustomed to caring for aged inmates.
Some states are already creating geriatric wards for prisoners who require more medical care, protection from aggressive inmates, different diets and even architectural alterations to accommodate wheelchairs.
Professor Zimring links the trend toward tougher sanctions to the advent of the television age, which has made people more aware of specific crimes and how prosecutors and judges deal with them.
''The increased visibility of the justice system makes the political risks of being visibly lenient on convicts substantially higher than the risks of being ostentatiously tough,'' said Professor Zimring. ''In that sense judges and prosecutors may be in a tougher mood than society.''
There have been other times of rapid growth in prison populations - in the early 1900's, for instance, when passage of the White Slave Act in 1910, the Harrison Narcotic Act of 1914 and Prohibition after World War I led to many new convictions. But even as late as the mid-1930's, a few years after the passage of anti-gangster measures, Federal institutions held only 15,500 prisoners. This month the Federal prison population passed 52,750.
Early in American history, prisons were used only to house the accused until trial and the convicted until corporal punishment or execution was carried out. With the declining use of flogging and stocks came the American invention of the penitentiary - to encourage penitence while housing the convicted for longer terms of punishment, reflection and, ideally, rehabilitation.
''But rehabilitation of inmates is not a popular concept now,'' said Frank Hartman, executive director of the criminal justice program at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. ''When you say a third felony conviction gets you into prison for as long as you're breathing, the message is not one of hope for the future. Today's message is incapacitation: Lock 'em up.''

Salvador Rebels Lose Touch, But Still Show Their Strength

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR

 BODY:
WITH something approaching awe, the rebel looked at the hotel room - a double bed, a carpet, a private bath and a tiled shower. That may be standard in any motel in the United States, but it is unfathomable luxury for most Salvadorans. ''I'm from the countryside,'' the guerrilla said. ''I've never been in San Salvador before. I've never seen wealth like this.''
The teen-age rebel was part of a band that had fought its way into a wealthy neighborhood in San Salvador, one of the few times the civil war had penetrated the tight security that shields the capital's elite. The rebels' presence illustrated their strengths in the decade-old civil war, and the teen-ager's awe at his surroundings reflected the deep divisions that have fueled the conflict. 
But his admission that he had never been in the city also illustrated a weakness of the rebels: they have failed to adapt to El Salvador's new political and demographic landscape. That weakness has kept them out of touch with many Salvadorans, and it undermined their recent offensive.
While most of El Salvador still works by an agricultural clock - up at 4 A.M., in bed by 8 P.M. - it is fast becoming an urban country. About three of five Salvadorans now live and work in metropolitan San Salvador, many having been forced off the land by the war, which has claimed 70,000 lives and displaced at least 1 in 10 people. Fewer and fewer Salvadorans share the peasant background of the guerrilla army, which is composed largely of rural teen-agers led by veteran guerrillas, many with university educations.
After almost a decade of isolation in the mountains, rebel commanders appear to have lost touch with the average city dweller. When one rebel leader returned to the capital two years ago for talks with the Government, he rode through San Salvador with his head swiveling from side to side. ''I can't believe how everything has changed,'' he told a diplomat accompanying him.
 
A Narrow View
Sometimes the rebels resemble an isolated sect, with a limited flow of information. That narrow view of the world seems to have tricked them into believing they could set off an insurrection with their latest offensive. They trucked in tons of weapons, apparently supplied by Nicaragua and Cuba. But they had more guns than volunteers, and the civilians did not rise.
More than anything, it seems, most Salvadorans are fed up with the war and see it as a continuing cycle of killing and poverty. While fighting raged in the working-class district of Soyapongo this month, workers stayed at their posts in a shoe factory caught in the crossfire. Evidently they saw steady jobs as offering a better future than revolution.
El Salvador's leading Lutheran cleric, Bishop Merdardo Gomez, last week called El Salvador a ''fertile country for revolution.'' So it appears. Poverty is endemic, repression seemingly perpetual. Luxury cars skirt potholes in streets bordering acres of shantytowns. A full-time job is a dream for almost half the population.
Yet the country remains a bastion of conservative attitudes.
Roman Catholicism has taught many that suffering is the price of a better afterlife. And there are long memories of a peasant uprising in 1932 that was put down by the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 people. If Salvadorans have learned one thing, it is to remain neutral.
 
Tactical Shifts
That is not to say the fight will soon end. While the rebels did not topple the Government this month, their offensive again showed them capable of overcoming internal divisions and countering improvements in the Salvadoran Army.
The latest offensive appears to have been one more tactical shift.
For the first time, the guerrillas brought the full force of the war into the capital, the stronghold of the oligarchy, which had been isolated from most of the fighting. And it almost caused direct United States intervention. When the rebels stormed the Hotel El Salvador, 12 Green Berets inside were trapped, and President Bush dispatched a special squad, the Delta Force, to rescue them if needed. It turned out that the team was not needed, because the rebels withdrew under an agreement with the Government.
Still, the rebels did show they hold a key to the success of President Alfredo Cristiani's ambitious plan to rebuild the economy and improve Salvadorans' lives. It is now clear that his ability to do that depends on the rebels' willingness to make peace.
Earlier this month, the rebels broke off talks with the Government on the ground that the talks had done little but show the chasm separating the two sides. The Government and the rebels have since sent members to meet with President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, who wants to mediate. But each side has also made demands intended to be rejected by the other. That has left the army preparing for another rebel attack, with prospects for renewed talks dim.
''The army and the guerrillas can both claim victory'' in this month's offensive, said Ruben Zamora, a leftist politician allied with the rebels. ''And a winner doesn't negotiate.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Reluctantly, the Military Embraces New Politics and Tighter Budgets

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
BUDGET officials were working late at the Pentagon last week as the Red Army Chorus launched into its program onstage at Kennedy Center, just across the river.
In their red-trimmed uniforms, the Soviet officers began with ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' and ended with ''God Bless America.'' The performance received a standing ovation, leading one concertgoer to say that the Red Army could knock an additional $5 billion off of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's new budget by extending its tour another week.
Warming relations between Moscow and Washington, along with budget considerations, have put increasing pressure on military spending. With cuts inevitable, Mr. Cheney volunteered to wield the knife himself. 
The Defense Secretary ordered the military services to identify $180 billion in possible cuts from projected spending in the fiscal years 1992 through 1994. Advisers to Mr. Cheney said that reductions of such magnitude were likely to be the most that they would have to accept.
But even if eventual cuts are less severe than the services have been asked to plan for, Mr. Cheney's directive tacitly acknowledges that some significant cuts are nevertheless in the offing.
 
'Realistic Assumptions'
''What I've done is take a look at history - at the last five years,'' he said last Sunday on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' ''Each year, the Department has gone up with a proposal for real growth in defense spending. It never happens.''
''If you look at a realistic set of assumptions about how much money we're going to have'' in future years, he added, ''then it leads you to the conclusion that we're going to have to spend significantly less'' than current plans call for.
The Pentagon's acceptance of this budgetary reality, unwelcome though it is by some Department officials, is a breakthrough of sorts.
Over the years, the Pentagon now admits that it had made a bad habit of wishful thinking. Even while Congress was moving to trim the military budget, the Pentagon would continue to project spending increases in future years and to act as if this imaginary money would someday become real.
 
Paying a Price
The practice of continually assuming the best helped to maintain relative peace within the Pentagon. Deferring the need for tough decisions helped to limit the infighting among the services and among their various supporters on Capitol Hill.
But the Pentagon's calculated over-optimism came at a price. Realistic planning was disrupted and money was wasted. Assuming that all projected appropriations would materialize, for example, the Defense Department launched too many weapons programs. As budgets shrank, production schedules were cut back and the unit cost of a given weapon went up.
Mr. Cheney's directive to the services, while only a first step, is an effort toward changing the Pentagon's approach on budget requests.
Until now, the Bush Administration had planned on spending increases of 1 percent or 2 percent from 1992 to 1994, after the effect of inflation was discounted.
A cut of $180 billion from the White House's previously planned increases for those years - the ''worst case'' circumstance at the heart of Mr. Cheney's budget directive -would mean that military spending would shrink an average of about 5 percent annually, after inflation, Pentagon officials said.
Responding to Mr. Cheney's order, the Air Force proposed measures including the closing of 15 bases, slowing the rate of production for the B-2 bomber and scaling back the purchase of F-16 planes, officials said.
The Navy's proposals included mothballing 2 of its 14 aircraft carriers. The Army has offered plans to eliminate three active divisions and forgo the long-sought modernization of the M-1 tank.
But none of the services were eager to suggest a cancellation of any important new weapons. Civilian and military officials met on Tuesday to review the service budget cut proposals, and some of them said that it could take months before the Pentagon decided how to modify its old multiyear spending plan.
In Congress, the Pentagon's changed approach to spending plans has generally been viewed as a shrewd move by Mr. Cheney.
Representative Norman Dicks, a Washington Democrat who serves on House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, said Mr. Cheney has a better chance of maintaining control over the budget on Capitol Hill by presenting a plan that is close to what Congress is likely to approve instead of making unrealistic requests, as Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger did during the Reagan years.
But some experts also worry that the cuts are being discussed in a vacuum.
To take account of changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Pentagon officials have begun to rewrite the the strategic planning assumptions on which military spending decisions are based. The revisions, which are to be made to the Defense Planning Guidance, have not yet been completed even though the planning document was scheduled to have been finished by Oct. 1.
 
Reduced Threat
Advisers to Mr. Cheney said the task of preparing the new policy guide has been complicated by the prospect of a sharply reduced Soviet military presence in Europe as a result of the recent rapid political changes in Warsaw Pact nations. But translating the perception of a reduced threat into actual spending cuts is a complicated matter, to say the least.
As the Pentagon is beginning to discover, climbing down the budget mountain is a lot harder than going up.

Will Cuts Help the Deficit?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
REDUCTIONS in military spending will not produce a pot of money for domestic programs any time soon. Nor will the cuts make it easier for President Bush and Congress to lower the budget deficit next year. The deficit problem is simply too daunting and potential Pentagon cuts too gradual to make much short-term difference. 
''We shouldn't look at this as providing us with the wherewithal to meet all our problems,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office and Congress's chief economist.
The President and Congress spent all this year haggling over reducing the deficit by a mere $14 billion to meet the $110 billion target required by law for fiscal year 1990, which began Oct. 1. Just before dawn Wednesday morning, Congress produced a bill of nips and tucks and gimmicks and then adjourned.
Next year, by contrast, the deficit will have to be cut by more than $40 billion to meet the $64 billion ceiling set by the law. Getting there will require deep slashes in spending, a substantial increase in taxes or a combination of the two. ''We've got a fire-breathing monster staring at us,'' said Representative Les AuCoin, an Oregon Democrat.
The Bush Administration is expected to propose cuts of no more than $10 billion in military spending, and Congress will probably not be able to up that ante by much. That is true in large part because so much of the Pentagon budget for the next year is already committed, either in long-term contracts for weapons systems or in pay and benefits for people already in the service.
Buying out contracts, closing bases or reducing troop levels - actions that could save tens, even hundreds, of billions of dollars eventually - take time to accomplish and often carry additional costs in the first year or two.
For the current fiscal year, about a third of the deficit reduction on which Congress and the President agreed was obtained by across-the-board cuts of 1 percent to 2 percent in most military and domestic programs. Another third comes from obscure tax law changes, including new taxes on cruise ship tickets. The remainder consists mostly of accounting tricks, like not counting the Postal Service's deficit. All these measures were so delicately constructed that Federal officials still could not say just what the deficit would really be in this fiscal year.
With this year's figures finally approved, the budget office is in the final stage of deciding how much money to propose for each department and agency in fiscal 1991, which begins next Oct. 1. The ''challenge'' in meeting the deficit target ''is going to be very large,'' said Richard G. Darman, the budget director. ''There's no escaping that.''

HEADLINE: IDEAS AND TRENDS;
How Freud Shaped the 20th-Century Mind

 BODY:
SCIENTISTS and philosophers still debate where Sigmund Freud's theories of psychoanalysis fit into the jigsaw puzzle of disciplines studying the brain and mind.
To biologists working with brain cells and psychologists analyzing experimental data, Freud's ideas of subterranean mental forces often seem musty and arcane. Are modern men and women really fated to relive the dramas of Oedipus and Electra, psychologically murdering the parent of the same sex? Even some psychiatrists feel that their more doctrinaire colleagues in psychoanalysis are seized with an ideology not a science.
Whatever their scientific status, Freud's theories about the effects of the unconscious on behavior pervade Western culture and the humanities. To observe the 50th anniversary of his death, scholars of psychoanalysis gathered in Columbia, S.C., earlier this month for a University of South Carolina symposium on Freud's impact on such fields as psychology, literary criticism and even business administration. Here are some excerpts. 
 
AN IDEOLOGY - OR A SCIENCE?
IN its early years, psychoanalysis took on an insular existence with few connections to the outside world. Even today some analysts treat concepts like the Oedipus complex as dogmas and opposing ideas as heresies. Dr. Eugene H. Kaplan, a professor of neuropsychiatry and behavioral science at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine, said it was time for the field to hold itself to more rigorous standards.
 
What has been the impact of Freud on 20th-century thought? After 50 years we have come far enough so that we are not here to consider ''the Word.'' We're not talking about the revealed word of Sigmund Freud. And we're not here to adore or to worship or to idealize but to appreciate. And to appreciate means to savor, to critique, to discard.
I was reminded of a celebration at the time of the 100th anniversary of his birth when, I think, the title was ''The Legacy of Sigmund Freud.'' There is some passage in the Bible that says when one inherits a legacy one must then work and strive to make that legacy one's own - really to metabolize it and to absorb it. I think we're arriving at that point.
What characterizes the main theoretical developments in the last 50 years has been a decentering of the importance of the Oedipus complex. Not because the Oedipus complex isn't important but if you're starting out and the first thing you discover is the Oedipus complex, the rational way of handling that is to explain everything on the basis of the Oedipus complex.
Clearly from what we've learned about Freud's relationships and conflicts toward his own parents, he had to put emphasis on the Oedipal complex and the relationship to the father and to sidestep the relationship to the mother. Issues of relationships to the mother and the issues of narcissism are much more in the picture now. And that makes for a richer and more difficult picture. Because we have come so much further and psychoanalysis is no longer merely the institution which is the shadow of the man, what developments that have occurred do not lead anymore to heresy and schism.
What do I see for the future? Some of us have a dream that we can achieve a kind of integration. We feel that psychoanalysis has suffered almost mortally from its isolation from the university, its isolation from the other intellectual disciplines. And if it's worth saving it has to be able to stand the glare of all kinds of other study. And I think it will be lifesaving. I think there has to be an integration in which the connection is not simply to medicine and psychiatry but to the arts and the humanities. Yet I look for an integration that is not a mindless eclecticism but where there will be a development of criteria and where we can go forward with some scientific appeal. We have to have a higher court of appeal that we will all accept and it can't be simply what sounds best or who is more charismatic.
 
FROM THE MENTAL TO THE PHYSICAL
TODAY most neuroscientists are what philosophers call strict determinists. They believe that the mind is simply what the brain does and that mental life must ultimately be determined by biology and chemistry.
Some scientists and philosophers, on the other hand, argue for a mentalist approach, holding that the mind is best studied as a thing in itself with a rule book of its own.
Dr. Robert Michels, chairman of psychiatry at Cornell University Medical School in New York, said Freud took an intermediary position, considering his theories of the mind a temporary approximation until more was learned about the brain.
 
A hundred years ago, Freud gave up the laboratory study of the brain to embark on a new phase in his career: the clinical, psychological study of the mind. His initial hope was to establish a scientific psychology, one that dealt with mental phenomena - with thoughts, feelings, wishes, fears, passions -and that did so not in the loose common-sense way in which we normally think about mental phenomena but with a strict, rigorous, scientific determinism that ultimately could be linked to the emerging understanding of the brain.
Before Freud there were really two approaches to thinking about mental life and behavior. One was scientific, deterministic, with the brain controlled by the laws of physics and chemistry. The study of mental life makes sense for awhile, until we know enough about the biology of the brain to be able to make predictive statements based on our direct understanding of it -that's the view of most contemporary leaders of neurobiologic science. It was certainly Freud's view when he started out in this new field.
 
Missing Pieces
The other pre-Freudian view was common-sense psychology - totally mentalist, common-sense explanations for behavior in terms of thoughts, wishes, feelings, hopes, never in terms of synapses, neurotransmitters, cortical excitation or other brain states. It was deterministic in that it explained things in terms of cause and effect. But it was loosely rather than tightly deterministic. There were weak links and missing pieces that were explained as behavior that just couldn't be understood.
Of course, common-sense psychology essentially ignored the brain. It saw most mental phenomena as caused by other mental phenomena. Those causes could usually be understood, but some mental phenomena were inexplicable. These included dreams, parapraxis [slips of the tongue, for example] and neurotic symptoms. Mentalist determinism based on the traditional data of common-sense psychology - introspection - failed and a determinist psychology that would be strictly mentalist required new tools.
Freud's psychoanalysis offered those new tools: the concept of mental causes that could not be discovered by simple introspection. This concept allowed all mental life to be seen as mentally or psychically determined by creating this new category of causes.
For the first time, with the advent of psychoanalysis, it was no longer necessary that a scientific psychology be fundamentally a neuropsychology. Freud himself was not too enthusiastic about this. He longed for a neurological basis for his new discoveries.
 
PUTTING A CORPORATION ON THE ANALYST'S COUCH
ABRAHAM ZALEZNIK, a professor at Harvard Business School, applies psychoanalytic techniques to sick corporations. He has found that even when business leaders are reasonably healthy, their organizations can engage in self-destructive behavior. Blinded by grandiose self-images - corporate mythologies, he calls them - a company often ignores economic realities and resists change. One explanation for General Motors's loss of market share, he said, was the ''internalization of ideals, values and corporate structures and practices'' that can be traced to the company's legendary chairman, Alfred P. Sloan Jr.
 
Organizational studies on the whole have remained somewhat detached from and resistant to psychodynamic observations and interpretations. The forms organizations take are presented typically as rational responses to environmental conditions, to technology and to other extrinsic forces. Motivations of actors in organizations are considered either as intervening variables and therefore not necessarily the object of direct study or as noise in the system. . . .
People who are well placed in the power structure enjoy a protected position. There are certain narcissistic gains from belonging to the organization and being in that power position, and they are highly invested in it, and all the elements that produce cohesion, as Freud pointed out, are at work there. The people in the lower levels are very much excluded from the mythological structures that provide these narcissistic gains. The mythology includes the notion that ''the world's against us, everybody out there is our enemy, and we therefore have to pull together in order to ward off impending disasters.'' The internalization of these mythologies passes on from one group to another within the power elite but it excludes the lower-level people, who in turn feel very much left out and are vulnerable to depressive reactions.
Belief in the mythological structure and the narcissistic gain from holding those beliefs imperils the organization. The United States is in a period of decline economically. We have lost industry after industry to competition abroad, notably Japan and West Germany. General Motors is sitting in the unenviable position of having lost market share within that industry equivalent to the Chrysler Corporation, and this share will not easily be regained. Translate that into jobs lost and economic security dislocations and you have pretty much a picture of what is going on in America today. The problem stems from the fact that as these large organizations grow and persist they develop these mythological structures which the leadership believes in and passes on and acculturates new groups in, generation after generation. It prevents people from looking at reality. They do not understand the nature of the world they are living in and the changes they are undergoing. They are therefore ill prepared to lead in the direction of change.
The leadership in these organizations has to understand why myths arise and why it's important that people believe in them. But the leadership must never take them seriously and never get sucked into it themselves. They must remain highly objective and have the capacity to look at the world as it is.
 
OF READERS, WRITERS AND TEXTS
AS soon as literary critics discovered psychoanalysis, they began scrutinizing the motives of both authors and characters through the Freudian lens.
As Murray M. Schwartz, dean of arts and humanities at the University of Massachusetts, observed, some interpreters went overboard. But as the field matured, he said, Freud's ideas of unconscious forces helped illuminate the mysterious relationship between authors and readers and the way that texts can take on lives of their own.
 
In the 60's, when there was an enormous flowering of psychoanalytic thinking in the humanities, psychoanalysis was a form of appropriating literature or historical material or even personal lives, the lives of poets and writers. It was a way of possessing things. It was a way of claiming them for psychoanalysis. People went to town with psychoanalytic ideas in all kinds of literary texts. A lot of good work came from this exuberance but also a lot of psychoanalytic overkill.
In the 70's and into the 80's psychoanalysis in the humanities emerges as both an agent and an object of critical inquiry. There is also an enormous amount of writing about psychoanalysis in the humanities, and psychoanalysis becomes part of a revolution in theoretical and critical thinking. The focus is on narrative, on dialogue, on the implication of the interpreter on the interpretive process. [The critic] Geoffrey Hartman summarized these developments when he said psychoanalytic criticism is getting harder and harder to do yet more and more people are doing it.
These developments participate in the general rethinking about the nature and functions of discourse. We see increased emphasis on the relations between fact and fiction, between events and the languages we invent and use to represent events and experiences.

HEADLINE: Suppose the Town Was Promoting Insurrection

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Anthony Lewis, in a column about Israel's handling of a tax strike in the West Bank Arab town of Beit Sahour (''It Can Happen There,'' Oct. 29), writes: ''Suppose the people of some small American town decided to protest Federal Government policy by withholding their taxes. The Government responded by sending in the Army. . . . Unthinkable? Of course it is, in this country. But it is happening in another: . . . Israel.''
If Beit Sahour were an Israeli town that did not pay its taxes merely to protest government policy, Mr. Lewis's comparison would have been apt. However, that is not the case. 
To give the proper context, he should have written: Suppose we were still in the pre-glasnost period and Mexico had become Communist, demanding that the United States return territories taken from it in the wake of the Mexican War: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada and California.
Suppose also a majority of former Mexicans lived in some of these areas, who felt they were discriminated against, wished to secede from the Union and started a widespread insurrection that was supported and financed by Mexico and other Communist states in Latin America. The insurrectionists obstructed communications and access to their areas of residence and attacked civilians, the police and the National Guard with stones and Molotov cocktails; and to bring about a breakdown in governmental activity, they killed former Mexicans holding jobs with the state or Federal Governments and then began to withhold their taxes.
If Mr. Lewis had given the Beit Sahour affair this context, it would have been a constructive contribution toward understanding Israel's position. A Communist Mexico might not in itself be a threat to America, but its proximity and its Communist connections would be factors the United States could not allow itself to ignore in trying to preserve its economic and political system. To surrender former Mexican territories as a result of the insurrection would unquestionably make America more vulnerable. Thus, to send in the National Guard to put down a tax strike in Texas might not have been ''unthinkable.''
The Arab states may not be in a position to defeat Israel on the battlefield today, but their proximity, their overall military potential and the instability of their regimes are factors that Israel cannot allow itself to ignore in deciding whether or not to cede territory.
This is not to say that Israel should disregard the need for peace or not cede territory. On the contrary, there is room to believe that Israel can cede some territory and maintain self-defense capability. Such territory might be surrendered as a calculated risk in the interest of peace. Considering the high stakes, however, one should ponder the matter before condemning those Israelis who, for reasons of security, are wary of making such concessions.
And as the Arab insurrection in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip is not over rights but over territory, yielding to it can only weaken Israel's ultimate ability to achieve secure borders through negotiation. Thus to send the army into Beit Sahour to put down a tax strike as part of an insurrection is not the same as sending the army into ''some small American town'' that protested Government policy.
Reported brutalities in Beit Sahour that Mr. Lewis refers to are not to be condoned. To focus on such incidents, however, is to give the erroneous impression that Israel has become a brutal country. Israeli Army briefings stipulate restraint. The overwhelming majority of Israeli soldiers who confront the insurrectionists behave with self-control. The Israeli press regularly reports excesses, and both the army and the civil courts prosecute offenders.

HEADLINE: East Europe Mostly Likes Our Life Style

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Most of the Russians and Poles I met on assignment in their countries spoke of drugs, street crime and a general breakdown of order in the West. We can attribute some of that ''knowledge'' to negative news coverage by their controlled news media, but word of mouth, via American relatives, was likely to be their main source of information. So-called Western freedom was more or less envied as a material and social life style, not usually spoken of as a political one.
Aeroflot, the Russian airline, has a ''first class'' section, and I found Soviet citizens to be extremely materialistic in their constant press to get foreign currency for access to the quality and status of foreign goods in the shops. Western products are highly prized as black market ''produce,'' but I didn't hear any talk about queueing up to register as Republicans or Democrats; that recurring theme is a bit of wishful thinking on our part. I remember that thought process from when I had a firsthand view of the two Germanys.
I was stationed in West Germany as an American serviceman at the birth of the Berlin Wall. I didn't get the feeling then that our system was envied on either side of Checkpoint Charlie. These people wanted Walkman, Izod, pop music and discos; they had little access to those before the wall came down.
Right now, they are Christmas kids with their noses pressed to the chilled windows of Freedoms R Us; let's wait and see if they go for the rest of the package.

How to Beat Prepay Charge For Air Tickets

 BODY:
More and more airlines are assessing penalties, known as prepay charges, for travelers who book an advance-purchase seat through a travel agent but get the ticket issued at the airport. There is a way to get around the penalty, which is usually about $25, but it requires a bit of planning.
Travelers who use out-of-town travel agents may find that because the agent is hundreds of miles away, the agent may not be able to get the ticket to the customer's home or office before the day of departure.
The prepay charge is not imposed by airlines when the customer books a flight directly with the airline by phone, using a credit card, and then picks up the ticket at the airport. But many travelers prefer agents - to save time, perhaps, or in hopes of getting a good deal - and then go to the airport to get the ticket. When this happens the airlines' view is that the transaction has not been completed because while the reservation has been made and payment accepted, the ticket has not been issued. The travel agent sends an electronic message called a prepaid ticket advice (P.T.A.), to the airline. To cover the cost of bookkeeping and writing a ticket, the airlines say, a prepay charge - usually $25 for a domestic flight and $30 on many foreign flights - is imposed. 
How to beat the pre-pay charge? Daniel T. Smith, a spokesman for the International Airline Passengers Association, a Dallas-based consumer group, recommends having the travel agent ship the ticket by overnight mail. Many agents have deals with couriers like Federal Express to deliver tickets for under $10. He also recommends trying to negotiate with the travel agent to absorb the cost of prepay charges. ''Particularly if you are a business, if your volume is high enough, anything is negotiable,'' Mr. Smith said.
 
Nonstop Flights To the Caymans
 Vacationers bound for the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean will be able to fly nonstop from New York for the first time starting Dec. 15. Cayman Airways, the British colony's national carrier, will fly its new Boeing 737-400's from Kennedy International Airport in New York every Friday, Saturday and Sunday at 9 A.M., arriving at Grand Cayman at 12:45 P.M. Flights to New York from Grand Cayman will be at 8:30 P.M. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, arriving at 12:15 A.M.
In previous winters, travelers from New York had to connect with Cayman Airways, Eastern or Northwest in Miami to get to the islands.
The 14-day economy excursion fare from New York is $399 round trip. The Boeing 737-400 carries 158 passengers.
 
Informal Sales Of London Art
 Visitors to London have a new opportunity to shop for contemporary art. The work of young artists is available at what the organizers describe as reasonable prices on an irregular monthly schedule at St. Peter's Church Hall, 59A Portobello Road, London (three minutes from the Notting Hill Gate Underground station). Two organizations working together stage either cash-and-carry exhibitions of emerging artists' work (about 200 exhibits) at prices from about $80 to $320 (calculating 1 at $1.60) or art auctions at which both established and emerging artists can put their work on the block for a $16 fee. Ten percent of the proceeds from cash-and-carry sales is donated to the environmental charity ARK.
The cash-and-carry exhibits are organized by Art Events, Post Office Box 1958, Notting Hill, London W11 3PF (937 5897) and the art auctions by Griffin Contemporary Art Auctions, Post Office Box 1966, London W11 2EL (243 0192). It is worth checking on the events in advance since dates are irregular and extra shows are often organized. Starting in 1990, the aim is to have a show on the last Saturday of each month. Meanwhile, the next two are a cash-and-carry sale Dec. 2 and an auction Jan. 27. The organizers do not arrange shipping but will supply the phone number for a transport service.
 
Lighting Up At Christmas Worldwide
 Germany is the home of the Christmas tree, and every city and village in East and West Germany has one up on its central square in time for Advent. This year Advent begins Dec. 3, and the tradition may have a new poignancy because of the opening of the Berlin wall.
In Munich's Marienplatz the tree is to be decorated with electric candles and tinsel in front of the Town Hall on Friday.
In Frankfurt, the tree on the Romerberg, as the town hall is called, was installed a couple of weeks ago, but the lighting ceremony takes place on Friday, opening day of the Christmas Market.
There are four trees in Nuremberg, two on each side of the Frauen Church, the central point of the Christkindlmarkt. Their electric candles will be lighted this week.
The tree in front of Vienna's town hall, the Rathaus, is traditionally donated by one of the provinces. This year's tree is 86 feet high and 25 years old and comes from Salzkammergut. Its decorations were switched on last month. In London, the tree on Trafalgar Square will be illuminated Dec. 7. Closer to home, at Rockefeller Plaza in New York, a 70-foot Norwegian spruce, will shine with 18,000 lights beginning Dec. 4. Ceremonies start at 6 P.M. with caroling, dancing and ice skating. In Colonial Williamsburg, Va., the tree, another Norwegian spruce, won't be turned on until dusk on Dec. 24.
A lighting ceremony in Minneapolis was staged Thanksgiving Day after a parade with Dorothy Hamill as grand marshal.
In Washington, President Bush will light a 35-foot blue spruce that is permanently planted in the Elipse, the park behind the White House, at 5:50 P.M. on Dec. 14. At the same time, 50 state trees surrounding the national Christmas tree will be turned on by the President from a switch in the White House. Ceremonies begin with Willard Scott as emcee-Santa Claus. The theme: ''Families.'' Seating is on a first-come basis.
There are at least two tree lightings in Seattle. One was at Westlake Center on Nov. 24; the other is on Dec. 6 when lights are switched on around the tree at 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza.
In Denver, the neoclassical City and County Building becomes a giant ''tree'' on Friday. About 300,000 watts will be used to illuminate multicolored floodlights lighting up the four-story building, which has a clock tower that is another four stories high.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 7, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

A report in the Travel Advisory column on Nov. 26 about airline-ticket prepay charges referred incompletely to their use.

HEADLINE: Czechoslovakia's Opulent Spas

BYLINE: By JOANNE FURIO; Joanne Furio is a writer who lives in Brooklyn.

 BODY:
For centuries, Carlsbad and Marienbad - the German names for Czechoslovakia's most famous spa towns, Karlovy Vary and Marianske Lazne - drew Europe's most prominent political and artistic figures.
Both were blessed with a wealth of mineral springs, which lured patients seeking cures as well as the healthy, and both evolved into luxurious retreats and important cultural and economic centers.
Situated in the northern, Bohemia, region, both towns are closer to today's East and West Germany than to the capital city of Prague, and throughout history have attracted a large German-speaking clientele.
Elaborate spa buildings and colonnades sprung up to surround the privileged visitor with an atmosphere of architectural splendor. Merchants set up fancy shops, hotels and restaurants. And, to keep such a group entertained, music and theater festivals were established, attracting some of the most respected performers. 
Karlovy Vary and Marianske Lazne no longer attract royalty or the wealthy, but average citizens of the Eastern Bloc.
Recognizing the towns' importance as tourist centers, the government has made an effort to maintain their historic significance by restoring many of the rich 18th- and 19th-century buildings. As a result, both towns offer some of the most luxurious accommodations for the money in Czechoslovakia. And, trying to keep up their cultural traditions, the spa towns continue to offer some of the country's best classical music performers, as well as those from other Eastern Bloc countries.
The only things a Westerner might miss on visits to these towns are foreign newspapers and magazines and a varied selection of vegetables. Although both towns have fine restaurants with an abundance of meat-based dishes, a lettuce salad is somewhat of a luxury. How the recent tumult in Eastern Europe will affect Western tourism is, at this point, anybody's guess.
Although completely different in scale and atmosphere, Karlovy Vary and Marianske Lazne have much in common.
Each is set in a valley, framed by hills of pines with a complex of walking trails and views, and an abundance of natural springs, which are thermal in Karlovy Vary.
Today, almost 90 percent of the visitors are from the Eastern Bloc, mostly from Czechoslovakia itself, whose numerous trade unions have provided its members with their own facilities, as well as East Germany and the Soviet Union. Only a handful come from England and the United States, although that, like so much else in Eastern Europe, may change.
Impressive colonnades built during the 18th or 19th centuries adorn both town centers, where visitors line up at fountains to fill porcelain mugs with the mineral waters, which they sip almost hypnotically while strolling or basking in the sun.
The mugs, designed with unusual hollow handles that act as straws, are purchased by patients before they begin their therapies.
Although the middle-aged people who visit these towns do so for curative purposes, staying an average of three weeks at the sanitariums, or spa houses, the towns do welcome those who come only as tourists, usually staying for two or three days, as well as a large number of day-trippers, who visit the towns on excursions from Prague.
But since many do come for a medical pilgrimage, the spas offer a feeling of quiet solemnity, even if their sidewalks are lined with pedestrians. For those who long for the fast-paced action of a city, these towns are not for them.
Karlovy Vary is the largest spa in the country - almost a city. (On a pocket-sized map printed by the country's official tourist office, Cedok, Marianske Lazne is not even delineated.) Karlovy Vary is said to have been discovered by Emperor Charles IV, who, in 1347, stumbled into the waters while on a hunting expedition. Later, the town achieved even greater notoriety by attracting such prominent personalities as Peter the Great, the Austrian Emperor Josef II, Beethoven, Chopin, Paganini, Richard Wagner, Freud, Tolstoy, Goethe and Gogol.
Surrounded by steep slopes that make the already majestic 19th-century buildings seem even more imposing, the spa district of Karlovy Vary conveys a comforting sense of envelopment that separates it from the gloomy urban areas surrounding it.
Karlovy Vary is centered on the River Tepla, which meanders through the town. Shops selling leather, crystal, the country's renowned folk ceramics and spa porcelain mugs line the streets on both sides of the river.
The river itself is a bit of a disappointment when not at its height. At times it resembles a stagnant pool shallow enough to allow ducks to bathe standing up, while on cool days its thermal waters at least provide an impressive display of evaporating steam.
Besides its high temperatures, ranging from 86 to 162 degrees, the waters of Karlovy Vary are known for their high levels of sulfate of soda and carbonate of soda. Because of these properties, the spas specialize in treating disorders of the gastrointestinal tract and liver.
Karlovy Vary appears to have attracted more American, West German and Arab tourists than Marianske Lazne, perhaps because it is larger, better known and older.
From the outside, those who don't stay in the spa houses might assume that they are elegant old hotels, well-maintained in their original Beaux Arts or Greek Revival style. Most of their interiors reflect such old-time opulence, as well as a kind of squeaky-clean, hospital atmosphere. This is where the doctors have their offices to diagnose and prescribe the appropriate water dosages for the patients (up to one liter a day), as well as regimens that include exercise, bathing in the waters and special diets.
Tourists can enjoy some of the perks offered by the spa houses, without making a three-week commitment. The 19th-century Grand Hotel Moskva, the most elegant complex in town, offers a sauna, massage, tanning room and small work-out room for those who seek some pampering.
Even if one doesn't seek such indulgences, the Grand Hotel is worth a visit. Completed in 1893, the hotel boasts several restaurants, stained-glass ceilings and other turn-of-the-century finery, as well as a white-and-gold rococo concert hall, where both Dvorak and Smetana, native sons, played.
Another important landmark is the casino, built in the late 19th century by the renowned Austrian design team of Helmer and Feller. Renovated in June 1988, the building houses spa facilities as well as a small casino operated by an Austrian firm.
The casino, portrayed in advertisements as a Czech Monte Carlo, is usually almost empty, with only a few West German and Arab visitors playing at the three blackjack and roulette tables on a Friday night. But it is worth seeing its elaborate period architec-ture and furnishings, including a spectacular marble staircase, 100-foot-high glass-paneled ceiling, murals depicting ancient Greeks at play and golden wood-paneled walls.
While the casino captures the feeling of Karlovy Vary past, the mood of the town today is best witnessed at its colonnades.
The Greek revival Colonnade of Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship, conspicuously renamed after the Russian invasion of 1968, is the most traditional, allowing patrons to stroll in the shadow of Corinthian columns and potted palms or sit on white wrought-iron benches along a parklike promenade.
In contrast, the Colonnade Yuri Gagarin is a modern steel-and-glass structure with a glass-domed room containing the Vridlo spring, which shoots hot waters 50 feet into the air, and an enclosed promenade where patients line up to get their water from modern brass fountains.
Karlovy Vary is the site of an international film festival every other year, most recently last summer, which does include some lesser-known Western productions, though none that would be considered controversial, and has its own orchestra, which regularly performs works by Smetana and Dvorak in the elegant yet badly deteriorated 19th-century theater.
The town museum displays antique folk ceramics and old spa mugs, along with a roster of its famous visitors. Not far is the Museum Karl Marx, which provides a lesson in propaganda for the uninitiated.
Also worth visiting is the sedate Dvorak Park, with its Victorian gazebo, and, on the outskirts of the city, the Russian Orthodox Church of the Chief Apostles Peter and Paul, the cathedral church of Russian Orthodoxy in Czechoslovakia, which was built in 1897 and has an impressive display of antique iconography.
The town's famous Becherova, a minty herb liqueur created by the German-born Jan Becher, is worth a taste.
Farther south and west of Karlovy Vary is Marianzke Lazne, a much cozier town whose amenities can easily be absorbed in a few days.
Its parks are integrated into the town center, thanks to early 19th-century planners. The main street, the Trida Obdoraru, is lined with the principal hotels and shops, pastel-colored Beaux-Arts buildings with impressive gargoyles and classical reliefs. Across the street is a stream and a series of winding parks that work their way, like the rest of the town, up toward the main square, named after Klement Gottwald, a former head of state.
On the square, whose center is a park and fountain, is the Kavkaz Spa, once the Hotel Weimer, where the spa's most famous visitor, King Edward VII, stayed during his many visits. Since the facility serves spa patients only, visitors can just glimpse the former King's favorite resort by walking into the marble lobby, framed by a double staircase and potted palms.
Edward was also responsible for one of the town's proudest assets, its 18-hole golf course, which was opened in 1905 by the king himself. Situated just outside town, the course is the largest in the country. Adjacent to the Kavkaz Spa is the museum, which has been connected to the former vacation residence of another noted visitor, Goethe. The rooms where the poet lived have been meticulously maintained, and the building is the only one in town that hasn't been renovated. Goethe memorabilia and some of his writings decorate the rooms, as does shiny wooden furniture inlaid in the style of the period. In the modern half of the museum, the town's famous drinking mugs and images of prominent doctors and visitors, including Czar Nicholas II, Ibsen, Kipling, Mark Twain and Thomas Edison are displayed. An audio-visual museum program is available in English.
Across from the museum is the 19th-century Ascension of Mary Catholic Church, somber on the outside, with an elaborate wood-and-marble altar trimmed in gold leaf inside.
Not far from Gottwald Square is the aquatic center of town for spa patients, the Gorki Colonnade, with an elaborate glass-paned archway and Corinthian columns. At one end of the colonnade is a plain modern fountain that plays classical music at intervals.
Like Karlovy Vary, Marianske Lazne has developed a healthy agenda of entertainment to keep patients occupied. There are two movie theaters, but even if they show Western films they are usually dubbed in Czech. Its well-preserved theater and casino are better bets, offering classical music programs performed by the town's own orchestra, visiting pop performers like the Czech singer Heidi, theater and dancing to native brass bands.
Marianske Lazne has 39 mineral springs, famous for their carbon dioxide content, as well as iron, magnesium and calcium. Drinking cures are used here in conjunction with carbon-monoxide gas injections, diet and exercise regimens, to treat urinary tract and respiratory problems.
The Polyclinic treats nonspa visitors, offering drinking cures, peat applications, massage and other therapies, after a medical consultation, ''Everything,'' according to the town's slogan, ''for the health of the working people.''
 
FINDING THE WAY TO THE SPA TOWNS
 
KARLOVY VAR
 The town is about 74 miles from Prague, a one-and-a-half-hour drive. Car rental is about $100 a day. Take highway 6 west.
A two-and-a-half-hour bus ride, about $4, is preferable to the train, which, at $4.50, takes four-and-a-half hours. Plane service is also available from Prague International Airport for $12.
 
Sights
The Casino, in the Spa House (1 Vysina Imperial; 6 P.M. to 1 A.M.).
 Museum of Karlovy Vary (Dukelskych Hrdinu; Wednesday to Sunday 9 A.M. to noon and 2 to 5 P.M.). Admission 40 cents.
 Museum Karl Marx (Dukelskych Hrdinu; daily from 9 A.M. to noon). Free.
 Church of the Chief Apostles Peter and Paul (26 Petra Velikehom; April to September 9 A.M. to 6 P.M.). Free.
 
MARIANSKE LAZNE
 A 135-mile trip from Prague, reachable by following the route to Karlovy Vary, then heading south to highway 20, which turns into 24 and leads directly into the town.
Both the train and the bus cost the same ($4.50) and take the same amount of time, about three hours. Trolleys or taxis must be taken to the center of town, at the cost of about 10 cents for the former and about 25 cents for the latter, after telephoning from the station, a difficulty for those who don't speak Czech or German.
 
Sights
Museum Marianske Lazne (Gottwald Square; daily 9 A.M. to noon and 2 to 5 P.M.). Admission 40 cents.
 Casino (between Trida Rude Armady and Dusikova; gambling from 6 P.M. to 1 A.M.).
Theater Marianske Lazne (Trebizskeho; evening and weekend performances).
 
 Dining
 Most of the hotels have their own restaurants. Neither spa town has many independent restaurants.
 Foreign wines are more than double the price of fine wines from the southern, Slovak republic. Prices range from $10 to $25 for dinner for two with Slovak wine.

HEADLINE: PITTSBURGH CLEANS UP ITS ACT

BYLINE: By Vince Rause; Vince Rause is a writer living in Philadelphia.

 BODY:
BILL JOHNSON KILLS THE ENGINE OF HIS RUBYRED Mercury Astro and lets the sleek fiberglass bass boat drift along the steep northern shore of the Monongahela River, into the heart of Pittsburgh.
A stone's throw from the river's edge, morning rush-hour roars along on the Penn Lincoln Highway. A few hundred feet above Johnson's head, traffic rumbles on the deck of the Liberty Bridge. The clamor drifts down to the river: random car horns, the guttural downshift of an 18-wheeler, the pneumatic hiss from the brakes of a city bus.
Ignoring these urban distractions, Johnson draws a graphite casting rod from a locker in the boat's hull, baits his line and casts into the still water at the base of the bridge's massive pylons. In moments, the line goes taut, and Johnson jerks the rod to set the hook. Suddenly, a fat, gleaming bass explodes into view, sending up sprays of silver sparks as it tail-walks wildly across the water. 
With the shining towers of the city's corporate center rising spectacularly behind him, Johnson works his catch to the boat. ''That's a 12-, 13-inch largemouth!'' he cries, as he cuts the line and sets the big fish free. ''You think bass, you think Lake Okeechobee, Florida, or something. But here I am catching a largemouth in downtown Pittsburgh! Under the Liberty Bridge!''
It's a bittersweet moment. For years, Johnson worked in the steel mills that made Pittsburgh an industrial powerhouse and turned its three rivers - the Monongahela, Allegheny and Ohio - into running sewers. Now, he claims, he is the first licensed fishing guide on the river. The rebirth of the Monongahela and Johnson's unlikely occupation make a striking metaphor for the surprising changes this city has seen over the last decade.
IN THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S, THE STEEL INDUSTRY, Pittsburgh's economic foundation for more than a century, virtually disappeared, crippled by foreign competition and dwindling demand. More than 90,000 jobs were lost, most of them in heavy manufacturing. Regional unemployment soared to more than 14 percent, and in surrounding steel towns like Homestead, Braddock and Duquesne, nearly one of every two workers was jobless. Economic collapse seemed imminent.
But the collapse never came. Instead, in a swift and dramatic economic restructuring, the city managed to sidestep catastrophe. Today, Pittsburgh has a robust, diversified economy, with heavy industry playing only a small role, and an unemployment rate that has dipped to 5 percent - its lowest level since the peak employment years of the 70's.
At the same time, it has sustained a quality of life that gained national recognition in 1985 when Rand McNally's ''Places Rated Almanac'' named it ''America's Most Liveable City.'' (In this year's almanac, Pittsburgh slipped to third place.) None of this has come without a price. The once-thriving mill towns along the Monongahela have essentially been written off. The city's population has dropped by more than 30 percent, as many of the unemployed packed up and looked for opportunity elsewhere. The ex-steelworkers who have remained search in vain for jobs in the new Pittsburgh that offer anything like their old salaries. And for Pittburgh's blacks, few of whom reaped the rich rewards of prosperity, opportunities are even more limited.
Still, while other aging manufacturing centers in the United States struggle simply to keep their heads above water, Pittsburgh, the spiritual capital of the rust belt, can lay claim to being America's most promising post-industrial experiment.
Despite its monolithic, heavy-industry background, Pittsburgh has always had a surprisingly complex civic persona. This is a town where ''Bowling for Dollars'' was a big hit, but it is also the home of the nation's first public television station. It's a place that takes its polka seriously, but that also has produced a dazzling parade of jazz talent, including Erroll Garner, Earl Hines, Art Blakey, George Benson and Stanley Turrentine. And as Pittsburgh gropes for the image to suit its sophisticated, forward-gazing aspirations, it has chosen as its new Mayor a homey, 71-year-old grandmother named Sophie Masloff. A past President of the City Council, Masloff stepped into the Mayor's office in 1988 when the beloved Richard S. Caliguiri died before finishing his term. She won the Democratic primary last May and ran unopposed for Mayor on Nov. 7.
Masloff is a streetwise, experienced politician, but since taking over the city's reins she has projected a decidedly homespun, low-tech, old-time Pittsburgh demeanor. She told a reporter from The Philadelphia Inquirer that she didn't understand his interest in her city, since she couldn't care less about his. When interviewed for this article, she asked, with genuine puzzlement, ''Why would The New York Times be interested in me?''
Masloff has had an especially hard time sorting out the rock-and-roll celebrities who pass through town. At a press conference welcoming the Springsteen tour, she referred to The Boss as ''Bruce Bedspring.'' She told reporters, ''I didn't mean to do it. But I've never been much of a rock fan.''
In a period of wrenching change, Masloff represented a vote for both the innovative policies of Caliguiri and for the working-class, ethnic town of neighborhoods that Pittsburgh has always been. She inherits from her predecessor a city that, by a number of significant criteria, is in splendid shape. Its public schools are nationally acclaimed. The University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-Mellon University are highly respected centers of research and scholarship. The region's 55 hospitals make the city an internationally recognized medical center. Presbyterian-University Hospital, where Dr. Thomas E. Starzl pioneered liver transplant techniques, is now the busiest transplant center in the world.
Pittsburgh boasts a thriving cultural life, with highly regarded museums of art and natural history, a world-class symphony orchestra, strong opera and ballet companies, and a profusion of smaller galleries and performing-arts companies.
Recent crime and housing statistics show that Pittsburgh may be by far the safest, most affordable city in the nation. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Pittsburgh's crime rate is less than half the national average for large cities. Violent crime is especially low: in 1988, only 24 murders were reported in the city; all but one were solved.
Meanwhile, a recent survey by an investors' advisory service in California found that Pittburgh's median housing price - $63,700 - was the lowest of the 25 metropolitan areas studied. More significantly, by comparing costs to income, the survey found that the city ranked second in its residents' ability to afford a home.
Perhaps most surprising to visitors is the fact that the Pittsburgh of today is clean and attractive. Cleared of industrial blight, the dramatic beauty of its natural setting - dominated by converging rivers, wooded ridges and deep hollows - has reasserted itself. One Midwestern columnist wrote that ''the waterways, the mountains, the trees, reminded me of a cross between Venice and San Francisco.'' That comment may have widened eyes, even in Pittsburgh, but it was seconded when Brendan Gill told readers of The New Yorker, ''If Pittsburgh were situated somewhere in the heart of Europe, tourists would eagerly journey hundreds of miles out of their way to visit it.''
The appeal runs deeper than scenery. Nestled in the rugged rise and fall of the local terrain are more than 80 distinct communities, each an independent village in spirit, and most united by strong ethnic ties. Naturally sequestered by rivers and ravines, these communities have retained the character of the immigrant groups that first settled here generations ago: Eastern Europeans on the South Side, Italians in Bloomfield, Poles on Polish Hill, Germans in Mount Troy and Mount Oliver, Jews in Squirrel Hill.
Neighborhood allegiances are powerful and people stay put; it's nothing remarkable to find several generations of the same family living only a few doors apart. ''There's a sense of rootedness here,'' says Morton Coleman, a professor of social work at the University of Pittsburgh.
''Pittsburgh works because we cooperate,'' says Mayor Masloff. ''The neighborhoods, the government, the universities, the corporations. I can call up the president of PPG or USX - these vast financial empires - and say, 'Look, this is what I want to do. What do you think? Let's do this.' We work together, and it gets done.''
ANYWHERE ELSE, Mayor Masloff's comments would be dismissed as Chamber of Commerce boosterism. But Pittsburgh can point to an idiosyncratic tradition of cooperation between government and industry that has physically and psychologically shaped the city for nearly two generations.
The original and most powerful example of this dates to the 1940's, when the city faced an environmental crisis even more threatening than the economic collapse of the 70's and 80's.
Thanks to the steel industry, Pittsburgh was, for much of its history, a foul and brutal place. Forests of smokestacks bristled along the rivers, towering over steaming slag heaps and grim workers' shanties. The rivers were flood-prone industrial sewers, the air stank of sulfur, and a billowing canopy of smog belched from the mills, blanketing the city so thickly that street lamps and headlights were sometimes forced on by early afternoon.
Over the years, distinguished visitors were horrified by what they saw. In the 1920's, H.L. Mencken called Pittsburgh ''a scene so . . . intolerably bleak and forlorn that it reduced the whole aspiration of man to a macabre and depressing joke.'' In the 1940's, Frank Lloyd Wright, asked by city fathers how he would improve the place, snapped, ''Abandon it.''
But Pittsburgh wasn't abandoned. Instead, in the years following World War II, the city's enormously wealthy Republican industrialists struck an alliance with its powerful New Deal Democratic machine, and launched the monumental effort that would raze and rebuild Pittsburgh. A privately funded planning commission made up of the city's top corportate leadership produced sweeping proposals for the city's rebirth. Local government turned those proposals into public policy, and the $500 million Pittsburgh renaissance began.
Tough smoke-control ordinances cleared the skies. A system of locks and dams tamed the flood-prone rivers. And a sweeping building campaign, directed by the nation's first urban redevelopment authority, leveled acre after acre of industrial slums and erected in their place a new city of grassy parks, modern towers, tree- lined boulevards and landscaped plazas.
The renaissance set the pattern for problem-solving in Pittsburgh and imparted a tough, defiant optimism in the face of adversity. ''It instilled a spirit in the people here of, 'If we can do that, we can do anything,' '' says Robert B. Pease, who was a young civil engineer at the time. Today, Pease is president of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, as the original planning commission has come to be known. Led by a board of corporate chief executives, the group meets monthly to orchestrate the resources of the corporate community and negotiate cooperation between business and government on issues affecting the region's economic and social development.
When the steel crisis hit in the late 1970's, Pittsburgh turned once again to this network of public-private alliances. By 1982, the Allegheny Conference had convened a commission of more than 200 government, business and community representatives to develop a strategy that would move the city away from its dependence on heavy manufacturing toward a more diversified economic base. A marketing agency was formed to attract foreign and out-of-state companies to the region; a seed-money fund was created to help new enterprises get off the ground, and an information program was designed to teach local businesses the arcane art of securing Federal contracts.
One of the most ambitious aims of the restructuring campaign was to capitalize on the presence of the University of Pittsburgh, a leader in biomedical technology (both the polio vaccine and synthetic insulin were developed at Pitt), and Carnegie-Mellon University, a groundbreaker in robotics and software engineering. Planners established a series of funding sources and support programs -notably the Ben Franklin Advanced Technology Center, the Pittsburgh High Technology Council and the Foundation for Applied Science and Technology - to encourage entrepreneurs to move new technologies out of the lab and into the marketplace.
On paper at least, the city's efforts seem to have borne fruit. Between 1975 and 1987, some 101,400 jobs were created, most in education, health care and research. Advanced technology is the region's fastest-growing field. More than 900 high-tech firms operate in the metropolitan area, employing more than 60,000 workers. And there are signs that the outside world is beginning to take Pittsburgh's high-tech community seriously. In 1984, the Department of Defense agreed to locate its $103 million Software Engineering Institute in the city. In 1986, a partnership of the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie-Mellon University and Westinghouse Electric brought one of the world's most powerful supercomputers to the city and founded the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, one of five similar centers across the country funded by the National Science Foundation. Many expect the high-tech revolution to completely restructure the city's economy. The Pittsburgh High Technology Council estimates that by the year 2000, more than 120,000 western Pennsylvanians will work in high-tech industries, making Pittsburgh arguably one of the nation's largest research and development centers.
Not everyone buys this rosy scenario, however. As the University of Pittsburgh's Morton Coleman, for one, points out, ''We were the greatest steel producers in the world. Our advantages were unique: the rivers, the raw materials, the proximity to the marketplace. But we lost those advantages. What are our advantages now? What makes us different from Columbus or Cleveland or Cincinnati or our other regional competitors? I think there are still big questions here.''
David Houston, a professor of economics at the University of Pittsburgh, dismisses the city's high-tech ambitions as ''a pipe dream.''
''There's some question whether these newly created jobs pay anywhere near as well as the jobs we lost,'' he notes. ''You know, most of those new jobs are in health care, education and business services. In those fields, there are a lot of lousy jobs.''
Bernard Bauer, former director of economic development for the Duquesne Light utility company, and now its manager of special projects, has listened to both the critics and the boosters. He insists that the region's recovery is real, if not as spectacular as some would contend. He is especially encouraged by a new $500 million expansion project at the Pittsburgh airport, which is expected to create thousands of new jobs.
Yet the region's low unemployment rate is also a matter of debate. David Houston of the University of Pittsburgh suspects that it may be statistically meaningless. ''We have one of the highest outmigration rates in the country,'' he says. ''A lot of those people, we can assume, were unemployed workers looking for opportunity elsewhere. Naturally, if your unemployed people leave, the rates go down.'' Houston's comments touch on one of the city's most surprising trends: in the last 30 years, Pittsburgh's population has dropped from just over 600,000 to about 390,000. Many younger people left in search of jobs, leaving Pittsburgh with one of the oldest populations in the country.
''Allegheny County has a higher percentage of people over 65 than any county in the nation, except for Dade County, Florida,'' says Moe Coleman - a demographic peculiarity that may help explain the popularity of Sophie Masloff.
David Houston sees no paradox in the city's drastic population loss and its low crime rate, affordable housing and other social strengths. ''All of those things are in some sense the result of weak growth or weak demand,'' he says. ''It turns out to be a virtue to miss some of the growth that places like Houston experienced. It may be an irony of modern life that managing decline gracefully may be more important than shooting for all this growth.''
EVEN THE MOST OPTIMISTIC Pittsburghers would find it difficult to deny that, whatever its successes, the city doesn't work for everybody. ''Pittsburgh is not a healthy environment for blacks,'' says Harvey Adams Jr., president of the Pittsburgh branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ''We are being destroyed here. We are an endangered species.''
''The unemployment rate in black communities is catastrophic,'' says Byrd Brown, who recently became the first black to mount a serious campaign for Mayor of Pittsburgh. ''We have areas that have been devastated by crime and drugs and the city's neglect.'' Pittsburgh has one of the highest black infant-mortality rates in the country and blacks face one of the nation's highest mortage-rejection rates.
According to Brown, racial conflict isn't obvious in Pittsburgh, in part because the black community, which makes up about 25 percent of the population, is scattered across the city in small residential pockets. ''It's not outspoken,'' he says. ''It's a very subtle thing. But it's there. When I was campaigning, everywhere I went, people were very polite and gracious. I'd give a speech in a white area and sometimes I'd get more applause than the white candidates. And I did very well in approval polls; I think I even won a couple of them. But when you check the election results, you'll see that in one white district, out of about 14,000 votes, I got 241! That statistic alone shows that no matter how subtle we are about it, we're just as racially polarized as any other city.''
''Look, I love Pittsburgh'' Brown continues, ''but if you love something, you've got to realize when it's sick. The fact of the matter is, the black community is simply not sharing in the white community's success. The disparity is truly unacceptable. And it's got to change.''
IN THE ONCE-THRIVING mill towns - the places that first put the region on the map - both black and white residents face social and economic exclusion from the new prosperity. When the steel industry collapsed, no town was hit harder than Braddock, site of the Edgar Thompson plant, Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill. In its heyday, Braddock was a thriving community; the retail district along Braddock Avenue drew shoppers from all over the county.
''Now, it looks like a miniature version of the Bronx,'' says Tony Buba, strolling past the blasted storefronts, boarded windows and crumbling brick shells that once made up the town's thriving shopping strip. ''They start to tear a building down and they run out of money. These abandoned houses, burned-out houses, buildings falling down - it looks like the aftermath of World War III.''
Buba is a film maker whose gritty, low-budget documentaries about Braddock's decline are beginning to attract international attention. He is not a detached observer. His father worked in the Edgar Thompson plant for 43 years, and except for eight years away at school, Buba has lived in Braddock all his life. He lives now with his wife in a trim white house next door to the house he grew up in, where his father, mother and grandmother still live.
Buba climbs the steps to a grand sandstone building that was Andrew Carnegie's first public library. Inside, he meets Ray Henderson, a steelworker who lost his job after 19 years in the nearby Dusquesne mill and is pursuing a degree in human services. Henderson was making $40,000 a year when the mill closed in 1984. On the streets, he found he couldn't land a job for more than minimum wage.
''I saw it coming,'' he says, ''and I thought I was mentally prepared. But you leave the mill and your mental state changes. You realize that your whole life centered around one thing - steel mills. And you have to go through this change, and you don't know how to get your feet under you, or how to get your mind in gear to think in terms other than how to make steel.
''Some of the guys I know in the mill committed suicide, some are still drunks. It's out there, you know. They can't pull their lives together, mainly because they couldn't regear themselves to the kind of town Pittsburgh has changed into.''
A few miles downriver, Bob Anderson, another laid-off millworker, stands on Homestead's main drag watching the mill come down, to be sold as scrap. ''The shift change happened right here on this corner,'' says Anderson, who now runs a food bank and support center for unemployed workers. ''From 4 to 6 o'clock you couldn't get through this intersection. There'd be traffic jams for hours. Now, it's like a ghost town. This town is broken down.''
''There are two Pittsburghs,'' says Anderson. ''There's the upscale Pittsburgh of the renaissance downtown, and there's this Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh most people don't see. I'm not bitter about all this promotion of the new corporate image - that's good, I think they should do that. But they shouldn't turn their backs on the people who built the town.''
ON THE MONONGAHELA, Bill Johnson guns the Astro's engine and veers upriver, racing past the old factories and mill towns lining the shore, past the leveled site of the old Jones & Laughlin blast furnace on Oakland, where a new high-tech industrial park will be constructed; past the South Side, where the ongoing demolition of the J.&L. rolling mill is revealing dramatic views of the new city skyline, and past the Homestead mill, where developers have already finished a waterslide amusement park.
Johnson lost his steelworking job in May 1989. Since then, he has made ends meet by doing custodial work at a church near his home and by playing in a local rock band. But fishing is his first love, and he hopes his sport-fishing business will develop into a full-time career. ''Sometimes I miss working in the mill,'' he says. ''I miss the people and the physical work. It's a shame. Steelmaking - that's what made Pittsburgh. A lot of guys thought it would last forever.''
''But now I'm on the river,'' he says. ''And this is where I really want to be.'' It's late morning now, but a light haze still drapes the bridges and the corporate towers. Johnson glances back at the new skyline. Then, jamming the throttle and leaning into the spray, he streaks through the old steel valley toward home.

BYLINE: By Barnaby J. Feder; Barnaby J. Feder is a business reporter for The Times.

 BODY:
HENRY SPIRA WORKS FROM home, a roomy rent-controlled apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side that looks like an office first, a cat playground second, and his residence only as an afterthought. One room is dominated by word-processing equipment. A second is filled with floor-to-ceiling shelves laden with files. And in the living room, where an immense worktable stretches along one wall, the furniture consists of an old couch and two chairs covered in Naugahyde (leather is not an option here). Pictures of Siamese cats hang over the fireplace and a cat jungle gym dominates the hall. From this Spartan dwelling Spira (pronounced SPEE-ra) has run a major command post in this country's rapidly growing animal-rights movement. The burly 62- year-old ex-seaman and former high school teacher says he first became interested in animal rights in the early 1970's, after a girlfriend left him with her cat: ''I began to wonder about the appropriateness of cuddling one animal while sticking a knife and fork into another,'' recalls Spira, who since then has always had one or two cats in his house. 
At the moment, though, chickens are on Henry Spira's mind. After four years of gathering material from animal-rights activists, government agencies and newspaper clippings, he has charged Frank Perdue, the nation's most famous chicken farmer, with grossly misrepresenting the conditions under which Perdue chickens are raised and slaughtered. In a grisly full-page ad in The New York Times, Spira has challenged Perdue's claims that his chickens grow up in ''chicken heaven.'' Rather, the ad describes, among other things, poultry sheds so overcrowded that they encourage cannibalism, disease and mass hysteria; it cites the de-beaking of young chicks with a ''hot knife,'' and working conditions for humans so stressful that they force ''about 60 percent of workers to go to the nurse for pain killers and to have their hands bandaged.''
Perdue Farms, through a public relations concern, described the attack as ''vague and totally groundless.'' It said Perdue spends millions of dollars on research to minimize stress and disease in poultry and improve its chickens' housing, diet and environment. Perdue intends to ignore Spira's call for reforms.
Nonetheless, Spira is pushing ahead, scheduling meetings with other animal-rights activists in an effort to ignite a consumer boycott and working on having his newspaper ad run in other papers across the country. The campaign is, in his eyes, a bid to focus broader attention on the treatment of all farm animals. Perdue was picked as the first target, Spira says, because ''he linked his image to the idea that his chickens are well treated.'' Any reformer, Spira says, must also be an opportunist. Indeed, he acknowledges that conditions are not necessarily worse on Perdue farms than on other chicken farms in the country. ''Later, we will approach other poultry producers to see if they want to cooperate,'' Spira suggests. ''In return for a quiet life, they may want to be part of the solution.''
If a whiff of bravado can be detected in Spira's remarks, it is not surprising. In the last 10 years or so, crusaders for a wide range of causes involving the treatment of animals have successfully raised the consciousness of the American public, business and government, resulting in some dramatic reforms. Spira himself is generally credited with organizing a key victory for the animal-rights movement - a 1980 campaign attacking cosmetics companies for testing new products in the eyes of rabbits. It began with a full-page ad asking, ''How many rabbits does Revlon blind for beauty's sake?''
Since then, the animal-rights movement has grown and expanded its targets and its tactics. Hundreds of thousands of people are members of groups ranging from the armed and radical to the simply noisy. Meanwhile, business and government researchers scramble to develop new ways to test the safety of products, procedures and medicines without the use of animals.
Spira's role in these changes is the subject of frequent debate in the animal-rights movement, which has become riddled with tactical disputes and personality clashes as it has grown. Because he is best known as a moderate within the movement, where radical voices have become increasingly prominent, Spira, through the Perdue campaign, will be testing his influence and leadership within the fractious animal-rights movement.
DISCUSSION ABOUT animal rights began in the late 18th century during the debates about the rights of man. The first animal-welfare organization of note was the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which was founded in England 165 years ago. A number of animal-welfare societies later formed in the United States, including the well-organized American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, but the movement did not gather momentum until the publication of Peter Singer's ''Animal Liberation,'' in 1975, a reasoned plea for the humane treatment of animals that galvanized the animal-rights movement the way Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' published in 1962, drew activists to environmentalism.
Today, organizations regarded as the radical arm of the movement, such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the International Society for Animal Rights, and Trans-Species Unlimited, endorse pressure tactics ranging from demonstrations and boycotts to shareholder petitions at corporate meetings, and they produce slick, widely circulated publications. More shadowy fringe groups, such as the Animal Liberation Front, advocate attacks on laboratories and contend violence in pursuit of their goals is justified.
What the leadership of these more radical groups have in common is the desire to protect all animals from what they consider abuses by humans, and they want immediate action. These broad-based organizations may oppose a number of things simultaneously - the fur industry, circuses, hunting and animal testing - but tend to focus their resources at any one time where they feel they can make an impact. There are also hundreds of small organizations that may concentrate on single issues, such as the killing of dolphins or the U.S. Surgical Corporation's use of dogs to demonstrate surgical stapling techniques.
''On this issue, you have to be an extremist,'' says Steve Siegel, director of the New York office of Trans-Species, which led recent demonstrations that forced a researcher at the Cornell Medical Center to abandon a 14-year research project studying the impact of barbiturates on cats.
Though polls show that the vast majority of the public does not agree with Siegel, especially when it comes to using animals in medical research or forcing farmers to adopt practices that might drive up consumer prices, there is no doubt that the membership and wealth of the more extremist groups is surging. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals alone has grown from 23,000 members in 1985 to more than 300,000. The group, based in Rockville, Md., now has an annual budget of over $6 million, and 60 full-time employees.
Spira, on the other hand, has operated on about $75,000 a year for the last two years. His major financial backers have been groups such as the Humane Society of the United States and the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals as well as wealthy individuals. Operating as a lone-wolf (he has only one employee who works on a regular, nearly full-time basis), Spira uses an ad hoc melange of doctors, medical researchers, toxicologists, advertising executives, and public relations experts. He has the advantage of flexibility over groups with large paid staffs and is freer to do things that seem useful but may not attract financial support. For instance, he spends large amounts of time quietly circulating news about alternatives to Government officials he hopes will eventually implement helpful policy changes. But the drawbacks of Spira's organizational approach are becoming apparent. He must rely on a loose-knit network of supporters, each with an individual agenda, to add weight to his cause.
The mushrooming growth of more aggressive animal-rights groups challenges the influence of more moderate organizations, such as the Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, as well as Spira and Animal Rights International, the non-profit umbrella organization for his activities. These groups tend to focus on improving the treatment of animals but not to publicly campaign for changes, such as vegetarianism or a ban on hunting. In general, they avoid confrontational tactics such as demonstrations and boycotts.
''Most of today's activists are new people who do not even know who Spira is,'' says Siegel, of Trans-Species.
The more radical groups are not only seizing the initiative from Spira by virtue of greater resources and more visible activities, they are challenging those who see value in his tactics, which include working with companies to figure out ways to reduce the exploitation of animals in industry, willingness to compromise with companies and even to publicly applaud those half measures.
''Industry knows very well that Spira doesn't represent the animal-rights movement but they try to pretend that he does,'' said Helen Jones, president of the International Society for Animal Rights, which is based in Clarks Summit, Pa. ''He's really part of the old humane movement. We say no animals in labs. They say give them bigger cages.''
Ingrid E. Newkirk, national director of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: ''He is hobnobbing in the halls with our enemy. Six or seven years ago, we had a lot in common. Everything he did then was putting gravel down for other people to pave roads, which was crucial. But I think Henry was deceived by the industry response. Henry was unable to cut himself loose from the mire of having become an industry mediator. The search for alternatives is a quite transparent ploy to maintain the status quo.''
But Spira also has many defenders, many of whom credit him with using the strategy that has paid off most in the long struggle. ''Henry has been absolutely right to say that at the time he began, groups had been seeking total abolition for 100 years without saving one animal,'' says Peter Singer. ''Through his work, there are millions of animals that have escaped acute pain and suffering because of the work already done on alternatives,'' he adds, referring to ways to test products without killing or maiming animals.
Frederick Davis, former president of the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, one of Spira's biggest financial backers, adds: ''There's no one like him who can talk with such credibility to either a toxicologist and or an activist. Henry's beyond knee-jerk emotionalism. He talks about parallel self-interest.''
Not that Spira's longterm goals are less revolutionary than those of the most radical animal-rights advocates. If he has his way, synthetics will one day replace leather and the fur industry will disappear. Spira readily concedes he would like to see humans become vegetarian. ''My dream is that people will come to view eating an animal as cannibalism,'' he says.
But Spira has repeatedly criticized the handful of visionary animal-rights advocates who destroy laboratories, spray paint on fur coats and threaten violence to researchers and their families.
''The people who burned flags in the antiwar movement didn't help it,'' Spira explains. He has shown no qualms about infuriating many animal-rights groups by praising companies that continue to test products on animals as long as he believes they are working to develop alternatives.
''I don't see the usefulness of pushing yourself into a corner where you are going to generate the most resistance,'' he says. ''What's interesting is what can be done. People and institutions can only move so much at one time. The task is to move people far enough that they can see the next step.''
A NATIVE OF BELGIUM, Spira immigrated to the United States with his family via Germany, England and Panama during his childhood years. He held a variety of jobs before finishing his working career as a New York City high school English teacher. During that time he was almost constantly involved in various trade-union reform efforts and civil-rights movements. ''My contribution has been to take the strategies of the human-rights movements and apply them here,'' he says.
Spira's first effort to publicize animal abuse came in 1976. Researchers at New York's American Museum of Natural History were blinding, deafening and mutilating the sex organs of cats to see how it affected their sexual performance. Spira wrote an expose in a neighborhood paper, which, along with the efforts of other activists, brought the experiments to the attention of Congress and the public. Finally, the museum was forced to scrap the program. Spira next organized lobbying to break a legislative logjam that had for 27 years prevented repeal of a New York law allowing researchers to use dogs and cats from public pounds.
''Those were victories, but we realized they were largely symbolic,'' says Spira, who noted that they affected, at most, thousands of animals in a nation that annually kills as many as 70 million, ranging from rats to primates, in research and testing, according to Government estimates. Thus, his next goal became abolition of the Draize test, named after John H. Draize, a Food and Drug Administration pharmacologist who, in the early 1940's, developed a method for categorizing the dangers to the eye of various chemicals used during World War II. His test, later adapted by the F.D.A., has been used by cosmetics and household-products companies for the last 40 years to measure how badly a product will irritate the human eye. The test uses white rabbits because their eyes do not tear, making it impossible for them to blink away whatever has been inserted in them, no matter how corrosive or blinding it may be.
The Draize test seemed to be begging for an attack. To start with, the results are subjective. What one lab assistant records as ''major irritation'' might be regarded as minor by another. In addition, scientists with no connection to the animal-rights movement had said it should be possible to find alternatives relatively easily. Finally, Draize users were vulnerable to bad publicity because the gruesome tests were being conducted in order to introduce new products that scarcely seemed essential given the thousands of cosmetics, cleaners, and similar products already available.
Spira and his allies spent most of 1979 gathering information and in fruitless private talks with Revlon. Using the Freedom of Information Act, Spira received reams of data from the Government on the number of animals used by different companies and graphic film of the distressing results for rabbits. Then he and Mark Graham, an advertising executive, went to the late Pegeen Fitzgerald, president of the Millenium Guild, a philanthropic organization involved with animal welfare, and immediately won her financial support for full-page newspaper ads. The ads were followed by demonstrations, letter-writing campaigns and eventually an international boycott.
By December 1980, Revlon announced it would offer $250,000 a year for three years for research at Rockefeller University on alternatives to the Draize test; research that is now financed by Government grants. After that, it was a simple step to persuade Avon Products, the industry leader, and other cosmetics companies to also contribute to research. In 1981, their grants led to the founding of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing, at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore. By last year, the center had received more than $4 million from the cosmetics industry and other businesses. Spira followed up with continual calls to companies about their research and internal programs to reduce animal usage.
''Over the years, we started seeing his point of view, and he saw our problems,'' says Janice Teal, director of product and package safety at Avon.
As the campaign against the Draize test gathered steam, Spira turned to a far more destructive test, the Lethal Dose 50. Thoughout a wide range of industries, the LD50 has long been the standard measure of how toxic the chemicals in various products are. In tests, scores, and in some cases hundreds of animals - typically rats - are destroyed in labs doing research for manufacturers ranging from toy companies to pesticide makers, to find out what concentration of various substances would kill 50 percent of the animals exposed to them. ''The issue shouldn't be how popular the animal is,'' says Spira, regarding the killing of rats. ''Rodents have feeling. They try to avoid pain. That's the reason they are used in psychology experiments.''
Often the tests are performed to satisfy labeling requirements even though it is known in advance that the substances are so toxic that warnings will be needed.
Prodded by Spira's campaign, leading toxicologists became more vocal about their long-held doubts about the test. ''There's a vanishingly small number of people who believe the LD50 provides useful information,'' says Shayne C. Gad, the G. D. Searle & Company researcher who is chairman of the Society of Toxicology Animals in Research Committee. ''Our society has said that the traditional Draize and LD50 tests are unwarranted except in special situations.''
Nevertheless, both the LD50 and Draize battles continue because companies are reluctant to abandon the tests. Companies fear that they would be exposing themselves to charges of recklessness - and massive punitive damages - if they were to abandon such tests before Federal regulators unambiguously endorse a non-animal alternative.
Government agencies are being urged by a variety of industries and some members of Congress to change regulations that encourage, and in some cases require, tests many toxicologists say are frequently unnecessary. And research on alternatives is a hot topic in toxicology circles. Five different journals have sprung up in the last six years to report on such non-animal testing techniques as work with tissue cultures and computer simulation.
To be sure, progress is too slow for many animal-rights activists. ''Habits and fixed ways of doing things, such as treating animals in laboratories as mere tools or objects, die very slowly,'' says a position paper on animal testing from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Animal-rights activists say that continued over-reliance on animal testing actually harms humans also by absorbing tax dollars that could be better spent on preventive medicine and research using humans who have diseases.
Scientists respond that the protesters do not understand how long it takes to prove that new test methods are reliable.
''The animal-rights people have oversimplified some very complex issues,'' says Frankie Trull, president of the National Association for Biomedical Research, a Washington-based organization defending the use of some animal testing. ''They tend to overestimate how much you can do with computer models and tissue samples.''
Computers and automated lab equipment are continually lowering the costs of the alternatives and expanding the amount of information they offer to toxicologists. In-vitro tests, as test-tube procedures are called, can provide clues at the molecular level as to why something is happening. In-vivo, or animal tests, have often done no more than demonstrate that an animal is or is not affected by a certain level of chemical exposure or treatment.
In any event, scientists say, it is often essential to test on live animals because their complicated responses, such as the reaction of the immune system to a foreign substance, cannot be duplicated by any combination of test tube procedures.
''It's not likely that a single-cell animal in a petri dish is going to tell you much about learning disabilities.'' says Theodore Farber, a former health official of the Environmental Protection Administration. Nevertheless, even though tens of millions of animals are still maimed and killed annually in research and product testing, the animal-rights movement has come far enough that, in Spira's words, ''It's no longer macho to use animals.'' Indeed, groups like the Foundation for Biomedical Research say medical research is already being hurt by restrictions put on animal use and the growing number of young researchers who dislike working with animals. In toxicology circles, the ''three R's'' stand for: reducing the number of animals used in testing, refining tests so that they are less painful, and, where possible, replacing animals altogether with other tests.
Today, scores of companies are reporting progress in reducing their reliance on animal testing. Colgate-Palmolive, which has developed a test to screen new substances on egg membranes instead of animals, reported to the United States Department of Agriculture that it used just 244 animals last year (the annual reports do not count mice and rats). The Noxell Corporation announced late last year that it would test the potential for all new cosmetics to irritate eyes on a mouse-tissue culture in a test tube instead of using rabbits' eyes, leading to a string of announcements last spring and summer from other cosmetics companies that they too were halting or suspending most or all of their rabbit tests in favor of various test tube alternatives or a policy of using previously proved formulations.
SPIRA REMAINS INVOLVED in animal-testing issues. However, by starting the chicken campaign, he is adding his voice to those who want to shift the attention of animal-rights activists and the public to the 5 billion animals of the farm sector.
''The society makes a statement that all lives are not equal by eating animals,'' says Spira. ''It's absurd in that context to think that you can eliminate laboratory tests before doing anything about farm animals.''
Spira concedes, however, that for the immediate future the best he can hope for is more-humane killing.
''Clearly, animal rights and eating animals don't mesh,'' says Spira. ''However, while it's going on you want to at least reduce pain and suffering. Once people think about it, they realize that it's not a thing under the cellophane, it's a living being.''
In addition to the nascent Perdue campaign, for example, he is backing reforms on how veal calves are fed and shipped. He would also like to see importation of an Australian experiment in which livestock are sold at electronic auctions, on computer screens, like over-the-counter securities on Wall Street, instead of forcing the animals to undergo the stress of shipment to live auctions.
''An improvement in the lives of 1 percent of farm animals would do more to reduce animal suffering than eliminating all of the testing,'' says Spira. He sees the farm campaign as more difficult than the lab campaign not because of the greater number of animals, but because of the public's attitude.
''People who eat animals don't want to read about how they got to their plate,'' Spira says. ''It's hard to do things that make consumers uncomfortable.''
Or producers. In taking on farming, Spira and animal-rights activists are dealing with opponents who have a far greater economic stake in using animals than companies that test products on them. And most are dismissive. ''Henry's much better at understanding what is achievable and what is a pipedream than most, but when it comes to farm animal production and care, he's out of his bailiwick,'' says Steven Kopperud, executive director of the Animal Industry Foundation, an educational organization based in Arlington, Va., and financed by farmers and agricultural corporations. ''We can't afford, either economically or in terms of what is best for animals, to make changes based on what makes Henry sleep poorly.''
Spira is not likely to be dissuaded by such opposition, though. He is not looking for quick victories. When asked what his epitaph should be, he ponders and suggests, ''He pushed the peanut forward.''

FREEING THE WHALES
How the Media Created the World's Greatest Non-Event.
By Tom Rose.
Illustrated. 318 pp. New York:
Birch Lane Press/Carol Publishing Group.
$18.95.
 For two weeks in October 1988, the eyes of the world were riveted on Barrow, Alaska, a frozen outpost 320 miles above the Arctic Circle, where three gray whales were trapped in a hole in the ice. The whales had stayed behind the pack to gorge on crustaceans and hadn't noticed when it was time to leave. Normally they would have drowned, as hundreds of others do every year. Their plight was a perfectly ordinary one, a routine Darwinian cruelty, and it would have gone unremarked but for one thing: the presence of a satellite dish and a television studio. 
NBC showed the first pictures. America immediately fell in love with the whales, and after that they had to be saved. The rescue of the magnificent battered creatures, struggling to survive, became the lead story on the nightly news, displacing the Presidential election campaign. By the time the rescue was over, it had cost $5.75 million and almost toppled the Government of Iceland. Japan, a whale-eating nation, thought it was a hoot, and one of its networks dispatched Tom Rose, a television news reporter and executive, to report on this bizarre American obsession.
''Freeing the Whales'' is Mr. Rose's version of the story behind the rescue. It's a detailed, somewhat stiff account (though the author does let himself go once, in a pretend moon-walking scene on the ice). Some of it reads like a PBS nature special, and it suffers from a bloated middle. But Mr. Rose has a wonderful ability to make connections, and the story he tells is funny, full of ironies and about many more things than the whales. It's about the reporters who converged on Barrow in their designer parkas (a boorish lot, arrogant and superficial, Mr. Rose thinks), who had to cope with frozen jaws and outdoor plumbing in subzero weather. It's about the Inupiat Eskimos, a people whose culture was trampled by the march of civilization and who had declined into alcoholism and idleness. And it's about self-promotion, public relations and the way so much of life has become just a matter of image.
For journalists, Barrow was a hardship post. One hundred and fifty of them descended on a town with only 80 hotel rooms. The Top of the World Hotel, a no-star establishment that did not take credit cards, got $300 a night by auctioning off rooms that were already occupied. (The previous guests were simply thrown out into the street.) Less affluent reporters paid homeowners $100 for space on cold floors. Blankets and running water were extra. A lukewarm five-minute shower cost $50. Everyone smelled. Eskimos in the transportation business were just as quick as the hoteliers to understand the economics of scarcity. The going rate for a one-way sled ride to the whales (17 miles) was $200. First-class passengers covered themselves with polar bear blankets and down sleeping bags. Economy-class reporters made do with bloodstained caribou hides and occasionally shared a sled with a dead walrus.
THE rescue effort, orchestrated by Greenpeace, brought about a collaboration between natural enemies: environmentalists and the oil industry. The two icebreakers belonging to the Coast Guard were out of commission, and the oil companies saw a public relations opportunity. They had long been lobbying to drill in the middle of a national wildlife refuge and quickly realized the value of helping to rescue the whales. However, their rescue operation foundered.
Next came another unlikely group of saviors. Eskimos wielding chain saws and small de-icers (donated by a Minneapolis company) kept the ice from freezing over the whales. These were the very same Eskimos who would have ''harvested'' the grays had the reporters and television cameras not been there to see them. The last in a long line of improbable rescuers were the Russians (invited by Greenpeace). They were delighted to be asked. For decades the West had sneered at them for being backward barbarians. Now the United States, their dearest enemy and the technological wonder of the world, was helpless, stuck without a decent icebreaker to its name. The Russians had only to cut a path through the ice and they would be transformed into instant humanitarians. Never mind that Russia is one of the four largest whale-hunting nations in the world (Norway, Iceland and Japan are the other three).
The author is ambivalent about the meaning of all this. He calls the whales' entrapment ''the world's greatest non-event'' and he faults the news media for missing the real story - Barrow and its drunken Eskimos. But he also calls the rescue ''exhilarating,'' ''the story of a lifetime, television journalism at its apex.'' Which was it? It was the sort of thing television does very well - an emotional story that doesn't need to be analyzed.
The final irony is that the rescue may well have been for nothing, that the whales may never have made it to Mexico past the polar bears, killer whales and sharks waiting for them along the Pacific coast. The whales weren't tagged, so we'll never know. It's just as well.
 
LIKE A CAT STUCK IN A TREE
 In many ways, this was the story television was created to cover. . . . It captured the imagination of millions of people in a way network executives had rarely seen. Only the immediacy of television could convey the whales' almost hypnotic allure. Somewhat the same way that a cat stuck in a tree could mobilize an entire town, three gray whales stuck in Arctic ice mobilized an entire world.
Within hours of the first NBC broadcast on Thursday, October 13, six days after the whales were first discovered, the network's New York switchboard was jammed with hundreds of calls from ordinary citizens around the country. They wanted to know how they could help. Friday morning, Greenpeace's Washington office handled hundreds more from concerned members.
The people had spoken. What started out as an ideal story for NBC to use as a ''kicker,'' a lighthearted piece used to close a news broadcast, for a brief time became almost a national obsession. . . . Just three weeks before a Presidential election, and three days after they were first reported, the stranded whales became the top story on each network newscast. Among the estimated 30 million people who watched the whales gasp for air on Sunday's evening newscasts was President Ronald Reagan. He penned a note reminding himself to ask about the whales the following morning at his daily 9:00 AM briefing with senior White House staff members. Perhaps ''helpless'' was not the best word to describe the three whales. They clearly had done something that most other creatures could not do. Nine days after discovery, the whales compelled the most powerful man on earth to action.

THE LONE STAR
The Life of John Connally.
By James Reston Jr.
Illustrated. 691 pp. New York:
An Edward Burlingame Book/Harper & Row. $25.
 On Jan. 22, 1988, John Connally, at one time among the most powerful political figures in the country and an aspirant for America's highest office, watched as his possessions were auctioned off by a Houston gallery. Having amassed $93 million in debts, he declared personal bankruptcy in July 1987. Yet rather than hiding in shame, Mr. Connally made himself the plucky symbol for his state's economic depression. ''This is not the demise of Texas, nor is this the demise of John and Nellie Connally,'' the former Texas Governor told the assembled throng. ''There are lots of places in the world we haven't seen. Lots of things we haven't done.'' 
The places he had seen and the things he had done are the subject of James Reston Jr.'s major new biography, ''The Lone Star.'' Mr. Connally's friendships with two Presidents, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon; the assassin's attack he survived while riding with John F. Kennedy in Dallas in 1963; his late-in-life switch from Democrat to Republican; his 1975 trial for accepting a $10,000 bribe from the dairy lobby, together with his acquittal; his embarrassing race for the Presidential nomination in 1980; and his recent bankruptcy - all are here in greater detail than ever before.
This rich detailing compensates to a great extent for the biographer's lack of access to Mr. Connally. The notes indicate that Mr. Reston, the author of several works of fiction and nonfiction, had only two meetings with his subject, and was barred from examining the Connally papers (which were donated to the Johnson Library in 1987 with the understanding that they would be sealed for five years). Fortunately, though the Connally perspective is missing, there were other sources on ''Big John.'' The chapter on the bribery trial, for example, is told from the point of view of Mr. Connally's accuser, Jake Jacobsen, the lobbyist for the milk producers and himself presented as a pathetic portrait of sleaze.
It is not hard to see why Mr. Connally was unwilling to confide in Mr. Reston. Here is the author's description of him as he assumed the governorship of Texas in 1963: ''He stood in his elegant boots with the wealthy over the poor, the business executive over the working man, white over black and Hispanic, the glamorous over the commonplace. In short, he symbolized Texas royalty over Texas peasantry. He was a taunting, polarizing figure, engendering feelings of intense loyalty and utter contempt, even hate.''
Much of the information for the chapters on Mr. Connally's Texas years comes from his implacable Texas-liberal Democratic foes, who were frequently the victims of his take-no-prisoner politics. Mr. Reston recounts the oft-told tale of vote fraud in L.B.J.'s 1948 race for the United States Senate, but with a new wrinkle: the possibility that Mr. Connally, who was Johnson's campaign manager, may have personally forged some of the voter signatures that appeared alphabetically in the same green ink on the registration lists of Jim Wells County in south Texas. The highly questionable votes from south Texas gave Johnson one of the most crucial victories of his career.
The author also develops a provocative theory that Mr. Connally, rather than Kennedy, was the true target of the assassin Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963. After Oswald defected to the Soviet Union, his United States Marine Corps discharge was reclassified from honorable to ''undesirable.'' According to Mr. Reston, Oswald's service in the Marines was the one significant achievement of the disturbed loner's life.
At the time of the reclassification, Mr. Connally was Kennedy's Secretary of the Navy. Oswald wrote to the fellow Texan in January 1962, appealing to him to look into the matter. But Mr. Connally, who already had resigned his post, brushed him off and routinely forwarded Oswald's letter to his successor. Mr. Reston believes that at this juncture Oswald's hatred of the United States Government became focused on Mr. Connally.
Whatever the truth, Mr. Connally survived that day in Dallas to become a national presence. Presidents Johnson and Nixon both had the highest regard for his bold, sometimes ruthless political judgment. Johnson took his best friend's advice not to run for a second Presidential term in 1968. Mr. Reston says Mr. Nixon had almost a schoolboy crush on the handsome, suave Texan, the man who told him to burn the Watergate tapes: ''Have Ziegler assemble the White House press corps in the Rose Garden, pile up all the tapes, set a match to them, and let them film the bonfire.''
Mr. Reston grapples with the question of why Mr. Connally, surely an equal of the Presidents he advised, found so little favor outside his home state. Mr. Reston embraces Johnson's criticism that Mr. Connally, who shared L.B.J.'s humble rural roots, had no compassion. ''I should have spent more time with that boy,'' Johnson complained after Mr. Connally agreed to serve as Mr. Nixon's Secretary of the Treasury. ''His problem is he likes those oak-paneled rooms too much.'' For his part, Mr. Connally attributed his humiliating defeat in the 1980 race for the Presidential nomination ($11 million spent, one Republican convention delegate won) to the fact that ''I reminded everybody of Lyndon.''
Once out of politics, Mr. Connally joined the former Texas Lieut. Gov. Ben Barnes in a Texas real estate and development partnership, and together in the early 1980's, backed by major lenders, they set out to make some big money. But the boldness that was Mr. Connally's hallmark in politics did not translate well into the business arena, and the last glimpse in this biography is of the famous wheeler-dealer seeing his furniture and keepsakes disappear into the hands of the highest bidders. Even Mr. Reston is moved by Mr. Connally's performance during the auction.
''At this moment John Connally rose to a level of nobility he had never before achieved in his lifetime,'' Mr. Reston writes. ''His fellow Texans were taking heart from his handling of the situation.'' But a few pages later the author comes back down to earth, adding, ''On no one's mind were the hundreds who had gone under less elegantly as a result of Connally's business folly or high dreams and unbridled avarice.''

Pro Tennis Spurred by the Diversity of Its Stars

BYLINE: By DIANA NYAD; Diana Nyad worked as a broadcasterfor USA Network during the 1989 United States Open.

 BODY:

WHEN Billie Jean King thrashed
Bobby Riggs in their Houston Astrodome circus match in September of 1973, grass-roots tennis in the United States got its biggest shot in the arm to date. By 1979, 32 million people a year took to the courts for their recreation and thus racquet sales and court construction were at an all-time high. Now those enterprises are waning as people forgo their racquets (the most recent figure is 18 million United States players) for the new rush onto public golf courses.
Tennis participation may have trailed off but, as the men's and women's professional seasons wind up this month in New York, the spectator surge toward the sport has expanded significantly. There are many reasons for the popularity of the professional game. 
You can virtually watch matches from your home every weekend of the year now, and cable channels offer as many as 12 hours of live action daily during the full two weeks of the four major events, the Grand Slams. ESPN brings us the early rounds of the Australian and French Opens. HBO takes us through highlights of Wimbledon's two weeks, and the USA Network allows us to follow the United States Open from the first day of the tournament.
In part, the increased television coverage stems from the phenomenon that tennis simply lends itself to the medium better than most sports. You get to see the players' faces and bodies with such clarity that the emotional drama looms larger than life. As the tennis buff Wilt Chamberlain puts it, ''Tennis makes for great theater.''
Another factor that has allowed tennis to spill over into a larger, crossover audience is the current star status of its players. Andre Agassi is on the cover of Gentlemen's Quarterly; Michael Chang goes on ''The Tonight Show'' and discusses his dates; John McEnroe is married to the actress Tatum O'Neal. Chris Evert's social life has always been tabloid material, going back to the days of her dates with Burt Reynolds, and her marriage now to a handsome skier, Andy Mill, has the look of old-time Hollywood coupledom. These show-biz tidbits, not a player's net game, are the elements that attract someone like my mother to a sport.
And professional tennis does not suffer at the moment from the boredom created by the homogeneous talent pools of other sports. Boxing is so desperate for a black versus white bout that a George Foreman-Gerry Cooney fight has been made. Tennis showcases teen-age millionaires against middle-age gladiators. Daughters of aristocratic tycoons face girls who got their first practice sneakers from the Y.W.C.A. Lost and Found. Athletes from the Communist bloc routinely oppose players honed by the opportunities and pressures of Western capitalism.
Indeed, the expanse of international representation is another key to the healthy numbers of fans newly piqued by tennis personalities. A Soviet player, Natalya Zvereva, goes public in her fight with the Soviet Tennis Federation to keep 70 percent of her prize money. Her countryman Andrei Chesnokov openly supports her. Then when Chesnokov shows flash and grit against Ivan Lendl at the 1989 United States Open, a packed house at the Grandstand court voices its approval of his stand, and his play, by chanting, ''Da, Chesy!''
And in one of the most dramatic matches at the Open, a black from Cameroon in Africa, who was discovered by Arthur Ashe, faces an Israeli who developed in the public parks of Tel Aviv. Yannick Noah prevailed over Amos Mansdorf that day in five hard-fought sets, but that match was more than tennis. Noah and Mansdorf seemed symbols of the wide spectrum of today's pros who have had their road paved by a few mavericks.
Billie Jean King drew thousands of women to the game. Arthur Ashe has inspired phenomenal growth in tennis opportunities for blacks. Bjorn Borg set off the Swedish explosion, which affected all of Western Europe, including West Germany, where Boris Becker and Steffi Graf have become national heroes. Guillermo Vilas's appeal spawned the clubs where Gabriela Sabatini eventually learned. And there is no telling how many street-fighting types have opened their eyes to tennis because of Jimmy Connors. A middle-class kid whose father collected the turnpike tolls in Belleville, Ill., Connors has played every point of his career like it was the last punch of a 15-round spectacle.
The Open era of tennis technically began in 1968 but it has taken some 20 years for the next generation to break through the white, country club image that once limited the sport's public appeal. Previously, only an exceptional talent, like Althea Gibson, could penetrate the domain of the privileged, but today Zina Garrison leads the way for hundreds of youths from minority groups successfully coming out of public parks.
It is true that recent American success -Chang, Krickstein, Gilbert, Mayotte, Courier, Sampras - has revived fans' interest, but even more significant is the fact that so many of the young stars are first-generation Americans who bring the attention of ethnic minorities to the game.
On court, Chang, the son of Taiwanese parents, embodies the Asian value system of respect and calm. The 13-year-old sensation Jennifer Capriati is becoming as known for her fun-loving, pasta-adoring Italian dad as she is for her accurate forehands. Mary Joe Fernandez - born in the Dominican Republic and raised in Miami - has created a Latin following, especially in this country's Spanish-speaking strongholds. And Agassi's play fulfills the dream of his Armenian father, a former boxer who hung a tennis ball over his son's crib in hopes that one day Andre would be a champion at the noble game of tennis.
These names - Agassi, Connors, Garrison, Noah, Chang, Chesnokov - instantly suggest the variety of race, religion, and economic background that has brought tennis into the legitimate big leagues of sport. Professional tennis has arrived at its most diverse moment and hence at a moment of immense popularity.

Tackling the N.F.L. Labor Impasse

BYLINE: By GERALD W. SCULLY; Gerald W. Scully is professor of economics at the University of Texas at Dallas. His most recent book is ''The Business of Major League Baseball'' published by the University of Chicago Press.

 BODY:
Union-management relations in football are the worst among the professional team sports. The two sides barely exchange civilities, much less negotiate issues.
Recently, the N.F.L. Players' Association suffered yet another defeat in this bitter battle. This time, a United States Court of Appeals ruled that the free-agency clauses of the 1982 collective bargaining contract could not be challenged as a violation of antitrust simply because current negotiations were at an impasse. 
The suit by the union was the latest in a series of contentious actions that have taken place since 1982, and especially since the failed negotiations and resulting strike in 1987. The rub - the source of the impasse - is free movement for players. The union wants unrestricted free agency for its veterans. The owners do not.
Why has this labor situation deteriorated so badly? Partly, player-owner relations are bad in the N.F.L. because the union acts more like it represents pipefitters than an association of athletes. When Ed Garvey, a Harvard-trained lawyer with strong labor movement sympathies, took over the union, he sought to structure the collective bargaining negotiations in a style reminiscent of many factory agreements. Gene Upshaw is cut from the same cloth.
Under their leadership the union in the early 1980's pushed for a fixed player share of the national TV contract that would be divided among the players by a union scale formula. Heavily weighted in the pay scale was experience or seniority. Players would be paid by job description and seniority.
This is a harebrained scheme that may work for pipefitters but has no place in football. The existing wide spread in salaries between rookies, journeymen and veteran players is a device to induce all players to perform at peak levels. Superior performance leads to the opportunity to earn a truly grand salary. Shrinking the differential pay among players reduces the incentive to play at peak levels.
Marvin Miller, the past director of the Major League Baseball Players' Association, came to the players after a long association with the United Steelworkers. Shrewdly, he left the idea of negotiated pay scales behind him. Players are a bunch of individuals who can be organized into a collective force only if the issues are important to all. Larry Fleischer represented the N.B.A. players in a similar fashion.
Aside from the militancy and traditional union approach of the N.F.L. Players' Association, the economic structure in the game is sufficiently different from baseball and basketball to make one skeptical about whether unrestricted free agency will bring the golden age of astronomical salaries. Revenues in football are socialized. About 60 percent of club revenues come from the national TV contract and are split evenly among the clubs. Ticket sales are split 60-40. In baseball, about 40 percent of the revenue comes from the sale of broadcast rights. Roughly half comes from the national TV contract and half from the sale of local rights. The gate split is 85-15. Basketball has had a much lower revenue share from TV and splits the gate, 100-0.
The implication is obvious. There is little financial incentive to win in football. Surely, there is pride in winning. However, a club that improves its finish by purchasing high-priced talent gets to keep 1/28th of the increased revenue. The remainder goes to the other 27 clubs. Moreover, in a world in which games are sold out (season tickets are the norm in football), revenues do not rise much with a winning season. While it pays to buy high-priced playing talent in baseball and basketball, this is not the case in football.
What is to be done to break the union-management impasse in the N.F.L.? There are three options. The union can call another strike. The union will lose, if it chooses this path, partly because a large fraction of the players will defect. When the expected length of your career in football is less than three years (seven in baseball and basketball), risking a third of your salary does not make a whole lot of economic sense.
Second, the union can decertify itself. Decertification would remove the labor exemption under antitrust. The 28 clubs then would have independent unions that bargain with individual owners. Players become independent contractors. As such, they would be free to initiate moves between clubs. However, I doubt that Gene Upshaw and the union staff are altruistic enough to liquidate themselves out of a job.
The third alternative is for the union to negotiate incremental improvements in the conditions of free agency (reductions in compensation for lost free agents) and build new incentives for clubs to check their overall player costs (the basketball team salary cap would work in football) or financial incentives for clubs to win. Suppose the clubs kicked in $50 million of their more than billion-dollar revenues as a prize for the winner of the Super Bowl. Such a prize would be a strong incentive to win. The demand for winning will translate into a demand for veteran free agents. Fans, players, and even owners would benefit from greater financial incentives to win in football.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: Long Island City;
Ambitious Projects Delayed as Conversions Proceed

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Two New York City agencies - the Planning Commission and the Public Development Corporation - are preparing blueprints for the brighter future that seems to be in store for Long Island City now that Citicorp has planted a striking Manhattan-style office tower there.
But as the agencies put the finish coat on reports designed to guide development in Long Island City, one major developer, Leonard Stern, chairman of the Hartz Group, has lost patience with the slow pace of the city's planning and has given up a plan for a 1.6 million-square-foot building he had hoped to put up at a major intersection at the approach to the Queensboro Bridge.
Other projects also have been put on hold, and the frenzied pace of property trading and assemblages that the Citicorp project touched off has slowed. Meanwhile, small-scale redevelopment is taking place without reference to any overall plan that may be adopted. Cunard Line, an Austrian bank and other Manhattan companies are taking blocks of space in existing buildings, many of which are former factories converted into modern office space. 
''The study will give momentum to the entire redevelopment effort in Long Island City,'' said James Schmidt, a vice president for planning, design and construction for the Public Development Corporation, referring to the agency's review of the impact of an estimated 25 million square feet in proposed commercial and residential development projects there.
''We have focused on transportation both public and vehicular, and tried to show what the effect would be on the community and the region if proposed projects were built between now and 1997.
Some of these projects include the Hunters Point district on the East River, a 68-acre proposed city, state and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plan; any further development by Citicorp and the planned expansion at the International Design Center. There is a big push on now because officials hope to start the formal review process for the waterfront early next year.
While Mr. Schmidt's agency has focused on all of Long Island City, the Planning Department has zeroed in on a mile-long stretch of Jackson Avenue, a major commercial core of the evolving community.
Except for Citicorp at Court Square - the name for the bank's 50-story glass tower - Jackson Avenue is like much of the rest of Long Island City, a mix of industrial buildings, warehouses and factories, with a few houses and stores tucked in here and there. Most of the street is zoned for both manufacturing and commercial uses with an F.A.R. (floor-to-area ratio) development potential of five.
Because of its width, its abundant surface and subway transportation and the number of underused or vacant sites, planners feel that Jackson Avenue holds particular potential for further commercial development.
Planning Department officials said that their recomendations on rezoning and land use would be based on such issues as potential impact of development on employment, traffic and the environment.
Local business people, economic development officials and real estate professionals who were consulted in the preparation of the report said they do not expect to see the sort of blanket upzoning for Jackson Avenue that could transform the street into a corridor of high-rise office towers. Rather, these observers expect to see a study that promotes upscale development that would incorporate some of the existing industrial buildings on Jackson Avenue and the side streets.
Once completed, the report will be sent for comment to the borough president's offic, the PDC, the state's Urban Development Corporation, the Port Authority, community boards and business development organizations.
But as the city moves closer to opening the door to more development in Long Island City, some developers and other real estate professionals have expressed frustration with the pace of the review and planning process.
''Unfortunately, the risk-to-potential-reward factor is no longer in our favor,'' said Mr. Stern, chairman of the Hartz Group, a subsidiary of Hartz Development, which has built some 35 million square feet with a mix of uses in the New Jersey Meadowlands. Mr. Stern's company held an option to buy the Queens Mart site at the intersection of Northern Boulevard, Queens Boulevard and Jackson Avenue as well as a riverfront site where he wanted to build a 960-unit residential community.
''While we were going for the rezoning, the market softened and the projected costs went up,'' he said. ''For now we will concentrate on projects elsewhere.''
The owners of the waterfront site, RAK Tennis Corporation, where Hartz hoped to build apartments, will continue to pursue the development project.
The site where Mr. Stern wanted to put up an office building is five blocks from the Citicorp tower, the most visible symbol of the neighborhood's economic potential. Citicorp, which got a zoning change that let it build to an F.A.R. of 15, as well as $75 million in tax abatements, is transferring some 3,300 executives and other office employees to the office building.
The bank has the approvals for another tower of about 1.2 million square feet of space for the property it owns across 43d Street. But while a second building has been considered, Ann Roberts, a company spokesman, said there are no plans to start such a project.
Since the opening four years ago of the International Design Center, a four-building complex where a string of factories was coverted to showroom space for design and furniture companies, prices for buildings and properties have risen in Long Island City along with expectations about the future of the neighborhood. Citicorp's announcement in 1985 that it would build a front-office tower in that part of Queens pushed prices for property and buildings even further.
''Prices have stabilized,'' said Gail Roseman, an executive vice president with Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a brokerage and consulting company based in Astoria. ''But there is still a great deal of anticipation and expectations are high. One of the reasons is that Long Island City is considered by just about every major space-user looking to expand and considering places other than Manhattan.
''But unfortunately,'' she continued, ''for any company that wants brand new space sometime soon, there is nothing here yet.''
Even though it seems development is in a holding pattern, companies are coming across the river from Manhattan and some small office projects are moving forward.
Cunard, the international luxury cruise and hotel operator, expects to move 300 employees from its executive offices at 555 Fifth Avenue to a 70,000-square-foot space in the municipal garage building at Bridge Plaza early next year. The company has sublet the space from Med-Mac Properties, which has a long-term lease with the city for all of the 200,000 square feet of office space at the base of the garage.
The Cunard move, which would be the largest transfer from Manhattan after Citicorp's, will be into space intended primarily for its reservations department.
Laenderbank, an Austrian bank, recently bought a former Volunteers of America building at 43d Avenue between 23d and 24th Streets. It is renovating the five-story, 115,000-square-foot structure for computer operations and other back-office space.
Richard Zirinsky Associates, one of the largest property owners in Long Island City and the company that sold Laenderbank its building, is transforming a former tomato paste plant across Court Square from the Citicorp tower into an office building. According to Richard Zirinsky Jr., a principal in the company, the building, which has 126,000 square feet of space, will be ready for occupancy by January. Mr. Zirinsky said a lease for the entire building, at 45-18 Court Square, is pending.

HEADLINE: Union Square: Gritty Past, Bright Future

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
The people who live in the vicinity of Union Square are engaged in heated debate about the future of real estate development in their neighborhood. Some equate development with progress, saying that until the last few years the area was regarded by many as having no future at all; others worry that too much development will ruin its social and architectural diversity.
Like similar debates elsewhere in New York City, it is at its most intense now that only a few major developable sites remain, on the south side of of the square and the stretch of 14th Street just east of it. This focus was sharpened nearly two years ago when Zeckendorf Towers, a 652-apartment condomium and office complex, opened on the northeast corner of Union Square East and 14th Street. It transformed the neighborhood by proving that New Yorkers would pay $300,000 to $400,000 to live in an area that, not long before, was considered all but worthless.
That success also sharpened interest in the remaining developable sites, since their disposition will determine whether the current trend toward expensive housing and shopping will continue, which local developers and the city favor, or a niche in the neighborhood's upward mobility can be found into which some low-cost apartments and maybe a community center could be fitted. 
Until the last couple of years it would have been unthinkable for anyone to worry about Union Square's becoming too slick. The park itself was a rundown, rubble-strewn smudge, a drug-dealing center where Broadway and Park Avenue South come close to meeting at 14th Street. Several nearby S.R.O.'s housed the violent and the despairing, and the big S. Klein department store buildings on the east side of the square were empty hulks. Last December, Mays, another big retail presence at the foot of the park, also was closed.
''We moved here in 1983,'' Todd Haimes, who heads the Roundabout Theater, said of his off-Broadway stage company, which rents the auditorium of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union Building, once a headquarters for Tammany Hall, off the corner of 17th Street and Union Square East. ''I distinctly remember having coffee and a bagel and seeing people openly selling drugs outside the window, and then someone tried to rob the coffee shop, and there were people screaming and jumping all over each other to get out. It was the Wild West all over again.''
Local leaders argue that Union Square and most of 14th Street is a neighborhood looking for a theme. Between Seventh and Fifth Avenues, 14th Street is a thriving - if shabby, at least on the south side - discount shopping bazaar, whose merchants were drawn to the area by the floor-through design of old loft buildings. Merchants there pay high rents of up to $125 a foot and do an annual business of $200 million dealing with lower-income shoppers who come to their stores from all over the city.
The eastward march of this shopping activity is arrested at Union Square by the empty bulk of the former Mays department store between University Place and Broadway. On the next block is a tangled, decaying collection of one-story ''taxpayer'' stores fronting the stretch between Broadway and Fourth Avenue, which becomes Park Avenue South north of 14th Street.
The blockfront is controlled by a group headed by Philip Pilevsky, who has expressed an interest in building condominiums and offices on the site but who has not yet filed any formal plans.
Much of the block between Fourth and Third is controlled by Jeffrey Glick, a developer of luxury apartments who is negotiating with the city for a city-owned parking lot that holds the key to development there.
The block between Third and Second is a stretch of rundown tenements, some boarded up, that planners believe are too narrow and shallow to attract development as retail space. The next block, of slightly better low-cost rental apartment walk-ups, connects the eastern reach of the street to the fastness of Stuyvesant Town.
The arrival of the Roundabout at Union Square was an expression of the rising real estate values - and rising rents - that eventually reached East 14th Street and Union Square. William Zeckendorf Jr., who has made his mark in recent years by beating the competition into gentrifying areas, committed $200 million in 1985 to build his development in return for the city's agreeing to allow greater densities for the project and commit itself to cleaning up Union Square Park.
The city spent $3.8 million in the first phase of refurbishing the park, completed in May 1985, which banished the drug addicts and brought back green lawns and the sound of children's laughter.
Phases two and three, to rehabilitate the pavilion at the north end of the park and to expand the park's boundaries on its west side, are now in the design review stage and no date for the work has been set.
The Union Square Community Coalition, a local citizens group, sponsors noontime concerts in the park and a greenmarket brings shoppers from around Manhattan three days a week. Over the years, five structures around the square have been landmarked to protect the ornate turn-of-the century character of the area.
A total of $20 million is scheduled to be spent rebuilding 14th Street itself, from Ninth Avenue to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, including a complete repaving of the roadway, planting clusters of trees - an arrangement the Parks Department now prefers over stringing trees out at equal distances along the curb - and installing Bishop's Crook streetlamps of historic design.
While the city and a few big developers were doing their part, smaller initiatives by local businesses also had a great impact on the district. The lofts above West 14th Street's bustling discount stores have been converted to dwellings and office space, helping to displace the dingy, unused look that the street had in earlier years.
One of the pioneers was Ken Giddon, who opened his Rothman's men's clothing store on the corner of Park Avenue South and Union Square North in September 1986 and says he has not regretted it for a moment.
''Not being from New York I didn't have the historical background on how bad Union Square was supposed to have been,'' he said. ''I just looked and said, 'Hey, we're on a park, it's a transportation hub,' and besides, I couldn't afford the rents they wanted over nearer to Fifth Avenue.''
Down two blocks, on the east side of the square, a 40,000-square-foot Kiddie City children's toy and clothing outlet just opened on the ground floor of the ornate, cast-iron-front building that once housed Klein's Annex. And the 350,000 square feet of office space on the lower floors of in Zeckendorf Towers has been leased to Integrated Resources, the financial services company.
On the ground level of the Zeckendorf complex, A. & P. has opened the first modern supermarket that anyone can remember in the area. Also there are a new restaurant, Romeo's, a dry cleaner's, a Federal Express office and a small theater, the Vineyard, in space contributed by Mr. Zeckendorf.
The former Mays department store, owned by a partnership including Mr. Zeckendorf, is scheduled to become a vertical mall, with one of six retailers occupying each floor. So far, Pergament, the home-supplies retailer, and Marshall's, the discount clothing chain, have signaled an interest.
According to an economic survey of the area for local businesses by Robert B. Pauls, a Manhattan planning consultant, some 40,000 new white-collar jobs moved into the area between 1980 and 1987.
Zeckendorf Towers, completed a year and a half ago, has sold all but two of its condominium apartments at prices averaging $230,000, according to a spokesman, with some going for more than half a million. This means that home buyers invested $150 million in an area with a rough past but a promising future.
''Personally, I couldn't believe that people were paying that kind of money to live around here,'' said a local businessman, who refused to be named for fear of offending future customers. ''It kind of woke me up to how much things have changed around here.''
''It's well known that the best investment in this city is real estate, especially if it's in an area that's improving,'' said Adam Berwiss, an electronics engineer, who moved into a one-bedroom apartment in one of the Zeckendorf Towers a year ago. ''I think most of us are here for the same reason the other people are here - the price is right and it's a great area.''
A total of 15 new apartment buildings with more than 2,000 apartments have been or are being built within eight blocks north and south of the square, and between Seventh and First Avenues, according to the Pauls study. One of the new buildings, the Carlisle, on Union Square West, has 92 units and has been partially taken over by New York University as a student dormitory.
Suddenly, long-time residents say, the signs of gentrification are there for all to see: palmy restaurants, cleaners that charge $2 to wash and iron one shirt, women in silk suits and sneakers. The old-timers watch their new neighbors with the ambivalence of rustics watching summer people move in next door - glad to have the new money in the area but afraid that too much of it will leave no room for them.
''It's very important for us to keep the ethnic and social diversity that exists here,'' said Evelyn Strouse, a writer who has lived a block and a half from Union Square since 1981 and who is now co-chairman of the Union Square Community Coalition. ''This neighborhood has a long history of being a home to artists and workers and people of various colors and races and religions and people of very diverse incomes, and we'd like to keep them here. They give the area its punch and its charm, and anyway, we've got enough gentrified neighborhoods in this city already.''
The city's Division of Real Property indicated it wanted more gentry on 14th Street, however, when it proposed, last fall, to rezone the block between Fourth and Third Avenues to allow more apartments to be built on it. This would raise the value of a .67-acre vacant lot it owns between the Palladium disco, formerly the Academy of Music, and the former Luchow's restaurant.
Mr. Glick, president of the Glick Organization, controls the block by his ownership of the Palladium, the Luchow's building and most of the other properties. A developer of big, expensive apartment houses, he said he shares Ms. Strouse's appreciation of the district's special qualities, but left open whether he was willing to make room for them in his plans.
''I love the area,'' he said. ''It has everything. You're on the East Side, you have the subways, you're near the F.D.R. Drive and you're near the Village, it has a park - it's all connected in that one area, and I think that gives Union Square a nice, homey feeling.''
But, given the current slack in the city's residential market, Mr. Glick cautioned local residents against believing that any great new projects were just around the corner.
''It's not going to happen all at once,'' he said. ''Zeckendorf did his site, eventually I'll do mine, and after a while it will done right down to First Avenue.''
But Mr. Glick's idea of getting 14th Street ''done'' all the way to First Avenue is not what several local business and community groups have in mind, even though the developer did win friends by donating $1,500 to Ms. Strouse's group.
Where Mr. Glick and other property owners prefer to increase density and therefore financial returns, local groups like Ms. Strouse's want less density, along with assurances that lower-income people will still be able to find affordable housing in the neighborhood after redevelopment.
Two of the groups favoring this approach, the Union Square-14th Street Local Development Corporation and the Union Square-14th Street Business Improvement District, are housed and heavily supported by Consolidated Edison Company, which has headquarters on the north side of 14th Street between Irving Place and Third Avenue. Besides having an interest in protecting the area around its massive headquarters from decline, Con Ed also owns a sizable parking lot and potential development site at Third Avenue between 14th and 15th Streets.
At present, like Mr. Glick, the big utility has no plans to develop the site, said Laurie Hanson, a company spokesman.
The city originally proposed zoning the Glick block with a floor-area ratio of 10 to 12, which would permit streetwalls 125 to 150 feet high with setbacks going up over 200 feet.
''The issue around Union Square is diversity,'' said Jack Goldstein, chairman of the planning and zoning committee for Community Board 5, which takes in the park and parts of 14th Street. ''You have here, in the center of Manhattan, an area that in some way or another has managed to maintain economic and social diversity as a source of neighborhood pride. I would say that the affordable housing situation there is no worse and in some ways a little better than in the rest of the city.''
A coalition of local groups, including the Local Development Corporation and the Business Improvement District, have proposed far smaller buildings, with an F.A.R. of about 6 and a streetwall no more than 85 feet high. They would also like to save the Luchow facade and interior and include some low-cost housing. Most importantly, Ms. Strouse argued, any new building would have to be low enough to let sunlight reach the square.
''People here remember what the city tried to do with the Coliseum site, putting up a tremendous tower that would cast shadows over Central Park,'' she said, speaking of the original zoning proposal. ''It would be crazy to put something that big on the south side of the square, where the sun comes from.''
The city has since withdrawn its original proposal and is studying new options for the site.
''It's the hottest spot on 14th Street,'' said Edward Barbarini, spokesman for the Department of General Services, of the Glick block. ''We thought our proposal was a fine opportunity for the productive use of city property, but the people there were not crazy about it, so we brought it back.''

HEADLINE: Rise in Housing Costs Scrutinized

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
HOME prices in New Jersey sharply outpaced income growth in the 1980's and exacerbated a worsening housing outlook, said a study released last week.
''Housing affordability declined dramatically over large areas of the state in a relatively short period of time,'' said the report by the New Jersey Economic Policy Council, which advises Gov. Thomas H. Kean on the economy.
In real terms, home ownership became an increasingly elusive goal for low- and moderate-income families, and housing choices became sharply limited for middle- and upper-middle-income families.
''If you own your house, you're in great shape,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, chairman of the council and a professor of economics at Rutgers University. ''For first-time home buyers, housing has become more expensive.'' 
 
'Problems of Prosperity'
Mr. Seneca said the study was ''an expression of concern over what I call the problems of prosperity.''
The study also concludes that the state's population growth must begin increasing at a faster rate if it is to meet the growing demand for employees needed to continue prosperity in New Jersey.
By 1987, average housing prices ranged from $150,000 to $200,000 across the state except for the southern area encompassing Burlington County and including parts of Atlantic and Salem Counties.
In more than two-thirds of the state's towns, housing prices rose more than 70 percent from 1984 through 1987. In more than 10 percent of the state's towns, housing prices more than doubled during the four-year period. The sharpest price increases were in the northeast and central parts of the state, the report showed.
But income did not grow nearly as fast, putting home ownership out of the reach of many families.
 
Steep Increases Found
Of the 555 municipalities studied, 44 percent had housing prices grow between two and four times faster than the average income increase.
In the northeast region covering Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, Morris and Sussex Counties, 70 percent of communities had housing prices increase two to four times faster than income.
In the region covering Warren, Somerset, Hunterdon and Middlesex Counties, 60 percent of communities had housing prices grow two to four times faster than income.
In 41 percent of communities in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, housing costs grew two to four times faster than income.
In the area covering Mercer, Burlington, Camden and Gloucester Counties, housing costs kept better pace with income.
About 38 percent of communities had housing prices and income grow at about the same rate, and in nearly all the other communities in that region housing prices increased at between one and two times the rate at which income grew.
 
Most Affordable Region
Housing remained most affordable in the southern region encompassing Salem, Cumberland, Atlantic and Cape May Counties, where housing costs increased at the same rate or slower than income increases in 43 out of 68 communities.
While southern New Jersey has traditionally been more affordable than the northern parts of the state, the gap between housing prices in the two areas widened between 1984 and 1987, the report found.
For example, in 1984 the average house cost $96,133 in the Bergen-Passaic-Hudson region and $97,659 in the Sussex-Morris-Essex-Union region.
At the same time, the average house cost $57,653 in the Salem-Cumberland-Atlantic-Cape May region, $60,231 in the Mercer-Burlington-Camden-Gloucester area and $86,984 in the Warren-Hunterdon-Somerset-Middlesex region. In the Monmouth-Ocean area, the average home price was $78,539 in 1984.
By 1987, however, the average house cost had risen to $185,533 in the Bergen-Passaic-Hudson region and to $178,453 in the Sussex-Morris-Essex-Union region. Likewise, large increases were found in the Warren-Hunterdon-Somerset-Middlesex region, where average prices climbed to $159,093, and in the Monmouth-Ocean region, where average prices increased to $146,692.
But average prices in the Mercer-Burlington-Camden-Gloucester area increased to only $86,817 by 1987 and increased to only $73,726 in the Salem-Cumberland-Atlantic-Cape May area.

HEADLINE: Helping Troubled Boys Save and Study for College

BYLINE: By TESSA MELVIN

DATELINE: DOBBS FERRY

 BODY:
FOR Cesar Alvarez, a senior at Hastings High School, the pressure was intense.
A final draft of his paper examining the light and imagery in ''The Scarlet Letter'' wasn't going well, and Cesar needed the grade. The New York City Police Academy entrance exam loomed, and his twice-weekly commute to Queens for tutoring for the exam was helpful but time-consuming. Then there was his job pumping gas at the local Getty station.
If last May was a tough month, Cesar had seen much worse in his 19 years. But now, he says, life looks very good indeed, a turnaround that began when he came to the county five years ago. 
 
Alumnus of Job-Training Program
Cesar is an alumnus of the Children's Village, the residential treatment center here, and of a new program at the center that provides college scholarships and job training to some of the troubled boys.
Cesar Alvarez graduated from Hastings High in June and scored 90 out of 100 on the Police Academy exam. He is one of 10 Children's Village alumni who have graduated from various high schools in the New York City area and headed on to full-time jobs. Five of these boys are now in college: at Westchester County Community College, Hunter College, the University of New Haven, Sullivan County Community College and Canisius College.
The 10 boys are all scholarship participants in the five-year-old Work Appreciation for Youth program, an unusual experiment to help boys learn work ethics and job skills. While every boy at the Children's Village has the opportunity to participate in the work program, about 15 are chosen each year for the scholarship program.
With the help of anonymous donors who contributed $350,000 in start-up costs, the Work Appreciation scholarship program helps the most promising of the program's graduates work toward a college education or post-high school job training. After evaluating the results, the program's original donors recently agreed to contribute an additional $720,000.
This latest contribution will pay for more counselors, finance research efforts and provide $1,000 to each college student in the program for four years and the same amount for two years to high school graduates needing job training.
The center here is home for 314 boys with severe behavior and emotional problems. Many of the boys have had to be removed from their homes; others have been taken from the foster-care system, where they have lived all their lives.
Cesar said he came to the Children's Village voluntarily in l984, ''depressed and subject to violent mood swings.'' His mother, Rosa Manno, was unable to control him, and his father, Cesar said, is a ''career felon.''
 
A Last Resort
For 138 years, originally in Manhattan and the last 87 in Westchester, the treatment center has been the home of last resort for abused and neglected boys in the New York City area.
''These are underprivileged children, multiplied by the most extreme economic and emotional deprivation that exists anywhere,'' Nan Dale, the executive director of Children's Village, said in describing the 5- to 15-year-old boys in her care. ''They are the most troubled of the troubled kids,'' Mrs. Dale said. Reading levels are typically four to six years below the grade typical for their ages, Mrs. Dale said, adding, ''When these kids make it, it is all the more remarkable.''
Typically, students are selected for the scholarship program at age 13. Those selected must sign a contract agreeing they will save at least $300 each year until they graduate from high school. They also agree to contribute a fixed portion of their earnings to a special fund, which the donors match. The donors increase the contributions to students who have outstanding performances.
Signing the contract binds participants to regular meetings with a Children's Village counselor for five years after they leave the campus and a promise that they will get tutoring whenever it is necessary. Those who leave the program without graduating from high school forfeit all donor funds and get their own savings back only when they reach graduating age. Participants in the Work Appreciation program may work toward a maximum donor contribution of more than $4,000 for a total saving of about $7,000 when added to their own earnings.
 
71 Percent Remain in School
Of the 63 boys who were enrolled in the Work Appreciation program during the first four years, 71 percent, or 45 boys, are still in school, working part time and saving money toward further education or job training. Early surveys indicate that about half of this group are aiming toward studies after high school, most have experienced setbacks and most have avoided delinquency.
The additional $720,000 grant, the largest single contribution Children's Village has ever received, will allow the treatment center to complete a 10-year study of the achievements and difficulties of children in foster care, and the effect of the Work Appreciation scholarship program.
''There's a certain self-fulfilling prophecy just in being selected for the scholarship program,'' Mrs. Dale said. ''We tell each boy, 'You have been chosen because you are smart and the staff thinks you have a great future,' but this program communicates from beginning to end, 'You are in control of your own destiny.' ''
The message is given early on. Following the first level of basic cottage chores, performed with no pay, each new job level in the Work Appreciation program requires potential ''employees'' to apply, provide an ''employment history'' and be interviewed wearing a suit. Each boy is paid a ''salary'' and may be promoted or sometimes dismissed. Boys advance through four levels of the work program, the last consisting of community jobs off campus and unpaid internships at hospitals and other organizations. The fifth level is the scholarship program.
 
Bus Outfitted With Computers
One of the 22 work sites available at the Children's Village campus is the computer bus, a vehicle outfitted with 18 computers, three printers and a selection of software. Boys who wish to take the 14-session course aboard the bus must apply and then pay $1 for each session. Graduates of the program may then apply to become teaching assistants on the bus, which pays $1.50 a session.
The bus has started to travel throughout Westchester, beginning with a program with the Meadow Pond Elementary School after-school program in South Salem. Each Thursday afternoon, a work counselor from Children's Village accompanied by his young assistants arrives at the Meadow Pond School to instruct 15 fourth, fifth and sixth graders on the bus.
Cesar Alvarez is a typical scholarship recipient. After leaving Children's Village in 1985, he entered Bryant High School in Queens as a freshman. Although he did well the first year, in his sophomore year, Cesar conceded that he attended school only for football practice. After a few months wandering about Queens as a truant, Cesar asked to return to Children's Village. He was admitted to one of the treatment center's group homes and entered Hastings High School, from which he graduated in June.
 
Holding Down Three Jobs
While Cesar awaits the results of his final interviews for admission to the Police Academy, he is holding down three jobs, as a driver for Hastings Taxi, a gas station attendant for the Power Test station in Dobbs Ferry and a teacher's aide at the Children's Village.
He also spends 30 hours each week as an auxiliary policeman in Queens, and in September, Cesar was named Auxiliary Cop of the Month, an award for his consistent work habits.
Cesar will be leaving his job at Children's Village soon because he has just been hired by a Westchester construction company. The pay, he said, is better, and he needs the money to make payments on the red l980 Datsun he bought recently.
While he waits to hear from the Police Academy, he has plenty to keep him busy and happy, and Cesar observed: ''One thing I like about Westchester. You can find jobs so quickly. Most kids here are going to school or have their parents to rely on.''

SAPPHO EXHIBITION
''Imaging Sappho,'' an exhibition of 16 paintings by Ellen Evjen, attempts to evoke the spirit of a woman who is generally acknowledged to have been one of the greatest lyric poets in history. The exhibition opens tomorrow through Dec. 11 in the Exhibit Hall of the College Center at the College of New Rochelle, at Castle Place in downtown New Rochelle.
While nothing of Sappho's life or death can be confirmed as fact, she is believed to have been born in 600 B.C., probably of an aristocratic family, on the Greek island of Lesbos. Along with others of her social class, she is thought to have been banished to Sicily in her later years. In spite of her fame during her lifetime, little of her poetry is preserved intact.
Ms. Evjen has interpreted five fragments of Sappho's poetry, using wood, canvas, silk, clay and metal juxtaposed on the texts written in English and in the original Greek. The translations were made by Christos Tsiamis. 
Viewing hours are from 11 A.M. to 3 P.M. weekdays and noon to 4 P.M. weekends. A reception will be held from 2 to 4 P.M. next Sunday. For more information, call 632-5300.
 
'DAY WITHOUT ART'
''A Day Without Art'' is the umbrella title for a national day of mourning Dec. 1, when more than 400 arts organizations will participate in remembering the victims of AIDS within the arts community. The date was chosen to coincide with the World Health Organization's ''AIDS Awareness Day.''
In cooperation with a campus task force on AIDS, the Neuberger Museum at the State University of New York at Purchase has scheduled a lecture called ''AIDS and Art: From Media to Metaphor'' at 7 P.M. Thursday. Robert Atkins, art critic and contributor to The Village Voice, will be the speaker, focusing on AIDS-related art produced during the last eight years. He will explore photojournalistic images, elegiac paintings, portraits of AIDS sufferers, conceptual works, guerrilla street art, and billboards by dozens of artists including Keith Haring, Ross Bleckner, Gretchen Bender and Masami Teraoka.
The Neuberger, the Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie Museum and the Walker Art Center are among those nationwide that will participate by closing for the day or removing art from the galleries, by halting performances for a moment of silence, holding memorial services, or by disseminating educational material.
Admission to the talk is free.
 
THANKSGIVING COMPOST
Instead of feeding Thanksgiving dinner garbage to the disposer or the local dump, how about composting it? Carolyn Cullen, greenhouse manager at the Greenburgh Nature Center, will give a demonstration of the process using the center's own compost pile.
Believed by environmentalists to be a more efficient, economical and beneficial way to dispose of most foods, fallen leaves and garden debris, composting can be achieved in a number of ways with the deliberate or involuntary assistance of insects and micro-organisms, making use of commercial containers or an unobtrusive corner of the backyard.
The program is designed for adults and older children at 2 P.M. today, and it is free, but contributions of $2 for adults and $1 for children would be appreciated. The center is on Dromore Road off Central Avenue. Call 723-3470 for more information.
 
ST. NICHOLAS FESTIVAL
Three performances of the St. Nicholas Festival will be given in December by the Bronx Arts Ensemble and the Double Reed Band. The medley of songs and narrative tells the story of the Dutch St. Nicholas, who came to the houses of boys and girls on Dec. 6 and put candy in the wooden shoes of those who were good, but filled the shoes of naughty children with lumps of coal. In addition, his assistant, Black Piet, had been known to make off with very bad boys and girls.
''St. Nick was not exactly like Santa Claus,'' said Robert Kornfeld, who wrote the narrative. ''During the performance there are songs and stories about how he became a saint by doing good deeds for the people of Holland.'' Dec. 6 was his birthday and a day for exchanging gifts, while Dec. 25 was a traditional Christmas feast day. The Bronx Arts Ensemble originated the program 15 years ago as a Yuletide celebration appropriate to the Van Cortlandt Mansion where it was first held. It has been performed every year since.
William and Louise Scribner, directors of the ensemble and bassoonist and oboist respectively, will be joined by Mark Perchanok, oboe d'amore; Robert Ingliss, English horn; and four vocalists. Settings for the old Dutch songs and carols were arranged by Jack Gale.
Performances are at 2 P.M. Saturday in the Bartow-Pell Mansion, on Shore Road in Pelham Bay Park; and again at 4 P.M. in the Church of the Mediator, Kingsbridge Avenue at West 231st Street. The third performance is at 10:30 A.M. Dec. 7 in the McGinley Center of Fordham University's Rose Hill campus, on Southern Boulevard. All locations are in the Bronx. Admission is free but reservations should be made. Call (212) 549-1899.
 
HOLIDAY BAZAAR
An old-fashioned Christmas church bazaar first held 63 years ago will be in progress from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M. Saturday at St. John's Church on Fountain Square in Larchmont.
''We get a lot of items from estates,'' said Carleen Kluss, one of the organizers. ''As parishioners pass away, their property is held by relatives until our next bazaar. One year I ended up clearing out a whole house for the family.'' Many rare books and sets of books are obtained through such bequests.
Each year a number of local antiques dealers display a selection of collectible silver, table linens and accessories that can range in price up to $400, but most other items sell for 50 cents to $75, and include gifts that children can afford to buy.
''We are noted for our own handcrafts - one of the few remaining church bazaars that makes them,'' Mrs. Kluss said. ''We have three women's guilds making 75 percent of what we sell. They start working in January.''
Among the handcrafts are unusual decorative baskets, small painted churches, all kinds of picture frames, stuffed dinosaurs covered in chintz, terrariums, knitted hats and gloves, needlepoint bridge-table covers and elaborate patchwork Christmas stockings. Aprons, decorated trees, patchwork quilts for dolls, kissing balls and toys are also created by hand, some decorated with a heart motif carrying out this year's theme - ''Christmas - Season of the Heart.''
Proceeds from sales aid such organizations as the Larchmont-Mamaroneck Community Services, the Yonkers Center for Abused Women, Hope for the Homeless and Providence House. Admission is free. For more information, call 834-2981.
 
MUSICAL CHRISTMAS CARD
''A Musical Christmas Card'' traces a period from the mid-19th century to today, when the popularity of Christmas cards grew by leaps and bounds. A selection of cards displayed one by one will be accompanied by a narrative and a selection of secular and religious music of the season. The free program, presented by ''Three for the Show,'' a group headed by Lu Gmoser, producer of the Asbury Summer Theater in Yonkers, will begin at 7:30 P.M. in the Crestwood Library, at 16 Thompson Street. Ms. Gmoser is the commentator, and her daughter-in-law, Susan Gmoser, is the vocalist, accompanied by Larry Wasserman on the piano. Call 337-1500 for more information.

HEADLINE: Restaurant Meals Going Door to Door for the Working Public

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

 BODY:
WHEN Duncan MacLaine and Charles Carafiello began Chefs' Express, a restaurant meal-delivery service, they said they thought their focus would be on food. The partners have discovered, however, that their three-month-old Hartsdale-based business fills more needs than the merely dietary.
Chefs' Express dispatches ''driving chefs'' clad in red jackets and chef's hats who deliver - and serve, if requested - meals from selected restaurants to homes and offices in the county. Customers choose from a booklet of menus and are promised hot meals within the hour if they live in central Westchester. The company, whose drivers keep in touch with the office by radio, will deliver outside central Westchester with 24 hours notice. 
Although he calls the uniforms ''silly'' and ''outrageous,'' Mr. MacLaine, who was born in Ireland, said the uniforms have ''rung a bell'' with a hard-working public in need of lightening up. ''Everybody stops you in the outfit,'' which matches the company's red delivery trucks and thermal carrying cases, he said.
 
Restaurants in the Service
Seven restaurants are included in the service. These are Livanos in White Plains; Pinocchio and Lotus King in Eastchester; Auberge Argenteuil, Hunan Manor and Epstein's Kosher Delicatessen in Hartsdale; and Marcello in Scarsdale. Desserts are also available from Sweet Cravings in Hartsdale and Brownie Square in Scarsdale. In January, 10 more restaurants are joining the list.
The delivery fee in most of southern Westchester is $7 per total order, and $10 to $25 elsewhere in the county. For an additional $15, the driver will stay an hour to serve and clean up.
Mr. MacLaine said Westchester residents were enthusiastic about the service. Many customers, he said, are two-income couples who are too tired after work to either cook or eat out.
These are often people, he observed, who have it all - and the lack of free time to prove it. They have arrived, but are too exhausted to leave again.
 
There Are 'Oops' Orders
Mr. MacLaine, an experienced res taurateur with a sociological bent, recognizes the syndrome. ''They perceive themselves to be slaves of their own success,'' he said. Chefs' Express is ''what America's about - people who will take the weight off your back.''
Work pressures lead to ''oops'' orders, Mr. MacLaine observed. He said he delivered many ''I forgot it's your birthday'' or ''I'm sorry'' dinners, noting that when the food arrived, brought hot to the table by a driving chef schooled in politeness, tensions seemed to melt. ''One woman told me this kind of thing could save her marriage,'' he added.
Andrea Taber of Scarsdale first ordered from the service when her baby sitter canceled one night. ''We were in shock when Duncan walked in in a chef's jacket and hat,'' she said. She and her husband, Kenneth, told Mr. MacLaine he could just put down the food, but ''he arranged a beautiful tray for us.''
The next time the Tabers ordered, Mr. MacLaine came again and ''seated us, lit the candles and served the wine,'' Mrs. Taber said. ''We've recommended them to all our friends.'' ''The service people are very, very nice and so pleasant on the phone,'' said Linda Grossbach of Irvington, who first ordered from the delivery service when she was nine months pregnant. After the baby's birth, the company sent champagne.
Mr. MacLaine, who is 42 years old, has owned or managed restaurants in England and the United States. The 39-year-old Mr. Carafiello is from a family that owned a restaurant in Eastchester for many years. There are 11 driving chefs, all experienced in food service. Jay Dollinger, 25, who works in the office, handles phone orders with the panach of a maitre d'hotel.
 
10 Months of Planning
The business was opened last August after 10 months of planning. Mr. MacLaine, who holds a degree in economics and marketing, said he had pondered everything from where to put the apostrophe in the company's name (''Chefs' Express'' refers to all the chefs whose food is served) to the best facsimile machine to buy for the restaurants. Each restaurant sends facsimiles of its specials to the office every day. The company also supplies restaurants with custom-designed thermal-plastic food containers.
A restaurant's menu is included in the service only after repeated visits by the partners. Mr. MacLaine noted that ''cleanliness, consistency and the quality of the personnel,'' along with the establishment's location, were the most important criteria for selection.
In turn, Chefs' Express promises to uphold each restaurant's reputation - a factor Mr. MacLaine termed ''key'' to the operation's success.
So far, restaurateurs have been impressed with the company's professionalism. M'el Eudes, who runs Auberge Argenteuil with her husband, Henri, the chef, said she liked not only ''the way the boys look'' but the fact that they knew ''what it's like to put out food.'' The drivers' behavior in hectic restaurant kitchens - where they have been instructed to wait patiently and silently for orders - reflects Mr. MacLaine's understanding that ''they'd better not come in bright and breezy - not in those outfits!''
Mrs. Eudes, who as an actress is known as M'el Dowd, said belonging to the delivery service provided ''a bit of power'' to small restaurants that could benefit from the company's advertising on cable television and elsewhere. She also disagreed with those who cautioned that a home-delivery service would take away from eat-in business.
''It's the same as a store having a mail-service catalogue,'' Mrs. Eludes said. ''It encourages people. Maybe the next day they'll feel like eating out.''
Bart Collins, the manager of Livanos, said the service enabled ''our customers to eat our food on nights when they can't get out to the restaurant.'' Chefs' Express also gives ''people who don't know us a chance to taste our food and know what we're about,'' he added.
Mr. MacLaine said he believed the ''walk-in trade'' of all the participating restaurants had increased since Chefs' Express had opened. People are willing to try unfamiliar restaurants when they are grouped with those they like, he said. The company distributes 20,000 menu booklets a month to the restaurants in the service as well as to other sites.
With satisfied home diners spreading the word to a growing clientele, Mr. MacLaine and Mr. Carafiello have begun to count their Pollo Mangiafuocos. (Breast of chicken sauteed with cherry peppers, fennel and garlic, available for $15 from Pinocchio.)
 
Lunches to Be Delivered
The company will begin delivering lunches this week and will promote the new service with a trailer sporting a huge red chef's hat adorned with a set of Mercury's wings - the Chefs' Express logo.
The partners plan to open another office in Saddle River, N.J., and are considering other metropolitan areas where the demographics - and what Mr. MacLaine called the ''back-breaking life style'' - are similar to Westchester's.
Chefs' Express also provides a one-hour grocery-delivery service and daily home delivery of items to the ill or disabled - with the same uniforms and the same fee structure.
Mr. MacLaine offered this advice for an enjoyable hot restaurant meal at home: when ordering out, set the table before the food comes.

HEADLINE: SHOWDOWN AT WINDOW ROCK

BYLINE: By SANDY TOLAN; Sandy Tolan, director of Desert West News in Tucson, Ariz., writes frequently on Indian affairs. He is a regular contributor to National Public Radio.

 BODY:
UNDER THE BRILLIANT BLUE ARIZONA SKY, AN air-conditioned GMC Sierra bumps along a weed-choked wagon track near the main road to Kaibito, just south of Many Waters Lake, at the foot of the Peak Where the Wildcats Stretch. In the back seat, Peter MacDonald, the embattled leader of the Navajo nation, peers through the tinted glass window at a distant figure on horseback.
Across a valley of wild grass and sage, the horseman begins riding toward the truck, four sheepdogs racing behind him. It is Dan Chee, an 85-year-old medicine man.
Chee pulls up his horse, Sheepherder, and dismounts smoothly. Turquoise earrings stand out against his deeply lined face and neck. Wisps of white hair escape from a weathered corduroy hat. He wears a paisley shirt, brown denim pants and tennis shoes. 
The two men embrace and exchange greetings. Chee addresses MacDonald as naat'aanii, the traditional Navajo term for leader. MacDonald respectfully refers to Chee as ''uncle.''
In the warm October sun, the medicine man, keeper of the ancient ways of the Holy People, and the naat'aanii, four-time chairman of the Navajo, find themselves together in crisis.
Chee lives according to the Beauty Way of the Dine - ''the People'' - as the Navajo call themselves. Adhering to tradition, he ''walks in beauty,'' living in harmony between the four sacred Navajo mountains, under what the people call naats'eelit. The word means ''the rainbow that stretches over us and protects us.'' It also means ''sovereignty.'' But the land where he lives, the place he considers his church, is claimed by both the Navajo and Hopi tribes. If a pending Hopi lawsuit, claiming up to 3.5 million acres, succeeds in Federal court, the old medicine man could be forced from his home.
Last year, MacDonald, accompanied by reporters, helped build a new house for Chee when his mud and cedar hogan began to fall apart. The highly publicized act defied a Federal court order banning new construction on the disputed lands without written permission from the Hopi.
A grateful Chee blessed his leader with corn pollen. Now he says: ''The plants that are here, the animals that graze on these grasses, the things that are good for human beings to live on -that is what Chairman MacDonald protects. He watches over these things. That is why I love him.'' But Peter MacDonald, stripped of power by his own tribal council, charged with 107 criminal counts by a special tribal prosecutor, facing possible indictment by a Federal grand jury, is now likened to a corrupt dictator by many of his own people. The man once known as the most powerful Indian in America must now find solace in the unshakeable faith of his most traditional followers - people like Dan Chee, who see MacDonald as the keeper of naats'eelit, the guardian of sovereignty, the man who understands the old ways far better than a younger generation of Navajo leaders.
''Some ask me,'' says Chee, '' 'Why are you supporting Chairman MacDonald? He's a liar and a thief.' And I say to them, 'I know MacDonald. He has done a lot for me.' And they say, 'Suppose they put MacDonald in jail?' And I say to them, 'If they put him in jail, I will follow him to jail.' ''
FOR NEARLY 15 YEARS, PETER MACDONALD CONTROLLED the destiny of the 200,000 Navajos, America's largest Indian tribe. As tribal chairman, elected to an unprecedented four terms, he governed a reservation of 17 million acres - slightly larger than West Virginia. The land takes up much of northeastern Arizona (the Navajo seat of government is in Window Rock) and spills over into Utah and New Mexico.
In many ways, the reservation resembles an emerging third-world nation. Nearly half the people live below the poverty line. About a third are out of work. Rates of alcoholism and suicide are alarmingly high. And with a median age of 19, combined with a birth rate double the national average, economic development has become the tribe's top priority.
Across the reservation, pressures on the land increase. By tradition the Navajo are sheepherders, but there's no longer enough grazing land for everyone. Only one in six Navajo families holds a permit to graze sheep. Housing projects, once known only to urban Indians, are now common across the land. For many families, living in the traditional way has become impossible.
For a time, it looked as though Peter MacDonald might be the leader to bring his people out of poverty, underdevelopment and dependence on the Federal Government. With his deep sense of Navajo tradition, a spellbinding speaking style and a strong belief in the free-enterprise system, he came to power in 1971 amid a national surge of Indian pride, a populist Republican ready to tangle with the United States Government.
MacDonald pledged to rid the Navajo tribe of the shackles of Federal paternalism and build an independent Navajo nation free of Government interference. He promised to gain greater tribal control over coal, oil and gas reserves, assert Navajo rights to tax corporations doing business on the reservation and cut through Federal regulations hindering development on Navajo land. Always, he saved his harshest criticism for his lifelong nemesis, the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
Today, MacDonald is awash in charges of corruption and bribery. During hearings before the United States Senate last February, Navajo and non-Indian contractors testified that they gave thousands of dollars in bribes to the chairman in exchange for guaranteed work on the reservation. His son, Peter MacDonald Jr., told of attempts to cover up a scheme in which his father allegedly helped defraud the tribe of up to $7.2 million.
The irony could not be more complete. Indian leaders across the country expected the hearings to focus solely on allegations of fraud against the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Instead, they broadened out and helped bring down one of the agency's severest critics.
Less than two weeks after the Senate testimony, the Navajo Tribal Council, which MacDonald had dominated for more than three terms, relieved the chairman of his administrative duties. When MacDonald refused to leave office, he precipitated a five-month crisis in the Navajo government, culminating in a violent confrontation in late July that left two Navajos dead.
If found guilty of the bribery and corruption charges against him, MacDonald faces up to 15 years in jail and fines of up to $60,000. (As this magazine went to press, a trial date had not been set.) He has been hit with civil lawsuits in the millions of dollars, and a Federal grand jury may bring additional charges.
MacDonald calls the charges ''hogwash,'' saying others, jealous of his success, ''are spending millions of dollars in an effort to crucify me. All they want to do is silence people like me who speak out against those who are trying to erode tribal sovereignty.''
But other Navajos say Peter MacDonald, using sovereignty as a political shield and the Bureau of Indian Affairs as a bogyman, weakened tribal government while enriching himself. MacDonald, say his critics, brought about his own hard fall from power when he strayed too far from the Navajo way.
''The Navajo saying is that when you become less of a Navajo, you're going to suffer more,'' says Daniel Peaches, who managed MacDonald's first campaign for the tribal chairmanship, and recently oversaw a study to establish checks and balances in the tribal government. ''If you cease to live the way of the Navajos, you're going to become less human. You will have less moral strength.
''You will steal, you will hurt people, you're going to have no respect for the feelings of others. And I think MacDonald, by abusing the trust and the power of his office, made a big leap toward that. He took advantage of the culture of the people.''
P ETER MACDONALD was born on open range on a goatskin, in the midst of a sheep drive, in the spring of 1928. His family was moving wagons, horses and a herd of 2,000 sheep through the Four Corners area, to their home camp at Teec Nos Pos, Ariz. His parents named him Hoshkaisith: ''fierce'' or ''warrior-like,'' or, literally, ''He Who Clasps With Power.''
As young shepherds, Peter and his brothers and sisters would move the herd through the wild pastures and deep red washes near Teec Nos Pos. In the afternoons, with the sheep resting in a meadow, they would make small horses out of sticks and race them, or mold cows and wagons from the fine red clay in the washes.
Peter listened to the elders tell stories of the brutal Long Walk of the 1860's. They'd tell how Red Shirt, known to the white man as Kit Carson, forced the people to walk hundreds of miles to a prison camp in New Mexico. Peter's great-grandmother, forced to make the Long Walk as a teen-ager, would tell the stories of Red Shirt's cavalry troops: how sick Navajos, too weak to go on, were shot and left to die; how pregnant women, slow afoot, were stabbed with bayonets.
When Peter was still very young, another disaster befell the people. Off the reservation, the country was gripped by the Depression. In Navajo country, a long drought threatened the livestock. The people said the land looked tired. The Government said it was overgrazed. Officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs came from Washington and ordered Navajo families to cut their herds drastically. Good, healthy animals, at the center of the people's economy and culture, were shot by Government range agents. The boy watched as his family's sheep were bulldozed into the earth.
He was sent to school at age 6, and given his last name by the Government teachers at Teec Nos Pos. It was at school that he began to hear that Indians were inferior. The Bureau of Indian Affairs teachers told the children to abandon their Navajo religion. They ridiculed the Navajo customs, the ceremonials, the Navajo diet of mutton stew, fry bread and blue corn meal mush. They punished the Navajo children for speaking their own language.
At age 12, Peter quit school and spent a year apprenticed to his grandfather as a medicine man. Then he sought work in the lumberyards of Dolores, Colo. It was 1941. ''Dirty Indian, lazy Indian,'' the foreman would taunt, as the boy feverishly shoveled wood pulp into a cart bound for the railroad. ''I lived through that,'' he remembers. '''You're a drunken Indian. You're a no-good Indian. You're a stinking Indian'.'' In 1944, at age 15, he joined the Marines, where he became part of an elite group known as the Navajo Code Talkers - the Pacific radio communication force that used the Navajo language in a code the Japanese could not decipher.
In boot camp at San Diego, a young private asked MacDonald if he could read a letter. He thought it was another taunt intended for the ''dumb Indian.'' He read the letter aloud. The next day, the soldier asked MacDonald to write a response. ''I always thought, up to that point, that white men were born already knowing how to write and read,'' he remembers.
''It really changed my attitude. I decided, hey, these guys don't have any secret endowment, as they said they do. They're not any better than I am. I felt very proud.'' At that point, he thought, ''I'm superior now.''
''I'll never forget that episode. Because from that day on, I never bowed down to anybody.''
After the war, MacDonald enrolled at the University of Oklahoma, earning a degree in electrical engineering in 1957. From there, he went to work for Hughes Aircraft, where he became part of a team that designed the guidance system for the Polaris nuclear missile.
Then in 1963, as the War on Poverty got under way, MacDonald came home to the reservation. Taking a leave of absence from Hughes, he was hired to direct a $900,000 annual program, the Office of Navajo Economic Opportunity (O.N.E.O.).
The Bureau of Indian Affairs wanted to manage the money. MacDonald wanted it sent directly from Washington to O.N.E.O. and its local programs. MacDonald won the bitter fight with his old enemy, and set about building a political base. As his annual budget grew to $12 million, the name Peter MacDonald became synonymous with jobs, new homes, power lines and local services.
Shortly after beginning work with O.N.E.O., MacDonald went to see Navajo government in action at the Tribal Council chambers in Window Rock. Two councilmen were engaged in heated debate. The Bureau of Indian Affairs representative, Glen Landbloom, pounded on the podium and told the councilmen to stop arguing. Then, MacDonald remembers, ''He said, 'If you guys continue to act like children, I'm going to throw every one of you out of this council chamber. I'm going to put a padlock on it. And I'm not going to let you back in until you learn to behave like adults!' ''
The councilmen stopped arguing and sat down. MacDonald was aghast.
''This Landbloom guy was treating the council like it was back in 1700! I couldn't get over it. So I said to myself, 'One of these days, it's not going to be like that.' '' MacDonald sent word to Hughes Aircraft: He wasn't coming back.
Seven years later, Peter MacDonald was elected tribal chairman. Before taking office, he met with the local Bureau of Indian Affairs official and insisted that the agency give the tribe title to the council chambers building. If not, he vowed, the council would hold its sessions outside. The tribe was given title to the building. MacDonald's assistants changed the locks.
The new chairman, presiding over his first session of the Navajo Tribal Council in 1971, fixed his gaze on the Bureau of Indian Affairs official in attendance. ''If I hear any outbursts from you or your staff,'' he warned, ''I will have our police escort you from these chambers. And you won't be let back in until you promise to behave like adults!''
Eighteen years later, sitting in the Sierra outside a hogan and corral near Black Mesa, MacDonald smiles at the memory. It's a story he has told many times. Like the tales of his early life, it has come to resemble the parables he uses with such effect when speaking to the traditional people.
PETER MACDONALD's first years in office were marked by frequent speeches pledging greater self-determination for the Navajos, new measures to assert Navajo control over reservation schools, hospitals and natural resources, and repeated trips to Washington to lobby for a greater share of the Federal budget.
''Those were the days of nation-building,'' he says.
In pursuing the seemingly contradictory goals of greater Navajo sovereignty and increased Federal support, the chairman began to forge what might be called a ''sovereign dependent nation.'' Navajo leaders explain this apparent contradiction by pointing out that the Treaty of 1868, which ended the Navajo incarceration at Fort Sumner, requires the Government to fulfill a trust responsibility for a distinct, independent people, in perpetuity.
MacDonald also began carving out a role in Republican politics. During his first term, he served on the Committee to Re-elect the President. He was scheduled to give a nominating speech for Richard Nixon at the 1972 convention in Miami. But then he began what became a legendary feud with Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona.
In 1972, Congress turned its attention to a major land dispute between the Navajo and Hopi tribes, involving 1.8 million acres claimed by both tribes. The Hopis argued that the Navajos had been encroaching on their land since the end of the incarceration at Fort Sumner. The Navajos protested that thousands of tribe members would be forced to move if the Hopis prevailed.
MacDonald met with Democratic Presidential candidate George McGovern, then chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Indian Affairs, who expressed support for the Navajo position.
Two weeks before the Republican convention, MacDonald said he might have to back McGovern for President. He was dropped from the list of speakers. ''Goldwater was infuriated,'' says Jerry Kammer, author of ''The Second Long Walk,'' a highly acclaimed book about the Navajo-Hopi conflict. ''He had arranged this, and here's MacDonald suddenly flirting with Nixon's opponent.''
Near the end of MacDonald's first term, Senator Goldwater gave his support to the Hopi side, now expressed in pending legislation, in the long-brewing land dispute. MacDonald fought back, enlisting the help of the AFL-CIO as Washington lobbyists against the bill.
But with Goldwater solidly behind the Hopi tribe, the law passed in late 1974. It authorized one of the largest forced relocations in North American history, involving some 7,000 Navajos so far. The gulf between MacDonald and Goldwater deepened.
''There's no question MacDonald's strategy backfired,'' says Kammer. ''It spelled tragedy for thousands of traditional Navajo people. And it set the stage for more trouble for MacDonald.''
In 1976, a year after MacDonald began his second term, Federal officials began looking into tribal operations. At Goldwater's request, the General Accounting Office began an audit of tribal finances. Late in the year, a Federal grand jury indicted MacDonald. He was charged with filing false travel vouchers in connection with an agreement to erect power lines on the reservation.
MacDonald, represented by F. Lee Bailey, repeatedly charged that the prosecution was a political vendetta by Goldwater. Others shared his suspicions. Ken Fields, one of the prosecutors in the 1976 case, now says: ''I was extremely uncomfortable about that. I've always wondered if we'' - the prosecutors -''were dupes.'' The Federal judge found so little evidence to convict MacDonald that he issued a directed verdict of acquittal. (Repeated attempts to reach Goldwater for comment were unsuccessful.) For the chairman, the incident became an important political weapon in his lifelong fight against the Government. It may have helped him win election to a third term in 1978. But he says the incident left him deeply bitter. ''When that happened to me in 1976,'' he says, ''I lost complete faith in the American justice system.''
IN JULY 1987, ON A warm afternoon in Window Rock, a confidential source slipped a two-page, typewritten memo to Betty Reid, a newspaper reporter. It was seven months into Peter MacDonald's fourth term.
Reid had been covering the reservation since graduating from journalism school at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1985. She was part of a team of Navajo reporters who worked on the first Indian-run daily paper in the country, The Navajo Times Today.
She'd covered the 1986 election campaign between MacDonald and Peterson Zah, the reformer who had defeated MacDonald four years earlier amid frequent charges of greed, cronyism and corruption.
Reid had heard MacDonald's many promises in the 1986 campaign: a house for every Navajo veteran, a guaranteed college scholarship for every high school graduate, a minimum of 1,000 new jobs per year. These promises of hope, unbelievable to many Navajos, were often presented as moving parables, in Navajo, to the traditional people.
''It was just amazing,'' remembers Reid, who was raised in the traditional community of Bodaway, in the western part of the Navajo reservation. ''People hung on his every word. He has this gift. If you listen to him speak in Navajo, it's incredible.'' Zah, perceived by his critics as well-meaning but ineffective, lost to MacDonald by less than a percentage point.
Reid had covered MacDonald's lavish fourth inauguration, watching as a string of white limousines cruised by, as the police snipers, perched atop grandstands at the tribal fairgrounds, surveyed the crowd. Navajo critics who had long ridiculed ''Big Mac'' (a former vice chairman was called ''Quarter Pounder'') now began to deride MacDonald's ''imperial chairmanship,'' comparing him to Ferdinand Marcos and Manuel Noriega.
Reid had also been part of the exodus from the Navajo Times five weeks after the inauguration, when MacDonald shut down the vigorously independent paper and dismissed its employees. Now, five months later, she was working for the Gallup Independent.
By the summer of 1987, it was common for Betty Reid to receive notes and tips. She had a lot of sources close to the chairman. She also knew many people who, over the years, had developed grave doubts about him.
The note came from one of these people. It was about Big Boquillas, a 491,000-acre ranch west of Flagstaff that the tribe had agreed to purchase for $33.4 million a few weeks earlier. According to the memo, the timing of the transaction was peculiar. It took place at 9:55 A.M. on July 9. At 9:50 that same morning, someone else had bought the ranch for only $26.2 million. That was a difference of $7.2 million in five minutes. On July 23, Reid called the Coconino County assessor's office. The facts checked out. She sat down to write. The lead story in the July 24 edition of the Gallup Independent announced the opening of the long-awaited Navajo Nation Economic Summit, which MacDonald hoped would initiate an unprecedented era of development. Sponsored by MacDonald and United States Senators Pete Domenici and Dennis DeConcini, the two-day meeting would be attended by five senators, four congressmen, three governors, the head of the Bureau of Indian Afairs, tribal officials, and executives from major corporations. President Reagan was to deliver a special message by videotape.
The same day, in a single column beside the summit story, the Independent ran a short piece under Betty Reid's byline about a ranch purchase. To many out-of-town journalists covering the summit, the article seemed of little importance. But for MacDonald, standing before prominent political leaders, government officials, chief executive officers and the national press, this was the moment when things began to unravel.
In the coming months, as new revelations came to light, the Big Boquillas Ranch controversy - immediately dubbed ''Bo-Gate'' - became the main topic of conversation in Window Rock.
Navajos soon learned that Byron (Bud) Brown, who, along with an associate named Tom Tracy, had sold the ranch to the tribe, was a close friend of Peter MacDonald's. It was reported that Ninibah Cahn, director of the tribe's Office of Navajo Land Administration, had ordered tribal appraisers to inflate the price of the land from between $50 and $63 an acre to $68 an acre, the final purchase price. The sale also appeared to have gone forward with a speed that bewildered tribal officials.
''I kept thinking, 'What's the big rush?' '' remembers Stanley M. Pollack, an attorney in the tribe's justice department.
Pollack, a graduate of the University of Colorado Law School, had been hired by the tribe during the Zah administration to work on energy and water law. On the afternoon of May 22, 1987, he was summoned to Ninibah Cahn's office and told to review the contract for the purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch. It was a complex document; Pollack felt the process shouldn't be rushed.
In the evening, MacDonald called. ''What's the problem?'' the chairman asked irritably. It was a complicated purchase, Pollack explained. But MacDonald was growing impatient. ''You know what I want!'' Pollack remembers hearing him say. MacDonald's impatience may have been fueled by the presence of Bud Brown and Tom Tracy in Window Rock, where the two men were waiting for a $500,000 nonrefundable down payment.
Around 10 P.M., after an uncomfortable Pollack prepared an option agreement to buy the ranch, Brown and Tracy got their money. If allegations are true, MacDonald had just helped the two men flip the ranch for a profit of $7.2 million.
It didn't take long for the shock waves from ''Bo-Gate'' to reach Washington. In early 1988, a special Senate committee had been organized to consider holding hearings on the Federal Government's relation with Indian tribes. The primary impetus for the hearings was an October 1987 series in The Arizona Republic that had detailed extensive fraud involving the Bureau of Indian Affairs and energy companies.
But by the fall of 1988, a major focus of the investigation had shifted to Peter MacDonald's problems. The committee received authorization to monitor the chairman's activities with a surveillance van and telephone taps.
Some staff members were furious. Four members of the energy team quit in protest over the changed focus of the probe. ''It was the Big Easy,'' says one veteran of Congressional investigations familiar with the Senate probe. ''The chief counsel was only interested in a big hit. This was Watergate in Indian country. The media were all primed. But it overshadowed everything else. And it only made the Indians look corrupt.''
On Feb. 7, Peter MacDonald became national front-page news, as contractors at the Senate hearings described in detail the cash and gifts they had given him in exchange for work on the reservation: Free limousine service at MacDonald's 1987 inauguration; a private jet flight to the graduation of his daughter at Harvard; all-expense trips to Hawaii and Las Vegas; and stacks of $100 bills, which the chairman allegedly stuffed in his pocket.
Bud Brown, who became an undercover informant for the committee in exchange for immunity, described an agreement to pay the chairman between $500,000 and $750,000 from the profits in the Big Boquillas Ranch deal. (At the time, MacDonald had allegedly received a BMW and cash, for a total value of about $125,000.) The committee heard extensive sections of an undercover tape, made by Brown, of a ploy to cover up the agreement through the perjured testimony of Brown and the chairman's son, Peter MacDonald Jr., known as Rocky.
Testifying under immunity, Rocky described the cover-up plan to the committee. He said his father used a code word whenever he wanted another payment from Brown.
''What was that code word?'' Ken Ballen, the committee's chief counsel, asked Rocky, as Senator DeConcini and others looked on.
'' 'Golf balls,' '' Rocky responded. ''A golf ball was approximately $1,000.''
Later, Ballen asked the chairman's son why he had chosen to participate in the cover-up.
''Because I love my father,'' he told the committee.
''THEY USED MY OWN baby against me, my people,'' MacDonald said in a speech broadcast in Navajo to his traditional supporters across the reservation.
''They said they were going to investigate the B.I.A. . . . and yet they lied. Instead they have been investigating me. The reports of the conspiracy - they are lies, my people. This you should remember.''
It was less than a week after the Senate testimony. After word spread that MacDonald's own son had testified against him, support for the chairman began dwindling to a hard core of traditional people. In Window Rock, former supporters of MacDonald were calling for his resignation. Opponents of the chairman began demonstrating outside the council chambers, holding golf balls aloft. Later, they wore buttons on their lapels that read: ''Mutton Yes! Golf Balls No!''
In a confidential Valentine's Day memo to the Tribal Council, Navajo Attorney General Michael P. Upshaw concluded that the Big Boquillas Ranch purchase represented a ''major fraud.'' In danger, he warned, was ''the sovereignty of the Navajo nation.''
The week after the hearings, the 88-member tribal council, once under the tight rule of the chairman, split into two factions. Supporters of each faction gathered in the road outside the chairman's office. Heated words flew back and forth.
Daniel Peaches, the tribe's deputy director of legislative affairs, recalls walking into the chairman's office. He looked outside at the demonstrators. ''What if they get into a fight?'' he asked. ''If you allow people to hurt each other, then you've lost control of this whole thing.''
MacDonald looked up from his desk. ''And he says to me,'' Peaches recalls, '' 'So be it. Let them fight. Let them hurt each other.'
''At that point,'' Peaches says, ''I figured he's more interested in himself than the welfare of his own people.''
AT 8:50 P.M. ON FEB. 17, 1989, after four days of bitter dispute in the council chambers, a 49-member majority of the Navajo Tribal Council placed Peter MacDonald on administrative leave. It was a vote of monumental importance for a council the chairman had dominated during nearly all of his 14 years in office.
But MacDonald refused to accept the council's decision. His stand touched off five months of dispute that put the tribal government to its greatest test of independence since the early 1920's, when the Bureau of Indian Affairs first formed the Tribal Council as a means of approving oil and gas leases.
In March, an interim chairman and vice chairman were appointed by a deeply divided council. The council then split into two factions. MacDonald's supporters believed the government had been stolen from them, arguing that there was no provision in the tribal code for removing the chairman by less than a two-thirds vote. (The tribe has no constitution.) They occupied the lavish office suites he had once had redecorated at a cost of $700,000 and filled with heavy wooden furniture (critics referred to the offices as the Mahogany Palace). From there, on MacDonald's instructions, they issued tribal mandates. An interim government issued opposing decrees from its spartan offices nearby.
On April 18, after a tense scene outside the chairman's office, the Area Director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, James H. Stevens, considered calling in Federal police from Albuquerque. ''The situation was moving so quickly that it might be best to take over the station,'' he wrote in a chronological record for that date.
On May 24, MacDonald's supporters were forcibly removed from the chairman's offices by tribal police. For the next two months, Window Rock was calm.
On July 20, however, after several days of delivering fiery speeches across the reservation, Peter MacDonald wrote a memo to his former chief of police, ordering him to ''reassume the position of Chief of the Navajo Police,'' and to ''assist with the orderly restoration . . . of the Navajo Government.''
Supporters of the fallen chairman gathered at the tribe's administration and finance building. Some, claiming they had been roughed up during the eviction from the chairman's offices, carried baseball bats and two-by-twos for ''protection.'' When a Navajo policeman arrived, they tied him up and took his gun. More police came. The crowd broke into groups of 10 to 15 people. ''They were hitting the police with sticks,'' remembers Marley Shebala, a Navajo reporter with the Farmington (N.M.) Daily Times. ''The crowd was in a frenzy.''
Police drew their weapons and held them aloft. Undeterred, the MacDonald supporters advanced. Someone - no one can say for certain who - fired a shot. Then the police began firing. A moment later, two supporters of Peter MacDonald lay dying.
SINCE THEIR ARRIVAL in the American Southwest centuries ago, Navajos have demonstrated an astonishing resilience. They survived war, hunger, incarceration, livestock reduction and forced relocation. They incorporated sheep and horses from the Spaniards, becoming expert weavers in the process. From the Pueblos, they learned pottery-making; later, from the Mexicans, they learned silversmithing. In this century, Navajos have taken to pickup trucks, blue jeans, satellite dishes and majority-rule government while staying rooted in ceremony and a strong sense of identity.
At his best, some time ago, Peter MacDonald personified this Navajo culture in transition. He combined deep roots in the culture, and an ability to incorporate the modern world in a keenly Navajo way. He used his gifts to inspire his people with a new sense of pride and helped make them a political force to be reckoned with.
Today, driving across the reservation, trying to rally support from his traditional followers, MacDonald thinks about his legacy. ''I look at some shopping center or some tribal building or some paved road, and I think about how that wasn't here before, when I returned to the reservation,'' he muses. ''I wonder if the people know that. I wonder if they even realize what it was like in 1963.''
At Dan Chee's new house, the house built in part by Peter MacDonald, the front door faces east, in the traditional Navajo way. It looks out upon a vast open valley cut only by a dirt road. On a hill beyond the road, the medicine man still grazes a few cattle and sheep.
To the north, just out of sight, a railroad brings coal from a big strip mine at Black Mesa to a power plant on Lake Powell. From there, transmission lines stretch from huge towers across the reservation, bypassing Navajo hogans on their way to Phoenix, Las Vegas and Southern California.
Some afternoons, Chee hikes a steep incline to the top of the Peak Where the Wildcats Stretch. There, he prays for the people's government to be whole again, for the dispute over his land to end, and for his way of life to continue.
''I always think, what words and thoughts do we use to make it right again,'' Chee says in soft, low Navajo tones. ''We have men and women, children and grandchildren. We want good for them. We want good food, sheep, cattle, horses and employment. We want to live our dreams. Instead, everyone is worried about what's going to happen next.''

HEADLINE: A Look at Fuji's Expanding U.S. Role

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

DATELINE: RYE

 BODY:
WHEN Osamu Inoue was an undergraduate majoring in business administration at Kobe University in Japan, he set his sights on a career that would take him beyond the borders of Japan into international markets.
''I very much wanted to travel and see something of the rest of the world,'' he said, ''so I felt I was very fortunate when I graduated to get a job in the export division of Fuji Film.''
That was 32 years ago, when Fuji first entered the North American market. A year-and-a-half ago, Mr. Inoue, became head of Fuji Photo Film U.S.A., which is based in Elmsford. And this month he delivered his first talk - ''Fuji, U.S.A.: An American Company With a Japanese Name'' - to members of the World Trade Club of Westchester at a luncheon meeting at the Rye Town Hilton. 
The World Trade Club is the international trade forum of the Westchester County Association, a business group.
For Mr. Inoue, who is called Sam by friends and acquaintances, his promotion to the post of Fuji's top executive in the United States brought his second tour here.
 
Steps Up the Ladder
He began working in the United States in 1964 at Fuji U.S.A., marketing industrial products. In 1971 he returned to Japan and has held various positions there and in West Germany. He was made general manager of Fuji's Dusseldorf operations in 1979, a post he held until 1984, when he returned to Japan as manager of the export sales division for consumer products.
''I am very glad to be back in the U.S.A. getting reacquainted with the many friends I met here,'' he said. ''What is especially gratifying is that when I left the United States in 1971, Fuji U.S.A. was a small company with perhaps two dozen employees. Now we have about 850 employees and many branch offices in the United States and we are still growing.''
Fuji U.S.A., Mr. Inoue explained, is the United States subsidiary of Fuji Photo Film Company of Tokyo, the second-largest manufacturer of photo-sensitized materials in the world, outranked only by Kodak. Its products are sold in more than 120 countries. Last year Fuji had worldwide sales of $6.9 billion, with two-thirds of sales made in Japan.
''It is important to note, especially in these days of concern about the balance of trade and the openness of Japanese markets to American products,'' Mr. Inoue said, ''that our American competitor does significant business in Japan. In the industries in which we compete, the markets are truly open, and free and fair competition benefits consumers and end-users of our products. The competition drives innovation while curbing inflation.''
Until recently, Mr. Inoue said, almost all of Fuji's products were developed and manufactured in Japan. But Fuji recently established manufacturing operations within the markets its serves.
This year, he said, Fuji's first U.S. factory, in Greenwood, S.C., began producing pre-sensitized plates used in offset printing. And in a joint partnership with the BASF Corporation, Fuji U.S.A. recently began manufacturing floppy disks in a factory in Bedford, Mass.
In addition, Fuji U.S.A. has acquired the worldwide manufacturing and sales operations of Olin Hunt, which includes manufacturing and sales plants in the United States.
 
Local Benefits Cited
''All our American factories employ American workers, use American machinery and raw materials and contribute to the local economy and communities we are in,'' Mr. Inoue emphasized, adding that in each country outside Japan almost all Fuji employees were local citizens.
''For example,'' he said, ''in Elmsford we have almost 180 people and only 20 are Japanese. In keeping with Fuji's philosophy, the heads of all our marketing divisions and almost all of our support departments are American. When the factory in South Carolina is fully operational, it will employ more than 140 Americans and seven Japanese.''
Since the job of Fuji U.S.A. is primarily to market Fuji products to American consumers and businesses, Mr. Inoue noted, advertising and promotion is handled by American firms, geared to the local market.
Fuji began its United States operations in 1955 by selling industrial products through American distributors. In 1965 Fuji Photo Film was incorporated in New York State and by the early 1970's, Mr. Inoue said, ''we began marketing some of our products, including color film, directly. Separate divisions were formed to market each product.''
 
Move to County Discussed
In 1986, the company moved from its original headquarters in the Empire State Building in Manhattan to Elmsford.
''We made the move to Westchester for the same reasons other companies move out of Manhattan,'' said Thomas H. Shay, director of corporate communications at Fuji U.S.A. ''We needed more room to expand and Westchester was an easier commute for most of our employees. We also felt the county was a better place to recruit the type of high-level employees we'd need in the future.''
When asked if working for the American subsidiary of a Japanese company differed from working for an American employer, Mr. Shay, who has spent 18 years with Fuji, grew thoughtful.
''Salaries and benefits are competitive with those of every other company,'' he said, ''but most of the two dozen original American employees who started when I started with Fuji are still on the job. The Japanese nationals that come here are rotated in and out, but there is almost no turnover in the American staff. The reason, I think, is that we feel valued. We all feel that we've played an important part in the growth of the organization and we have a real interest in it. There's a sense of pride.''
 
Role of Japanese Workers
At the Elmsford headquarters, Japanese employees primarily act as marketing or technical coordinators, relaying information between American employees and their counterparts in Japan, Mr. Inoue said.
''Our marketing programs are designed in America for Americans by Americans,'' he said, ''but I believe our success is largely due to our ability to continue to offer American consumers new high-quality products.''
''Fuji's big growth spurt in the U.S. came after we sponsored the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics,'' Mr. Shay noted. ''The Olympics really put us on the map. As the official film of the Games, Fuji caught the attention of millions of people for the first time.''
In Westchester, Mr. Shay said, Fuji helps sponsor concert and museum programs and supports dozens of local civic and charitable organizations. ''We had felt a warm welcome in Westchester and we want to do our best to repay the kindness,'' Mr. Inoue said.
''We try to demonstrate that Fuji U.S.A. is truly an American company,'' he said. ''Not only will 1,500 American employees be working for various Fuji subsidies in the U.S., but we also support other American jobs through advertising and the magazines and the networks where we place our ads, and at so many other places along the channels of distribution.''
Mr. Inoue and his wife, Takako, live in Harrison. They are parents of two grown sons: one works in Japan and the other in West Germany.

HEADLINE: CONNECTICUT Q & A: LIEUT. COL. DAVID R. WALLACE;
'They're Sold on Patriotism'

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
DAVID R. WALLACE of New Haven, a lieutenant colonel in the Army and a Vietnam combat pilot decorated seven times for heroism, has had a new challenge for the past year, as the Army's chief recruiter in Connecticut.
Lieut. Col. Wallace has just reached the halfway mark in his two-year assignment as the Recruiting Battalion Commander for Connecticut and western Massachusetts, and in that time the number of recruits increased to 1,800 from 1,260. The percentage of high school graduates at the top of their class who join the Army also increased, the colonel said. And his region is now 26th in recruitment out of 55 regions nationally, up from last place a year ago.
In an interview at his office in New Haven, Lieut. Col. Wallace talked about the problems of recruiting in Connecticut. Here are some excerpts from the conversation:
Q. Has the image of the armed forces changed? 
A. Absolutely. Our low point was probably during the latter parts, or just after, the war in Vietnam. We came back to an Army that was demoralized. No one wanted to come into it. From that low point, we started building, step by step, first at the officer corps, and then to our senior noncommissioned officers, and finally down to our enlisted personnel.
We set very high standards, particularly starting about 1980, which was our turning point. In 1980, about 54 percent of our soldiers were in the lower mental categories. By lower mental categories, I mean someone who on a test where the top score is 100 scores 27 or below. We now have that down to about 4 percent, sometimes 7 percent.
The other thing is, only about half the kids in the early 1980's had a high school diploma. Today, 91, 92, 93 percent of our kids have a diploma. We are getting the winners in our society. A young man or woman who drops out of high school, even in school there is competition, and that's one more gate they didn't go through. We have more enlisted soldiers today with four years of college, or a degree, than we have enlisted soldiers without a high school diploma.
Q. How has your first year gone?
A. For the first time in the battalion's 14 years, in 1989 we not only met our mission, but we met our mission in every category all across the boards. We were one of about only 10 battalions in the country to do that. It was a good feeling. There are 55 battalions, and I can tell you that the entire Army Recruiting Command met its goal in fiscal year 1989. Obviously, some are doing better than others.
Since January, for what we call the quality market, we've been No. 1 in the country. We are graded on the number of quality recruits we put into the service, as opposed to volume. We could open up our doors today, and in two days' time fill every vacancy we have. But for either physical or moral or mental reasons we just can't use them.
Q. Why has Connecticut been such a tough recruiting environment traditionally?
A. I think it stems from two things. Patriotism here is just as good as where I come from in Arkansas. But there's low unemployment. When only 2.9 percent of the population is unemployed, you don't have that hunger to get out. So the recruiting force has to be more, I hesitate to use the word aggressive, but we have to get out and let people see what we have to offer. The other thing is salaries here are pretty good. We'll be more of a golden handcuff.
Q. Why have you been successful as a recruiter?
A. I have serving with me the best noncommissioned officers in the country, and I have delegated to them the responsibility and authority to do their job. I'm one guy, and I'm from Arkansas and I'm not real smart, but I've got a bunch of smart guys working for me. And if you sit around and listen to those 200 guys come up with good ideas, and get a bunch of them together once in a while and let those good ideas bubble up, and then implement those - that's what we've been doing, and that's what's been working.
There's a stereotype of one guy giving out all the orders and maybe not knowing what's going on, but I've never been in that environment. You know the book ''The One-Minute Manager?'' That's the kind of guy I've worked for all my life.
Q. What types of goals do you have to meet as a recruiter?
A. We have about five or six different categories. One is a total number. The bulk of them will score in the upper half on the mental tests. Roughly 50 to 60 percent of my overall mission will be males in the upper mental categories. Probably 10 to 15 percent of my mission will be the upper mental categories of females. We get more female mission here than some of the other battalions because we seem to do real well here.
The rest of the mission falls into the mental categories that are kind of middle of the road. We have no lower mental category mission. In fact, the entire country was just cut off last month. I could not put a non-high school graduate in.
Q. As a recruiter, what would you think about mandatory military service for all teen-agers, as is required in some countries?
A. We have, for most of the history of our country, had a volunteer Army. The draft we always talk about is really, when you look at a long period of time, only been in place for a very short period of time. I personally think we're better off having people volunteer to serve their country. We're a free society, and we're probably freer than any society that's been around this old world for a long time. I don't think we should do anything to infringe on that freedom.
Q. Do you expect much of an impact after the recent announcements of defense cutbacks in the Soviet Union because the threat of war with the United States is at a 45-year low?
A. It's too soon to tell. But I will say, I think it's great. The guys who want peace the worst are the soldiers who went to combat. I don't ever want to go to war again. One was enough for a lifetime. I don't ever want my son or my daughter to go to war. I think it's great the way it's going, and I hope it keeps going.
Q. Do recruits today favor active duty over the reserves?
A. Active is most favored because of the packages we offer, but a strong second is the reserve program. A lot of women in their first year of college are interested in medical training, so they spend one summer going through basic training, and then they have a part-time job. In October, we set a record for the number of reserves put in in a single month out of this office.
Q. Do you get a lot of young people who think of the service as the start of a career?
A. I don't think you identify who a career soldier is until his or her third or fourth year. When I came in I wasn't sure I was going to be a career soldier. What we're seeing mostly are young men and young women who are looking for ways to improve their life. The typical high school graduate goes into a service industry, such as fast food. After a year or two years, they take a look at that and wonder where they're headed.
We can offer a young man or woman $25,200 for college, or we can repay their student loans. We can give them up to an $8,000 bonus. We're one of the few services that can guarantee you in writing a specific job. I can promise Mike Jones that he will be a military policeman.
The other person we see, interestingly enough, are people who are affluent. These people look at the $25,000 we offer for college, and they really don't need it. We get more Airborne Rangers out of that group of kids than anywhere else in the country. They're sold on patriotism, and the fact that they will have a challenge to meet for three years.
Q. High school enrollments have been dropping since the mid-1970s, and are expected to drop for the next few years as well. What does that mean to recruiters?
A. We have been fighting the declining market now for the last five years, and we're winning it. We're winning it not because we're superstars, but because we've got packages we can offer people that are attractive. I think the declining market problem has just about bottomed out.
Q. What recruiting techniques work best in an affluent, low-unemployment area like Connecticut?
A. Getting out and talking to people. You go everywhere you can. There are three types of prospecting we do; telecommunications, get on the phone and call them; go out and meet them face to face, out in the malls and the schools, and the third kind is referrals. Now referrals are the best kind. If you're a good recruiter and you have a satisfied customer, he'll bring more people to you.
Q. Has your budget for recruiting been increasing to help you meet the special challenges of recruiting during prosperity?
A. It's gone down. What it costs me today to put a young man in the service is about $2,200. Twelve years ago, it cost $1,900, so if you play inflation in, we're working with a lot less. But the difference is 12 years ago, who wanted to go in. Now, our image has turned around.
Q. What are the most popular choices of careers for teen-agers signing up these days?
A. The career choices don't center around jobs so much, such as M.P.s or infantrymen, as they do around vocational training. You see a lot of young people interested in medical training, in mechanics, aviation, truck maintenance, which directly leads to a career after two or three years in the service. Communications, and the high technology areas are popular, and language training.

HEADLINE: THEATER;
Again They Drink From the Cup Of Suspicion

BYLINE: By ARTHUR MILLER

 BODY:
''The Crucible,'' written in 1953 by Arthur Miller, is produced constantly all over the world. On Thursday the play, which links the Salem witch trials of the 1690's to McCarthyism in the 1950's, will open at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven, where Arvin Brown will direct a cast that includes John Braden, Charles Cioffi, Frank Converse and Virginia Downing. In March the Roundabout Theater in New York will also stage a production, directed by Gerald Freedman. In this essay the playwright discusses the origin and nature of his work.
I did not write ''The Crucible'' simply to propagandize against McCarthyism, although if justification were needed that would have been enough. There was something else involved. I'll try to explain.
A writer friend was recently telling me about a Moscow theater producer who is interested in putting on a play about the Vietnam War. Why Vietnam? It turns out that what he would really like to illuminate is the Russian defeat in Afghanistan, but with feelings about Afghanistan still running so high he felt he needed a metaphor that would go to the dilemmas underlying such a war rather than attempting an outright confrontation with the thickets of feeling surrounding Afghanistan itself. 
That approach reminded me of my decision to write about the 1692 Salem witch trials rather than trying to take on Joseph McCarthy and his cohorts directly. In the early 50's McCarthyism, so-called, began as a conservative Republican cavalry charge that in the name of anti-Communism helped scatter the left-liberal coalitions of Democrats and union people who had held together the only recently faded New Deal. But this was no ordinary political campaign. This time the enemy was not merely ''The Democrat Party,'' as McCarthy sneeringly renamed it, but the hidden foreign plot which, naively but often knowingly, it shielded. Thus a certain sublime gloss - national security - was varnished over a very traditional grab for domestic political power.
With amazing speed McCarthy was convincing a lot of not unintelligent people that the incredible was really true, and that, say, General of the Army George Catlett Marshal was a Communist sympathizer, or that Senator Millard E. Tydings of Maryland was a buddy of Earl Browder, head of the American Communist Party. (A photo of both of them standing happily together would only much later be proved to have been a fake manufactured by Roy Cohn, McCarthy's right-hand bandido.) For a time it began to seem that Senator Joe was heading straight for the White House, the more so when the sheer incredibility of his claims appeared to be part proof that they were real; if the Communists were indeed hidden everywhere, it followed that they would certainly be found where common sense indicated they could not conceivably be.
The case being circular, it was finally all but unarguable. Worse yet, you could not rely on the too-trusting police, the naively legalistic courts or even the slow-moving F.B.I. to root out the conspiracy. As for the press, it was all but sold to Moscow, secretly, of course. Who then was absolutely reliable? McCarthy, naturally, and those who had his blessing.
This was colorful and fascinating stuff for the stage, but a play takes a year to write and months to see through production, and I could not imagine spending so much time on what seemed to me so obvious a tale. But as the anti-Communist crusade settled in, and showed signs of becoming the permanent derangement of the American psyche, a kind of mystery began to emerge from its melodramas and comedies. We were all behaving differently than we used to; we had drunk from the cup of suspicion of one another; people inevitably were afraid of too close an association with someone who might one day fall afoul of some committee. Even certain words vibrated perilously, words like organize, social, militant, movement, capitalism - it didn't do to be on too familiar terms with such language. We had entered a mysterious pall from which there seemed no exit.
Returning around that time to my alma mater, the University of Michigan, to do a story for Holiday magazine, I discovered that students were avoiding living in the co-op rooming houses because the very idea of a nonprofit organization was suspiciously pro-left. The F.B.I. was paying students at Michigan to report secretly on teachers' political remarks, and teachers to report on students.
Why was there so little real opposition to this madness? Of course there was the fear of reprisals, of losing jobs or perhaps only bad publicity, but there was also guilt, and this seemed to me the main crippler, the internalized cop.
No doubt instinctually, McCarthy and Roy Cohn were handing around full plates of guilt which were promptly licked clean by people who in one way or another had brushed the sleeve of the Communist movement in the 30's - some by joining the party or supporting one of its front organizations, a left-wing union or professional guild, or in whatever manner had at some point in their lives turned to the left. Of course such people were used to being guilty - why else would they have bothered to worry about the poor, the blacks, the lynch victims, the Spanish Republicans and so on when real Americans were only remotely aware of such inequities around them?
It was a charm, a kind of spell. McCarthy could call the Roosevelt New Deal ''20 years of treason'' with hardly a rejoinder from the vast multitude of Americans for whom New Deal measures, hardly more than a decade before, had meant the difference between living on the street or in their own homes, between hunger and real starvation. It was a sort of benighted miracle that just about anything that flew out of his mouth, no matter how outrageously and obviously idiotic, could be made to land in an audience and stir people's terrors of being taken over by Communists, their very religion in danger.
I had known the Salem story since college, over a decade earlier, but what kept assaulting my brain now was not the hunt for witches itself; it was the paralysis that had led to more than 20 public hangings of very respectable farmers by their neighbors. There was something ''wonderful'' in this spectacle, a kind of perverse, malign poetry that had simply swamped the imaginations of these people. I thought I saw something like it around me in the early 50's.
The truth is that the more I worked at this dilemma the less it had to do with Communists and McCarthy and the more it concerned something very fundamental in the human animal: the fear of the unknown, and particularly the dread of social isolation.
Political movements are always trying to position themselves as shields against the unknown - vote for me and you're safe. The difference during witch hunts is that you are being made safe from a malign, debauched, evil, irreligious, wife-swapping, deceitful, immoral, stinking conspiracy stemming from the very bowels of hell. In Wisconsin in the early 50's, a reporter went door to door asking residents if they agreed with certain propositions, 10 in number, and discovered that very few people did, and that most thought the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution, unnamed of course in the inquiry, were Communistic. To propose that we should be free to express any idea at all was frightening to a lot of people.
The Colonial government in the 1690's saw itself as protecting Christianity (while unknowingly propagating a thrilling counter-religion of Satan worship) by seizing on the ravings of a klatch of repressed pubescent girls who, fearing punishment for their implicitly sexual revolt, began convincing themselves that they had been perverted by Satan. There were economic and social pressures at work, but the nub of it all as it appeared to the locals at the moment was that the arch-fiend had been sneaked into the spotless town by an alien who, even better, was black, the Barbadian slave of the Lord's very own man, the church minister himself. Authority quickly converted the poor girls back to the true religion and made them celebrities for their agonizing bravery in pointing out likely adherents of the Devil.
But were there not really Communists, whereas there never were any witches? Of course. And there are also paranoids who are really being followed. There was a very real military face-off in the 50's between America and the Soviet Union, and we had only recently ''lost'' China, but were these grounds for blacklisting actors and writers in Hollywood, or destroying professionals in many other fields, and for turning the country into a whispering gallery? What research showed me, and what I hoped the play would show the country and the world, was the continuity through time of human delusion, and the only safeguard, fragile though it may be, against it - namely, the law and the courageous few whose sacrifice illuminates delusion.
In the 35 years since the play was written it has become my most produced work by far. I doubt a week has gone by when it has not been on some stage somewhere in the world. It seems to be produced, especially in Latin America, when a dictatorship is in the offing, or when one has just been overthrown.
There is so often a telltale social sidelight connected to its production. Years ago in South Africa, black Tituba had to be played by a white woman in blackface, but the director, Barney Simon, terrified though he was of attack, wanted the white audience to contemplate the story. Last year I happened to meet Nien Cheng, the 70-year-old author of ''Life and Death in Shanghai,'' an account of her six-year imprisonment during the Cultural Revolution. Tears formed in her eyes when she shook my hand, tears as it surprisingly turned out, of gratitude.
Released from prison, she had spent months recuperating when a director friend, Huang Tsolin, invited her to see his production of ''The Crucible'' in a Shanghai theater. She said she was astounded: ''I could not believe the play was not written by a Chinese because the questions of the court were exactly the same ones the Cultural Revolutionaries had put to me!''
I saw the play in Tbilisi, Soviet Georgia, where John Proctor wore 17th-century Turkish pantaloons and a gorgeous wide moustache and was chased through a forest by a crowd waving scimitars. At Olivier's fabulous 1965 National Theater production, with Colin Blakely and Joyce Redman, I overheard a young woman in front of me whispering to her escort, ''Didn't this have something to do with that American Senator -what was his name?'' I have to admit that it felt marvellous that McCarthy was what's-his-name while ''The Crucible'' was ''The Crucible'' still.
Simone Signoret and Yves Montand did a stirring French film, a version of their Paris stage performance, with a screenplay by Jean-Paul Sartre in which the New England farmers were, inexplicably, Roman Catholic. The Long Wharf Theater in New Haven is about to open it under Arvin Brown's direction - it was Long Wharf's first production 25 years ago - and the Roundabout Theater will be doing it later this season. An HBO film of it is to be made this winter for both television and theatrical distributon. In Glasgow recently, two productions were running at the same time, one by a young Soviet company. The Schiller Theater in Berlin will have it on in a few months.
I have wondered if one of the reasons the play continues like this is its symbolic unleashing of the specter of order's fragility. When certainties evaporate with each dawn, the unknowable is always around the corner. We know how much depends on mere trust and good faith and a certain respect for the human person, and how easily breached these are. And we know as well how close to the edge we live and how weak we really are and how quickly swept by fear the mass of us can become when our panic button is pushed. It is also, I suppose, that the play reaffirms the ultimate power of courage and clarity of mind whose ultimate fruit is liberty.

HEADLINE: Suburbs Trying Alternatives To Hotels for Their Homeless

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

 BODY:
By bending Federal reimbursement rules, state and county officials in the suburbs around New York City have found a way to channel millions of dollars away from welfare hotels for homeless people and into the creation of permanent low-cost housing.
Several hundred families in the region are now living in transitional housing that social workers say is cheaper and more humane than overcrowded and often drug-infested motels and hotels. Many of the latest developments provide child care and job training to help fight the causes of homelessness, and allow the transitional apartments to be eventually converted into rental units. Similar programs have been started in Michigan, Massachusetts and California.
''It gets people out of motels and hotels and into much better surroundings,'' said Shirley Harvey-Cook, the commissioner of social services in Orange County, N.Y., which cut the number of families the county placed in hotels to 50 from 100 a year ago, partly through the new programs. 
Most important, the projects are a breakthrough in one of the most frustrating problems facing advocates for the homeless: how to tap into the vast amount of Federal money now available strictly for emergency housing.
The rule-bending works like this: The Federal Government now pays half the cost to temporarily house homeless families in motels and hotels, which typically charge more than $2,000 a month for a room. The states and counties pay the difference.
But with the region's severe housing shortage, many families spend months, even years, in motels. So why not spend the $2,000 a month on an apartment rather than a motel room? Federal regulations prohibit spending the money, which comes from the Department of Health and Human Services, on permanent housing.
 
Hotel Business With a Twist
To get around that restriction, state and county officials are contracting with nonprofit housing agencies and private landlords, who buy abandoned apartments or multi-family houses with the help of state and local grants and conventional mortgages.
The housing agencies or landlords go into the hotel business, but with a twist. Under the contract, the landlord designates some or all of a building's apartments as emergency housing, qualifying them for the emergency assistance rate. The rate varies widely and, because local governments have become so desperate to find housing for the homeless, is sometimes as high as triple the market rent. Instead of pocketing the difference, the landlord spends the extra money to renovate the building, hire social workers and pay off the mortgage more quickly. Within 18 months to five years, the debt on the building is reduced until the apartments can be converted into permanent housing with rents so low even families on welfare can afford them.
The latest programs reflect a push by state and county officials to find alternatives to spending millions on dingy welfare motels and hotels, where about 70 percent of all homeless families live. Throughout the region, officials are directing money that would have been formerly spent for hotel rooms to pay back rents, rental deposits and other fees to keep families in their homes and off the welfare rolls.
Westchester County, which is using all available hotel and motel rooms inside the county, has reduced the number of families it sends to motels and hotels outside the county to 170 families from 282 a year ago, partly by using apartments.
In New Jersey, where the cost of sheltering the homeless has increased to $50 million from $9 million in the last two years, state officials have said they will stop using all hotels and motels by 1992. The state has offered to pay a county's share of shelter costs if the county reduces its hotel and motel placements. In Connecticut, where state officials will spend more than $25 million to shelter the homeless this year compared with $14.8 million in 1988, more than 300 apartments are being used for emergency shelter.
Transitional housing that offers counseling, child care and other social services has sprung up in Newark and in Middlesex County. HELP, the housing organization established by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, is building a similar project in Suffolk County and has proposed three complexes in Westchester.
In New York City, which this year will shelter 25,000 single homeless people and 11,000 homeless families, few of the newest programs have been used. Officials are instead focusing on building and rehabilitating transitional housing in which residents get training on how to run homes, keep family budgets and find jobs.
 
Reprieve From Hotel Living
The latest programs in the suburbs do more than provide cleaner, safer housing and in-house social workers. They use the emergency assistance money to convert small apartment houses or two- and three-family homes into permanent housing within a few years. Although the number of projects is still relatively small, officials say that by year's end more than 250 families in northern New Jersey and the mid-Hudson region, as well as in the Hartford and Stamford areas, will be living in emergency apartments that are generating income to renovate buildings.
For the families, living in an apartment or a house is a reprieve from the confines of hotel living, where privacy is scarce and simple conveniences like cooking are not allowed. Geneva Johnson lived with her 18-year-old son and 3-year-old grandson in a welfare motel in White Plains for 2 1/2 years before moving to a renovated three-bedroom apartment in Yonkers five months ago.
''I love it here,'' said Mrs. Johnson, 42. ''I can cook when I want; the Laundromat and grocery store are a block away, and there are no problems.''
These kind of projects have their origins in housing preservation programs that Westchester County developed in the early 1980's. The county contracted with landlords of dilapidated or largely vacant buildings to designate one or two apartments as emergency housing. Using emergency assistance payments, the landlords agreed to renovate the buildings and charge affordable rents once the work was completed.
 
Preparing for Independence
The program saved marginal buildings and avoided displacing people. ''But it didn't work very well for housing homeless families,'' said Robert Miller, a former Westchester County housing official who is now executive vice president of Westhab, a nonprofit housing agency in Elmsford, N.Y.
Westhab, whose board of directors includes builders, clergy and social workers, expanded its program in 1985 to buy apartment buildings and multi-family houses, reserving several apartments in each for emergency shelter and using the remainder for low-cost housing. Grouping families in fewer sites allowed social workers to work more closely with them. Under this model, the agency has 126 emergency apartments in 11 buildings, mainly in Yonkers and Mount Vernon.
The newest programs are forging alliances between housing agencies and social service providers, whose aim is not just to move families into apartments, but to move them in with new skills. ''It's a mistake to move some families from transitional to permanent housing before they're ready,'' said Mr. Miller. ''A number of these families have trouble with budgeting their income, parenting skills and homemaking. You need to help them with those things, so that when they do move back into an apartment they aren't just evicted a few months later.''
In the Westhab building where Mrs. Johnson lives, a building manager inspects the apartments every Friday, checking for grimy stovetops, dirty dishes or strewn clothes. Tenants who fail inspection more than twice can be evicted. In four years, no one has been evicted for messiness.
 
'The Neighbors Are Happy'
Keeping homeless families in their neighborhoods is a goal of a national pilot program operated by Urban Initiatives, a nonprofit housing agency in Stamford. Under the program, which has about a dozen emergency apartments in Stamford, Hartford and East Orange, N.J., and more than 70 in Massachusetts and Michigan, money from emergency assistance goes to renovate buildings and reduce mortgage costs. The apartments are converted into long-term affordable housing at the end of five years.
Orange County, which spends about $2 million a year to house 50 homeless families and 170 individuals in hotels and motels, has contracted with two housing agencies, Recap of Middletown and Poder of Newburgh, to operate 48 emergency apartments by next spring. Under the plan, homeless families will receive counseling and job training. After 18 months, the apartments are to be converted into permanent housing with monthly rents from $500 to $600. A similar program is under way in Dutchess County.
Unlike larger transitional housing that has drawn fierce community opposition, like Mr. Cuomo's proposed 108-unit complex in Greenburgh, N.Y., most of the smaller emergency apartments have been accepted. Westhab meets with community groups before striking any deal, and has eased lingering doubts by having its building security guards patrol the block. ''We take a boarded-up house, fix it up and the neighbors are happy,'' said David N. Hilgendorff, executive director of Suburban Housing, an agency in Bay Shore, L.I., which operates 10 single-family houses for emergency shelter and 11 for low-cost rentals in Suffolk County.
The emergency housing apartment programs have inherent limits. Their small size defuses community fears, but only dents the housing shortage. In Westchester, where the programs are most developed and the need most urgent, 15 percent of the county's 917 homeless families are in emergency apartments. Officials on Long Island complain there are few legal multi-family dwellings to convert.
But in places where the programs have taken hold, there are heartening results. In a blue Victorian two-family house that Poder operates in a tattered neighborhood in Newburgh, Nova Vandermark is getting a new start.
Ms. Vandermark and her two daughters, 14 and 4, lived for three years in welfare motels in Port Jervis and Middletown. ''It was depressing,'' said Ms. Vandermark, 33, who grew up in the county. Now she and her daughters have a cheery two-bedroom apartment and Ms. Vandermark is studying to become a nurse. ''This is better for me and for my kids,'' she said. ''I wanted them to know there is more to life than a motel room.''

HEADLINE: Honduras Votes for a Leader To Tread Between Two Wars

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Voters in this nation stuck between two civil wars voted today for a president who will have to deal with the sticky questions of how to get rid of thousands of Nicaraguan rebels and what to do with half a million war refugees.
The turnout was early and big, as people in large numbers went to the polls in flag-decked trucks, buses and cars and on foot and horseback.
Rafael Leonardo Callejas, the National Party candidate, was a slight favorite over Carlos Flores, of the incumbent Liberal Party. Mr. Flores, 39 years old, is publisher of La Tribuna, a leading Honduran newspaper. His wife, Mary, is a United States citizen. 
Mr. Callejas, 46, comes from a land-owning family and was trained as an agricultural economist at Mississippi State University.
 
Results Are Imminent
If Mr. Callejas takes office on Jan. 27, it would be the first transition of power to an opposition party since 1932. Sunday's was also the nation's third free presidential election of the decade after years of military-dominated rule. Final results were expected late today or early Monday.
Both major candidates have relatively conservative economic views and support United States foreign policies. But both also agree that the American-supported Nicaraguan rebels should move out of Honduras. Neither, however, has an idea for getting them to leave.
Two other candidates, Enrique Aguilar Paz, of the Social Democrats, and Efrain Diaz Arrivillaga, of the Christian Democrats, have small followings.
Also at stake are three vice presidential posts, a 128-seat one-chamber legislature and 289 mayors' offices. Voting was by party slate; ticket splitting was not allowed.
The major campaign issue was the economy and President Jose Azcona Hoyo's weak Liberal government. Mr. Azcona, elected in 1985, is barred by law from seeking another term.
Half a million refugees fleeing civil wars in El Salvador and Nicaragua have deepened economic problems that include per capita income of only about $500 a year, high unemployment and inflation and little industry.
More than 2.2. million people were registered, but voting was concentrated at a few locations, and many in the countryside had to travel more than 20 miles to cast ballots.

HEADLINE: Miami Beach Journal;
Jews Leaving a City, And a Piece of History

BYLINE: By JEFFREY SCHMALZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Nov. 26

 BODY:
For four decades, Miami Beach has been known as much for its Jewish flavor as for its sun and sand. As recently as seven years ago, three-quarters of its population was Jewish.
But now, in a shift that is developing so quickly that many people here are taken aback, the number of Jews in Miami Beach is plummeting.
Since 1982, the drop has amounted to 29 percent, from 82,000 to 58,000, according to surveys taken by Ira M. Sheskin, a demographer at the University of Miami. At the current rate, by the end of the 1990's this city that liked to call itself Little Jerusalem will be less than a third Jewish. 
''It's hard to express how much Miami Beach has changed,'' said Rabbi Tibor Stern, who is closing the Jacob C. Cohen Community Synagogue because the congregation is dwindling. ''There was a time when, in the evening, 15 or 20 people sat in front of every building to chat and sing. No more. It isn't the center of Jewish life it once was. It's a different Miami Beach.''
Many of the Jewish retirees who settled here in the 1950's and 1960's have died. But the decline can also be traced to thousands of Jews moving north to Broward and Palm Beach counties, along with other whites fleeing the crime and the Hispanic immigration in the Miami area.
And even though Jews are moving to South Florida from other parts of the country in record numbers, they, too, are shunning Miami Beach for Broward and Palm Beach.
They, too, fear the crime and the immigrants. But they are also a different kind of retiree from those who found Miami Beach so attractive. Unlike their predecessors, who were mostly from New York City itself, the new retirees are from its suburbs and prefer the suburban feel of Broward and Palm Beach to the high-rises of Miami Beach. And many are not content to sit on porches sunning themselves, preferring instead the golf courses and tennis courts.
To be sure, some areas of Miami Beach still retain a Jewish flavor. At Passover, 15,000 Jewish tourists continue to pack the famous hotels. And Orthodox Jewish families are moving in.
But the Jews moving here are not enough to offset the departing Jews. And the face of Miami Beach is changing dramatically.
In the southern part of the peninsula, known as South Beach, younger whites and Cuban-Americans now predominate, drinking and dining in the pastel Art Deco hotels where only a year or two ago elderly Jews rocked on the front porches speaking Yiddish. In 1982, the median age on Miami Beach was 67. But by 1985, as elderly Jews died or moved, it had dropped to 54.
At least 3 of the 10 synagogues in the southern half of Miami Beach are closed or plan to close. Along Washington Avenue, only two of eight kosher butcher shops that were there about 10 years ago remain. National groups like the American Jewish Congress have moved or plan to move their regional offices away, following the Jewish migration to the north.
Whether this is good or bad for Miami Beach is open to debate. Hispanic groups are pleased. Citing surveys by the city, they point out that more than 40 percent of the people moving in are believed to be Hispanic. Some Jews agree that the change is positive, saying that the Beach had become a ghetto and that it is good for Jews to be dispersed through South Florida.
But others mourn the loss of what was not just a neighborhood but a way of life. ''I'd like to see the Beach maintain its Jewishness,'' said Rabbi Solomon Schiff, the executive vice president of the Rabbinical Association of Greater Miami. ''It was such an important center of life for Jews -a symbol.''
Whether pleased or displeased, many residents agree that a chapter in the area's history is ending with the transition of a community that had helped define Miami. And most agree that it shows that 25 years after Cuban immigrants began pouring in, the map of the Miami area is still being remade.
''I'll never forget a line in the TV sitcom 'All in the Family,' '' said Mr. Sheskin. ''Edith asked Archie where a Jewish friend had moved to, and he said, 'He's gone to the land of his people - Miami Beach.' Now all that seems back when.''

HEADLINE: Legalizing Drugs: Failures Spur Debate

BYLINE: By DAVID CORCORAN

 BODY:
The idea of legalizing drugs is emphatically rejected by the Bush Administration, by Congress and by huge majorities of Americans in opinion surveys. But it has gained surprising force in recent months, propelled by growing doubts that the Government can win its war on illicit drugs.
Some of the strongest doubts are being raised by people who can usually be counted among the Administration's strongest allies: leading conservatives and even some officials who are veterans of the war on drugs. With crime linked to drugs rising despite the Government's best efforts, they say, it is time for a national debate about the alternatives, including full or partial legalization.
''We should at least be willing to debate these issues,'' said George P. Shultz, who as Secretary of State led the Reagan Administration's effort to eradicate drug crops abroad. Mr. Shultz, who teaches at Stanford University's School of Business, said in an interview that President Bush's program is ''conceptually no different'' from past Government efforts that ''have not achieved the result he's seeking.'' 
The Administration, which has said legalization would be an ''unqualified national disaster'' in the words of William J. Bennett, the Director of Drug Control Policy, brushed Mr. Shultz's suggestion aside. ''Whoa, he's been out on the West Coast too long, hasn't he?'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary. #5 to 1 Against Legalization Public opinion is on the Administration's side. In a recent poll by the National Opinion Research Center, five-sixths of those surveyed said marijuana should not be legalized. And when Congress last spoke out on the issue, in last year's anti-drug law, it declared that legalization would be an unconscionable surrender in a war in which ''there can be no substitute for total victory.''
But if anything, the debate on legalization has intensified since Mr. Bush announced his anti-drug strategy to the nation on Sept. 5. It has become a staple of editorial pages, letters to the editor, public lectures and talk shows on television and radio. And many who do not go as far as advocating legalization show a new interest in the subject.
Charles Murray, the policy analyst whose 1984 book ''Losing Ground'' was the source of many Reagan Administration ideas on overhauling the welfare system, said in an interview that although legalization would be a ''leap into the unknown,'' he has been edging toward it as he grapples with the implications of cracking down ever more heavily on drug users and street dealers. ''Exactly how many people are you willing to put in jail?'' he asked. ''Is it really feasible? Do you want that kind of police state?''
And William F. Buckley, the conservative columnist who is a longtime advocate of legalization, predicted that it would ''inevitably prevail because the alternatives are becoming increasingly discredited.''
A sizable minority of the law-enforcement officials, judges and scholars who attended a conference on money laundering last month in Miami said that although they did not necessarily support legalization, they agreed with many of its advocates' arguments.
 
Efforts Seen as Failures
One of those officials was K. Brooks Thomas, the regional counsel in Miami for the Customs Service, the principal Federal agency responsible for keeping illegal drugs out of Florida. Mr. Thomas said he did not support legalization but was ''appalled when members of Congress indicated it would be unthinkable to debate such a thing.''
''The methods we're applying simply aren't working,'' he added.
Until last year, the advocates of legalization were a tiny minority relegated to the fringes of the national debate on drugs. They included Mr. Buckley, who is editor of The National Review; Milton Friedman, the free-market economist who won the 1976 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science; the Libertarian Party, and the American Civil Liberties Union.
But in April 1988 Kurt Schmoke, a former Assistant United States Attorney who had just become Mayor of Baltimore, stunned a meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors by declaring that the nation was losing the war on drugs and urging, ''Let's at least have a national debate about decriminalizing drugs.'' Mayor Schmoke's speech attracted national attention. ''When politicians put their electoral future on the line,'' said Ira Glasser, the executive director of the civil liberties union, ''people pay attention.''
The advocates of legalization favor a variety of approaches. Some would experimentally remove criminal penalties on marijuana, then gradually decriminalize other drugs if the experiment seemed to work. Others favor wholesale decriminalization, even for dangerous and highly addictive drugs like crack.
 
Treatment as a Health Problem
As bad as crack is, said Arnold S. Trebach, a professor of criminal justice at American University who is president of the Drug Policy Foundation, a nonprofit group in Washington, ''keeping the drug within the control of an absolute criminal prohibition makes the situation worse.''
The advocates are united by two convictions: that drugs should be treated as a health problem, not a problem for the criminal justice system, and that the war on drugs cannot be won. By keeping drugs illegal, they say, the Government has created a black market that drives prices - and traffickers' profits - sky high.
''The greatest beneficiaries of the drug laws are organized and unorganized drug traffickers,'' Ethan A. Nadelmann, who teaches politics and public affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, wrote in the Sept. 1 issue of the journal Science. If drugs were legal, he and other advocates argue, the criminal violence surrounding them would fade as it did when the Prohibition against alcohol was repealed in 1933.
The proponents concede that overall drug use would probably rise if criminal penalties were dropped, just as consumption of alcohol about doubled in the decade after the repeal of Prohibition. But they argue that expanded treatment and education programs would help keep people away from drugs.
Advocates say that if the Government legalized drugs and taxed them as it does tobacco and alcohol, it could save the billions it spends on enforcement and earn billions more in revenue. That money could be applied to treatment and prevention.
 
Predictions of More Drug Use
To opponents of legalization, such arguments betray a dangerous naivete and an unwillingness to come to grips with the nature of drugs like cocaine. ''Cocaine is clearly much more addicting than alcohol,'' said Dr. Herbert D. Kleber, a Yale University professor of psychiatry who is Mr. Bennett's deputy director for demand reduction, If it were legalized, he added, ''I think you'd see a five- to sixfold increase above the present level of use.''
If the Government taxed drugs heavily, opponents say, traffickers could still undercut the price. If the price were reduced to avoid that problem, they say, drug use would rise.
Dr. Kleber said the legalization advocates were ''intellectually dishonest, playing cruel games with the American people.''
And Mark A. R. Kleiman, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government who worked in the Justice Department under President Ronald Reagan, says he doubts that anyone can develop a plausible argument for legalizing the most dangerous drugs.
He said no one should ever assume that the future cannot be worse than the present: ''In a singing contest, never award the prize to the second soprano until you've heard her sing, even if the first one was awful.''

HEADLINE: WHEAT CROP FACES THREAT OF DROUGHT

BYLINE: By WILLIAM ROBBINS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SALINA, Kan., Nov. 22

 BODY:
Signs of yet another drought are spreading fear among farmers like Larry Kern and Jerry Ireton, who say they could be facing their second straight disastrous harvest of winter wheat.
And while it is too early to panic, it is not too soon to worry about conditions throughout the five-state region where most of the hard red winter wheat, the principal American bread grain, is grown, agricultural experts say.
The new threat comes at a time when world consumption of wheat has been exceeding production and, as a result, world supplies have been dwindling.
''The wheat's just not rooting down,'' Mr. Kern said as he poked into dusty soil around scrawny plants in a field just west of this central Kansas city. ''It's not rooting down to the subsoil because there's no moisture down there for it to get.'' 
Mr. Ireton said: ''Missing another crop would be pretty tough to take. Last year was the nearest thing to a total loss I ever saw.'' #5 States Leading Are Producers Mr. Kern and Mr. Ireton farm in one of the most productive regions of a state that normally leads the country in wheat production. The four other leading producers of hard red winter wheat are Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado and Nebraska.
Over the past year a series of bad weather episodes battered wheat farmers across most of that area, leading to the poorest crop of winter wheat in 1989 that the nation had seen in 11 years. It was a total of about 1.5 billion bushels. Winter wheat is planted in early fall, takes root then lies dormant through winter and is harvested in late spring and early summer.
The hard red winter wheat is the biggest portion of all American wheat, which also includes soft varieties of winter wheat as well as spring wheat.
The reduced supplies are driving up wheat prices. The effect they may have on consumer prices remains uncertain. The cost of the wheat is so small a part of the price of bread that the effect of small changes for a bushel is minimal, economists say.
The price for hard red wheat at Kansas City grain elevators, for example, is now at $4.36 a bushel, as against $4.20 a year ago and not far from highs for the year.
The state hardest hit by the weather has been Kansas, which usually accounts for a a third of hard red winter wheat and 16 to 17 percent of the country's entire wheat crop. After a dry autumn last year, the crop in Kansas suffered from a bitterly cold February after a January thaw and from a dry March with high winds that blew the topsoil off entire fields.
Kansas produced less than half of its normal yields this spring and summer.
Agricultural weather experts now say an unusually dry fall has set the stage for a possible return of some of last year's problems. The dryness leaves the land vulnerable to eroding winds and the crop in greater danger than usual from cold-weather damage.
''It's about time for this crop to go into dormancy,'' Mr. Ireton said. ''It won't need much water then, but if it goes into dormancy in the condition it's in now, it won't be able to stand much cold weather.''
Douglas LeComte, chief of the agricultural weather section of a joint agency of the Agriculture Department and the National Weather Service, said: ''This has been going on long enough to call it a drought. Now, if the crop goes into dormancy in its present weakened condition, the outlook for next summer's crop is not very good.''
Instances of extreme dryness are widespread, Mr. LeComte said. Dodge City, for example, has had less than one-tenth of an inch of rain since September and northestern Colorado has had less than a quarter of an inch. Most of the states producing hard red winter wheat get at least four inches in that period.
''The last good rains in the wheat belt were in the first part of September,'' said Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of the Weather Service Corporation of Bedford, Mass., a private consultant to business. ''Most places have had hardly any since, and there doesn't seem to be any significant precipitation in sight.''
This, he said, ''looks like it's going to be one of the driest Novembers on record for Kansas.'' On average statewide no more than a trace of moisture has been recorded. The driest recorded November was in 1954, when precipitation averaged three-hundredths of an inch.
Figures for other states vary, but agricultural statisticians are reporting dry conditions for all the major producers of hard red winter wheat.
While there is still time for winter snows and good spring rains to ease conditions, history does not augur well for good crops after such a dry fall, Mr. Leavitt noted.
 
Total Supply Is Declining
Since 1930, he said, there have been 18 seasons in which Kansas had less than two-thirds of normal rainfall for October and November. Fifteen of those dry autumns were followed by below-normal crops.
Wheat production throughout the world for the 12 months ending May 31, 1990, is projected at 532 million metric tons. But for the second year in a row, production is falling short of consumption, which has been placed at 536 million metric tons. A metric ton of wheat equals 36.7 bushels.
That would leave the total supplies of wheat at 112.8 million metric tons next June 1, down from 116.9 million tons a year earlier. That reserve, amounting to 21 percent of a year's consumption, is the smallest since 1973.
Similarly, supplies are tightening in the United States, which is also using more than it has produced this year. Wheat produced this year totaled 2.04 billion bushels, but consumption totaled 2.3 billion bushels. The nation's reserve supplies dropped to 443 million bushels from 698 million.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Say Pentagon Hasn't Thought Through Its Cuts

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Members of Congress who deal with military policy say the Pentagon is scrambling to propose cuts in troops and weapons for budget reasons without thinking through the altered strategic needs dictated by political upheaval in Eastern Europe.
In interviews over the past week, they made it clear that they were unimpressed by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's request that each armed service propose cuts that would take effect over the next few years. They said the suggestions the services had offered in response, like slowing production of the Stealth bomber or closing Air Force bases, had little, if anything, to do with changes in Europe.
''My own impression is that Secretary Cheney's orders to the services reflect fiscal change, not a real threat assessment,'' said Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee. He added that the combination of legal requirements to reduce the deficit and President Bush's resistance to new taxes would have forced the Administration to look for serious cuts in the military budget even if the Soviet Union were still ruled by a hard-liner like Leonid Brezhnev. 
''I think these cuts he's talking about now, when you get down to it, are not in relationship to events in Eastern Europe,'' Mr. Nunn said. ''That's the background music, and that's what makes the politics of it more acceptable to an awful lot of people, both on Capitol Hill and in the country.''
 
Momentum From the East
Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, said Mr. Cheney clearly faced strong pressures within the Cabinet to cut spending. Mr. Warner added that he and others on Capitol Hill wanted to be certain that the cuts reflect a long-term strategy that accounts for needs not just in Europe but in the rest of the world, and not just the risks of superpower conflict but other responsibilities like fighting terrorism and drug trafficking.
''The threat assessment is going to be the hottest document in Washington next year,'' he said. ''The Congressional committees will be scrutinizing it like never before.''
He and his colleagues agreed that the tempo and drama of events in the Soviet bloc have added enormous momentum to what was already a strong push in Congress for cuts in the military budget.
''This is not just a wind blowing, but a gale coming at the defense budget,'' said Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense.
Representative Norm Dicks, a Washington Democrat who is a senior member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, agreed. He said that he expected the Pentagon to propose a 1991 budget that covers only the increase caused by inflation, but that Congress would want deeper cuts. ''If the Pentagon comes out with a 5 percent real cut, about $15 billion, they would have to consider that a victory,'' he said.
 
Ascertaining the Threat
Mr. Nunn said he had no doubt that the threat to NATO allies in Western Europe had decreased as a result of political changes in Eastern Europe and the unilateral force reductions announced by the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
But he cautioned that these dramatic political developments do not necessarily translate into equally dramatic changes in overall American military strategy. ''I believe that if you are going to make cuts related to the reduced threat, first you have to ascertain what the threat is,'' he said, and added that before his panel takes action on next year's budget, he would ask the Administration for a complete assessment of how the changes in Europe affect the structure of United States forces and its responsibilities to countries like South Korea and Japan.
Mr. Nunn and other military specialists in Congress said they did not want the United States to make unilateral cuts until the negotiations on strategic and conventional forces, now going on in Geneva and Vienna respectively, are complete.
But they acknowledged that they may not have the luxury of time or political harmony in which to make their budget decisions, particularly in a Congressional election year.
Already, a group of about two dozen liberal House Democrats, several of whom serve on the House Budget Committee, are laying plans to try to use recent events as a basis for major cuts in the military budget for fiscal 1991.
The liberals say they want no part in the kind of budget accord with the White House in which domestic and military programs take an equal share of cuts. Representative George Miller, a California Democrat, said his colleagues will demand that savings from the military budget be large enough to plow back into domestic programs like housing, education and child care.
 
'An Old-Fashioned Debate'
''In the past,'' Mr. Miller said, ''the Congressional leadership has run off with a few people in the Administration and decided what the defense number would be.'' He complained that such an arrangement made it impossible to shift money from military programs to domestic ones and called for open decisions ''and an old-fashioned debate about what our defense policy should be.''
The liberals are unlikely to succeed on their own. But they are seeking allies among more conservative Democrats from the South who expect military spending to be cut and want the saving applied to reducing the deficit.
That prospect worries the House Armed Services Committee chairman, Les Aspin of Wisconsin. A senior aide said Mr. Aspin saw potential for budget chaos in the House as the liberals' demands become entangled with members' more parochial concerns about base closings and production-line cutbacks in their districts.
Representative G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery, a Mississippi Democrat who ranks seventh on the armed services panel, said regional politics will also be at play next year.
''The biggest problem we have in defense is that all the attention gets focused on the weapons,'' he said. ''In the Northeast, the money is spent on procurement and research; in the South, we've got the bases. I'd rather have the cuts hit some of the weapons systems and concentrate on helping the personnel.''
 
Rethinking Services' Roles
Mr. Montgomery contended that reductions in active-duty troops should be balanced by increases in National Guard and Reserve forces to maintain a strong defense while saving money. Senator Stevens says money can be saved by shortening the overseas tours and keeping dependents at home.
Senator Warner said one of the most basic questions is whether the changes in Europe require a redefinition of the missions of each of the services. Spending cuts cannot simply be apportioned equally among the Army, Navy and Air Force, he argued; fewer ground forces need more mobility, and ''that means better Air Force and Navy transport, lighter divisions, more emphasis on special forces.''
In asking the services to review their budgets, Mr. Cheney apportioned the reduced spending targets evenly, but one Administration official said the Defense Secretary was likely to make changes as he drew up a long-term spending plan.
Like Mr. Nunn, Mr. Warner said the reduced threat in Western Europe also argues for more specialization in NATO, with allies closest to the potential battle lines concentrating on troops and equipment while the United States concentrates on long-range naval and air power.
Mr. Stevens said the events in Eastern Europe had left even the staunchest conservatives a little breathless. ''I feel sort of like an astronaut, weightless,'' he said. ''We are literally looking at this situation from another world, and our greatest problem is going to be making sure that whatever we do, we do it right.''

HEADLINE: The Limits of Medicare

 BODY:
In last week's rush to adjourn, Congress took a bold step forward and a giant leap backward on medical insurance for the elderly. The step forward was a system to control total physician billings. The leap backward was repeal of catastrophic health insurance - which protected the elderly against bankrupting medical bills. 
Physician reimbursements under Medicare -the Federal health insurance for the elderly and disabled - have been rising by about 15 percent per year. Part of the inflation is due to uncontrollable factors: a growing population of retirees and new medical technologies. But part is due to an increase in superfluous tests and procedures. Medicare now gives little incentive to limit expensive tests that have only marginal medical value.
The new legislation tries to solve this problem by establishing a fee schedule that limits how much Medicare will reimburse doctors for individual procedures. The law also limits how much a doctor can charge a Medicare patient above the scheduled amount. In addition, the law sets national annual targets for total physician billings. If billings in a year exceed the target, then the reimbursement schedule for the next year will be reduced.
Under this system, doctors who bill for unnecessary procedures wind up hurting their colleagues. That is supposed to motivate medical societies to monitor their members and reprimand abusers.
These ''expenditure targets'' may not work. A better law would impose the targets more locally. But the basic strategy is a sound way to address excess physician billings. The measure is worth approving in order to establish the concept in law -perhaps subject to refinements as experience makes clearer how expenditure targets can work.
Catastrophic insurance, which began last January, was designed to reimburse the elderly for large medical bills that are not covered under Medicare. To pay for the program, Congress raised Medicare premiums by about $60 per year and imposed a separate surtax on elderly individuals with annual incomes above $16,000. The typical surtax is $300 per year, reaching a maximum of $800 for those with incomes in excess of $43,000.
The families paying the surtax rebelled and forced Congress to repeal the entire program. They resented subsidizing insurance for the poor and paying for benefits that many already received from former employers.
Lost in the furor was the fact that every Medicare recipient - even the wealthiest - is heavily subsidized by the general taxpayer. The surtax reduced, but did not eliminate, this unjustified subsidy for middle-income and affluent families.
While Congress repealed catastrophic insurance, it cannot repeal catastrophic illness. And the public will continue to pay for it, through the Federal Medicaid insurance program, when the victims are poor. Many of the retirees who complained about the Federal surtax are soon going to have a new complaint - about increases in their premiums for private insurance against catastrophic medical costs. They will face the choice of paying those premiums or accepting that costly illness could force them into destitution.
America's aged are entitled to both health care and freedom from the indignity of forced poverty. Congress might respond with a new catastrophic program that subsidizes coverage for the poor with general taxes rather than a surtax on the middle-and upper-income elderly. Or it might make available unsubsidized insurance. Or it might pursue the issue in the context of a more comprehensive national health insurance plan.
Whatever form the response may take, the demise of catastrophic insurance makes the aged-health care issue more urgent than ever.

HEADLINE: Candid Comment From Tokyo

 BODY:
When the Bush Administration charged Japan with unfair restrictions on imports from America last spring, it also wisely proposed that the two governments sit down and air complaints about each other's economic systems. That opened the way for Japan to pick at America's faults, instead of just taking it on the chin from Washington. Tokyo has responded with a cogent critique. 
Washington argues basically that ''structural impediments'' in the Japanese economy deny its citizens a higher standard of living - and, not incidentally, purchasing power to buy more U.S. goods. It cites a fragmented distribution system, interlocking business and banking interests, inadequate investment in transportation and housing, and a pattern of favoring Japanese products.
In contrast to Washington's fix on Japanese practices that inhibit imports, Tokyo's critique focuses on America's declining competitiveness as an exporter. The main targets are the U.S. budget deficit and low private savings, too little investment in plant modernization and too much in leveraged buyouts, American business's focus on short-term results, inadequate spending on education, and antitrust laws that prevent collaboration.
Sound familiar? You don't have to go to Tokyo to hear such advice. Mainstream American economists would endorse most of it. European governments hounded President Reagan for eight years on the budget deficit. Even President Bush would agree with the Japanese in principle if not in detail.
The detail is spelled out in supporting documents. On education, for example, the Japanese call on schools and colleges to upgrade instruction in math, science and languages, and on businesses to give more ''practical training.'' Tokyo has even challenged the high-sounding rhetoric of President Bush's ''summit conference'' on education by asking for an outline of what the Administration will actually do. On the budget deficit, Japan challenges the Bush proposal to cut taxes on capital gains, and suggests a gasoline tax - a pair of thoughts that, considering the source, Mr. Bush might ponder if he were truly disposed to hear intelligent criticism.
The ''structural impediments'' talks are founded on two ideas: that America's foreign trade deficit is not all the other guy's fault, and that import restrictions are only one factor affecting the flow of exports and imports. Alas, America's new trade law tends to blame the other guy; Congress directed the Administration to act as unilateral judge of other countries' trade practices, and to curb imports from any that it judges ''unfair.'' But the Administration realized that that would barely dent the $50 billion U.S.-Japan trade deficit, and would certainly aggravate America's relations with its strongest ally. Thus the broader talks.
Japan has shown unaccustomed candor in this mutual critique. The Administration owes the Japanese - and America - some good answers.

HEADLINE: Parental Consent Could Justify Forced Abortion;
Public Shouldn't Pay

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''Bush and the Zealots'' (column, Oct. 19), Anthony Lewis can find no moral basis on which George Bush can deny ''the right'' to abortion ''to poor victims of violence,'' while allowing it for others. The President denies nothing to the poor that he would grant to the rich; he simply opposes Federal financing of abortion in the circumstances concerned. 
Lest this seem justice of the kind that gives rich and poor equal freedom to sleep under bridges, Mr. Lewis should examine the economics of the matter. According to ABC's World News Tonight of Oct. 25, rape and incest are responsible for about 16,000 pregnancies each year. The average cost of an abortion, the report added, is $190. Though it would not be necessary - rape and incest not being limited to the poor - only $3.04 million would provide abortions for all these women. Raising such a sum annually would be a minor task for Planned Parenthood and other pro-choice groups. One can only conclude that their concern is not to succor the victims but to score a political victory.
It is not hypocritical for the President and others who reluctantly concede that abortion is sometimes the lesser evil to reject government financing of it. If there be moral fault, it lies with those - is ''zealots'' too strong a word? - who insist that abortion is a private matter, while denouncing as opportunistic political leaders who resist making the public pay for it.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Advice to Sherpas

BYLINE: By William Safire

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
One practical question is burning in the minds of the President and his pre-summit sherpas: What will it take to get the Red Army completely out of Eastern Europe?
That is at the heart of the matter in this moment of convolution. If Mr. Gorbachev can withdraw his 380,000 men from East Germany, his 80,000 from Czechoslovakia, his 62,000 from Hungary and his 40,000 from Poland, then his spinoff of Eastern Europe will indeed be irreversible.
While troops remain, a policy reversal and crackdown are possible; but after such a pullout, it would take a new World War for his successor to reassert Communist control in the crumbling Soviet empire. 
Evidently he wants to withdraw the troops. Eastern Europe is a millstone around the neck of a millstone; continued occupation and control of these four countries is more than the failing Soviet system can afford.
Certainly Gorbachev knew that as soon as the captive peoples learned of his refusal to continue backing the puppet governments with Soviet tanks, they would rise and throw out the quislings. A garrison state ends when the garrison won't roll over dissenters.
He must have been equally certain that the post-quisling governments would do away with the imposed ''leading role'' of Communism. Even the Supreme Soviet came close last week to jettisoning Article Six of the Soviet Constitution, the party's license to command.
The logic is inexorable: coming elections in the Eastern non-bloc will lead to the demand from occupied countries to remove the occupiers. The four-decade fiction that Soviet troops are defending the Poles, Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and Germans from the West can no longer be maintained. The occupation thus becomes today's anachronism: if you're not going to use them, lose them.
Preparing for Malta, President Bush should keep his eye on the ball: his historic assignment is to hasten the day of total Soviet military withdrawal to positions within Soviet borders.
The President and his men should stop fretting about ''another Yalta'' because it would be impossible, in this day, to keep secret agreements secret. Private understandings between world leaders no longer have weight; public opinion must ratify whatever comes out of the meetings.
Nor is ''another Reykjavik'' in the cards; Gorbachev would be a fool to try to entrap another U.S. President in a grand, surprising bid to make a bilateral deal. Malta shouldn't be ''another'' anything; it should be sui generis.
A half-dozen suggestions for our sherpas: 1. Stop trying to manage anticipation. Nobody believed the protestations about putting feet up and schmoozing; the effort to minimize possible disappointment or maximize achievement by downplaying the summit meeting beforehand is silly. Americans have the right to anticipate the end of Moscow's subsidy of Caribbean killing. 2. Do not be induced by the headiness of the history-making to meet Gorbachev ''halfway'' on troop withdrawal. First, we are not occupiers; second, Soviet troops in Europe far outnumber our own and are closer to their base. 3. Expect a new idea from Gorbachev while he is in Italy, so he can say he did not drop a bombshell at the summit meeting. If it has to do with the neutralization of Germany, let him know it is a non-starter: the Germans will decide their own orientation. NATO will continue as a political alliance because that suits its members, while the Warsaw Pact is an amalgam eager to dissolve. 4. Reject with solemnity any overtures about advance ''understanding'' on crackdowns in the Baltics or curbs on glasnost anywhere. The shameful silence of America's journalists at Gorbachev's firing of Vladimir Starkov, editor of the widest-read Soviet newspaper, for the crime of reporting Gorbachev's unpopularity is indicative of the blinding power of euphoria. Our job is to raise, not lower, expectations of freedom. 5. Be ready, if he needs a fig leaf for implosion, to come up with an East-West non-aggression pact. Convening some new Congress of Vienna purely to assure Moscow that it is secure from invasion would cost us nothing; we could agree to call the withdrawal a glorious homecoming. 6. Don't start offering to bail out the Soviet economy; its crisis is the impetus for all that has happened this year. Instead, offer expert advice on gold standards and free enterprise.
The great temptation is to try to solve everything at once. Instead, Mr. Bush should focus on one great aim: end the Soviet occupation of Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Educators Belittle New Jersey's 'Report Cards' on Schools

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
By giving all of New Jersey's public schools ''report cards'' recently, state education officials had hoped to create a dialogue between parents and educators that would, over time, make schools more accountable and improve education.
They created a dialogue, but not the type they had hoped for. Since the reports were distributed earlier this month, representatives of the state's school boards, administrators and teachers, as well as outside education experts, have criticized them and the kind of comparisons they immediately inspired.
They complain that the reports - which contain local and statewide statistics for items like test scores, spending, and graduation rates - tell parents nothing about the overall quality of education in New Jersey. The critics say the reports offer no perspective on academic progress this year at each school, thereby giving them little immediate value. In addition, they argue, the categories of data are too skimpy to be of long-range value. 
''The card doesn't tell you enough about the school,'' said Jeremiah Regan, head of the New Jersey School Boards Association. ''My major concern is that parents, citizens, and real-estate agents will draw very simplistic conclusions,'' said Susan Fuhrman, director of the Center for Policy Research in Education, run by Rutgers, Michigan State and Stanford Universities and the University of Wisconsin.
 
Comparisons Called Flawed
''It has a few isolated items,'' said James A. Moran, executive director of the New Jersey Association of School Administrators, which represents the state's public school superintendents. ''We don't believe it will do good for the students of New Jersey or the school districts.'' In addition, critics argue, some news accounts based on data for all 2,174 public schools have drawn flawed comparisons between per-pupil spending and standardized-test scores in poor cities and wealthy suburbs.
Since the reports were proposed in early 1988, Saul Cooperman, the State Education Commissioner, and his aides have insisted that it was not a tool to rank or compare districts.
Each report has average data for the entire state and numbers for one individual school. No figures are provided to satisfy parents' universal curiosity about how their child's school compares with others.
Despite the state's aversion to comparison, many have been made. Some, which compare spending and test scores without factoring in a district's social and economic profile, have disturbed critics.
For example, Newark spends $5,942 a pupil, against a state average of $5,185, and the highest average Scholastic Aptitude Test score from the city's six open-admission high schools is 663, compared to the state average of 896. Suburban Nutley and Sparta spend $4,976 and $4,705, respectively, and have S.A.T. scores of 936 and 941, respectively.
''Do we conclude that the less spent, the higher the scores will be?'' asked Mr. Regan of the School Boards Association. ''If Newark dropped to Nutley's $4,900, would its scores go up? Without considering socioeconomic data, there isn't a one-to-one relationship between spending and quality.''
Kenneth Carlson, a professor at the Rutgers Graduate School of Education, said Newark's poverty, family instability and ''community ethos'' are among the numerous factors that bear on a student's academic performance there.
''Newark may not be spending anywhere near enough to cope with the sheer magnitude of the problems it has,' he said.
 
Challenge to Aid Formula
The absence of socioeconomic data from the new report cards takes on added importance now because the State Supreme Court is considering a landmark lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of New Jersey's education-aid formula. The suit contends the formula discriminates against the poorest urban districts by denying their students many of the programs available in suburban districts rich in property taxes.
The State Education Department denies the formula is inherently biased.
Marilyn Morheuser, the lead lawyer on the challenge to the formula, said the report card data uphold the argument that the poorest districts with the most educational needs have the lowest test scores.
The state's past analysis of ninth-grade scores on its own basic-skills tests has consistently revealed that the higher a district's socioeconomic status, the higher its test scores are.
 
Three Years of Data
The state omitted any reference to social and economic data from the new card for fear of stigmatizing the poorer districts and crimping their educational ambitions, said Richard A. DiPatri, an assistant commissioner who heads the report card program.
''The best part of the report card is not this first year but the second and the third,'' Mr. DiPatri said. ''Ultimately, parents will have three years of data and will be able to see if there's improvement.''
But even then, critics say, the cards will not give parents a full picture of all a school offers - and does not offer.
Statistics that are provided deal with a school district's spending per pupil; a school's enrollment; the ratio of professional staff, including teachers, librarians and counselors, to students; daily instructional time; drop-out rates; the percentage of students entering or leaving a school during the year; student performance, at the elementary-school level, on national standardized tests and, at the high-school level, on the state's ninth-grade basic-skills test; the average S.A.T. scores of graduating seniors, and the percentages of graduates who enter, college, the military and the work force.
 
'Card Has No Value'
The reports contain nothing about the diversity of a school's curriculum or its instructional resources, student behavior, its staff's average educational level or continuing training programs, or its extracurricular programs and accomplishments.
''In and of itself, the card has no value,'' said Robert Broderick, a spokesman for the New Jersey Education Association, the state's largest teachers union.
The New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association cautioned in a statement against evaluating a school's quality only by the card's criteria. Curriculum, faculty commitment to scholarship and the learning atmosphere are essential ingredients in assessing a school, it said.
Education officials readily acknowledge that the cards' offerings are limited. Mr. Cooperman calls the report a ''snapshot'' of a school. But the intention, his aides say, was to make the card concise and easy to understand. Consequently, only objective data was gathered.
Data on most of the categories had been compiled in past years by the Education Department and was available on request. But the report cards pull all the data together in a single document for the first time. About 1.3 million copies of the reports, dealing with 1,808 elementary schools and 366 high schools, were printed.
California, Virginia, Illinois and some other states have various types of ''school report cards,'' but New Jersey is the first state to send a report home to parents or make it available to taxpayers or anyone else interested, the Education Department said.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Tale of Two Yuris: For Soviet Ambassador, These Are the Best of Times

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Yuri Vladimirovich Dubinin calls himself ''a popularizer of perestroika,'' a salesman of the new Soviet thinking that brings Red Army watches to Bloomingdale's and blasts holes in the Berlin Wall.
With real political debate in Moscow, a Solidarity-led Government in Poland, huge demonstrations in Czechoslovakia, the promise of free elections in Hungary and the opening of the border between the Germanys, there has never been a more promising time to be the Soviet Ambassador to Washington.
''It's very exciting,'' Mr. Dubinin says of changes in Soviet attitudes and their effects on his life - so exciting that his words tumble out, disclosing both his zest for the job and his uncertain command of English:
''The feelings of a diplomat is that perestroika opened new horizons for our diplomatic activity. Absolutely. And how to say, the most important part, the essence of the diplomatic activity - contacts, understanding and cooperation with other countries. It's luck just to be involved.'' 
Mr. Dubinin got off to a rough start in Washington, sometimes boring former Secretary of State George P. Shultz and irritiating his successor, James A. Baker 3d. But he has undergone a remarkable personality change. Yesterday's gray-faced apparatchik is today's bon vivant.
 
'A Different Person Today'
''Whoever he was yesterday, he's obviously a different person today,'' says Max M. Kampelman, the former chief United States arms negotiator who sat on the other side of the table from Mr. Dubinin's delegation at Madrid. ''But the key is that his Government's policies are different today. He is and always was a faithful servant of his Government. Faithful, that's the word to describe him.''
It is hard to believe that this Yuri V. Dubinin, Washington's most sought-after Socialist socialite, is the same Yuri V. Dubinin who, in 1980, as the Soviet Ambassador to Spain, stalled for two months at a 35-nation preparatory conference on human rights and security issues in Madrid.
In those pre-perestroika days, Mr. Dubinin was so secretive that comrades from other Warsaw Pact countries had to turn to their NATO counterparts for assessments of the private parts of the negotiations. The Spaniards considered expelling him because of K.G.B. meddling in the Canary Islands. His hard-line positions and his hairdo earned him the description ''A Molotov with a pompadour.''
It is a function of both the times and Mr. Dubinin's personality that he now spends as much time buttonholing businessmen, eyeballing farms and factories across America and mingling with the rich and the royal in black tie or tails as he spends reporting on the nuances of superpower politics. Indeed, the 59-year-old envoy seems more comfortable with his new roles than with the old ones.
When he talks about joint ventures or cultural exchanges, Mr. Dubinin is effusive. But when the subject turns substantive, he proves that he is very much a product of Andrei A. Gromyko's school of diplomacy. The cardinal rule of the late Foreign Minister and President was to give away nothing and put the other side on the defensive.
 
Limited Latitude
Mr. Dubinin's interpretation of the significance of the scheduled summit meeting off the island of Malta in early December illustrates both his extreme caution and the limitations of his diplomatic latitude.
''You see, there are a lot of speculations around this meeting,'' he said. ''And on one side, I would say that all kind of speculations is just a manifestation of interest. It's a positive aspect. Sometimes this kind of speculations could be damageable also, because, you see, it could be speculations that could raise too much expectations, too much hopes, too much projects and after that it could be a kind of disappointment.''
Mr. Dubinin came to Washington in May 1986 as an obscure career diplomat who had specialized in Western Europe, spoke little English and had not set foot on American soil until he was appointed Moscow's top representative at the United Nations two months earlier. He stood in the shadow of Anatoly F. Dobrinin, his predecessor, whose 24 years as the Soviet Ambassador made him the most formidable diplomatic presence on the Potomac and Moscow's top specialist on American affairs.
Mr. Dobrynin was brilliant, daring and shrewd; Mr. Dubinin is smooth, cautious and nice. He lacks the access and the insight of his predecessor, who knew six Presidents and nine Secretaries of State and had a direct line into the Politburo. But he enjoys the advantage of a better relationship between Moscow and Washington.
''The nature of the job has become much easier and more pleasant and he is thriving,'' said John C. Whitehead, the former Deputy Secretary of State, who knows Mr. Dubinin well. ''In the social and economic world, he is acting like a normal ambassador from an important country.''
 
He Compensates for Gaps
In the world of geopolitics, however, Mr. Dubinin still has a lot to learn. To help compensate for gaps in his understanding of issues, he relies on highly sophisticated specialists who are encouraged to court the news media and address research organizations on matters of substance while he presses the flesh and works the drawing rooms.
''I don't have any complex of inferiority, not because of my experience, but because I came here - how to say - carried by a new policy,'' he said when asked about his predecessor.
Trained as a linguist, with perfect French and excellent Spanish, at first Mr. Dubinin fooled his American audiences into thinking he knew more English than he did by memorizing answers to anticipated questions in advance. Determined to be a player, he haphazardly took lessons from two American tutors and pushed himself to speak English in every social setting.
He and his wife of 36 years, Liana, have thrown open the doors of the once-formidable Soviet Embassy and transformed the mirrored and chandeliered receiving room into a regular meeting place for glasnost glitterati.
He welcomed an Iowa businessman who delivered a 50-by-13-foot congratulatory greeting card for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and held a joint news conference with Russian bears and tiger cubs when the Moscow Circus came to town. He struggled with a hand puppet named Khryusha the Piglet in a performance by Mister Rogers, the star of children's television, and presented Mitch Snyder, the Washington advocate for the homeless, with $5,000 and an elaborate samovar after Mr. Gorbachev denounced homelessness in America at the 1987 Washington summit talks.
 
Large Portions of Perestroika
''I would use an American expression to describe him - he is a person who can think big,'' says Boris Malakhov, the embassy's press spokesman.
Every event is served up with a large portion of perestroika and the economic, social and opportunities it provides.
He called his recent party for Debbye Turner, the marimba-playing Miss America, and Yulia Sukhanova, the first Soviet beauty queen in half a century, a ''kind of Soviet-American summit'' for beauties. The good-will visit of a Soviet missile cruiser to Norfolk last July became ''a clear, tangible manifestation of the new spirit'' and the signing of two Soviet hockey players by the New Jersey Devils opened ''new avenues in a spirit of cooperation.''
Mr. Dubinin's style fits nicely into Mr. Gorbachev's vision of restructuring in the Soviet economy. The Ambassador has pressed for joint ventures to generate the currency needed to make the ruble convertible on the world market. To help put more chickens into Soviet pots, he organized a tour for Soviet experts to study poultry production at the Perdue Farms operations in Virginia and Maryland. After the Armenian earthquake, which killed 25,000 people and left 500,000 homeless last December, Mr. Dubinin appeared on television, gave speeches, wrote letters, solicited businessmen and was a co-host for a Carnegie Hall concert to raise money for the victims.
Unlike his predecessor, who preferred to jawbone over scotch in the parlors of the capital, Mr. Dubinin pops up in unexpected places. He took the Mayor of Moscow to a Washington cabaret to watch a performance by the singer Mel Torme, who is of Russian Jewish descent. When French peasants and workers stormed the barricades with red flags in a Kennedy Center performance of ''Les Miserables,'' Mr. Dubinin startled some in the audience when he jumped out of his seat and cheered.
 
Travels Around the Country
In three years, he has visited 27 states, touring an international auto show in Detroit, the Chicago Board of Trade, an Iowa corn farm, the largest supermarket in the Giant Food Inc. chain and the Walt Disney Company's Epcot Center in Florida.
''I have visited more military bases in the United States than in the Soviet Union,'' he said. ''To be more honest, I have visited no military bases in the Soviet Union.''
Mr. Dubinin got off to a bad start in Washington. He antagonized State Department officials, from Mr. Shultz on down, with relentless requests for high-level meetings on inconsequential subjects. ''He was like Federal Express,'' said one State Department official who has dealt with him extensively. ''He would get a letter and was always trying to deliver it immediately.'' Mr. Dubinin is still so persistent that some senior Administration officials say they will make themselves unavailable when he comes calling on many routine matters.
Mr. Dubinin also finds it impossible to amplify official Soviet positions or improvise in meetings with American officials, even though Administration officials believe that he has a close relationship with his boss, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. His reticence has left the impression that he is not privy to high-level decisions the way Mr. Dobrynin was.
Instead, said one State Department official: ''He'll go fishing. He'll deliver a message on Afghanistan and then ask you your opinion of a non-aligned conference in Zimbabwe.''
 
Not 'a Brilliant Philosophe'
To compensate for what some Bush Administration officials characterize as Mr. Dubinin's problems of perception and lack of influence, the State Department increasingly relies on Jack Matlock, the United States Ambassador to Moscow, to get Washington's points across to the Kremlin.
''O.K., nobody is now saying that he's a brilliant philosophe or Gorbachev's right-hand man,'' says Dimitri K. Simes, a Soviet expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ''But he is what he appears to be: a highly competent professional diplomat who shows loyalty to his Government's agenda and pursues the party line.''
Mr. Dubinin uses his sense of humor, with varying degrees of success, to disguise the fact that he is more a faithful messenger than a creative thinker. In response to a protest by Mr. Baker after Honduran authorities intercepted a truckload of Soviet-bloc weapons on the way from Nicaragua to El Salvador last month, Mr. Dubinin delivered an urgent message from Mr. Shevardnadze.
After Mr. Baker read the rough English translation, he was unable to contain his anger. He coldly told the Ambassador that the message included nothing new and added that he was ''deeply disappointed'' in the Soviet response. Undaunted, Mr. Dubinin paused a moment and handed him the Russian text. ''Maybe you will read it better in the Russian,'' he said. Mr. Baker was not amused.

HEADLINE: Hope Is Seen for Poor of 7-State Delta

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
In many ways geography has wrought a common destiny for much of the lower Mississippi River delta as the centuries-old rhythm of flooding and receding waters made the agricultural bottomland fertile, attracting farmers and thousands of laborers to work the land.
But as agriculture became mechanized, jobs disappeared. Nothing has replaced most of them, leaving the region in the grip of some of the worst poverty in the nation.
Yet until the past year, no one looked at the region's problems as a whole. Instead, the seven states in the region fought the high levels of unemployment, poverty, infant mortality, substandard housing and illiteracy in their own way. But they generally found that the problems were too vast to deal with alone. 
The Lower Mississippi Delta Development Commission, created by Congress about a year ago, is now seeking to change that with the first-ever plan to fight the problems on a regional scale. The plan is due to be completed by next May.
 
'A Common History'
''We see a common history,'' said Wilbur Hawkins, executive director of the commission, ''an atmosphere which created an aristocracy and a colonial-type economy, but no middle class.''
The region, which extends from Cairo, Ill., where the Mississippi and Ohio Rivers meet, to the Gulf of Mexico, covers 214 counties in Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi and Louisiana.
Over the past four months the commission has been holding hearings throughout the region. On Nov. 30, it will hold a hearing in Greenville, Miss., on developing tourism in the region.
But the commission's chances of success remain blurred.
For one thing, while modeled on past Federal efforts to deal with regional problems, like the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Appalachian Regional Commission, the delta commission is working without the huge infusions of Federal money that breathed life into the earlier efforts. And although it has the support of the Governors of all seven states, it has yet to get noticeable support from the White House.
''We just don't have the band leaders that the A.R.C. and the T.V.A. had,'' said Lee Troutwine, Kentucky's Commissioner of Local Government, who serves as his state's representative to the delta commission as well as to the two older regional groups.
 
Depth of Problems
In an interim report released last month, the commission reported that nearly 21 percent of the 8.3 million people in the region live in poverty, as against 12.4 percent nationally. The most deeply affected are the 30 percent of the population who are black. More than half the blacks in the region have incomes below the national poverty level.
Unemployment rates in the region average more than 8 percent, as against the national rate of 5.2 percent. But some counties have unemployment rates of more than four times the national average. And while the region's per capita income of $10,192 a year is 75 percent of the national average of $13,577, 137 of the counties had average incomes that dipped to 62 percent of the national average, or less.
''The Delta's economic, social and cultural structure of life has often reinforced tensions between ethnic groups and worsened the economic subjugation of African-Americans,'' the report said, adding that changes in recent years had failed to eradicate the legacy of this history.
Both Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the commission chairman, and Mr. Hawkins said the panel does not see itself as simply trying to open a floodgate of Federal financing to the region, which already receives more than $17 billion annually in welfare, Medicaid, veterans and other benefits to individuals. Nor do they see their task as developing a ''laundry list of new Federal programs'' or becoming a cheerleader for larger farm subsidies.
 
Targeted Programs
Instead, they said, they hope to focus on a number of targeted, self-help and state financed efforts that, with a small amount of additional Federal help, can be repeated regionwide or made more productive.
They also hope to modify existing Federal policies that work against the region. Those policies, Mr. Hawkins said, include limits on Medicaid payments for services that can be delivered at lower cost in densely populated urban areas than in rural areas.
''Why does this exist?'' Mr. Hawkins asked. ''It exists because no one from the region was there to scream about it or ask tough questions.''
The commission, in its interim report, also emphasized the potential of building on the region's agricultural base to establish industrial jobs for the unemployed. Mr. Hawkins said that might include food processing jobs, like flash freezing, distilling and packaging the agricultural products.
Currently, most of the delta's agricultural products are processed outside the region.
''We would like to identify five alternative crops that have this capacity for growing and processing here in the region, just as we now do with catfish,'' Mr. Hawkins said. Catfish grown in the region supply nearby plants that employ thousands of people to do filleting, processing and packaging.
 
'Involvement at All Levels'
''When we talk of these spinoff industries and jobs,'' Mr. Hawkins said, ''we are talking about significant involvement at all levels for minorities. That kind of thinking just wasn't going on some years ago.''
The makeup of the commission is proving to be both an asset and a small drawback. In addition to Mr. Clinton, its nine members include Gov. Ray Mabus of Mississippi as vice chairman, Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana, gubernatorial appointees from the other four states and two Presidential appointees, all of whom are white males.
''This is not the delta,'' said Jimmie Wilson, an Arkansas lawyer who is president of National Association for the Advancement of Colored People chapter in Helena, referring to the commission's makeup. ''The delta is largely female and African-American. I'm not surprised, just disappointed.''
Representative Mike Espy, the Mississippi Democrat who was a main sponsor of the bill creating the panel - and who is black - said he was also disappointed in the makeup of the commission. It has hurt the panel's credibility, he said. But he added that having Governors on the commission has given a higher profile to its work. ''It means they are willing to put their integrity and reputations on the line, and that's fine,'' he said.

HEADLINE: It's All Untrue: Lendl Spurns The Lendl Myth

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn.

 BODY:
It hardly comes as a surprise that the house Ivan Lendl lives in is made of stone, great slabs of gray and beige stone, and is protected from the rest of the world by two fences: a natural baffle of hemlocks backed up by a no-nonsense span of chain link. Protecting himself - on the job with a dentist's drill of a forehand, at leisure with a battery of sarcasm that passes for cocktail-hour banter, at home with a meticulously trained quartet of brainy German shepherds - has long been a top concern of the world's top tennis player.
After a life spent in a furious pursuit of mental and physical invincibility, it would not make much sense to leave any inch of himself vulnerable. And besides, said Lendl, who at age 29 has begun to soften some of the hard edges of the blueprint he lives by, nobody would believe him if he did.
 
He's Heard It All
''You hear it all about me,'' Lendl said. ''That I only sleep two hours a night, I don't like food, I train like a machine, I have killer dogs, I hold a grudge against Michael Chang because he beat me in the French Open, I am an unhappy guy, I am too driven of a guy.'' 
Lendl is still most efficient in situations that do not demand an excess of affability, such as a five-set match where pride and a six-figure payoff are at stake. But he has a ready rebuttal for the amateur anthropologists who continually accuse him of impersonating a robot.
''Hey, I wish I only needed two hours of sleep,'' he said. ''I had turkey and potatoes and brownies for Thanksgiving; I train five to seven hours a day, not so different from anybody's workday, and unless you are mice, my dogs won't kill you. And why should I hold a grudge against Michael Chang just because he beat me? I've beaten more guys than have beaten me.''
''If they all hold grudges, that's too funny,'' added Lendl, whose sense of humor is decidedly not mainstream.
This week Lendl will be getting serious against his prime rival, Boris Becker, the Wimbledon and United States Open champion and defending Masters champion. The pair will meet when the Masters opens tomorrow at Madison Square Garden.
Lendl said he was not worried by intimations from Becker's camp that the West German, who earned two grand slam titles this year, should be ranked No. 1 in the world instead of Lendl, the computer's pick.
 
Wimbledon on His Mind
''You don't have to massage my ego by saying I'm No. 1,'' the five-time Masters champion said.
But at the moment, he conceded, ''I am worried a little about the Masters, a lot about the Australian - and a lot more about Wimbledon, which is my one goal left.''
''But first I must get to this clinic on time,'' Lendl said as he guided his sensible suburban Range Rover toward the Trumbull Racquet Club and the yearly benefit he attends for the Big Brothers/Big Sisters Program.
Lendl does not use his cars like flying carpets anymore; age has brought more wariness (the accident that caused the demise of his old Porsche happened at 35 miles an hour instead of his customary 100). And, in another sign of maturity, he has committed his time, his fame and his shiny new smile to a bushel of worthy causes.
 
Eat and Run
For more than two hours inside the chilly club, Lendl traded strokes with awed schoolchildren and stood obediently at net as the procession of local movers and shakers who spent sponsorship dollars for the event took their turn at practicing their country club smash on him.
Then, his responsibilities in order, he jumped back into the Rover, stuffed a restorative banana into his mouth, and sped away toward the highlight of his day, a Hartford Whalers game.
A hockey buff who wears an autographed Mike Liut jersey whenever he tends goal for charity, Lendl is a friend of the Whalers' owner, Richard Gordon, the developer who has had a Trumpian impact on Hartford's skyline and who last year assumed control of Hartford's only professional sports team.
Gordon added Lendl to the club's board of directors, which tickled Lendl, and in the not too distant future the two will travel to Czechoslovakia in hopes of extricating the hockey prodigy Robert Holik.
 
A Favor to the Sport
Success in that endeavor, Lendl said, would be nothing short of a profound public service to hockey lovers like himself, not to mention a coup for Holik, who in Lendl's judgment is bound to excel as an athlete with more certainty here than there.
''In the early days of our friendship, he once told me that part of being Czech was the feeling that you cannot excel,'' Lendl's former agent, Jerry Solomon of ProServ, said of him. ''And he said he wasn't going to let that happen to him.''
Although Solomon's business relationship with Lendl concluded in a $7 million breach-of-contract lawsuit that provoked a $25 million countersuit from Lendl (the matter was settled out of court after an eight-month battle), Solomon remains intrigued by Lendl's determination to succeed.
''He's not a guy who allows for any margin of error,'' Solomon said. ''He's obsessed or driven to achieve at a standard that in his mind is a level above what anybody else has done. His system has worked for him, and he believes it would work for anybody. But in reality you have to have a very specific personality for it.
''I can remember when we'd have guys come back from practicing with him for a week before a tournament, guys who were tennis professionals themselves, and they'd say, 'If that's what it takes to be No. 1 in the world, then I don't want to be No. 1 in the world.' ''
 
Likes Life Here
A quiet friend to the Reagan and Bush administrations, Lendl has repeatedly gone on record with a social philosophy that sounds as if it had been lifted from a tattered propaganda poster for the American dream.
Anybody, Lendl has said, can make it in the United States if he just sets his sights on a goal and works for it -just look at Lendl. He has said that people do not seem to know how good they have it here.
Anyone with doubts, Lendl said, should take a field trip to Czechoslovakia, where, despite the unraveling of the Communist Government, a development Lendl approves of, the meager economy defies even the ablest entrepreneurs.
''Life is so good over here, especially in my position now; life is like a dream,'' said Lendl, who was allowed to take up residence here in Greenwich when he was 20 and ranked sixth in the world. The defection of his countrywoman Martina Navratilova in 1975, Lendl explained, paved his path for a smooth absorption into the capitalist system he embraces.
''I really owe a lot to her,'' said Lendl, who was never forced to undergo the emotional upheaval of defection.
 
Concedes Single-Mindedness
''I basically did everything in my life so that I could become the best tennis player,'' he said. ''And that happened to be the same thing as trying to live the best possible life, and living in America was part of that. I believe neither Martina nor I would have become No. 1 if we'd stayed in Czechoslovakia.''
But now he is here for good. He has accumulated more than $14 million on the tennis court, added millions more from endorsements and investments made possible because of his celebrity on and off the court, and is, in his own words, ''a happy person not because of the money, but it helps.''
In the spring of 1992, Lendl expects to relinquish his shopworn green card for United States citizenship. By then, he and his wife, Samantha, who is now pregnant, will have a toddler to raise in their mansion of choice. Current contenders are his 20-room Georgian in Greenwich, with its United States Open tennis court cloned in the side yard, the 45-acre Conyers Farm nearby, or the 800-acre gentleman's estate in Connecticut's rustic foothills.
Lendl followed up his six-year courtship of Samantha Frankel, whom he met through the former player Wojtek Fibak when she was 14, with a whirlwind wedding last September. Married in their home on a Friday, they honeymooned that night at a rural inn in Connecticut, went to a Whalers game Saturday, and flew to Europe on Sunday to keep on track with his tournament schedule.
 
Respects His Idiosyncracies
But Frankel, like everyone permitted into Lendl's inner sanctum, defers to his need for planning and order on all fronts. She does not attempt to advise him on his tennis, and she gets away from it all with her own hobby, horseback riding.
Lendl, acquisitive and competitive by nature, has not ventured into that arena. ''I don't like horses,'' he explained, ''because I'm afraid of them.''
Lendl did not like children much, either, but with impending fatherhood, he has adjusted.
''When I was 18, 19, somebody with little kids around drove me bananas 100 percent of the time,'' he said. ''Five years later, I'd like it one day, they'd drive me bananas the next. Now 99 percent of the days, I like it.'' What Lendl envisions for his future is, for the first time, two lives.
''It's going to be something new to split myself between career and family,'' he said. ''My goal in tennis is to win Wimbledon, because I haven't done it, and after that it's to win every tournament, of course. But next year I'm 30, and the time is coming when I'll quit. Wimbledon is not nearly as important as the life I have.''
 
Looking Out for No. 1
Lendl's accomplishments since he became No. 1; results are from tournaments on the Nabisco Grand Prix tour.

The Twilight of 'America's Century'

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
''America's Century,'' Lewis H. Lapham's dour and dire view of the decline of American power and confidence over the last 100 years, comes to its gloomy conclusion tonight with a litany of events that have shaken the nation's sense of itself.
With the support of a few like-minded journalists and think-tankists, Mr. Lapham probes traumas like the loss of the war in Vietnam, the economic competition from Japan and West Germany, the Iranian hostage crisis, the killing of United States marines by terrorists in Lebanon and the Iran-contra revelations. He arrives at a diagnosis of terminal malaise.
The six-part series, which ends tonight at 8 P.M. on Channel 31 and at 10 P.M. on Channel 13, is as close to a personal essay as television has given. If you tuned into the earlier programs, you know by now that Mr. Lapham, the editor of Harper's Magazine, sees American history in this century as a compound of pretensions to power, affectations of ideology, and a naive idealism about the workings of the world and the motives and interests of the United States itself. And so the nation has plunged from triumph to disarray. 
Much of tonight's hour, produced by Peter Bate, is given to the Presidencies of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, and Mr. Lapham and his cohort really give it to them. Mr. Carter is presented, not without sympathy, as a feckless leader, altogether out of his depth in Washington. Even as he was trying to incorporate ideals of human rights into foreign policy, he is shown toasting the Shah of Iran: ''We don't fear the future when we have friends like this great country.'' The Administration, by this account, was totally unprepared for the advent of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Mr. Carter's response to the taking of American hostages in 1979 is written off as ''weak, indecisive, sentimental.''
The treatment of Mr. Carter is kindness itself compared with the treatment of Mr. Reagan, who is credited here with having accomplished the ''Hollywoodization of politics.'' Mr. Lapham, who can seem supercilious even when he means to be pleasant, lets loose his scorn for the former President for upholding ''the sanctity of myth against the heresy of fact.'' He is blunter about Lieut. Col. Oliver L. North, whom he calls ''a treacherous and lying agent of the national security state.''
It is that state, represented most formidably by the Pentagon, that Mr. Lapham and most of his guests, who are not very helpfully identified but speak mainly from the left, see as the Great Satan. President Eisenhower's warning against the power of the military-industrial complex is hauled out as a prophecy come true. The Pentagon and the defense industry are pictured as clinging to past threats and future profits, while present threats and opportunities go unmet. Instead of working with other nations to safeguard the environment and help the impoverished, Washington, in the Laphamian view, is frozen in its obsession with military power.
At the very end, Mr. Lapham, who delivers his messages while strolling among international sites and sights like a figure out of Henry James, turns slightly upbeat, offering the possibility that the hopes of the American people will prevail over the ambitions of the American state. Given all that has gone before, this seems like pro forma condescension toward the People. It runs smack against the strong current of the series.
But you don't have to buy Mr. Lapham's entire stock of goods to be stimulated by this effort to provoke thought, concern, debate. And whatever one's reservations about the quality of the history offered by ''America's Century'' and the opinions advanced with such assurance, at the very least - and it is not so little - they are phrased with an elegance not common to television.

HEADLINE: Small Companies Going Global

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Small American companies, which already account for a fifth of United States exports, are increasingly taking the next step to becoming global businesses: they are setting up operations overseas, not just shipping their goods abroad.
A decade ago, such an evolution was unthinkable at most small companies. Overseas operations were the domain of the Fortune 500 corporations, while small companies kept production close to home. And even now, the small manufacturer - the sort of company that employs 200 people in a one-story factory in an industrial park - is expanding abroad reluctantly.
''A lot of small companies are forced into the international marketplace just to stay alive,'' said Kenneth S. Flamm, a Brookings Institution economist. 
 
Smaller First Moves
Today, some smaller companies are building factories in foreign markets, but most are making less costly moves at first, like arranging joint ventures, partnerships and licensing agreements in Western Europe, Japan and elsewhere. The globalization of small business underscores corporate America's belief that in the future most companies, even small ones, must compete internationally to be successful.
A foreign presence can increase sales and give companies access to new technology and marketing ideas. The experience helps them to fend off competition at home from second-tier foreign rivals that have jumped into the United States market in recent years. And with the economy slowing sharply in the United States, smaller companies, often particularly susceptible to downturns, are looking to faster-growing overseas markets.
Since the mid-1980's, thousands of small manufacturers have gone into exporting. Small companies account for more than 20 percent of the nation's total annual exports, according to several studies. The United States has more than 150,000 small manufacturers, companies with fewer than 400 employees and less than $70 million in annual revenues, the National Association of Manufacturers reports.
 
Exporting Seen as Not Enough
Still, small companies are now concluding that exporting alone is not enough, according to executives and Government and trade group officials.
''You can't sell very much abroad without switching to production overseas,'' said Michael Plumley, chief executive of the Plumley Companies, an auto-parts maker in Paris, Tenn.
Like other small-company executives, Mr. Plumley contends that operating overseas is essential to stay competitive in the domestic market. ''It's the best way to gain experience in new products and manufacturing techniques,'' he said.
But when manufacturers switch to overseas production, the nation's income from exports declines, making the trade deficit more difficult to resolve. And as long-term survival for small manufacturers depends more and more on establishing overseas operations, the pinch on this crucial sector of the economy will intensify, business executives say.
''The pressure is to become a much bigger company fast in order to compete globally,'' said Harry E. Featherstone, chief executive of the Will-Burt Company, an Ohio concern with $22 million in annual revenues that makes truck parts and mobile radio-transmission towers. ''Will-Burt will either become much bigger or sell out to a big company, or we won't be around.''
Recent events at three small companies illustrate what is happening:
* Plumley's main product is auto engine hoses to connect radiators and air-conditioners. For a while, the family-owned company, with about $50 million in annual sales, tried to export directly to European customers. But each required a different metal coupling or fitting - of a type that Plumley did not sell at home. So Plumley now ships bare hose in bulk to a German-based partner, Aeroquip Trinova, which makes the metal fixtures and handles sales. ''We don't have the money for our own European factory or distributorship,'' Mr. Plumley said, ''but 10 years down the road, that's the way we'll have to go.''
* Avid Technologies of Burlington, Mass., is trying to sell simultaneously in Europe, Japan and the United States a new $80,000 computer system that edits film and videotape, using Avid's proprietary software. Lacking money for such ambitious marketing, Avid relies on foreign distributors who keep up to 40 percent of the revenue. William Warner, Avid's president, said that was the price of gaining a quick foothold abroad. Without one, foreign companies will have room to introduce similar systems and then invade Avid's American market. ''By being successful, you create a big billboard that says, 'This market exists and here's how to address it,' '' Mr. Warner said.
* Rather than continue to export its mobile radio towers, Will-Burt is negotiating to make them in Ireland, with a partner that would provide the factory and sales force - and keep a big chunk of the profit. Why do this? Well, Will-Burt cannot yet afford its own factory, but having a European operation is essential, Mr. Featherstone said. For one thing, it gets the company inside the European Community, safe from trade barriers that might appear once a unified market is created in 1992. Even more important, if the dollar were to rise in value, Will-Burt could sell its Irish-made towers in the United States for less than towers made in Ohio.
 
Protecting the Home Market
Such a strategy would protect Will-Burt from foreign companies that might try to export towers to the United States during a strong-dollar period. ''You can't protect your home market unless you are also in the fray overseas,'' said William Archey, international vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''If your first experience with foreign competitors is right here at home, you might not survive.''
Will-Burt's first experience with foreign competitors, in fact, almost cost the company its main business, manufacturing truck and tractor components, Mr. Featherstone said. As the dollar rose in value in the mid-1980's, Caterpillar Inc. canceled a $1 million contract for items like cab doors and engine compartments and switched to lower-priced Belgian and Brazilian suppliers.
''We realized then that we were operating in a worldwide market,'' said Mr. Featherstone, whose company had never had any foreign dealings. By cutting costs in Ohio and going to China for some castings and to Indonesia for some welded parts, Will-Burt was able to win back Caterpillar, as well as business lost at Mack Truck. Currently it is bidding to supply parts to Volvo in Europe.
Many of the small companies now operating abroad are niche manufacturers, making specialized products whose sales often rise more quickly abroad than at home. For example, the Kiva Container Corporation of Phoenix produces containers made of corrugated plastic - the material used in the post office's letter-sorting containers. Kiva's containers are used for computer boards and chips, and to ship fish packed in ice.
''Getting Americans to buy plastic corrugated containers instead of cardboard ones is very difficult,'' said Ruth Stafford, Kiva's vice president. ''The Europeans are much quicker to switch to new products.''
Whatever the explanation, Kiva's overseas sales now represent 10 percent of the company's $5 million in annual revenue, up from zero a few years ago. And Kiva is making a barter arrangement with a British company, Team Tool Ltd. Team Tool will distribute Kiva's containers in Europe while Kiva will distribute the British company's die-cutting equipment in the United States.
''Eventually, we'll manufacture containers in Europe; that's more practical than shipping them from here,'' Mrs. Stafford said.
At the outset, Kiva's manufacturing operation would probably be a joint venture - owned by Kiva and perhaps Team Tool.
As a first step, most small companies today rely on joint ventures, partnerships and licensing agreements. (Foreign licensees pay royalties to American companies for the right to make their products abroad.) Indeed, licensing fees and royalties collected by American companies from abroad are running this year at an annual rate of $12 billion, compared with $6.2 billion in 1979 and $5.3 billion in 1983, the Commerce Department reported.
But joint ventures and partnerships can be hazardous, executives say. ''Often the foreign partner prefers to expand sales of its own products, not those of its American partner,'' said Stephen Cooney, director of international investment at the National Association of Manufacturers.
 
Problems of Partnerships
And sometimes the American partner in the joint venture becomes less than enthusiastic. That happened to Sonicraft Inc., a Chicago manufacturer of airport communications devices used in bad-weather landings.
With few new airports being built in the United States, Sonicraft, which has $30 million in annual revenue, sought overseas sales through a venture with the Teli Corporation of Sweden, which makes a different type of airport communications gear.
''We wanted to Americanize their gear and, in exchange, they would sell our product through their distribution network in 65 countries,'' said Jerry T. Jones, Sonicraft's chairman.

Cut Expected In Prime Rate This Week

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The prime lending rate, which most commercial banks have held at 10.5 percent since late July, is likely to be lowered by half a percentage point this week, some credit market analysts and economists said.
The way for a cut in the prime was paved last week when the Federal Reserve Board signaled that it had eased the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market by about a quarter of a percentage point, to 8.25 percent. A drop in the prime would lower costs for a wide range of borrowers, ''I think the Fed would like the prime to come down, and it may happen today,'' said Paul L. Kasriel, a vice president and money market economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. ''A move in the funds rate from 9 percent to 8.5 percent earlier this year didn't generate a cut in the prime rate, and I think that is one of the reasons they eased policy again last week. I think they are concerned that households are going to go on a buying strike.'' 
 
'Further Confirmation' Sought
Norman Robertson, chief economist at the Mellon National Bank in Pittsburgh, observed that ''banks may want further confirmation that the Fed has indeed lowered the funds rate to 8.25 percent.''
''There is a lot of pressure on bank earnings, which intensifies the pressure to linger at 10.50 percent,'' he said. ''But the Fed wants interest rates, including the prime, to move lower.''
Banks have been reluctant to lower the prime rate because other important financing costs, like three-month Eurodollar deposit rates, have lagged the declines in the funds rate. Generally, banks like to maintain a difference, or ''spread,'' of 1.50 to 2 percentage points between their own cost of funds and the prime.
After the dip in the funds rate late last week, three-month Eurodollar deposits were offered at a rate of 8 5/ 16 percent.
Aside from small and medium-sized businesses, an array of consumers have loans with charges tied to changes in the prime.
 
Affecting Consumer Confidence
With Christmas scarcely a month away, a cut in the prime could provide an additional lift to consumer psychology, which remains high even though spending has been sluggish lately.
''Consumer confidence has held up pretty well, but there is no doubt the Fed wants to create a favorable backdrop going into the Christmas season,'' said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services in Chicago.
Nevertheless, a lower prime rate would not in and of itself lead to a further rally in the credit markets.
''At this stage the market has limited upside potential,'' said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm. ''The Fed's most recent move is already reflected in current prices. Further improvement won't come until we get a chance to see additional new information.''
By late Friday the Treasury's 8 1/8 bonds of 2019 were offered at a price to yield 7.86 percent, down only slightly from a yield of 7.93 percent on Nov. 17. Yields on two-year notes had dipped to 7.63 percent by the end of last week, down from 7.76 percent on Nov. 17.
 
New Data Due
Given the Fed's current bias to postpone the battle against inflation to help stave off a recession, analysts said another cut in the funds rate, to 8 percent, is possible before the end of the year if data show that the economy remains weak.
Reports due early this week will not offer much new evidence on the economy, but traders are likely to pay close attention to data in the November survey of the nation's purchasing managers that is due Friday.
Few if any analysts are willing to project publicly what will be shown by the survey, which provides the first glimpse of how the economy fared in the month just ended. In October, the results of the survey showed that business conditions had improved slightly from September levels.
Aside from the economic reports, which also include the Commerce Department's first revision of third-quarter growth figures, the week's credit market activity will be highlighted by the sale of $10 billion of new two-year Treasury notes tomorrow and $8 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday.
Aside from weekly bill auctions, the note sales next week ''pretty much wind up the Treasury's activity for the year,'' Mr. Santow said.
With the Treasury absent from the market, he said, ''dealers will use that opportunity to lighten up their positions, and provide the opportunity for corporations and municipalities to price some issues.''
This week's corporate debt calendar is fairly light, and there is at least some statistical evidence to suggest that the heavy Treasury financings that have taken place this month have persuaded corporate treasurers to stay away from the new-issue market despite the fall in interest rates.
Through last Friday, $22.68 billion worth of corporate non-convertible debt issues had been priced during November, according to data from IDD Information Services. During the comparable period last year, the figure was $25.89 billion.

HEADLINE: O.E.C.D. Is Optimistic On American Economy

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The United States can avoid both a recession and excessive inflation next year, so long as the Federal Reserve keeps an even grip on credit, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says in a report to be released on Monday.
But the O.E.C.D. said the American economy would remain dogged by the trade and budget deficits, which may stay stubbornly high in coming years.
The research group, which is sponsored by 24 countries, said in its latest review of the United States economy that price rises may be fanned by too-rapid cuts in interest rates. 
 
Below Previous Forecast
Despite this caution, the O.E.C.D.'s latest inflation and growth forecasts are more optimistic than its projections last June. It foresees inflation in the United States at just less than 5 percent in 1990. Previously, the O.E.C.D. expected it to be 5.25 percent. It is expected to average 4.2 percent in the second half of 1989.
The gross national product should grow 2.5 percent next year, the same as in the second half of 1989. Last June, the O.E.C.D. predicted growth of 2.25 percent in 1990 after 2 percent in the second half of this year.
But the O.E.C.D. cautioned that the trade deficit showed little sign of narrowing after sharp improvements in the last two years, with imports expected to outpace American exports. The 1990 trade deficit is seen at $105 billion, little changed from this year's $107 billion.
 
Watched by Markets
Financial markets closely watch the United States' overseas trade performance to determine if the dollar will be pushed lower to make American exports more competitive.
The O.E.C.D. also said that a failure to meet lower budget deficit targets would add to trade and current account problems. Fiscal measures are needed to dampen consumer spending and reduce the budget deficit, it added. And the organization recommended ending current tax distortions that discourage private savings.
''If effective action is not taken to meet the budget targets, the trade and current account deficits could well remain above $100 billion over the next five years,'' it said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
New Magazine Planned To Challenge TV Guide

BYLINE: By ALBERT SCARDINO

 BODY:
The publisher of the monthly Cable Guide plans to challenge the 30-year dominance of TV Guide and local newspapers in providing a weekly roadmap to the ever-expanding landscape of television.
TV Times, a weekly television listings magazine, will appear Feb. 3 in San Diego and Huntington, Calif. Its publisher, TVSM Inc., expects it to spread to other markets and hopes it will eventually reach a paid circulation of two million.
By sharing revenues with cable system operators and by simplifying listings, TVSM is trying to overcome the obstacles that other publishers, including Time Inc., have faced in assaulting TV Guide's market. 
 
Simplified Listing Format
TV Times will provide a subscriber with the current listings for each of the channels on a particular system - and only on that system - for about $3 a month. The format will eliminate the complex grids and multiple-system listings provided by daily newspapers and other publications, which usually try to provide information for most of the cable systems reached by local broadcasters.
The magazine will also include articles about television personalities and programs, as well as advertising.
The introduction of TV Times comes more than six years after Time Inc. lost about $50 million on TV-Cable Week magazine, its unsuccessful challenge to the industry giant, TV Guide. Time closed TV Cable Week after only about six months of publication.
Robert Cohen, a magazine consultant, said TVSM's longstanding relationship with independent cable operators may give TV Times the edge it needs to succeed where TV-Cable Week failed.
Many cable systems already distribute the Cable Guide, which has a circulation of almost eight million.
''If the cable operators are willing to play the game, the market might decide that it needs another listing book after all,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 
Reliance on Operators
TV Times will rely on the cable operators for a range of services. The operators will be asked to supply both programming information and subscriber lists, helping TVSM to hold down the initial promotional costs.
The cable companies will also bill for subscriptions on the monthly statements that they already send to their customers, another powerful advantage over competing publications, which rely on sales at newsstands and through annual mail subscriptions. Those who sign up for TV Times and do not pay may find their cable service disconnected.
In return for their services to TV Times, the cable operators will receive a share of the advertising and circulation revenues, said Mark Edmiston, chairman of TVSM.
Mr. Edmiston said many cable operators believed that more cable subscribers would sign up for premium channels if they knew what programs would appear on them. He said the magazine's simplified listings might encourage its readers to add those channels.
With special pay services added to the basic monthly subscription price, many cable subscribers now spend $40 a month or more.
 
'Hopelessly Complicated'
''The average cable system will be up to more than 50 channels by the late 1990's,'' Mr. Edmiston said. ''When you have several systems in a given metropolitan area, it can get hopelessly complicated to read a guide that tries to cover all of them.''
The area reached by New York City's broadcast stations, for instance, now includes more than 100 cable systems, and no two of them use the same numbering system.
Mr. Edmiston asserts that videocassette recorders and remote control devices have shifted the balance of power in the fight for audience share. ''The viewer can control what he watches far more than ever before, but unless he knows what his system offers, he can't decide what to watch,'' Mr. Edmiston said.
Joseph W. Cece, publisher of TV Guide, agrees that television viewing has increasingly become defined by cable system rather than by local network affiliations. But TV Guide, America's largest magazine (circulation 15.8 million), is reacting to the cable phenomenon, too.
 
About 6,000 Cable Systems
''We have already introduced several editions where the programs are listed by the cable channels they appear on rather than by the broadcast channel,'' Mr. Cece said. ''But there are about 6,000 cable systems in the country, and you can't provide a different edition for each one.''
To start the magazine, TVSM has added 30 editorial staff members -half of them in New York and half at the company's headquarters in Horsham, Pa. - to the 130 already with the company. Mr. Edmiston said TV Times would grow system by system.
TV Guide will introduce its cable-oriented guide in the same markets in December.
''When TV-Cable Week came out, TV Guide spent as much defending against it as Time spent trying to launch it,'' Mr. Edmiston said. ''But only about 20 percent of our monthly subscribers also read TV Guide, and that's what we expect from the weekly. They can't do what we are going to do economically.''

HEADLINE: De Lorean Wins a Round

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Lawyers for John Z. De Lorean, whose Belfast-based car company went bankrupt in 1982, won a High Court order on Friday setting aside an earlier court order against him for more than $51 million.
Judge Peter Gibson overturned a July 1987 court order that allowed legal documents in the case to be served on De Lorean at his home in New Jersey, which is outside the jurisdiction of the English courts. 
''It follows that all subsequent orders made against Mr. De Lorean will fall away,'' Judge Gibson said.
The ruling is the latest in a dispute between the liquidators of the DSQ Property Company, incorporated in Northern Ireland and formerly called De Lorean Motor Cars Ltd., and Mr. De Lorean.
Unstated damages had been claimed against Mr. De Lorean, who was accused of conspiracy, deceit and breach of fiduciary duty, Judge Gibson said. In June 1988, the High Court entered judgment against Mr. De Lorean ordering him to pay more than $51 million.
Judge Gibson said Mr. De Lorean took no part in the English proceedings until this year, when DSQ sought to enforce the judgment in the United States.
On July 10, Mr. De Lorean asked the High Court to set aside the order.
DSQ, which was ordered to pay Mr. De Lorean's legal costs, was allowed to appeal Judge Gibson's ruling, which was suspended pending the appeal.
Mr. De Lorean, a former executive with the General Motors Corporation, set up his plant in Belfast in 1978, employing more than 2,600 workers at its peak.
The British Government, hoping to ease high unemployment in the city, lost $140 million in the venture when the gull-wing sports cars found few buyers.

HEADLINE: U.S. Issues Protest to Soviets On Arms to Salvador Rebels

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The United States has told the Soviet Union that it holds Moscow indirectly responsible for what the State Department described today as the recent ''outrageous'' attempt by Nicaragua to ship advanced Soviet-made weapons to the leftist guerrillas in El Salvador.
The Soviet Embassy in Washington was also told that this arms shipment was a ''dangerous escalation'' in the Salvadoran conflict and a clear violation of explicit Soviet promises to the United States to get Nicaragua and Cuba to halt such activities. The issue would be brought up when President Bush meets with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this weekend, Bush Administration officials said. 
''The President will tell Gorbachev that the introduction of surface-to-air weapons in the guerrilla war in El Salvador is a dangerous escalation of a conflict, contrary to high-level Soviet assurances,'' said the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater. ''It is an example of old thinking. The President will press the Soviets to take action to insure that their allies cease this outrageous behavior.''
Analysts said the Administration wants to do all that it can to publicize Nicaraguan shipments of Soviet-made arms to El Salvador to create international pressure on the Sandinista Government in Managua to live up to its promises to other regional leaders not to support insurgencies in neighboring countries.
 
U.S. Accepted Soviet Assurances
For the last 10 months, the Bush Administration has been accepting assurances by the Soviet Union that it was cutting off its arms deliveries to Central America and exerting pressure on Nicaragua and Cuba not export their Marxist revolutions to neighboring countries.
Only hours after a two-engine Cessna aircraft, purportedly making an arms run to Salvadoran rebels from Nicaragua, crashed Saturday in southeastern El Salvador with 24 Soviet-made SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles and one American Redeye missile on board, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called the State Department from his home in Houston and ordered that the Soviet Ambassador, Yuri V. Dubinin, be summoned and handed a formal protest.
Administration officials doubt that the Soviets are actually encouraging Nicaragua to make arms shipments. But they argue that if Moscow can use its leverage to help bring down repressive Communist leaders in East Germany and Czechoslovakia, it can stop Nicaragua from sending Soviet-made missiles to Salvadoran rebels.
 
Questioning Soviet Priorities
A senior Administration official said Mr. Dubinin was told that Nicaragua and Cuba could not provide military assistance to the Salvadoran guerrillas were it not for the fact that the Soviet Union was providing these two countries together with between $6 billion and $7 billion a year.
''Therefore,'' the Administration officials reportedly told the Soviet diplomat, ''we hold you responsible.''
The official said that Mr. Dubinin was also told that it is difficult for the United States to take Moscow's appeals for economic assistance from the West seriously as long as the Soviet Union can afford to continue pouring money into Nicaragua and Cuba.
The Soviet envoy reportedly was also told that the United States has gone out of its way not to exploit the changes in Eastern Europe in ways that might undermine Soviet security, but that the Soviets are not reciprocating in Central America.

Where More Than A Highway Collapsed

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OAKLAND, Calif., Nov. 27

 BODY:
Each time the wrecking ball pounds the concrete remains of the Nimitz Freeway, the streets of West Oakland vibrate and the residents of the neighborhood shudder anew.
The aftershocks of the Oct. 17 earthquake have subsided in many parts of the Bay Area. But here in the poorest pocket of Oakland, where 42 people died in the collapse of the double-deck roadway, there will be no peace or forgetting for years to come.
Demolition is three-quarters complete, after a month of round-the-clock jackhammers, but there will be dust and detours well into the 1990's as the Nimitz is rebuilt. 
And this week seismic testing is supposed to begin here, with engineers rocking one standing block of the highway to determine why the mile-and-a-quarter section fell, and how best to reinforce similar structures against future jolts.
''Not much we can do about it but accept it or move,'' said Joseph Perkins, whose decrepit Victorian house is next to the test area.
This is a neighborhood with more than its share of boarded-up or burned-out buildings, where men pass the afternoon drinking from bottles sheathed in brown paper. Front porches sag and paint peels from the private houses. The housing projects are grim cinder-block bunkers.
By virtually any index, West Oakland is the harshest of this city's neighborhoods, with the highest rates of unemployment, infant mortality and welfare. Huey P. Newton, founder of the Black Panther Party, was murdered just a block from the Nimitz last summer in a drug-related shooting, a common occurrence here.
Since the quake, there are new indignities. A neighborhood school was turned into a temporary morgue and for weeks the streets stank of death. Scores of homes were damaged beyond repair, swelling the ranks of the homeless. Local people do not hold much hope for employment related to the highway, since few belong to construction unions.
For a time the area was overrun by reporters, including network anchors who incongruously set up shop in white stretch limousines. For a while, residents were hospitable, offering cornbread, coffee and the use of their telephones. Now many are bitter, asking for money before they will talk. ''Can you help a guy with a buck?'' asked Wendell Price. ''We're so bad off around here.''
Local leaders note that the poor of West Oakland do not have the luxury of resettling during the chaos, which is wearing them down. ''They cannot get away to put their life in order or forget,'' said the Rev. Walter H. Brown, pastor of the Taylor Memorial United Methodist Church.
These leaders hope to galvanize the community against rebuilding the Nimitz in its original route, which bisects the neighborhood, leaving one portion of West Oakland isolated.
''No one thought of the social pathology of this,'' said Edward J. Blakely, chairman of the city planning department at the University of California at Berkeley. ''But a section of this city atrophied and died.''
Oakland has a black mayor, and there are many members of minorities on the City Council and Alameda County Board of Supervisors. The power structure was very different when the Nimitz was built in the 1950's. ''People of color were not represented,'' Mr. Brown said. ''No one was paying attention at any level of government.''
Now, local leaders say, the state is listening. The Department of Transportation has agreed to review proposals for alternative routes.
Decisions about the Nimitz could resonate in the 1990 mayoral and council elections here. Candidates are expected to walk a fine line, courting votes in West Oakland without stalling reconstruction of a truck route that serves the Port of Oakland and is essential to the city's precarious economy.
For the first month after the quake, the state was less than sensitive to the residents, who live side by side with freight yards and machine shops. Until mid-November, they endured 24-hour demolition, which was then scaled back, stilling the jackhammers at night.
''The noise just came through the house, like it was made of paper,'' said Cynthia Talbert, who lives in a project next to the site. ''The kids were so tired they didn't want to go to school. Now that they cooled it down, it's not as bad. But each time the ball hits, it sure brings back memories.''

HEADLINE: Long-Secret History of C.I.A. Sheds Light on Battles Over Authority

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
The State Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the military hampered the Central Intelligence Agency in its infancy by bickering about authority, according to a long-secret history of the agency's early years.
The 1,000-page narrative, written in 1953 by the agency's first historian, Arthur B. Darling, is the first C.I.A. document to be declassified and transferred to the National Archives for release to the public under the agency's historical review program.
A copy of the history was delivered to President Bush last Wednesday by William H. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, and Don W. Wilson, Archivist of the United States. 
Mr. Webster said other agency records would be declassified and transferred to the Archives.
 
Note Cautions Readers
The declassified version of the history was accompanied by a note from the C.I.A.'s history staff cautioning readers that Mr. Darling, a former professor of history at Yale, had ''a definite and sometimes controversial point of view.''
''Darling blames the State Department, the F.B.I., and what he terms the military establishment - especially the heads of the military intelligence services - for much of the hardship which the early C.I.A. (and its predecessor, the Central Intelligence Group) endured,'' the note says.
The history staff also said that Allen Dulles, who became Director of Central Intelligence in 1953, reportedly ''did not concur with Darling's conclusions'' and restricted access to the history.
Mr. Darling was the agency's historian from 1952 to 1954. He died in 1971.
He wrote that sniping by the military departments began as soon as the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner of the C.I.A., was established by President Roosevelt in World War II.
Brig. Gen. John Magruder, deputy director of the O.S.S., told Mr. Darling that career military officers ''lowered their horns'' against the economists, geographers, historians and scientists recruited for the C.I.A. Mr. Darling conceded in his history that the military might have been justified in withholding information because the O.S.S. ''deserved part of its reputation for being a sieve.''
 
The Issue of Security
However, he quotes the O.S.S. chief, Gen. William J. Donovan, as saying that it was the military men who were the ''leaky boys.''
In any event, Mr. Darling wrote, ''They are reluctant to this moment in 1953 to give a central civilian agency intelligence which exposes their capabilities in war.''
''The result,'' he continued, ''has been interference with the flow of raw materials essential to the realistic estimates which should go to the makers of diplomatic policy and military strategy.''
On Nov. 18, 1944, with World War II less than a year from its end, General Donovan urged President Roosevelt to turn the O.S.S. into a permanent central intelligence system. But, Mr. Darling wrote, the F.B.I., the military, the State Department and other agencies were hostile to that idea.
On Sept. 20, 1945, President Harry S. Truman disbanded the O.S.S. and ordered the State Department to develop a postwar intelligence network. On Jan. 24, 1946, Truman issued a directive creating the Central Intelligence Group, which was prohibited from interfering with ''internal security functions.''
In 1947 the Central Intelligence Group became the Central Intelligence Agency, as part of the same law that merged the War and Navy Departments into the new Department of Defense.

HEADLINE: Pressure Grows for Cuts in Intelligence Spending

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Senior Pentagon officials' decision to consider substantial cuts in the military budget over the next few years has intensified pressure on intelligence agencies to take an equal share of the reductions.
Although the issue has not yet been directly joined, Administration officials and members of Congress say the battle lines are already forming between those who view a diminishing Soviet threat as a reason for reducing intelligence spending and those who believe that more extensive intelligence information will be needed to keep abreast of rapidly changing developments abroad.
''In my recent conversations with senior intelligence officials, many have been privately concerned that the United States intelligence community will have to take a 'proportional hit' -that is, be reduced by the same percentage the defense budget is being cut,'' said Kenneth E. deGraffenreid, former head of intelligence programs in the Reagan White House. ''There is no question that many in the Office of Management and Budget and the money side of the Defense Department intend to go that way.''
Current and former officials said the budget pressures would likely prompt a reassessment of whether to shift money now spent on monitoring Soviet military movements in Eastern Europe to regions and topics that historically accorded less emphasis. 
American officials said it was possible to achieve savings on intelligence operations in Europe as the NATO nations pulled back from their posture of preparing for an all-out war in Central Europe. The United States spends billions on eavesdropping and satellite photography to collect intelligence on Soviet and Warsaw Pact forces.
 
Spending Is Buried in Budget
Intelligence spending is not publicly disclosed; it is hidden in the Pentagon budget by overstating the amount of money needed for various military programs. Government officials said it represents less than 10 percent of the $300 billion Pentagon total.
Because their financing is part of the Pentagon budget, any effort to exempt intelligence programs from cuts will mean greater reductions in military programs.
Intelligence spending grew as much as four times as fast as the Pentagon's overall budget in the early years of the Reagan Administration. And in the past five years as the Pentagon budget has actually declined once inflation is accounted for, intelligence spending has continued to grow at a modest rate.
In recent weeks the military services, at the request of Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, have identified $180 billion in possible cuts in spending for 1992-94.
Officials said the prospect of tightening, or even flat budgets, could force some hard choices for the intelligence chiefs, causing them to define more carefully what is truly needed by the President and his aides.
One Government official summarized the predicament this way:
''If you've had an intelligence requirement that says, 'I want to be prepared to go to war on a moment's notice; I want to know when this Soviet commander turns on his radar within seconds,' the question is: In a peacetime environment do you need to collect and report that information on daily basis?''
 
Senator Sees New Soviet Threat
Senator David L. Boren, the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said through a spokesman, ''Now is not the time to reduce the intelligence budget; it's just the opposite.''
Senator Boren says that as the Soviet Union cuts military spending, it will put greater emphasis on the theft of Western technololgy, his spokesman said, and this will increase the pressure on counterintelligence agencies. Senator Boren also contended that the anticipated signing of new arms control treaties will place costly requirements on the intelligence agencies for verification.
In the House, the intelligence panel's chairman, Representative Anthony C. Beilenson, Democrat of California, said that if present trends continue in Europe, he foresees a slow, steady decline in intelligence spending over the next few years.
''One could argue that the intelligence budgets should be cut more carefully and slowly than defense,'' Mr. Beilenson said. ''But if we continue to believe the Soviet threat is diminishing, then I think the intelligence budget will be cut into over the years to come.''
At best, Administration officials said, the intelligence agencies can plan on flat budgets while they are being asked for better reporting on trends in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union, Central America, China and the economic powers of the Pacific Basin.
The agencies are also being pushed to develop better capabilities for supporting the war on drugs, and some consumers of intelligence - including President Bush - have complained about a lack of solid reporting from human sources.
Administration officials said no decisions had been made on the intelligence budgets, and one official said, ''This is not the sort of thing that is going to happen over one year; it's something that will develop over five years.''
 
Separate Budget Is Considered
The uncertainty has prompted some Administration officials to consider -and one prominent former intelligence officer to advocate - the idea of separating the intelligence budget from the Pentagon's, thus allowing Congress for the first time to vote on a publicly announced total figure for intelligence.
''My worry is that as we start a new cycle of draw-down in the Pentagon, we will once again incrementally take a slice off intelligence,'' said Adm. Bobby Ray Inman, former Deputy Director of Central Intelligence. ''There is much less hazard in letting people know how much money we spend on intelligence then in letting the cuts get made almost accidentially.''
Admiral Inman said history shows that the intelligence agencies suffered lasting damage in periods of reduced Pentagon spending. As a former director of Naval Intelligence and head of the National Security Agency, Admiral Inman traced the pattern of intelligence spending as it grew through the 1950's, was altered by the Vietnam War and sharply reduced in the 1970's.
After World War II, he said, Government leaders concluded that ''never again should we be so ill-informed about the outside world.'' This meant better intelligence than simply counting an opponent's military forces.
The intention, Admiral Inman said, was to create a ''classified Encyclopedia Brittanica'' of the world's countries. Financing for the Central Intelligence Agency rose steadily throughout the 1950's, hitting a peak in 1958. It stayed flat from 1958 to 1964, when he said a decision was made to move analysts on other subjects to work on the Vietnam War.
''We gave up on analytical efforts judged not to be problems, beginning in the Western Hemisphere and then to Europe, Africa and later Asia,'' Admiral Inman said.
 
Embassy Shrinkage Cuts Data
In 1967, as a way of improving the nation's trade balance, the Johnson Administration cut the number of people in American embassies, a move that Admiral Inman said reduced intelligence collection.
In 1971, he said, costly new technology was discovered that greatly expanded the potential of overhead surveillance. Nixon Administration officials decided to buy it and absorb the cost by cutting manpower from other technical areas.
As President Richard M. Nixon withdrew American forces from Vietnam and began reducing the Pentagon budget, ''all those cuts went straight across the intelligence budget,'' the admiral said.
In 1973, when the intelligence agencies failed to predict the 1973 war between Israel and Egypt, William Clements, Deputy Secretary of Defense, ordered a 25 percent reduction in intelligence agencies under direct Pentagon control, which included the National Security Agency but not the C.I.A.
By the end of the 1970's, he Admiral Inman said, intelligence employment was down 40 percent from the level of 1958.
When new issues arose in the 1980's, like strife in Central America or terrorism, American intelligence was not effectively covering countries involved. ''We would see things, and couldn't tell what they meant,'' the admiral said. ''We didn't know what the norm was.'' To correct the problem, President Reagan ordered large increases in intelligence spending, starting ''a slow process to begin covering not just the Soviet Union,'' Admiral Inman said. ''The buildup has been broad-based, including human intelligence, clandestine collection and overt collection as well as broad increases in the analytical side.
''It was possible largely because the executive branch was prepared to let intelligence budgets grow at a faster rate than the rest of the defense budget and because of bipartisan support on the intelligence committees and enough support on the armed services committees.''

HEADLINE: Democracy Speaks in India

 BODY:
What most distinguishes a democracy is the people's right to reject those in power. In India, the world's largest democracy and the third world's most durable, voters have done just that, denying a majority to Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress Party. They gave no clear mandate to any single political force but everywhere vented their anger at incumbents for corruption, inequality, religious discord and a variety of local failures. 
Forming a coherent, effective new government is certain to be a challenging task. But the challenge is a constructive one, thanks to India's continued faith in democratic change.
Mr. Gandhi, political heir to his mother, Indira Gandhi, and his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, could yet survive, but only as a coalition leader, and only with greatly diminished power. It's a mighty fall, for which Mr. Gandhi can blame only himself.
In 1984, buoyed by sympathy over his mother's assassination, Mr. Gandhi led his Congress Party to a huge triumph. He promised clean government, economic liberalization and secularism. But he concentrated real power in his personal entourage, weakening the party and tempting corruption. He achieved solid economic gains, but these disproportionately benefited an urban elite. Relations with India's two strongest neighbors, China and Pakistan, began to improve. But a huge defense buildup and clumsy power plays against Sri Lanka and Nepal gave India the reputation of a regional bully.
The opposition ranges all the way from Communist to Hindu fundamentalist. Its leading force is a center-right coalition headed by Vishwanath Pratap Singh, a former Finance Minister. Most worrisome are the strong gains of the fundamentalist Bharatiya Janata Party. Its drive to rebuild a Hindu temple on a site sacred to both Hindus and Muslims has already cost more than 300 lives. Political violence during the five-day voting period cost at least 100 more, making this India's deadliest election.
American interests are best served by a democratic, peaceful India. Those goals would be equally well served by Mr. Gandhi or Mr. Singh or any other likely prime minister - provided that the fundamentalists don't impose divisive policies as the price of needed political support. Nor do the major parties differ much over bilateral issues like nuclear proliferation and Afghanistan, although the fundamentalists favor nuclear arms production. Voters sensibly rejected crude last-ditch efforts by the Congress Party to paint the opposition as American pawns.
In too many countries, dictators cite poverty, corruption and social diversity as excuses to avoid elections. In India, those ills spur democratic electoral change. That example deserves praise, and emulation.

HEADLINE: How Japanese Undercut U.S. Companies

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Trade Law's Tangled Web,'' Peter Passell's Nov. 8 Economic Scene column, omits or confuses important facts to reach tangled conclusions about the anticircumvention provision in United States antidumping law.
He correctly points out that Japanese forklift truck manufacturers were found by the Commerce Department to be dumping their products in the United States market, in some instances at half the fair market value - and in the process damaging the United States industry. The remedy for this offense under both international and United States law is for the manufacturer to adjust prices to eliminate the dumping or pay additional antidumping duties to the United States Treasury. 
Certain Japanese companies decided to do neither. Instead, they sought to evade the duties by shipping parts from Japan (and, in some cases, Mexico, Indonesia or Turkey) and assembling them in the United States. Mr. Passell does not mention that in the two quarters after the final antidumping order was issued, imports of complete forklifts subject to duty were 52 percent less than for the same two quarters in the previous year, while imports of Japanese forklift parts, which would evade the duty, increased by 403 percent.
The value of forklift parts imports jumped from $16.8 million between July and December 1987 to $84.2 million between July and December 1988.
Mr. Passell's concern that enforcement of the trade laws will lead to less Japanese investment in the United States is misplaced. Certainly, the flood of parts imports does nothing to help the United States economy, nor does it represent any real investment in the productive facilities of this country.
Further, one questions whether Mr. Passell relied on unbiased sources for his statement that the United States-made part of the Japanese forklifts assembled in this country ''reportedly exceeds 20 percent.'' Does that figure represent investment in the United States or the profit, selling and other expenses that any importer would experience?
Unless the anticircumvention law is enforced rigorously, Japanese forklift truck producers will have little incentive to invest in productive facilities in the United States. Indeed, Mr. Passell's approach to enforcement -or more aptly, nonenforcement - of the anticircumvention provision of the law will not only lead to less investment in the United States, but it will also result in undermining fair trade laws and increase protectionist approaches to our trade problems. This is a result that Congress clearly did not, and Mr. Passell should not, want.

HEADLINE: Too Soon to Slash Defense

BYLINE: By Caspar W. Weinberger; Caspar W. Weinberger was Secretary of Defense from 1981 to 1987.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Is anybody listening out there?
The Secretary of Defense, appearing on a national television program, is told by reporters that Congress will probably require even deeper budgetary cuts than the 12.6 percent reduction that has been imposed since fiscal 1987. He is also told that the Air Force's response to the Secretary's request for ideas about how to meet such deep reductions has already been leaked to the press. 
The Secretary responds that he has indeed been told by Congressional leaders that they will insist on deep cuts, perhaps totaling $180 billion in the next few years. He agrees that the risk of a Soviet attack against the West is lower than in many years. Then he is asked if he has changed his belief that Mikhail Gorbachev is likely to be driven out of power soon. No, he replies, he still thinks that is right.
The Secretary never said he wanted these deep cuts; he never said it is safe to make them, and it is clear he has not ''ordered'' them.
Nonetheless, the next day, the press reports that the Secretary wants to cut $180 billion from defense in three years (Associated Press); five years (USA Today); six years (The Wall Street Journal); three years beginning in 1992 (The New York Times).
I never heard Secretary Dick Cheney say he ''wanted to cut'' any amount. While the ''likelihood of all-out conflict between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R.'' is indeed lower than ever, as he said, it is largely because of the total failure of Communism and Socialism as an economic system and the military strength we regained from 1981 to 1988. All these welcome changes we are seeing in the Warsaw Pact countries are neither irreversible nor cause for concluding that the West and NATO can reduce their military strength now.
Less than six months ago, China, under Deng Xiaoping, was ''irreversibly'' launched on the road to free market economics and more democracy, or so most people believed and hoped. One afternoon in Tiananmen Square reversed all that. We all hope it will change back someday. But it is certainly clear that the Soviets did not reduce their military forces on the China border on the ground that there was less of a threat because of apparently ''irreversible'' changes in China.
But Congress, having already made major cuts in President Bush's requests for defense funding for fiscal 1990, now insists on much deeper cuts for the next several years. These cuts will hurt all the military services, cast doubt on the future success of the all-volunteer program, reduce our readiness and cast aside many of the elements of our regained strength. And all of this because of some pleasing rhetoric and some clear demonstrations that people who have been forced to live under Communism hate it as much as always.
There has been no evidence yet that Mr. Gorbachev, if he is sincere, can last. And there is no question whatever that if Mr. Gorbachev or his successor wants to use force and repression, the Soviet Union, with its huge military might not yet meaningfully reduced, will continue to be the biggest threat to peace and freedom.
Under these circumstances, cutting the heart out of our defenses for the next several years is roughly like canceling all your fire insurance because you did not have a fire last year.

Where 2 + 2 Can Open Eyes To a New World

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING

DATELINE: LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J.

 BODY:
In many ways, the beginning sessions of Bill Granville's Granville Academy resemble an introductory class in business administration, with the emphasis on accounting. Indeed, the class is held in a large lecture room at Rider College here, in the glistening new business administration building.
''A woman owns a car worth $1,500,'' the instructor said. ''So what is that?'' ''An asset,'' several in the class answered. ''Why is it an asset?'' ''Because she owns it!'' ''But she owes $750. What is that? ''A liability.'' ''Why?'' ''Because she owes it!'' ''So what's the owner's equity and how do you arrive at it?'' 
''Seven hundred and fifty dollars, by subtracting liabilities from assets.''
The lesson is rudimentary, but grows more complex, easing into balance sheets, ''a snapshot of where you are financially at a particular moment in time,'' and on to gross and net profits, sales and operating expenses, other overhead and the like.
The instructor, Joseph S. Marrow, is the accounting supervisor for the marketing division of British Petroleum in Keasbey. He is teaching the class because he is an old friend of the founder of the five-year-old academy, William Granville Jr., who is also an oil executive, vice president of a division of the Mobil Corporation in New York City. Mr. Marrow, who is 42 years old, entered the oil business because of Mr. Granville, 48.
 
Mr. Marrow met
Mr. Granville in Trenton, in the inner city, where Bill Granville, called just Bro' in those days, led a gang, the Whips East Trenton Trotters. Bro' was good with his fists. The Whips wore blue-and-yellow jackets with a snake on the back. They fought, stole and used a fair amount of dope.
''I saw a man who was very angry in those days,'' said Mr. Marrow, who also saw a transformation in Mr. Granville. ''Someone who was looking to prove himself as a man. That was the impression you had - a man who was tough.''
That was a long time ago. William Granville did well in math, found out that he was smart and earned a cum laude degree in mathematics from Delaware State College, which also recently awarded him an honorary doctorate in humane letters. He started climbing the corporate ladder, but he has not forgotten.
The students at the Granville Academy are black teen-agers, 13 to 15 in this class, and they are mostly from the inner-city areas of Trenton. ''They don't think of black businessmen and investors at this level,'' Mr. Granville said. ''To them, the inner city is it, and success in business in the inner city means owning a barbershop or a beverage store. Business does not mean planning, economics and corporate structure. It isn't a negative image they have. It's a non-image.'' Mr. Granville's academy meets two evenings a month at Rider or the Princeton Theological Seminary. The surroundings are intended to defeat a ''ghetto mentality.''
The ad hoc four-year program enrolls 20 to 30 students a year. The academy has had four graduates, all of whom went to college in business disciplines.
The students - recruited through churches, schools and word of mouth - enroll for different reasons. Coltrane Stansbury, 14, said the academy offered ''long-term benefits, communication skills and learning to deal with people in the realm of business.''
Marwan Malloy, 13, said she wanted to know ''the fundamentals of business.'' Camille Roberts, also 13, said that she wanted to be a doctor, but that ''I also sort of want to have my own business, too.''
The president of Rider, Frank N. Elliott, was so impressed with the academy that he arranged for up to eight scholarships, worth $15,000 a year, for its graduates.
After attending a class on insurance, he said, ''I can truthfully say that my daughters,'' who are both college graduates, ''are not nearly as sophisticated about insurance as these 8th-to-12th graders.''
Mr. Granville suggested that the successful executive might provide an alternative role model to the ''other entrepreneur,'' the inner-city drug dealer. ''The dope dealer has income, bags of cash and gold chains,'' he said. ''The investor has property, marketable securities and is on his way to a better life.''
A 15-year-old in the class said that he sold marijuana when he was ''in the seventh grade'' and made $100 to $150 a week, but that he then thought about his situation.
''I just looked around and saw more and more people getting arrested, more people falling off, dying,'' he said. ''I just started thinking about it.''

HEADLINE: Historic House May Get New Life at Last

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
In the more than 200 years that it has stood on the East River waterfront, the home of Capt. Joseph Rose has endured few periods as trying as the last decade, while New York City officials have tried and tried and tried again to salvage what has become little more than a brick shell.
But there may be new hope for the four-story Captain Rose House at 273 Water Street, which is the third-oldest building in Manhattan, with one of the raciest histories of any of New York's structural antiquities.
It has been auctioned for $325,000 to two Manhattan real-estate investors, Edmond Ohebshalom and Eli Sakhai. Mr. Ohebshalom said they hope to renovate it with a ground-floor store and offices above.
Under terms set by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, which controls the house, they cannot complete the purchase until their plans are approved by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The house, between Peck Slip and Dover Street, is within the South Street Seaport Historic District. The building must be rehabilitated and cannot be enlarged. 
 
Looking New, Feeling Old
''The key is to make this building look new but feel old,'' said the city's Housing Commissioner, Abraham Biderman. He said builders were ''daunted'' by the challenge of retaining the small structure's historic character while making it functional and economically attractive for the contemporary market.
Although the house is in a state of near ruin, some of its facade - the second floor in particular - is a handsome testament to 18th-century building crafts, with Flemish-bond brickwork and splayed brownstone lintels and even some wooden window frames that are presumed to be original.
But from the street, the sky can be seen through the fourth-floor windows. Alarmingly large cracks run through the exterior walls. The interior is badly charred and appears to be close to collapse.
It is not known exactly when Captain Rose built his house, which is 25 feet wide and originally was two stories and an attic, but it was standing in the 1780's. In Manhattan, only St. Paul's Chapel on lower Broadway and the Morris-Jumel Mansion uptown predate it.
 
Brig Moored Nearby
At the time of its construction, before land was filled, the Rose property was on the riverfront and the captain kept his brig, Industry, moored behind his house. When he was not in New York, Captain Rose sailed as far as the Bay of Honduras, trading in sugar, mahogany, indigo, rice and tobacco.
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, the house was an apothecary shop, rooming house, hotel and brothel. Its most notorious incarnation was as Kit Burns's Sportsman's Hall, a saloon that kept its patrons entertained by staging bloody fights among dogs or between dogs and rats. In 1869, it was converted into a ''home for fallen women.''
More conventionally in the 20th century, the building was a loft and storehouse. In 1904, after a fire in the upper floors, it was expanded to four stories. It was abandoned by 1976, when squatters started a fire which consumed the roof and caused severe interior damage.
City officials took the building from its owner in 1976 for failure to pay taxes. In 1983, the housing agency tried to dispose of the house under a 30-year lease to a development team that included the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, specialists in restoration work. But that arrangement fell apart. A second attempt in 1985 failed.
 
A Love for South Street Area
Commissioner Biderman said housing officials finally determined that leasing the building would not work but selling it might, ''as long as we could maintain restrictions so that the building could retain its historic context.''
''Obviously, it would be more financially attractive to a buyer,'' Mr. Biderman said. ''That's why we got someone to bite this time.''
Mr. Ohebshalom said he became aware of the Rose house while looking through a catalogue of city properties for a Sept. 27 auction. He was attracted to the property, he said, because of his love for the South Street area. There were no other bidders, and $325,000 was the minimum price.
This would be the first major construction project Mr. Ohebshalom has undertaken, although he described himself as being ''in the real-estate business for the past five years.'' He said Mr. Sakhai was also involved in real estate.
Mr. Ohebshalom said a housing official ''gave me some hope that it will be much easier to do'' than it appears. But, he conceded, ''when you look at the building, you get scared.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Counts o Computer Edge In the Race for Advanced TV

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
DESPITE a slow start by the United States in the race to build television sets with razor-sharp pictures, a growing group of scientists and engineers say there is hope for a comeback. Indeed, some believe conditions are ripe for America to vault over the international competition in a field seen as vital to economic success in the 1990's and beyond.
''We've got a tremendous opportunity to leapfrog limited technology and really develop a television of the future,'' said Dr. W. Russell Neuman, director of communications research at the media laboratory of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
''It would be a big mistake to write off the field,'' agreed Dr. Dimitris Anastassiou, a professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University who recently helped organize a technical symposium on high-definition television. 
Experts say the main reason for hope is that the Japanese and Europeans, by virtue of an early lead, have locked themselves into a type of technology that may become antiquated. That technology is based on analog signals, which mimic the scenes and sounds observed by a camera and render these, in all their variations, as continuous electronic waves. The future of television, these experts say, increasingly lies in the direction of digital processing, the same technique computers use and is an area of great American strength. Digital signals turn the complexity of the real world into a code based on the numbers 0 and 1, or, in electrical terms, plus and minus. The code can be manipulated to process or transmit volumes of information with great accuracy.
''We have a hope because this country is so good in computers,'' said Dr. Arun N. Netravali, director of the computing systems research laboratory at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories.
Pessimists say the race is already nearly lost, and that even if the United States came up with an innovative design for a high-definition television, few companies would be able to make HDTV's now. They note that Zenith is the last large American company still in the television business.
The race for high-definition television is considered important by some experts because the technology may represent more than a path to sparkling images and sound as good as that on compact disks. Some experts see it creating a wide variety of new products, including video systems for education, industry, medical imaging and the military. Moreover, the technology is so demanding electronically, requiring scores of advanced new computer chips, that it is seen as a new driving force for the semiconductor industry, potentially providing even greater demand than computers do.
''The companies and countries that control the development of HDTV will have a huge lead in the coming competition for leadership in the electronics world,'' Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House subcommittee on telecommunications, recently said in opening a hearing on high-definition television. Other experts disagree, saying the importance of the field has been exaggerated.
 
A 20-Year Japanese Quest
Japan has long led the fledgling field, having embarked on HDTV research 20 years ago and investing an estimated $1 billion. European governments and companies over the past five years have spent about $200 million. Spending in the United States is estimated to be less than $100 million.
But both Europe and Japan have based their efforts on the development of analog systems that use wave-like transmission signals. These signals can easily be disrupted by static. Moreover, they are broadcast by satellites (Japan has one in orbit and Europe will soon) and are therefore not available to regular television viewers. Satellite transmissions aimed at a small geographic area or nation are relatively easy to accomplish. But experts say they cannot rival the economic advantages of terrestrial broadcasting that allows local programing and local advertising.
In contrast, the United States is focusing on the creation of what experts believe is a more egalitarian and economically promising system that could be broadcast over regular television channels. Moreover, there is growing enthusiasm about doing it with digital signals, which could dramatically cut distortion.
Several of the 20 or so American systems now under development are partly based on digital transmission, and American scientists at schools like Columbia and M.I.T. are racing to see how far digital technology can go in the search for the perfect television picture.
''As far as transmitting over the air, we're already way ahead of Europe and Japan,'' said William F. Schreiber, director of M.I.T.'s advanced television research program. ''They simply haven't addressed the problem seriously.'' But some other experts note that Europe and Japan have begun work on tackling the challenge of terrestrial broadcasting, instead of by satellite. >gfcrossline>More Detail in More Lines The basic goal of high-definition television is to increase the number of lines in a television picture, thus sharpening it. Today's television pictures in America and Japan are composed of 525 scanning lines, while those in Europe have 625. More scanning lines provide more details in the image on the screen. HDTV proposals call for various numbers of lines: 787, 1,050, 1,125, or 1,250.
The challenge is not just making high-quality picture tubes. It also is devising a way to process and transmit all the extra information that is needed to animate the added scanning lines.
Last year, the Federal Communications Commission ruled that new American HDTV systems would not be allowed to make the nation's existing 160 million TV sets obsolete. That means broadcasters must give viewers the standard signal and, if they choose, the new HDTV signal for those who have special TV sets to receive it. In addition, the F.C.C. ruled that HDTV broadcasters must operate in the same wavelength range as older sets because the electromagnetic spectrum was considered too crowded to appropriate a new area.
In technical terms, the challenge is to squeeze the 30 megahertz of signal band width needed for high-definition television into the band of 6 megahertz for each channel that normal broadcasting uses. Some experts have likened the process to squeezing an elephant into a bathtub.
The solution is signal compression. It relies heavily on digital processing, which breaks the analog signals from a camera into digital pulses that are sliced, diced and rearranged with incredible precision.
In a technique known as conditional replenishment, a series of images is digitally analyzed and only new features are transmitted, such as those that show an object moving. The static background is sent only once. Another technique reduces the data flow even further by taking into account the fact that the human eye perceives fewer details on a moving object than a stationary one.
''If you have a lot of motion, you don't send as much information,'' said Wayne C. Luplow, executive director of electronic systems research at the Zenith Corp., which is developing an HDTV system.
 
Elimination of Noise
Both Europe and Japan do some of this kind of digital signal compression. But then they switch back to analog signals for transmission to television sets, since that was the accepted approach when they started their work. In contrast, American scientists are working to extend the digital process all the way to the receiving TV set.
The advantage of digital transmission is error reduction. Electronic flaws, called noise, that invade an analog signal are sometimes nearly impossible to differentiate from the signal itself. But since a digital signal is made up of a string of simple pulses, noise stands out and is easily removed. In its place a computer can generate a corrected pulse after making a quick assessment of nearby pulses.
For instance, a black dot of interference could be replaced with a correct red dot of color, based on a survey indicating most nearby dots were red. Similar techniques of digital transmission are how deep-space probes send back stunning photos like those Voyager 2 recently radioed from Neptune.
''Digital communication by definition has higher fidelity,'' said Dr. Neuman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In addition, by going directly from digital processing to digital transmission, rather than switching back to analog, ''You skip a step of processing, which improves performance and makes it more cost effective,'' said John I. Taylor, a Zenith spokesman.
The problem is that digital transmission is still only experimental. Researchers have tried over-the-air digital radio broadcasts, but are just starting to tackle the challenges of of over-the-air digital television.
Zenith, which recently decided to sell its personal computer business and focus on high-definition television instead, is one of the pioneers of digital transmission of HDTV. Its proposed signal is a hybrid, part analog and part digital. The digital portion includes low-frequency video, the pulses that keep receivers synchronized with transmitters, and the audio signal for high-quality stereo sound. The analog signal contains high-frequency video information, which helps make up the picture.
 
Less Power Means More Channels
An important advantage of this approach, Zenith says, is a vast reduction in the amount of power needed for the broadcasting transmitter, since the low-frequency part of the analog signal that has been eliminated is also the power-hungry part. Zenith's HDTV signal, it says, uses less than 0.2 percent of the power needed for regular transmissions.
This power reduction, in turn, allows Zenith's HDTV signal to use the channels that usually are empty in crowded city television markets. Because analog signals are so strong, they can be broadcast only by skipping channels between them so they do not interfere with each other. For instance, a city with several stations might have channels 3, 5, 7 and 9 in use. But the low-power Zenith signal can be broadcast in the taboo channels in between without causing interference.
Scientists say proposals like Zenith's are but the first step on the digital highway, and that the transmission journey might be complete in the next 5 to 10 years.
''Over the air, if you can receive it, digital will have the advantage of being perfect,'' said Dr. Anastassiou of Columbia University. He noted that there are a host of challenges, and potential solutions, to the goal.
It will be at least two years before the Federal Communications Commission decides on standards for over-the-air HDTV broadcasts. Some options under study would make it easier to extend the digital range; others would make it harder.
Some scientists say a better digital route is through a national network of glass fibers that connect homes. Such fibers can carry enormous amounts of digital information in the form of laser-light pulses, transmitting not only digital HDTV signals to American homes, but also other types of information, including high-speed computer data.
''We want to make this the superhighway of the future,'' Jules A. Bellisio, a fiber enthusiast at Bell Communications Research in Redbank, N.J., told the recent HDTV symposium at Columbia.
 
Adding Computers for 'Smart' TV
Finally, scientists say, the advent of digital television will aid the merging of computers and television, with the prospect of a rush of combined uses. Smart TV's, for instance, could automatically scan the digital airwaves for shows of interest, recording them when certain key words were present.
Several scientists and engineers warned that American HDTV would materialize only if there was steady Federal financial support for the field. Most direct in his comments was Dr. Neuman of M.I.T., who said, ''The lack of leadership in the Bush Administration may blow it.''
Dr. Netravali of A.T.&T. Bell Laboratories, in Murray Hill, N.J., echoed the need for a strong initiative, saying, ''If we take no action, obviously we won't have anything in this country.''
On the other hand, some experts say, HDTV development could prove so successful in the United States that it would be exported to the countries now considered the leaders.
''There's a lot of interest in Japan and Europe for terrestrial broadcast systems,'' said Mr. Luplow of Zenith. ''We think that when there is a terrestrial standard in the United States, it may be adopted in those countries as well.''

HEADLINE: U.S.-Soviet Makers Plan Supersonic Business Jet

BYLINE: By ERIC WEINER

 BODY:
In a striking example of commercial glasnost, a Soviet state enterprise that made the planes that bombed Afghanistan has joined an American company to build the ultimate capitalist status symbol: a supersonic jet for business executives.
The project is still in its early stages and faces formidable obstacles, including environmental concerns and worries about exporting sensitive technology. Some skeptics say the proposed plane will never be built.
''The whole idea is preposterous,'' said Richard N. Perle, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington and a former Under Secretary of Defense. ''There would be immense licensing problems.'' 
He said export controls were unlikely to be relaxed to allow the free flow of technology between the countries.
But East bloc and aerospace experts say it signifies the Soviet Union's hunger for hard currency, Western technology and new uses for its historically military-oriented aerospace industry, now that the Kremlin is cutting military spending.
Sukhoi, a company best known for building the Su-25, a jet used in the war in Afghanistan, has teamed up with the Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, a subsidiary of the Chrysler Corporation best known for building high-priced private jets used by top executives who want an edge on the corporate battlefield.
Rolls-Royce P.L.C., the British aerospace manufacturer, has been signed up to design the engine for the plane with a Soviet company, Lyulka. The plane would tentatively carry 15 to 20 passengers, fly at speeds of about 1,500 miles an hour and cost $50 million - twice the price on the most expensive corporate jet on the market today.
The proposed plane, according to Allen E. Paulson, the president of Gulfstream, would have the range to fly the booming trans-Pacific market for corporate travel, especially from the United States to Japan. The only civilian supersonic plane flying today is the British-French Concorde, which took more than five years to develop and does not have trans-Pacific range.
After months of meetings between Sukhoi and Gulfstream engineers, the final designs are scheduled to be approved within weeks. It would be the first joint civil aviation project between the countries.
Sukhoi, which would handle most of the development work, valued at the equivalent of $1 billion, has said in meetings with Gulfstream that it can have a prototype flying in three years and begin production in five.
''What the Soviets have to offer is manufacturing muscle,'' said Donald Fink, the editor of Aviation Week and Space Technology, a trade magazine. ''You have, if not a marriage made in heaven, a logical meld.''
While the aerodynamics of Soviet aircraft are nearly on par with that of Western planes, they lag slightly in engine technology and cockpit electronics. And a previous Soviet attempt at building a supersonic civilian aircraft ended in disaster. The plane, the Tupelov Tu-144, crashed at the Paris Air Show in 1973, killing several crew members. The plane never entered passenger service.
The cuts in Soviet military spending, intended to decline by 14.2 percent through 1991, are behind Moscow's push into civilian aircraft for export. Other sectors of the Soviet defense industry also diversifying. Missile plants, for example, have begun making outdoor barbecue grills, while aircraft manufacturers are building baby strollers.
''The Soviet defense industry is under enormous pressure to go civilian and equally enormous pressure to come up with hard currencies,'' said Marshall I. Goldman, the associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard University.
The Soviets' aviation export agency, Aviaexport, has already expanded its presence and now has 55 offices worldwide. It hopes to increase its export sales by 50 percent, to nearly $4 billion, by 1995, calculated at the official exchange rate for the ruble. But until now, virtually all of those sales have been to East bloc nations and to some third world countries.
To stimulate interest and possibly sales in Western markets, the Soviets are now showing their airplanes abroad, making dramatic appearances at air shows last summer in Oshkosh, Wis., and Abbottsford, British Columbia. And Ilyushin and Tupelov, the two primary manufacturers of airliners, are developing longer-range, more fuel-efficient jets that they hope to sell to Western airlines.
''It's of prime importance for these companies to start finding new products,'' said Dmitri Beskurnikov, the principal counselor for the state Foreign Economic Commission in Moscow. ''One of the ways of easing the conversion process is to invite foreign partners.''
Mikhail P. Simonov, Sukhoi's chief, has said that his goal is to transform the primarily military-oriented company to one that is half civilian.
Mr. Paulson of Gulfstream first heard of Sukhoi's plans in an article published last spring in Aviation Week and Space Technology. Mr. Paulson and Mr. Simonov then met for several hours in June at the Paris Air Show, the industry's premier event. By the next morning, they had signed an agreement to study the design of a supersonic coprorate jet.
 
Concerns Abound
The current project faces many hurdles, not the least of which is the public concern about the noise from supersonic jets. Civilian planes are prohibited from flying faster than Mach 1, or about 700 miles an hour, over the United States. But Mr. Paulson said the plane could be designed to have a lower, more acceptable sonic boom.
While Gulfstream's planes have advanced electronics and other systems that could have military applications, Mr. Paulson said that it was the United States that was most likely to gain in the technology transfer.
Another obstacle is the plane's price. At $50 million, the jet would cost more than twice Gulfstream's G-IV, which is considered the ultimate corporate chariot. ''It's a great concept from a technology standpoint, but I'm not sure the market is big enough to warrant the development costs,'' said Angelo Fiataruolo, the president of Premier Aircraft, an aircraft brokerage in Westport, Conn.
Upon reconsideration, some Soviet analysts say, Moscow may eventually abandon the project, given its huge risks.
''I don't think the Soviets are in a position, considering the state of the economy, to stick their neck out on a project that no Western company, even a consortium, would consider doing,'' said Jan Vanous, the research director for Planecon, a Washington consulting company that specializes in the Eastern bloc and Soviet economies.
Gulfstream, Mr. Paulson said, so far has invested a nominal amount of money into the project.
NASA, along with the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, recently completed a study on building a commercial supersonic plane that would seat about 200 people. While NASA concluded that a market existed for such a plane, industry analysts said that such an extensive project would need to be developed by an international consortium and might require government money.

HEADLINE: Domestic Car Sales Show Drop

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The nation's Big Three auto makers suffered serious sales declines in mid-November, while the so-called Japanese transplants posted sharp gains on far fewer sales. Over all, sales of domestically produced cars slumped 6.1 percent, and light-truck sales dropped 1.7 percent, not quite so dismal a trend as during the early part of the month.
The Big Three and five Japanese auto makers operating American plants sold 149,381 cars from Nov. 11 to 20, down from 159,082 a year ago, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of about 6.2 million.
Analysts said the sales report indicated that the automotive industry remained soft, and they agreed that while production cuts were likely, they were not sure how they would be accomplished. 
 
Scattered Shutdowns Seen
Ron Glantz of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said he was looking for scattered shutdowns, a few weeks at a time, during the next couple of months.
Jack Kirnan of Kidder, Peabody in New York said he was hearing rumors of an industrywide extension of the traditional Christmas vacation, that starts just before the holiday and ends just after New Year's.
From an investment perspective, Mr. Kirnan said an industrywide shutdown was bullish because ''it dramatizes to the Fed the need for continued lower interest rates.'' He added: ''It dramatizes to the union the need for sanity in the bargaining for the next contract. And it will help improve the resale values of cars and trucks,'' which are hurt when companies overproduce and then use incentives to clear inventories.
Indeed, the prices of all three stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange today. The Ford Motor Company added $1.125 to close at $45.375; the General Motors Corporation gained 87.5 cents to close at $43.875, and the Chrysler Corporation rose 75 cents to close at $20.25.
G.M. car sales in mid-November were off 13 percent, to 66,338, Ford's sales were off 11.5 percent, to 41,963, and Chrysler's car sales were off 11.9 percent, to 20,187.
Nissan Motor Corporation sales for the period jumped 19.5 percent, to 2,329; the Honda Motor Corporation's car sales rose 29.7 percent, 10,714; the Mazda Motor Corporation's car sales rose 44.9 percent, to 978, and the Toyota Motor Corporation's car sales rose almost threefold to 5,882, compared with a year ago. The Mitsubishi Motor Corporation, in its first full year of United States production, sold 990 cars produced in this country. The five Japanese auto makers producing in North America together sell about as many domestically built cars as Chrysler.
Light-truck sales declined to 98,878, from 100,643 a year ago, with Ford acccounting for the entire decline; it had a 14.8 percent drop from a year earlier, while G.M., Chrysler and Nissan all posted increases.
Tom Houston, a Chrysler spokesman, commenting on increased truck sales, said, ''It's about time something turned up.'' He credited financial incentives for trucks and recent increases in dealers' advertising outlays for the gain.
A Ford spokesman, referring to Chrylser's truck gain, said the No. 3 auto maker ''obviously is trying to buy some market share.'' He added, ''Chrysler is the only company with incentives on full-size pickup trucks.''
 
Domestic Truck Sales Down
For the first 20 days of the month, domestic car sales were down 15.3 percent, and domestic truck sales were down 8.8 percent. Sales of minivans and utility vehicles, which are used as personal transportation, are included in truck sales.
''This is progress, but nothing to get excited about,'' said Harvey Heinbach, an automotive analyst for Merrill Lynch & Company in New York. ''The first 10 days of the month must have been an aberration, but still, these are not good numbers at all.''
G.M. plants in Doraville, Ga., and Fairfax, Kan., and Chrysler plants in Toledo, Ohio, and Detroit will be closed this week to help reduce inventories. Ford will shut its Dearborn, Mich., plant for a week starting Dec. 4 and keep its Lorain, Ohio, plant shut until Dec. 11, also to reduce inventories.
Charles Brady, auto analyst for Oppenheimer & Company in New York, said no clear sales trend had emerged. The soft sales of October and November are understandable in light of the strong incentives at the end of the summer and the sharp price increases for 1990 models, he said, but how long the downtrend continues depends on the strength of the overall economy and consumer psychology.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 19.42 Despite Bond Market Slump

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday despite falling back from early highs after a slump in the bond market.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 19.42 points, to 2,694.97, as 883 issues rose and 612 fell on the New York Stock Exchange.
Revived hopes for lower interest rates pushed the Dow up steadily in the morning, to about a 27-point gain at 10:30 A.M. Shortly before noon, however, stock prices began to retreat in reaction to the Federal Reserve Board's signal that it would further drain funds from the banking system, a sign that it is not easing credit.
''Hopes for a quick prime rate reduction were dashed early as the Fed drained liquidity,'' said Joseph H. Barthel, director of investor strategy at Hopper Soliday & Company in Philadelphia. ''While the Dow ignored this apparent change in the direction of short-term interest rates, the broad market underperformed badly, with the Value Line index being up only the equivalent of 6 points on the Dow.'' 30-Year Bond at 7.90% Mr. Barthel noted that by late in the day, bond prices were near their lows for the day, with the bellwether 30-year Treasury issue off nearly half a point to yield 7.90 percent. The Federal funds rate was up to 8.5 percent. 
''The Fed's apparent move toward higher interest rates might have something to do with an attempt to stem recent dollar weakness,'' Mr. Barthel said.
Volume on the Big Board expanded to a moderate 149.4 million shares from Friday's 86.3 million shares, the second-lowest turnover the year.
In the broader market, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.64 points, to 345.61, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index added 0.84, to 191.13.
 
Chevron Advances 3 1/4, to 68 1/4
Among individual issues, Chevron rose 3 1/4, to 68 1/4, in active trading. The company said it had created an employee stock ownership plan under which it would borrow about a billion dollars and use the money to buy back newly issued Chevron stock, representing 5 percent of its currently outstanding 342 million shares.
Pennzoil, which is regarded as Chevron's most likely suitor, also advanced, adding 1 1/2, to 80 3/8.
Perkin-Elmer rose 1 1/8, to 23 3/8. The Nikon Corporation of Japan is considered a likely bidder for Perkin-Elmer's semiconductor equipment operations, which it put up for sale in April, but there has been trouble completing a deal, analysts said.
Lone Star Industries gained 1, to 21 7/8, despite announcing it would take a charge of $250 million in the fourth quarter for a restructuring program. Lone Star also said the charge would prevent payment of future dividends on its common stock under its present loan agreements.
 
Cray Research Up 1 3/4, to 34 1/2
Cray Research rose 1 3/4, to 34 1/2. Rick Martin, an analyst with Prudential-Bache, reiterated a buy recommendation on the supercomputer maker's stock, citing an improved earnings outlook.
Texas Utilities, in an apparent dividend-capture play, was the most active Big Board stock, rising 1/2, to 35 1/2, on a volume of more than 11 million shares. The stock goes ex dividend today.
Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 1 1/4, to 61 3/8; Exxon gained a point, to 46 7/8; Philip Morris was unchanged at 41 1/2; Texaco was unchanged at 53 7/8; I.B.M. dropped a point, to 99 3/8; A.T.&T. slipped 5/8, to 43 1/8, and Unisys was off 3/4, to 15 1/4.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index rose 0.90, to 374.04, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.46, to 456.17.

HEADLINE: Trade Zones Are Criticized

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Foreign trade zones, which are supposed to create jobs in the United States by increasing exports, are instead bringing in more imports, mostly auto parts, according to a Congressional report released today.
The report by the House Government Operations Committee said 89 percent of all shipments through the zones now come into the United States and only 11 percent go out.
Duty-free zones at United States ports were approved in 1934 to create jobs and promote exports, re-exports and transshipment of goods.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Profit Taking by Speculators Sends Gold Prices Plunging

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold prices plummeted yesterday amid heavy profit taking by speculators as the market broke a five-day run-up that had pushed the metal to its highest levels in almost a year.
On other commodity markets, cotton futures plunged the permitted daily limit and soybeans were down sharply.
Gold futures settled $5 to $6.10 lower on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in December down $5.20 at $414.10 an ounce. The expiring November contract fell $5, to $413.90. Silver fell 18.7 cents to 20.7 cents, with December settling at $5.693 an ounce. 
 
Steepest Drop Since Aug. 4
Yesterday's selloff was the steepest daily decline in gold prices since Aug. 4 and the most significant drop since the market began climbing sharply about six weeks ago from levels near $360 an ounce.
Analysts said gold had been due for a correction after climbing so hard so fast, and many remained bullish.
''The trend remains intact,'' said James Steel, a metals analyst with the futures brokerage Refco Inc. in New York.
But they said gold could easily fall a bit further before resuming its climb, which has been based largely on investment buying stemming from the uncertain economic outlook, the volatile stock market and worries about the rapid rate of political change in Eastern Europe.
There were no solidly bearish developments yesterday to prompt the gold selloff, so observers concluded that the selling reflected profit taking by players who had ridden the market up since mid-October.
''I don't think we're finished yet with the rally in gold or silver,'' said Jack Barbanel, managing director of First Global Asset Management Inc. in Princeton, N.J. ''It's healthy for the market not to overextend itself.''
Most cotton futures prices fell the daily limit of 2 cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange in a sell-off inspired almost entirely by technical sell signals in the absence of fresh supply-and-demand news.
The trigger was the March contract's drop below the September low of 72.20 cents early in the session, said Ernest Simon, a cotton analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
''When it came close to it, frantic, panicky selling developed,'' he said.
The wheat market closed narrowly mixed, with support stemming from Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter's statement that France's sale of 1.3 million metric tons of wheat to the Soviet Union was ''an encouraging sign'' that the Soviets were back in the market for wheat.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls on Expectations Of Changes in Interest Rates

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against most major foreign currencies yesterday. Traders apparently are expecting a decline in interest rates in the United States in response to a slowing economy, although action by the Federal Reserve in the credit markets yesterday suggested rates may not decline as quickly as some may expect.
The Fed, which took the first steps earlier this year to ease credit as the economy began to slow, signaled apparent approval for further easing last week but indicated yesterday that it had not yet approved a rate decline. 
The dollar was also weakened, however, by the expectation among currency traders that interest rates will rise in West Germany because of the continuing political changes in Eastern Europe, said Earl Johnson, a vice president for foreign exchange at Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. ''The psychology is definitely bearish for the dollar and bullish for the mark,'' he added.
 
Decline Against the Mark
A nation's currency tends to follow the direction of its interest rates. Lower American rates make the dollar less attractive, while higher West German yields make the mark a better investment. Against the West German currency yesterday, the dollar fell to 1.7890 marks, down from 1.8010 late Friday.
The dollar's downward trend is expected to remain in place in the next few weeks unless the Government issues new statistics indicating strength in the economy, Mr. Johnson said. Traders will be scrutinizing several economic reports this week, including third-quarter gross national product figures and personal income, construction spending and the index of leading indicators for October.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing of 143.35 Japanese yen from 143.80 at Friday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 143.40 yen, but in New York, it fell to 143.195 from Friday's 143.60.
The dollar gained against the British pound, as sterling fell to $1.5605, from $1.5635 late Friday in London, and to $1.5585, from $1.5625 late Friday in New York.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.6040 Swiss francs, down from 1.6095; 6.1100 French francs, down from 6.1415; 1.16665 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6725, and 1,320.75 Italian lire, down from 1,326.75.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Management Of Facilities a Growth Area

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
FACILITIES management has become a fast-growing profession, so much so that 8,000 specialists belong to the International Facility Management Association, formed in 1980 with headquarters in Houston.
Its president, Robert J. Gross, who is 43 years old, is a vice president of the First Pennsylvania Bank, in charge of its faciliites. ''Take the word facility away from facility management and substitute assets,'' he explained. ''We are a resource for executive management.'' 
''If the bank adds staff we are concerned about expenses as well as space requirements,'' he said. Space often constitutes the second-largest operating expense after salaries.
''I joined 17 years ago at a time the bank was using people without formal training to handle branch expansion,'' he said. ''In fact, there was little training available. Our facilities management department grew from that.'' He has a bachelor's degree from Temple University in architecture.
Mr. Gross heads a staff of 24 people, including six in design and construction, three in real estate, two in planning and four general administrators. Each unit is headed by an assistant vice president, while outside concerns do much of the maintenance work under contract.
''One way my operation differs from a manufacturing company is that the bulk of my space is office and customer-contact space,'' he said. Involved with furniture, lighting, acoustics, environmental issues, occupancy expenses, design and construction, he also busies himself with long-range planning. ''I work closely, too, with management information systems people.'' he added.
''We try to eliminate surprises,'' he said. ''Our weekends sometimes are not a lot of fun.'' Often his department must check artwork, nameplates, telephone systems and other items at new bank branches.
''I think an undergraduate major in facilities management and a master of business administration degree would be a fine background,'' he added.
Training is still scarce, available at fewer than two dozen colleges. Cornell University, a pioneer in the field, offers graduate and undergraduate degrees. Iona College offers a bachelor of science degree as does North Dakota State University and Brigham Young University. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology has several courses and holds an annual conference.
Arthur P. Hahn, facility operations manager for the space and defense sector of TRW Inc., heads a staff of 400 people of which about 300 are in operations and maintenance.
Mr. Hahn, who majored in architecture, joined the Air Force after college and it sent him to Oklahoma State University for a master's degree in architectural engineering. ''I spent more than 23 years in the Air Force, doing facilities management,'' he said. After retiring as a colonel he joined TRW.
''It's a good career - one of the last unexplored areas, without many books for guidance and few courses,'' he added. ''So many facilities can be improved. The thing that strikes me is that every day is different.''
Mr. Hahn might receive a call about a broken air-conditioning system or trash not being picked up. Sometimes questions are technical as in the case of the engineer who asked for the longitude and latitude of a plant.
''I had to research that,'' he said. ''Then I might get a call about the need to plan for a new building.'' His responsibiliites include environmental and heating and ventilating problems, among others.
Cost containment is important, he said, ''Our electric bill in the space and defense unit alone is $25 million a year.''
Christine H. Neldon, who is 36 years old, heads facility management at four offices for the accounting and consulting firm of Arthur Andersen & Company, in Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Jacksonville, Fla., and Chattanooga, Tenn. ''I majored in marketing,'' she said, adding that in her 17 years with the firm she has held many administrative jobs, in personnel, training and telecommunications.
She has ''a lean operation,'' with two professional assistants. ''We lease space,'' she explained, so that when a plumber or electrician is needed she telephones the landlord's office.
Her areas include long-range planning, design, construction and renovation, office furnishings and real estate procurement. ''For that I might talk to our real estate partners,'' she said, explaining that often she can find professional help within the firm.
''Today many companies are contracting out some facilities management,'' she said, noting that new service firms have been ''sprouting up.'' However, others have increased inside facilities staffs. ''It's purely a matter of economics,'' she added.
At the International Facility Management Association, she said, about 75 percent of the members are professionals while 25 percent, called affiliates, work for outside service companies. ''You see people go back and forth between them,'' she commented, and she recalled a funny situation: ''One day the chairman of a company discovered ants crawling in his office. The question is can an outside consultant react fast enough.''

HEADLINE: The Short Life of 'Little Man,' A 14-Year-Old Drug Peddler

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
The life and death of Preston (Little Man) Simmons, a 14-year-old marijuana peddler who was shot and killed last Thursday, is a story that has become dismally familiar in his part of the world.
When he was executed in the courtyard of his housing project in the Bronx, he became one of almost 140 homicide victims aged 18 or under in New York City this year. For the last three years, about 10 percent of the city's homicide victims have been in that age group, many of them killed in drug-related incidents, according to police officials.
That the case of Preston Simmons is so commonplace is what gives it special weight. His existence at the Castle Hill Houses, a sprawling public housing complex in the East Bronx, was typical of life in the underclass. And the legacy of despair he left behind provides little hope of a better life for the next generation. 
Like Preston's mother and grandmother, his girlfriend will become a teen-age mother next month when she is due to deliver his child. The girlfriend, 17-year-old Denise Butler, doubts that her child's life will be much different from that of Preston, a personable youngster who made his spending money by selling $5 bags of marijuana.
''If he's still living around here,'' Miss Butler said of her expected child, ''I guess he'll be selling drugs, will be forced to sell drugs, or will have a lot of bad habits.''
The police have yet to make an arrest in Preston's case, but contend they have good leads. Although police officials are reluctant to declare the killing a drug hit, Preston's family and friends believe he was killed because he threatened to break with his marijuana supplier and set up a competing operation.
Although the man identified as Preston's supplier is not suspected as the gunman, he has been questioned at length by the police, said Sgt. William T. Kivlehan, a detective at the 43d Precinct in the Bronx. The man, who was at the site of the killing when it occurred, has a record of drug arrests.
Preston was killed at about 8:15 P.M. while walking from his girlfriend's apartment at 580 Castle Hill Avenue to his family's apartment a block away at 2120 Randall Avenue. He encountered the drug supplier and, while talking to him, was approached by a group of at least four men.
One of them pulled a 9-millimeter automatic pistol from his waist and shot Preston twice, once in the head and once in the body, and then shot him nine more times as he fell to the snow. ''This kid was full of holes,'' said Vincent Pizzo, chief of detectives for the housing police.
Preston's friends said he sensed the danger in the drug trade, although he thought it came more from the police than from his counterparts in commerce. It was a risk he thought worth taking.
''I guess he did it for the reason all the young dudes do it,'' said Anthony Butler, the brother of Preston's girlfriend and one of Preston's best friends. ''He was too young to get a job and it was some quick little change in his pocket.''
 
Fear of Venturing Out
Although residents of Castle Hill are accustomed to bloodshed, they were taken aback by Preston's death because of the coldness of the killing, particularly given the victim's age and his low position in the drug hierarchy.
The incident has made children and elderly people afraid to leave their apartments and has encouraged community leaders to philosophize about the spiraling cycle of poverty and drugs that seems to pull each generation's youth farther away from hope.
''There is a growing fear that the drug cancer is metastasizing and it's really impacting on the young children,'' said Zalreth P. McCreath, the director of the Randall Early Learning Center, a few yards from the site of the shooting. ''It's clear that the whole family unit has broken down and what's caused it seems to be drugs.''
In Preston's case, it is hard to know whether drugs were the cause or the effect.
 
From Shelter to Project
Preston was the fourth of Ruth Simmons's seven children, who range in age from 18 years to 15 months. An eighth child died as an infant.
Ms. Simmons dropped out of high school in 11th grade, when she first got pregnant. Preston's father, Ms. Simmons said, was an abusive drug user who wandered in and out of her life, often entering through a smashed window or door.
During the two years that they lived together, he regularly beat her and the children, Ms. Simmons said. Eventually, Ms. Simmons got a protective court order prohibiting the man from seeing his children.
Ms. Simmons and her family spent a number of years crowded into her mother's two-bedroom apartment. They moved into a shelter in Queens in the summer of 1988 before moving into their four-bedroom apartment at Castle Hill 15 months ago.
Unemployed for the last six years, Ms. Simmons has received a welfare check since 1969 when she first became pregnant. She gets a check for $235.55 every two weeks, which is supplemented by a $371 monthly check for one of her sons, who has a mental disability. She pays $266 a month in rent at Castle Hill.
 
Gunfire Is Commonplace
About one-fourth of the 2,025 families living at Castle Hill are on full welfare, saidVal Coleman, a spokesman for the New York City Housing Authority. The average family income at the 14-building complex is $11,022. More than 7,000 people live there now, with almost half of them under the age of 21.
The project is a complex of 12-story buildings clustered around playgrounds and courtyards. Most of the apartments are spacious, but the elevators smell of urine and the tile hallways are marred with graffiti.
Residents report that the project is overrun with crack dealers. Gunfire from roofs and windows has become commonplace and there have been four homicides this year.
 
Life Is Cheap
One killing took place only a month and a half before Preston's death, when 17-year-old Jamal Graham was shot twice with a .32-caliber automatic. Police have labeled the killing a territorial drug dispute and have charged a 20-year-old man from another housing project in the shooting.
''People are dying over jackets, drugs, money, even the way you look at people,'' said Crystal McNeill, a 17-year-old Castle Hill resident who knew both Preston and Jamal. ''For $5, they'll shoot you in your head.''
Before the emergence of crack, Castle Hill was a relatively quiet place, said Anthony Butler, who is 24. He remembers when his mother would plant a beach chair in the grass in the late afternoon and spend much of the evening there.
Now the Butlers, like many residents, spend most of their time locked in their seventh-floor apartment, watching music videos, preparing meals, and peering through grime-stained windows at a view of the Empire State Building framed between two other Castle Hill high-rises.
Because Preston Simmons was a broad-shouldered and self-reliant youth, he had been called ''Little Man'' since childhood. He was friendly and outgoing, often playing the role of the family clown. He also was susceptible to peer pressure, according to his sister, Natasha.
His was a life devoid of positive role models or heroes, said his mother and friends. After learning some elementary karate moves from a friend, he lined the walls of his bedroom with magazine pictures of Ninja warriors.
Because he was hyperactive, Preston was enrolled in a special education class at Intermediate School 174. His teacher, Norman A. Washington, described Preston as an average student who rarely skipped school, who did his homework, and who showed respect for authority. ''He seemed to have a good self image,'' Mr. Washington said. ''He had an elastic ego. He didn't get hurt easily.''
Preston began selling marijuana after meeting his supplier last summer, according to friends and family members. Along with several other boys working for the same man, he stationed himself in a playground near the spot where he was killed.
On a good day, he would sell 20 to 30 bags for $5 each and would keep $1.50 for each bag sold, Anthony and Denise Butler said. Occasionally he would keep some marijuana for his own use, but his sister and friends said he preferred a Heineken beer to a joint.
Ms. Simmons said she was not aware of her son's drug dealing.
 
Keeping Up With 'the Styles'
Preston spent his money on food and gifts for Denise, and for pricey clothing and shoes. ''Young people like to keep up with the styles and it's expensive to keep up,'' said Mr. Butler. ''These are low-income projects here and your parents can't get you everything the other kids have.''
Since Preston's death, both his family and Denise's family have found special meaning in the coming birth of Denise's baby. They seem unfazed by the prospect of another generation of fatherless children living a life of destitution and danger.
''Little Man is gone but he's left something behind,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''We hope it's a boy so he can keep his name. We loved Little Man a lot. Since he's not here any longer we all will have something to remember him by.''

HEADLINE: Oil, a Foundation of Alaska, Works to Rebuild Its Image

BYLINE: By RICHARD MAUER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE, Nov. 28

 BODY:
For four days last month, the State of Alaska refused to allow an oil tanker to discharge her cargo at a refinery 100 miles south of here in Kenai. In a state that owes its prosperity and indeed its existence in large part to oil, the event was a jarring one.
But it symbolized a shift in the psychology of Alaska and its citizens, a new skepticism shaking an old faith in the virtues of oil.
But the keepers of the old faith have shown in word and deed that they do not accept the change as inevitable or irreversible. With some public opinion polls showing a renewal of good feelings toward the oil industry as memories of last spring's disastrous spill fade, the oil companies have aggressively joined the fight for the trust of Alaskans. 
Oil brought Alaska its statehood and later its low taxes, schools, roads, theaters, jobs, a vibrant economy and an annual dividend check of more than $800 for each citizen.
Lobbyists who campaigned against raising taxes on oil production and regulating its development found allies among residents who were the industry's beneficiaries. Over the years, the arguments of the industry resounded among Alaska's ''boomers,'' that vocal segment of the population for whom development assumed the significance of a spiritual quest.
Historians here say that changes in Alaska's boom mentality were apparent even before March 24, when the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Prince William Sound and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of oil. But they say the environmental disaster wrought by the spill was an event that has shifted politics and, more fundamentally, the way Alaskans think about their environment and how industry should be allowed to operate in it.
''Oil is now suspected,'' said Stephen Haycox, a professor of state history at the University of Alaska in Anchorage. ''Before, there was trust in oil - grudging trust, willing trust, but guarded. It's much more than guarded now. I think it's resentful.''
This new skepticism was evident last month when the state's Department of Environmental Conservation refused to allow the tanker Sansinena II, owned by the Unocal Corporation, to discharge her cargo. The ship lay at anchor in Cook Inlet south of here while her owners scrambled to provide the state with an acceptable plan for cleaning up oil spills.
 
A Change in Enforcement
Ships lacking such plans are nothing new. Most of the 15 tanker companies active in the Valdez trade, including Exxon Shipping Company, had no plans in place before March 24.
But enforcing the longstanding law requiring cleanup plans is a change. Two weeks before the Kenai-bound tanker was forced to anchor, the state notified all the companies that pick up oil at Valdez that they must have contingency plans by Nov. 13 or be barred. All the companies have since filed the plans.
''I see the Cook Inlet situation as being indicative of change in Alaska that parallels change nationally,'' said Dennis Kelso, Alaska's Commissioner of Environmental Conservation. ''I think Alaskans are going to want to have the deciding vote in what kind of risk they accept, whether from tanker traffic in Cook Inlet or exposure to waste materials on the Kenai Peninsula from drilling waste, or other sources.''
Mr. Kelso's agency and the Coast Guard, have been criticized by those who saw failure to protect the state against a spill and to make sure industry could clean up a spill. Mr. Kelso, in turn, has said the State Legislature has consistently failed to provide the money his agency needed.
 
'What a Betrayal'
Claus-M. Naske, the author of the standard text on Alaska history and a professor of history at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, says the March spill changed attitudes, perhaps forever.
''What a disaster, what a betrayal of the Alaskan people, what a failure of Alaska State Government and the Legislature,'' he said. ''But the upside of it was that it finally broke the power of the unholy 11 in the State Senate.'' The majority in the 20-member Senate has effectively blocked higher oil taxes and regulation for most of a decade.
That coalition collapsed in the months after the spill, when oil-production taxes were raised, more money was appropriated for the environmental agency and even the most ardent backers of industry backed tougher standards.
Oil's singular place in Alaska had much to do with breaking the hold that the canned-salmon industry and its legendary lobbyist, W. C. Arnold, had on the territorial Senate before Alaska joined the union in 1959. The canneries, based in Seattle, fought statehood, fearing new taxes and a loss of access to the fishing grounds. Until the mid-1950's, when oil was discovered on the Kenai Peninsula 80 miles south of Anchorage, the canneries had been persuading Congress that Alaska would remain an economic burden, demanding ever greater Federal subsidies if it became a state. Epitome of Capitalism? Although public opinion polls over the years have shown that an overwhelming majority of Alaskans had ''positive'' feelings about the oil industry, Professor Haycox ascribed those sentiments to admiration of achievement, not to a deeply rooted affection of the type found in oil states like Texas.
''It's not so much a love affair with oil, because there isn't much drilling for oil up here by wildcatters, and there's not that much direct investment in oil,'' Mr. Haycox said. ''I think people saw oil in the most heroic of terms, betting the company and investing all of the resources in an economic gamble, so that if the gamble fails, the company is wiped out. It's sort of the epitome of Western capitalist success.''
But in teaching his class on Alaska's living history, Mr. Naske has invited some of the older generation of boomers to lecture - and has found that his students see them as ''quaint'' relics from a bygone era.
 
Different Perceptions on Attitudes
The two poll takers who monitor Alaskan opinion agree that attitudes changed sharply with the spill, but they dispute how long the effect will last.
David Dittman, whose clients include Atlantic Richfield, the state's second-biggest oil producer, said the percentage of people who believe oil has been a positive force has rebounded to within about five percentage points of the pre-spill level. ''There really hasn't been much of a change that is long-lasting,'' Mr. Dittman said. But Marc Hellenthal, who does not work for the major oil companies, said the popularity of oil remained relatively low. He said a poll he took in late summer for the Alaska Federation of Natives showed a that higher percentage of the state liked environmental organizations than the oil industry.
Mr. Hellenthal said his research does not provide many clues on how lasting the changes will be. But he recalled that the industry has begun a new advertising campaign after months of silence over the summer. Whose Dream Is Sung? Last month, Atlantic Richfield began televising a commercial that intersperses shots of oil developments with farmers, rugged loggers, and a boy riding a horse on a beach. The song in the background extolling ''the Alaska Dream'' is so catchy that people have written for sheet music.
The Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, the manager of the pipeline and the Valdez terminal and industry's first line of defense against a spill in Prince William Sound, is preparing a series of newspaper advertisements it hopes will restore some of its credibility.
And changes in Alyeska's management appear to be having results. Riki Ott of Cordova District Fishermen United, a biologist who is one of Alyeska's long-time critics, says that Alyeska's new manager for environmental issues, Mike Williams, has been so friendly and open that he has disarmed some opposition.
Last week the state's biggest and most influential oilfield-service companies, Veco International, took another step toward insuring a platform for its views when it announced it was buying The Anchorage Times. The Times, a privately owned afternoon daily that was once the state's dominant newspaper, has been steadily losing circulation to its morning rival, The Anchorage Daily News, and is widely believed to have been in danger of closing.
 
One Man's Newspaper
Robert Atwood, The Times publisher for more than 50 years, has been unabashed in his support for the oil industry; he has owned oil leases himself on the Kenai Peninsula. At a recent press conference, Mr. Atwood said he believed a newspaper ''should be an integral part of a community, not a separate entity sitting on the sidelines at a tennis match.''
Veco was the prime contractor in the billion-dollar oil spill cleanup. Its majority owner, Bill Allen, said he planned to invigorate The Times but not change its outlook.
Recovering some measure of political influence is important for the industry. The new taxes and regulations passed after the spill are expected to cost it more than $2 billion over the next two decades. As a result, ''the investment attraction of Alaska has dimmed perceptively for the industry,'' said Benjamin M. Rice Jr., an analyst with the Brown Brothers Harriman investment company.
Mr. Hellenthal said Arco's commercials are a masterly attempt to regain some of the lost influence. ''It's classical conditioning,'' he said. ''It's got a nice warm feeling, and then they pair it with oil.''

HEADLINE: Prominent Rightist Slain in El Salvador

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, one of this country's most prominent right-wing politicians, was shot to death today outside a fast-food restaurant here.
The former justice, Francisco Jose Guerrero, 64 years old, was shot in the throat at 9:40 A.M. by four gunmen on foot as he rode on a downtown street with two bodyguards in his Volvo, spokesmen for the armed forces said.
No one immediately took responsibility for the killing. But the logic of political violence in El Salvador made the most likely assassins leftist guerrillas, who had tried to kill him seven years ago. 
 
One Attacker Reported Slain
The police said one attacker was killed by Mr. Guerrero's bodyguards. The assailant, who the police said was an urban guerrilla, appeared to be in his late 20's and was dressed in civilian clothes.
There was also circumstantial evidence indicating that left-wing insurgents killed Mr. Guerrero, who was the president of the legislature from 1962 to 1968 and the Foreign Minister from 1968 to 1971. While a member of the Supreme Court, he was the architect of an important ruling that blocked an investigation into the 1980 assassination of Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero of San Salvador.
In an interview earlier this year, Joaquin Villalobos, the top rebel commander, said guerrillas had killed Roberto Garcia Alvarado, the attorney general, because of his role in blocking the inquiry into the murder, which has repeatedly been linked to the governing party.
Mr. Guerrero, a conservative landowner known as Chachi, was an unsuccessful presidential candidate in 1984 for the National Conciliation Party, a group closely linked to the armed forces, which had ruled this country for a quarter of a century before a 1979 coup by junior officers bent on change. Political violence that erupted that year between leftist and rightist groups has grown into a civil war that has killed about 70,000 people. Backed by the C.I.A. Mr. Guerrero, who had served as a behind-the-scenes adviser to the United States Embassy, was secretly supported in his presidential campaign by the United States Central Intelligence Agency in an attempt to split rightist votes and insure that the candidate favored by Washington, Jose Napoleon Duarte of the Christian Democrats, triumphed over Roberto d'Aubuisson, an extreme rightist who was considered politically unacceptable to the American Congress.
Moderate critics often pointed to Mr. Guerrero as one of the men most responsible for blocking social, political and economic change.
Mr. Guerrero represented the 14 families that formed the nation's oligarchy and other large landowners who thwarted efforts in the mid-1970's to break up the country's tight concentration of property owners.
Mr. Guerrero's party and its historical allies in the armed forces have often been accused of stealing the 1972 election from Mr. Duarte. The controversy over that vote, which provoked widespread feeling that it was impossible to change the society through peaceful methods, went a long way to set the stage for the political violence that followed.
Mr. Guerrero's term on the Supreme Court had ended earlier this year, and he was no longer a member of the Government's inner circle. But in recent weeks, Mr. Guerrero's party had formed an alliance with the governing party to enact legislation that gives the army and the Government sweeping power to suppress dissent.
 
Earlier Killings
The killing of Mr. Guerrero followed several attacks on the homes and families of senior army officers. In addition, during the last year the rebels have killed several political leaders linked with extreme rightists.
The rebel attacks have already brought retaliation. The security forces, which are linked to the death squads that slaughtered almost anyone who dared organize or even criticize in the early 1980's, have cracked down on church groups and religious organizations.
 
Ortega Won't Comment on Plane
MANAGUA, Nicaragua, Nov. 28 (Reuters) - President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has declined to comment on accusations that Nicaragua sent antiaircraft missiles to Salvadoran rebels.
''The problem here is not of denying or accepting charges,'' Mr. Ortega told reporters Monday. ''I am not on trial. We are facing a political problem promoted by the United States.''
Mr. Ortega made his remarks while being questioned about Salvadoran charges that a light aircraft that crashed in El Salvador on Saturday had taken off from Nicaragua with weapons for the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.

Europeans Ask U.S. Not to Reach Understanding on Troop Cuts Yet

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Western European defense ministers asked the Bush Administration today not to reach any understandings about American and Soviet troop cuts when President Bush meets this weekend with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union.
The European concerns were expressed to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney during a closed-door meeting at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's headquarters here and in private individual meetings between Mr. Cheney and NATO defense ministers.
''The message of the Europeans is don't do unilateral things,'' said a Western European defense official. ''Be cautious. Don't be hasty.'' ''In the back of our mind, we remember Reykjavik,'' the official said, referring to the summit meeting between President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev during which the two leaders came close to an agreement on drastic cuts in ballistic missiles before the talks collapsed over American plans for a space-based anti-missile defense. 
 
U.S.-Soviet Understanding Feared
Even though the Bush Administration has repeatedly said it will not try to strike an arms control agreement at the summit meeting off Malta on Saturday and Sunday, British, West German and other Western European defense officials have been concerned that Washington plans to use the summit in a subtler fashion to lay the groundwork for further troop cuts.
Bush Administration officials have said, for example, that Mr. Bush may engage in ''philosophical'' or ''conceptual'' discussions with the Mr. Gorbachev about lower troop levels in Europe. American officials say publicly that this is in keeping with Mr. Bush's desire to have a wide-ranging discussion with Mr. Gorbachev about the implications of change in Eastern Europe. Some West European officials fear, however, that the ''philosophical'' discussions will be a cover to explore an informal superpower understanding about future cuts without prior consultation with NATO.
The European worries have been aggravated by reports that the Pentagon is already considering troop cuts in Europe to alleviate severe pressures on the military budget, and by recent comments by Mr. Cheney. En route to the NATO meeting here, Mr. Cheney publicly encouraged Moscow to go beyond the cuts contemplated in the emerging East-West pact to cut conventional arms, suggesting that the United States would reciprocate after consulting with its allies.
 
Adding Fuel to the Fire
A statement on Monday by the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, that the two leaders would hold discussions on ''arms control and military force structure'' added fuel to the fire.
Mr. Cheney sought to ease European concerns here today by reaffirming Administration pledges that Mr. Bush would not present detailed proposals for troop cuts, and by saying the United States planned to maintain a sizable military presence in Europe for the foreseeable future.
But a Western European official who attended the closed-door meeting today said differences between Mr. Cheney's approach on conventional arms and that of some Western Europeans were apparent in several areas.
Mr. Cheney, for example, is reported to have spelled out a faster timetable for carrying out a agreement to reduce conventional arms than did some Western Europeans. The West German Defense Minister, Gerhard Stoltenberg, is reported to have said it would take five to seven years to carry out such an agreement - an estimate based on the large quantities of equipment to be destroyed under the accord and by the difficulties that Moscow is likely to encounter in discharging a large number of troops into the civilian economy.
Mr. Cheney, however, is reported to have said that he thought such an agreement could be carried out in two or three years.

An Outline of German History

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:

1815 After the Congress of Vienna redrew the map of Europe with the defeat of Napoleon, the main German states grouped themselves into a loose association of 39 kingdoms, duchies, principalities and free cities known as the German Confederation. It was dominated by Prussia and Austria.
 
1834 The states formed a German Customs Union with free trade, which brought economic growth. With Austria staying aloof from the union, Prussia eventually emerged as the dominant German power. 
 
1866 After defeating Austria in the Seven Weeks' War and driving it out of the confederation, Prussia created a North German federation north of the Main River.
 
1871 Otto von Bismarck, chancellor in the new federation, used the patriotic fervor aroused by Prussia's defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War to persuade the southern states to join the North German federation. The Second German Empire, with King William I of Prussia as Emperor and Bismarck as its ''Iron Chancellor,'' was proclaimed Jan. 18, 1871, at Versailles, near Paris. It embraced four kingdoms, five grand duchies, 12 duchies and principalities, and the three Hanseatic free cities.
 
1918 The new Reich, which initially stretched along the whole Baltic coast as far as Memel in present-day Soviet Lithuania, did not survive Germany's defeat in World War I. The Weimar Republic, proclaimed in 1919, adopted a federal structure with a central government far stronger than in imperial times.
 
1933 The instability of the Weimar Republic opened the way for the rise of Hitler and his totalitarian Nazi ideology stressing nationalism, anti-Communism and anti-Semitism that led to the Holocaust in which millions of Jews and others were killed. Under the Third Reich, Hitler's aggressive expansionism led to the outbreak of World War II.
 
1945 After the defeat of Hitler, modern East and West Germany grew out of the postwar occupation zones of the four victorious Allies -Britain, France, the Soviet Union and the United States. Their borders, although universally recognized, have never been formally laid down in a peace treaty.

HEADLINE: Aging Baths In Brighton Face Demise

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
These days Jose Ruiz eyes his neighbor across the street, an aging recreational complex sprawled over 15 acres of Brooklyn's Brighton Beach waterfront, and can hardly wait for it to die.
A $275 million condominium project is planned for the site and is expected to bring at least 5,000 new higher-income residents to the area. Mr. Ruiz, the owner of J & I Grocery and Deli at 3212 Coney Island Avenue, figures that would mean a 15 to 20 percent rise in his business. He says he plans to invest $12,000 on two new display cases, add more products and give his store a facelift.
''Once they start building over there I'll start renovating over here,'' he said yesterday. ''I want my store to look good too.'' 
 
'Can't Stop Progress'
The aging recreational complex he wants to see torn down is the Brighton Beach Baths, which has been around since 1919 -the Miami Beach of Brooklyn before there was a Miami Beach. The complex, with 25 paddle-tennis courts and 3 swimming pools, its tiny zinc-roofed cabanas and Beach-Nut Bugle newspaper, its dancing classes and duplicate bridge, has been in decline for years, its members dying off or moving into nursing homes.
''I don't feel too good about it, but what am I going to do?,'' said Al Stone, 82, a club member since 1931 and one of about 20 members using the club yesterday afternoon. ''Can't stop progress. I got my share.''
Steve Alschuler, a spokesman for the developers, said the club was doomed even if the project was not planned. ''The baths are going to close no matter what,'' he said. ''It's not a feasible enterprise anymore.'' But its anachronistic charm has many defenders, and even neighbors who do not remember the heyday of the baths, when the club had 14,000 members instead of 2,000, feel the condominium project set to replace it is too dense and intrusive for the last remaining bit of local shorefront.
The New York City Planning Commission is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the project today at 10 A.M. at City Hall.
The proposal before the seven-member commission is a revised, scaled-down version of one first proposed in 1986. It envisions two 23-story buildings, two 25-story buildings and one 29-story building for a total of 1,730 apartments ranging in size from studios to three-bedroom units.
The project, to be built by Alexander Muss & Sons, who have owned the Brighton Beach Bath and Racquet Club since 1980, would also include doctors' offices, commercial space and a health club.
The apartments would sell for $125,000 to $275,000. Nina Mazur, who is 28 years old and a Brighton Beach resident for eight years, said she fears the changes that so excite Mr. Ruiz. She lives in a $600-a-month studio apartment with her husband and 2-month-old daughter. The couple have been looking for bigger quarters but find everything too expensive.
If the project goes through, she said, ''prices, rent, everything would go up.''
Residents have other concerns. Jean Kreiling of the Committee to Preserve Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach, a group of neighbors who oppose the project, said the new units could bring as many as 7,000 new residents into the area without an accompanying increase in resources. The development would provide 1,856 new parking spaces, for example, but Ms. Kreiling said that was hardly adequate for households that often have two cars.
 
Won't Make It Better
Edith Zuloff, another resident, said she worries more about a deeper change in the character of the neighborhood that she has called home for the last 14 years.
''The only things Brighton has going for it is the beach, the boardwalk and the air,'' she said. ''This is not going to make it better.''
Under the 1986 plan, the project would have had six towers from 24 to 44 stories tall occupying a total of 2.8 million square feet. The new plan is 27 percent smaller, but the developers still need zoning changes that would allow them to change the site from commercial to residential and from a density of 300 units to the proposed 1,730. The site is bordered by Coney Island Avenue, Brighton Beach Avenue and Seacoast Terrace.
Both the developers and the project's supporters say the condominiums would ease a housing shortage and blend with other high-rise buildings in the area. Two of these, the 20-story and 18-story buildings next to the beach club, were also owned by Alexander Muss & Sons before becoming co-ops. The late Alexander Muss's son, Stephen, is the owner of the Fontainbleau Hilton in Miami Beach.
 
'What We're Looking For'
Community Board 13 approved the project in a 30-to-4 vote. The community district manager, Herbert Eisenberg, said the project was needed because economic development in the area was soft, there was too little housing and the local economy was stagnant.
''It keeps some of our kids from going,'' he said. ''My 26-year-old son is moving out of the area. He could afford better housing but can't find any. There are people who could afford it, and that's what we're looking for.''
But Ms. Kreiling said: ''This is New York City's recreational playland and you shouldn't block off the shore with high-rises. We think it's an outrageous zoning request for a waterfront site.''
If the Planning Commission approves it, the project then goes to the city's Board of Estimate for a hearing and a vote. Construction is expected to take five years.

HEADLINE: 2 U.S. Towers At Foley Sq. Will Avoid Review Steps

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Worried that full public review might seriously delay or even derail their plan to build two large civic buildings in lower Manhattan, the Federal Government and New York City have agreed to sidestep that process.
Under legislation signed this month by President Bush, the Government would condemn the two city-owned sites on which the new buildings are to rise, rather than acquire them through a voluntary transfer by the city. The condemnation would be ''friendly,'' not contested or protested by the city.
In that way, the project, a Federal courthouse and a Federal-municipal office building, would not have to go through the city's uniform land-use review procedure, known as Ulurp, which involves the local Community Board, the City Planning Commission and the Board of Estimate. 
 
Announced Two Years Ago
Nor would the plan be affected by changes to the land-use review process that are called for by the recently approved revisions to the City Charter.
''All the parties agreed that only friendly condemnation would make it happen,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York. He has been impatient with the slow progress of the $500 million project, which was announced two years ago and had appeared to be foundering. ''We have basically knocked a year, year and a half, off the process by doing it this way,'' said Deputy Mayor Robert Esnard.
''Without condemnation, we would not have a certainty of any building being built there,'' said William J. Diamond, regional administrator of the Federal General Services Administration, which is overseeing the project. ''We would not know what would happen in Ulurp. More importantly, we were very afraid that with the charter's being a new one, no one knows exactly how it will work.''
Now, he said, ''there is no chance that a municipally driven process is going to destroy'' the project, which he described as the largest civilian development currently being undertaken by the Federal Government. He said he expected the buildings to be completed in ''the second Bush Administration.''
The two towers, on either side of Foley Square, would be built by one or more developers and purchased by the Government on a 30-year installment plan. Together, they would contain more than 1.5 million square feet, or one and a half times the size of the Chrysler Building. The Government said it did not expect that either tower would be more than 30 stories tall.
 
Compensation From Developers
One tower would be directly behind the New York County Courthouse at 60 Centre Street, between Worth and Pearl Streets. In its 740,000 square feet would be more than 40 Federal courtrooms, judges' chambers and space for court clerks, marshals, probation offices and the United States Attorney.
The other tower would be at 290 Broadway, between Duane and Reade Streets. It would have 400,000 square feet for Federal offices and 400,000 square feet for city offices.
The sites are now used mostly for parking.
Under the original terms, the city was to have conveyed the land to the Federal Government in return for a credit on the rent for office space in the new building on Broadway. Under the new agreement, the land would be condemned under eminent domain and the city would be compensated not by the Federal Government, but by the developers. The value of the land has not been established.
''While there is a condemnation, we are working with the city and, as best as we can, with community groups,'' Mr. Diamond said. ''It doesn't mean we're throwing out environmental concerns. We're not using condemnation to massively build a site that we couldn't otherwise. And it's not being used to avoid zoning.''
 
Plea From Community Board
Indeed, Mr. Diamond said, the size of the planned courthouse had been reduced, from 800,000 square feet. He added that the Government was ''committed to working with the city to improve Foley Square.''
Community Board 1 has objected to bypassing the review. Its chairman, James A. Stratton, wrote to Mr. Diamond that the board ''considers its participation in the Ulurp process one of its most important and significant functions'' and that it is ''not prepared to waive this opportunity to review and speak out on these two new buildings.''
The president of the Municipal Art Society, Kent L. Barwick, said the existing Jacob K. Javits Federal Building at 26 Federal Plaza, long criticized as being too large and having a brutal architectural style, was a troubling indication of what the Government would do if left unchecked.
''There is nothing in the past performance of the Federal Government at Foley Square to give anybody any confidence that the results will be anything less than disastrous,'' Mr. Barwick said. ''Nobody can blame anyone for wanting to avoid Ulurp. But the last people you'd want to see in charge of alterations to the Civic Center are the Federal Government.''

HEADLINE: Small College Shifts Focus To Minorities and the 90's

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BLOOMFIELD, N.J., Nov. 28

 BODY:
Working in a factory alongside his father was an option that Luis Rivera of Passaic always had but never wanted. His dream was to go to college, learn all he could about computers, work for a big corporation and, someday, own the business.
Now, with the help of a full scholarship and a special program at Bloomfield College intended to help minority students enter the state's post-industrial work force, Mr. Rivera is taking the first steps toward his goal.
''I plan to live up to the dream,'' the 17-year-old said. 
Long shut out of New Jersey's economic mainstream, Hispanic and black workers were hired in record numbers during the 1980's and will make up a growing portion of the labor force in the next decade, recent Federal statistics show.
 
'Missed Opportunities'
But analysts say that unless more young people like Mr. Rivera receive the substantially higher level of education and training needed to hold a job in today's sophisticated information-handling economy, New Jersey and the metropolitan region might not have enough workers.
''With all the achievements of the 1980's, the decade was also a period of missed opportunities,'' said Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the Federal Department of Labor.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said that New Jersey created more than 750,000 jobs, most in business services or retail trade, during the 1980's. But in the same period it lost 133,000 factory positions that traditionally had been filled by people with few or no professional skills. The 1980 census found that 34 percent of black workers and 52 percent of Hispanic workers had not finished high school.
Mr. Ehrenhalt said it was that lack of education that kept many more minority workers from taking advantage of the state's economic boom and will continue to hamper them in the 1990's.
 
Change in Emphasis
Capitalizing on the pending demand for workers will take special education initiatives and a renewed effort on the part of government, business and schools to integrate minorities into the job market, Mr. Ehrenhalt said.
Such efforts are under way here at Bloomfield College, a 121-year-old liberal arts institution that over the last few years has been reorganized to help financially and academically disadvantaged minority students prepare for the work place of the future.
''If we turn our backs on the thousands and thousands of students whose S.A.T. test scores fall below 800, we turn our backs on the students upon which the future of New Jersey rests,'' said Dr. John F. Noonan, the president of Bloomfield College for the last three years.
 
Transforming the School
The college's location makes it a suitable site for an experiment in minority education. It is a mile and half north of Newark and not far from other large urban areas like East Orange and Irvington, and many of its students come from those cities. About half of the institution's 1,600 full- and part-time students are members of minorities, the highest percentage of any of the state's 16 independent colleges and universities.
Scores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test range from a minimum of 400 to a high of 1,600.
When he arrived from Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y., in 1986, Dr. Noonan set in motion the transformation of Bloomfield from a traditional liberal arts school with a sharply declining enrollment to what he calls a multi-cultural contemporary institution serving the surrounding population.
The most direct way of helping those students was to help them find work in New Jersey's new economy, which may need as many as 100,000 more workers by 1995.
 
A Lot of Hiring
The tight labor market has been building. According to recent Federal statistics, the number of New Jersey residents in the labor force rose by 437,000 between 1979 and the first nine months of 1989, far less than the 750,000 new jobs that were created. Immigrants from other states and nations filled the remaining jobs.
The shortage led businesses to hire minority-group members at a rate greater than ever before. Black and Hispanic workers constituted 44 percent of the 437,000 people who joined the labor force. As a result, the unemployment rate for black and Hispanic workers was halved during the 1980's, dropping to the current rate of 6.9 percent. But that rate remains twice as high as the 3.5 percent rate for white workers. In 1979, it was roughly the same - the unemployment rate for minorities was double that of whites.
The jobs these minority-group members took were not limited to low-paying positions at McDonald's, Mr. Ehrenhalt said. But Federal statistics show that 34 percent of white workers in New Jersey are employed in managerial, professional or technical jobs, compared with 19 percent of black workers and 19 percent of Hispanic workers.
Last year, Bloomfield College received a $1.8 million challenge grant from the state to establish an extensive program to attract black and Hispanic students who might otherwise not have even considered going to college.
 
Studying Leadership
The program establishes an executive-in-residence, who this year is Cyrus R. Holley, chief operating officer of Englehard Industries. It also includes a four-year leadership development program, in which select students, including Mr. Rivera, receive help as they study leadership styles and skills they will need in business.
Along with courses in his major, computer information systems, Mr. Rivera attends special leadership seminars. In his second year he will be assigned a mentor, an off-campus volunteer already working in the computer field. The third year he will spend up to 20 hours a week working as an intern in a business. He will also attend leadership seminars with Dr. Noonan. In his senior year he will become a mentor for a freshman.
Sometimes it takes more than financial aid and seminars. For Isabel Londono of Newark, who emigrated from Colombia in 1983, it also took an on-campus job, a flexible class schedule and long hours learning English.
''It was all very hard, very difficult,'' said Ms. Londono, who is 46 and the mother of twin teen-age boys who live with her in a Newark housing project.
Last May she graduated with honors with a degree in business administration.
Bloomfield College's new emphasis on job training and technical skills has raised questions about the mission of an institution of higher learning. There is concern that entrance standards might be lowered too far, and that too much attention might be paid to the needs of the work place at the expense of subjects like history and literature.

HEADLINE: Neediest Cases Drive Is Off To Better Start Than in 1988

BYLINE: By NADINE BROZAN

 BODY:
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund campaign for 1989-1990 opened on Sunday, and $1,303,381.21 has been collected. That is a substantial increase over the $1,168,040 that had been collected by the same time last year.
''Getting off to so impressive a start is particularly heartwarming at this time of great need,'' the president of the fund, Fred M. Hechinger, said yesterday. ''I hope that it will encourage donors old and new to make this year's drive the most successful ever.'' 
Of the total, $993,726.10, was from estates and trusts. The balance, $309,655.11, was from individuals and organizations, including the Starr Foundation, which donated $150,000, and the Mary J. Hutchins Foundation, which gave $55,000.
Even taking inflation into account, the proceeds of the three-day-old campaign dwarf the total of $3,630.88 that was collected in 1912. That was when Adolph S. Ochs, publisher of The New York Times, started the campaign after a chance encounter with a beggar.
 
From an Original Donor
One of the 117 original donors, Elizabeth L. Weiler of Manhattan, sent a $100 gift this year, carrying on a lifelong tradition.
''The time has come again,'' she wrote in a letter accompanying her contribution. ''I have done this since the very first year that you initiated this fund and hope to continue for a good number of years. I am now in my 85th year and look forward to a few more to enjoy life's blessings.''
Arthur D. Tenenholtz of Brooklyn, who wrote a check for $40 to the fund on Thanksgiving Day, said: ''At this time of year I receive many solitications from New York's cultural institutions. As worthy as those institutions may be, their letters remind me of The Times's Neediest Cases Fund, which never sends me solicitations.''
Some ties between cultural organizations and the fund do exist, as exemplified by $75 sent in September by di Cagno Inc., a new theater company. ''The enclosed check is from the proceeds of our theatrical production of Harold Pinter's 'The Collection,' '' the president of the troupe, Charles di Cagno, wrote.
The play ran in June at the Kittredge Club for Women on East 39th Street. ''We had a small budget, and we made some profit,'' Mr. di Cagno said yesterday. ''So we forwarded a small check. I would have preferred to send more. I have given to the fund before, and I was prompted by the sight of the homeless to do something this year.''

OPEC decided to revise its quota system in a fundamental way that would give Persian Gulf oil producers a firm grip on the group's prices and production in the next decade. It also agreed to raise its overall production ceiling to 22 million barrels a day for the first six months of next year, up from the current, widely ignored ceiling of 20.5 million barrels. The impact on oil prices is uncertain: the stocks of big U.S. oil companies rose, but oil futures prices fell. [Page D1.]

HEADLINE: OPEC Sets New Policy On Quotas

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: VIENNA, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided tonight to revise its quota system in a fundamental way that would give Persian Gulf oil producers a firm grip on prices and production in the next decade.
It also agreed to raise its overall production ceiling to 22 million barrels a day for the first six months of next year, from the present widely ignored ceiling of 20.5 million barrels.
OPEC's strict adherence to its new and higher quotas is doubtful since its 13 member nations are believed to be producing more than 23 million barrels a day. Indeed, the United Arab Emirates immediately said it would not accept its quota and would continue to overproduce.
 
'A Different Future'
''This meeting was somewhat insignificant in its immediate results, but we have set the first step for a different future,'' said one senior Iranian official who asked not to be identified. 
The new system will give Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, the Emirates and eventually Iran the final say over OPEC policies for years to come.
''After 1991 it is possible that people who will be managing the market will be three or four countries within the oil business,'' said Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister.
While Iran and Iraq are still technically at war, they have observed a truce in the last year and they seem to tacitly agree on demanding a larger share of OPEC production in cooperation with their Persian Gulf neighbors.
 
Dominance in Market
The new system means that as world demand for oil rises, those OPEC nations that possess the largest reserves will take what they please of the growing market and, consequently, set the price of oil as it serves their interests.
News of the OPEC agreement was interpreted on Wall Street as a sign that the price of oil would rise, increasing the value of the inventories of major oil companies. The stock prices of most oil companies were higher in brisk trading. But in the commodity markets, oil prices fell, and analysts there said there was a broad expectation of continued overproduction by OPEC members. [In New York, the chairman of the Phillips Petroleum Company, C. J. Silas, said in a briefing for reporters that he thought the OPEC agreement ''might give some strength to the market.'' He added that he was pleasantly surprised, explaining, ''I thought they might agree to nothing.'' [Mr. Silas added that the price of West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, had averaged $18.50 for this year, and that the international market was such that the price would probably not be much higher for 1990.] Some OPEC countries, like Indonesia, have for the first time recognized their limited ability to produce more oil from their poor reserves, giving the green light to those with enormous reserves, like Kuwait, to fill the void.
 
Output Tied to 'Reality'
''The sensitive thing about this agreement is that it links production for the first time to the reality of oil reserves and the ability to produce it instead of a blanket right to have a larger share for political reasons,'' a senior Arab oil minister who asked not to be identified said in an interview.
Sheik Sabah of Kuwait, echoing a widespread judgment by a number of oil analysts and other oil ministers, said at a news conference tonight at the end of the OPEC meeting that ''the quota issue will lose its relevance in the 90's.''
In raising its ceiling by 1.5 million barrels, OPEC gave a third of the increase to Kuwait, which has been arguing for more than a year that OPEC countries that possess large oil reserves must have a bigger share of oil producion.
Under the accord, Kuwait's share of production went up to 1.5 million barrels a day. In September, OPEC assigned to Kuwait a quota of 1.2 million barrels a day, which Kuwait refused to acknowledge as binding.
 
Emirates Firm on Quota
The Emirates, which has been producing nearly two million barrels a day, twice its present quota, did not participate in the OPEC accord. In rejecting the assigned quota, its officials said they continued to believe that their country must receive a substantially higher share of oil production in OPEC in order to rejoin the quota system they have boycotted for more than two years.
Some OPEC members received proportional increases in their quotas. Others, like Indonesia, whose ability to produce oil is shrinking, received a smaller share. Algeria and Ecuador are other OPEC members whose capacity is believed to be near the saturation point.
Some countries that received proportional increases based on an old and increasingly defunct percentage system are not expected to be able to produce the oil, leaving room for those that can to fill the void.
Other countries that are able to produce more oil but are expected to face financial or physical constraints in doing so over the next few years are Libya, Qatar and Iran.
 
Iran Investment Lags
Iran is expected to join Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Emirates and Iraq in being able to sharply increase production if it makes substantial investments in its oil operations. It has not been able to do that because of a lack of hard currency after war losses in the eight-year conflict with Iraq.
While OPEC's strict adherence to its new quotas is doubtful, virtually all OPEC officials here agreed to develop new methods to deal with their perennial disputes over market shares.
Of the Emirates, Sheik Sabah of Kuwait said, ''We hope as demand increases that we will get them back into the fold.'' That reflected a widespread belief within OPEC that it will increase its share of the world oil market to about half in the next decade, from its current one-third share. Such growth would create enough room within the group to accommodate the competing demands of major producers.
Some oil analysts argued that although in the long run OPEC might be right about its optimistic view of the rising oil demand, it might be rushing too fast to increase its production.
''There is a euphoria in OPEC about the recent price rise they have seen over the past year, but Western economies and Asian economies are slowing down and OPEC may be putting too much oil in the system with this latest agreement,'' said Joseph Story, president of Gulf Consulting Services of Washington, who was observing this meeting. ''I think demand will drop in the spring and this may come as a big shock to them.''
 
Steady Increase Since 1986
Oil prices and demand have risen steadily since 1986. OPEC prices have risen by an average of $6 a barrel over the last year alone, but many analysts said that while this trend might resume eventually as demand for oil continued to grow, it might slow in the coming year.
Nordine Ait-Laoussine, an Algerian oil expert who was an OPEC official for his country, said demand for OPEC oil in the first quarter of 1990 might not exceed 21.5 million barrels a day, while the group will be pumping at least 22 million barrels, plus another million barrels from the Emirates.
''It is an invitation for oil prices to come down,'' Mr. Ait-Laoussine added, ''because this is the first time in years that OPEC is fixing its ceiling of production above, not below, market demand.''
But the OPEC agreement worked out today has a built-in clause that suggests the calling of another meeting if prices drop substantially below the ''reference minimum price of $18 a barrel,'' according to the organization's final communique issued here tonight.
 
Strong Winter Demand Seen
Several ministers said, however, that they believed winter demand for oil would be strong enough to sustain current prices. Furthermore, they added, a number of other independent oil producers, notably the Soviet Union, were experiencing financial, political and physical constraints on their production that might create room for any excess OPEC production.
One key minister said the economic problems of the Soviet Union and the Eastern European bloc were becoming so severe that the average total exports of the Communist bloc countries of about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day might be substantially cut this year.
Some countries within OPEC are not expected to be able to produce their full allocation of oil under the accord either. Bahman Karbassioun, a former OPEC economist and independent consultant, said Algeria, for instance, would not be able to produce 50,000 barrels of the 827,000 barrels a day it had been allocated.
 
Doubt on Output Abilities
He also noted that Indonesia would not be able to produce 100,000 barrels a day of its new larger share of 1,374,000 barrels a day. Libya will also be unable, in Mr. Karbassioun's view, to pump all the 1,233,000 barrels a day it has been allocated, and Iran may have a shortfall of 140,000 barrels in its allocation of 3,140,000 barrels a day.
''Even if there is an overproduction by some, others will recognize they are hitting their maximum capacity and underproduce their quotas,'' Hisham M. Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oil minister, said in an interview.
Abdallah Bassondan, a senior Saudi economist with his country's OPEC delegation, said: ''The nice thing about this agreement is that it is putting OPEC's capacity to the test. Some countries are about to find out that they may be unable to produce their new quotas. Then we will have a new ball game.''

HEADLINE: Hard Choices for Arms Makers

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Spending cuts being contemplated by the Pentagon for the 1990's could bring profound changes in the weapons business.
The cuts could reshape an industry in which the Pentagon and Congress have historically kept open certain weapons factories and laboratories even when they are no longer needed, simply to preserve jobs and hedge against any future war. Instead, some contractors now face years of shrinking profits and a growing likelihood of being forced out of businesses like airplane making and shipbuilding, where the military's reduced needs could be met by fewer companies.
Analysts, Government officials and industry executives also say that some of the biggest contractors would pursue a host of survival strategies, including taking on more work historically done by subcontractors or deliberately underbidding on programs just to keep engineers and production lines busy until the day, if it comes, that the arms business turns up again. A few could become takeover targets as Wall Street drives down their stock prices. Some could explore diversification more heavily into nonmilitary fields. 
 
Cutback Seen as a Catalyst
''Our biggest task is the restructuring of the defense industrial base,'' said Robert B. Costello, a former Under Secretary of Defense for acquisitions in the Reagan and Bush Administrations who is now with the Hudson Institute, a research organization. A Pentagon cutback would be ''a catalyst that will focus attention on the issue and allow us to put together concise, coherent policies to best use our capabilities for the benefit of the nation.''
Many experts say widespread spending cuts would also result in increased calls for the Government to take a more active, if yet undefined, role in making sure that companies vital to national security are not forced out of business, that important personnel and vital technologies find a home and that research projects in promising fields continue to be financed.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the armed forces to formulate budgets that would allow a decline in Pentagon spending for the 1991 fiscal year and cuts totaling as much as $180 billion over the three years beginning in 1992, which represents an annual drop averaging 5 percent after accounting for inflation. His request reflected warming relations with the Soviet Union, the political changes in Eastern Europe and the pressure to bring down the budget deficit. The Administration had previously proposed increases of 1 or 2 percent after inflation over those years.
''In the 1990's, we are finally going to have to face the issue of what kind of defense industry we want,'' said Thomas L. McNaugher, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
 
Muddling Along
The weapons industry has been headed toward leaner times since the Reagan Administration's arms buildup reached a peak in 1986, although most companies have managed to muddle along for the last few years, finishing out programs started earlier in the decade.
Even now, few companies have taken radical steps to cope with the likelihood of rapidly declining Pentagon spending, saying it is too soon to predict what impact any budget cuts will have on their programs. Some industry executives say their companies will do just fine without any big strategic changes.
''When you take into account budget deficits, arms control negotiations and Gorby mania, this is something we've been anticipating for a long time,'' said David Wheaton, corporate vice president for program development and planning at the General Dynamics Corporation.
 
Some Losers, Some Winners
The cuts would still hurt though. Smaller Pentagon budgets would put the most pressure on the the builders of expensive aircraft and ships. Further cuts could hasten the demise of the Grumman Corporation on Long Island as a leading aircraft producer, analysts said. Other companies like the Lockheed Corporation would also face struggles to keep producing planes.
There would be some winners as well as losers. Because the armed services would not be able to afford new planes and ships, they would probably turn more frequently to makers of some sophisticated electronics systems that could upgrade and modernize their existing fleets. Most big contractors have expanded their electronics businesses in recent years, especially those like Lockheed and the Rockwell International Corporation that have seen rapid declines in their aircraft business.
Similarly, makers of satellites and other surveillance equipment are expected to do well. Wall Street has particularly high hopes for a company in Dallas called E-Systems Inc. that makes surveillance gear used for arms control verification.
 
Political Factors
While the weeding out of the industry's weaker or excess players has begun in recent years, it has been significantly slowed by political realities.
For example, Congress has continued to finance production of Grumman's F-14 fighter plane even after the Navy asked that the program be ended. The reason was Congressional reluctance to end all major aircraft production at Grumman, the largest employer on Long Island and a repository of knowledge about the design and manufacture of carrier-based fighter planes.
Other companies have already left portions of the business, either by design or because of lack of new business. Rockwell, which built the B-1B bomber earlier in the decade, now has no major military aircraft-production programs. The company is concentrating instead on its commercial businesses and those military-related businesses that show some growth prospects, mostly in satellites and electronics.
 
Adding to Costs per Unit
Even those companies that have and continue to receive big production contracts will suffer as programs are stretched out or scaled back in an attempt to save money. While generally preferable to outright cancellation from the contractor's point of view, stretchouts almost always make production less efficient, increase the per-unit cost of the system and reduce profit margins.
The Northrop Corporation has invested more than $1 billion in developing technical expertise and capacity to build the 132 B-2 bombers the Air Force wants at a rate of 24 to 36 a year. But now the B-2 program seems certain to be scaled back and stretched out. The B-2's per-plane price of $530 million will probably rise, because Northrop will not master the manufacturing process as quickly as it had planned. Northrop's profit margins will suffer, the company's debt load will remain higher than planned and large amounts of space, machinery and skilled personnel will be underutilized.
Faced with a declining military market, most companies, predictably enough, are studying the possibility of diversifying into other businesses. But that route has not been successful for those contractors who have tried it in the past - Rockwell, for example, never learned to make good televisions or refrigerators when it tried a decade ago - and few companies have the financial strength to make an acquisition or start an entirely new business anyway.
 
A Variety of Strategies
Still, said Robert Paulson, a director at the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, prime contractors will pursue a variety of strategies to survive. Some will deliberately underbid on the few contracts available, just to insure that they stay in the business, doing so on the assumption that the Government will later help by giving them more money. Other prime contractors will take on more work historically done by subcontractors, or will farm less work out to subcontractors by making more parts in-house.
Companies are increasingly likely to pursue joint ventures with foreign partners that can supply technologies, designs and access to their home markets. Lockheed recently announced that it would license the design for a jet trainer from Aermacchi S.p.A. of Italy that it will propose for use as the Air Force's next generation of trainers.
As the financial pressures mount, some companies could attract takeover offers. Analysts say Grumman, Northrop and Lockheed are the most logical targets, because all have relatively weak stock prices that would allow an acquirer to purchase their technical expertise at bargain prices. The Boeing Company, which is financially strong because of its booming commercial aircraft business, is one potential acquirer, though it has made no moves in that direction.
''There's no question that budget cuts will force a more rapid consolidation in almost all the subsectors of the weapons industry,'' said William B. Burnett, a vice president at Charles River Associates, an economic consulting firm. ''The question is to what extent the Department of Defense will participate in the consolidation and make sure that valuable defense assets don't just go floating away in the wind.''
 
Fears for Smaller Companies
Much of the concern is focused on the lower tiers of the industry, generally smaller companies that supply prime contractors with sophisticated technology or components. Without a Government effort to protect such companies, many officials say, the nation will increasingly face situations like that in which a unit of the Perkin-Elmer Corporation that makes tools to produce advanced computer chips is likely to be sold to the Nikon Corporation of Japan because efforts to find an American buyer have failed. A sale to Nikon would leave the United States almost wholly dependent on a foreign nation for the production of chips that have widespread military as well as commercial applications.
Some analysts think the Pentagon should decide which contractors ought to survive and should direct contracts toward those companies to insure a smaller but healthier industry. Others think the Pentagon should provide more seed money to private industry, much as the Government is trying to do in backing Sematech, the industry consortium that is working to improve the nation's competitiveness in computer chips.
Mr. McNaugher of Brookings said the Government should finance more research and development without necessarily planning to build the weapons systems that might result.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Shifting Spending To Public Works

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE upheaval in Eastern Europe, with its greater openness to the West, means to many Americans that the United States no longer needs a huge military establishment. The Bush Administration, in fact, is beginning to shrink the $300 billion military budget. But if billions of dollars are diverted from military spending over the next decade, how should the money be spent?
To many people, the answer is that the money should not be spent at all: It should be used to balance the Federal budget and thus revive the economy. If the Government no longer has to borrow so much to finance the deficit, this argument goes, then interest rates will decline. The lower rates will encourage corporations to build new factories and buy machinery on credit. This robust capital spending increases productivity, lowers costs and helps to make exports boom. 
''If we could get $100 billion a year out of defense spending, that would bring long-term interest rates down toward their levels in the 1960's,'' said Charles L. Schultze, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Adjusted for inflation, interest rates averaged 2 percent in the 1960's.
But popular as it is, the goal of reducing the budget deficit runs into a conflicting economic theory. No matter how low interest rates are, companies will not invest in a big way if they cannot hire properly educated workers for their new factories, if they lose money trying to ship goods on rundown highways and if they have to put up with costly irritations like congested airports, or inadequate water and waste disposal systems.
Private investment, in sum, requires an adequate infrastructure, many economists contend. Reflecting this view, Robert Heilbroner, the economic historian, says, ''The single most productive use that we can make of a $100 billion annual reduction in the defense budget is to rebuild the nation's infrastructure.''
Few economists oppose public works spending. Mr. Schultze, for example, says $20 billion of the $100 billion in military budget savings - if that much is actually cut - might go to the infrastructure. But giving it priority over reducing the budget deficit assumes that refurbished public works will generate so much new wealth that a $150 billion annual deficit won't be hard to finance.
The most frequently cited research into infrastructure spending has been done by David Aschauer, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago. He concludes that for every $1 invested in ''core infrastructure'' - streets and highways, water and sewer systems, airports and mass transit - corporations invest 25 cents in plant and equipment, over the long run.
By comparison, Mr. Aschauer says, the private sector would increase capital spending by only 7 or 8 cents for every dollar's reduction in the military budget, absent an offsetting public works outlay. Compounding the problem, the ratio of public works to private capital stock has fallen from a peak of 54 percent in 1964 to just over 40 percent today, Mr. Aschauer said.
Other studies - and the research is still skimpy - support the view that a Government dollar spent on the infrastructure gets more mileage than it does in the military sector. Zvi Griliches, a Harvard economist, for example, found that civilian research into, say, more efficient auto engines, results in three times more growth in the nation's productivity rate than the same amounts spent on developing weapons, such as ballistic missiles.
There are some caveats, of course. Gordon Adams, director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, for example, agrees that public works spending adds to the nation's wealth, but only if the spending is managed properly. The rebuilt highways, for example, must be thick enough to bear the weight of tractor-trailer trucks.
Then there is the short-term problem. The 1970's were another period of cutbacks in military spending, and when the low point was reached in 1976, Pentagon outlays generated only 1.9 million jobs in the private sector, compared with 3.1 million today, according to Richard P. Oliver, a Labor Department economist. ''If you cut one-third of the defense spending in the next decade, one-third of the jobs may be lost,'' he said.
That process is already under way. The General Electric Company, for instance, plans by 1992 to eliminate 10,000 jobs, or 20 percent of the work force, in its aerospace division, mostly devoted to military work. But that does not faze unions. ''The defense industry is turning to offshore procurement and to labor-saving technology,'' said Richard Greenwood, an official of the International Association of Machinists, which represents many military equipment workers. ''The civilian sector is a better bet to generate more jobs in the future.''

HEADLINE: Trade Gap a Bit Wider As Export Growth Lags

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit, after improving for six months, deteriorated slightly, to $27.75 billion, in the third quarter, reflecting flat exports and the nation's appetite for imported goods.
Analysts do not expect much improvement in the near future. Imports may drop somewhat because of a slowing United States economy, they say, but exports also are likely to fall because of a strong dollar and moderating economies overseas. 
The Commerce Department said today that the gap between imports and United States exports edged up by seven-tenths of 1 percent in the July-September quarter, from $27.55 billion in the second quarter. The April-June deficit was the narrowest since a $27.7 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1985.
 
Records in Five Quarters
Imports rose three-tenths of 1 percent, to a record $119.3 billion, while exports rose only two-tenths of 1 percent, to a record $91.6 billion. Both imports and exports have reached record levels in each of the last five quarters.
But analysts worry that exports, which sustained much of the nation's economy last year, will remain unchanged in the months ahead. ''The trade report substantiates what we've already seen,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. ''Export growth simply has flattened out after booming previously and is a major source of the wave of weakness rippling through the United States economy, particularly the manufacturing sector.''
A stronger dollar makes American goods more expensive and thus less competitive overseas, while making imported goods cheaper and thus more attractive to buyers in the United States.
 
Increase in Oil Imports
Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., said the trade deficit would be aggravated by the high level of oil imports.
The Commerce Department said the average number of barrels imported daily increased by 8.5 percent in the third quarter, to 8.65 million barrels, the highest level since the third quarter of 1977. But despite the increase, oil imports showed a July-September numerical decrease of 1 percent because of lower prices. The average price per barrel fell to $16.85, from $18.46.
Non-oil imports rose five-tenths of 1 percent, to $106 billion, led by consumer goods, including clothing and household goods. Imports of industrial supplies and materials fell, while both capital goods and automotive products were virtually unchanged.
 
Bolstered by Capital Goods
Non-farm exports increased by 2 percent, to a record $81.8 billion. The sector was bolstered by shipments of capital goods, including aircraft and parts to Western Europe, Japan and newly industrialized countries in Asia.
For the first nine months of the year, the overall deficit was running at an annual rate of $111.6 billion, down 12.3 percent from the $127.2 billion trade deficit registered in all of 1988.
Today's report on merchandise trade, which is calculated on a balance-of-payments basis, is slightly different from the Commerce Department's monthly merchandise trade reports because it excludes United States military sales to foreign governments and makes other minor adjustments in the monthly figures.

HEADLINE: U.S. Awards Computer Contract

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
The Thinking Machines Corporation said today that it had received a $12 million contract from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to develop the first supercomputer capable of speeds of a trillion operations a second, the level of computer performance researchers believe will be necessary to solve the most difficult scientific problems.
Thinking Machines is a computer maker based in Cambridge, Mass., that has designed its supercomputer around thousands of small processors that work in parallel. This approach differs from the route taken by such traditional supercomputer companies as the Cray Research Corporation, which build computers based on only a few processors and concentrate on making each processor as fast as possible. 
A computer capable of a trillion operations a second has recently become the Holy Grail of the supercomputing industry after a Government panel reported that such performance would be necessary to solve 20 ''grand challenges '' - the thorniest scientific problems. These include creating models of the earth's weather patterns that would enable much more sophisticated long-range forecasting.
 
Speedier Operations
Such computing power would enable operations to be performed as much as 500 times more quickly than on existing supercomputers, which reach speeds of several billion operations a second.
The Thinking Machines contract comes at a time when the Pentagon research agency has been embroiled in a controversy over what the Government's role should be in supporting research that would help United States high-technology industries compete against Japanese and European companies.
In recent years, Darpa, as the agency is known, has been the Government coordinator of efforts to enhance national competitiveness in semiconductors, high-definition television and computing. But in recent weeks there have been indications that some of President Bush's advisers believe that the Government's role in such efforts should be restricted.
The supercomputer business has also become more risky recently. This year two major American efforts to design supercomputers, by ETA Systems, a subsidiary of the Control Data Corporation, and Evans & Sutherland, a start-up venture, have each announced a withdrawal from the field.
And Cray, the world's leading maker of supercomputers, split into two companies this year because it could not meet the costs of all of its development efforts.
At a news conference here, several of the agency's executives said Darpa's financing role in the supercomputing field did not raise broader industrial policy issues.
''Darpa has a clear mission to avoid technology surprises,'' said Stephen Squires, the chief scientist of Darpa's information technology office. He said Darpa was currently supporting a number of private and university efforts in new supercomputing technologies.
 
Japanese Deal Likely
More than 40 Thinking Machines computers, known as Connection Machines, have been sold to private and government agencies as well as to Europe, The company said it would announce its first sale to Japan soon.
Thinking Machines is controversial in the supercomputing business. ''We can't find any real progress in harnessing the power of thousands of processors,'' said Neil Davenport, the president of the Cray Computer Corporation, a spinoff of Cray Research that was founded by Seymour Cray earlier this year.
Mr. Davenport said he believed that such parallel computers were only useful on a limited class of scientific and engineering problems.
The Thinking Machines CM-2 computer uses 64,000 processors. The new machine, which will not be ready until the mid-1990's, will have as many as a million processors and will cost as much as $80 million to develop, said Danny Hillis, the company's co-founder and chief scientist.

HEADLINE: Boskin Sees Lower Rates

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
Michael Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said today that he expected interest rates to fall a bit further, spurring increased consumer demand for durable goods.
''It's likely there will be a little bit further fall,'' Mr. Boskin said at the Agriculture Department's 1990 outlook conference. 
Economists have grown confused in recent days by the actions of the Federal Reserve, and interest rates in the credit markets have moved erratically this week.
Mr. Boskin said that recent sluggishness in the economy could be attributed partly to higher interest rates earlier this year and that, as rates continued to fall, the economy would pick up.
He also said the Government on Wednesday would probably revise upward the 2.5 percent third-quarter gross national product figures it reported previously.
He said the Administration was forecasting long-term economic growth of 3 percent after inflation.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 7.04 as Light Trading Continues

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices rose moderately yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing above 2,700, after languishing in a slightly higher range throughout most of the session.
''The Dow's close of 2,702.01, was at a critical market area,'' said Robert B. Ritter, the chief technical analyst at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company in New York. ''Stock prices advanced despite investor confusion primarily resulting from conflicting monetary policy moves by the Federal Reseve Board.''
Mr. Ritter said that while the outlook for interest rates and the economy were dominating the market, the forthcoming summit meeting between President Bush and the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, was attracting widening interest and helping lift stocks. 
''A better definition of the 'peace dividend' might develop from these discussions and have a major impact on the stock market,'' he added.
 
Gains 26.46 So Far
The Dow gained 7.04 points yesterday, bringing the week's gain so far to 26.46 points.
Volume continued to be light, with investors still cautious over the course of interest rates. A total of 153.8 million shares changed hands yesterday, up from 149.4 million the day before, as the 848 advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange outnumbered the 647 declining ones.
The broader market yesterday was noticeably weaker than the blue-chip sector. The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks edged up only 0.16 of a point, to 345.77, while the New York Stock Exchange composite index tacked on 0.21 to close at 191.34.
Oil stocks helped bolster the blue-chip sector after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries increased the output quotas of its members. Exxon jumped 1 point, to 47 7/8; Mobil added 5/8, to 58 3/4; Phillips Petroleum gained 3/4, to 23 3/8, and Texaco rose 7/8, to 54 3/4.
 
Chevron Most Active
Chevron was the most active Big Board stock, slipping 1/2, to 67 3/4, on a volume of nearly 3.7 million shares. Traders said that Chevron, based in San Francisco, also attracted interest because on Monday it created an employee stock ownership plan that will hold $1 billion worth of its shares.
Much of yesterday's action came in merger-related stocks.
On the American Stock Exchange, Ambrit rose 5/8, or 38.5 percent, to 2 1/4, making it the Amex's biggest percentage gainer. The ice cream maker, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., said it had agreed to a new exchange ratio in its proposed merger with Empire of Carolina Inc. under which each Ambrit common share would be exchanged for three-tenths of a share of Empire.
In over-the-counter trading, McCaw Cellular Communications jumped 1 1/2, to 37 1/2. The company, with headquarters in Kirkland, Wash., offered to make its offer for Lin Broadcasting more attractive if the New York-based Lin would agree to a friendly merger.
 
Polaroid Off $1.25
Earnings reports and projections continued to move some equities.
Polaroid slipped 1 1/4, to 45 3/4. The company, based in Cambridge, Mass., said it had lowered its earnings projections for 1989 and 1990.
Litton Industries slipped 3/8, to 77 1/8, after reporting that earnings for its first fiscal quarter that ended on Oct. 31 were unchanged at $43.6 million.
Other active stocks included General Electric, up 3/8, to 61 3/4; Philip Morris, unchanged at 41 1/2; McDonald's, off 1/8, to 32 7/8; Smithkline Beecham, up 1/4, to 39 1/4, and American Express up 5/8, to 35 3/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the Amex market-value index rose 1.06 points, to 375.10, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index advanced 0.49, to 456.66.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Energy Prices Fall Sharply In Wake of OPEC Accord

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Energy prices declined sharply yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange as traders reacted to news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had reached a production agreement that would raise the group's output ceiling to 22 million barrels a day and maintain a target price of $18 a barrel.
Futures prices of precious metals were mixed in active trading on New York's Commodity Exchange, and grain and soybean prices rose.
The OPEC agremeent, reached at a meeting in Vienna, ''had a few more leaks in terms of quota discipline'' than was desired by the market. said Robert Baker, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York. 
''The agreement was signed with the recognition that the United Arab Emirates would continue to overproduce,'' he added, predicting that Kuwait would also continue to surpass its quota. The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait have each been producing two million barrels a day. or double their current quotas.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 29 cents to 43 cents lower, with January at $19.25 cents a barrel; heating oil was 0.61 cent to 0.94 cent lower, with December at 60.31 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.80 cent to 1.36 cents higher, with December at 49.53 cents a gallon.
 
Gold Prices Mixed
Gold settled from 50 cents higher to 60 cents lower, with the contract for delivery in December down 60 cents at $413.50 an ounce; the expiring November contract settled at $413.40, off 50 cents. Silver was 2 cents to 6 cents higher, with December at $5.695 an ounce.
Gold prices continued Monday's slide in early trading, but regained some losses as speculators began to hunt for bargains.
''Gold continues to be bought by speculators,'' said Peter Cardillo, an analyst at Josephthal & Company in New York. ''Basically, there still is a sense of fear about the strength of the economy.''
Grain and soybean futures prices closed higher on the Chicago Board of Trade despite the lack of news to influence trading. Soybean futures rose as traders reacted to a sense that the market was oversold in the wake of Monday's selloff of soybean futures on slack export sales and bearish technical signals.
Soybeans also received support from the Malaysian palm oil market, where futures were higher Monday after last week's weakness, analysts said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Generally Lower On Interest-Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was generally lower yesterday as concerns about interest rates continued to dominate the foreign exchange markets.
Analysts said the dollar moved higher in early trading after the Federal Reserve signaled on Monday that it was not lowering interest rates. When interest rates fall in the United States, dollar-denominated securities and the dollar itself become less attractive to investors.
The dollar had fallen in recent sessions amid expectations that the Fed would lower interest rates. But Monday's developments ''caused a momentary hesitation in the market'' and traders began buying dollars early in yesterday's session to shore up their positions, said Robert Ryan, senior foreign exchange trader with the Bank of New York.
In late trading, the dollar resumed its slide because of continuing expectations that interest rates would rise overseas, particularly in West Germany, making foreign currencies more valuable, said Jack Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc.
 
Strength of West German Mark
The West German mark has been strong against most currencies since East Germany opened the Berlin wall on Nov. 9, raising expectations that West German industry would benefit from the new opening to the East and that the Bundesbank would raise West German interest rates.
The mark suffered from some profit taking yesterday but still closed higher. In New York, the dollar fell to 1.7770 marks, from 1.7890 late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.5880 Swiss francs, down from 1.6040; 6.0710 French francs, down from 6.1100; 1,312.75 Italian lire, down from 1,320.75, and 1.16645 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16665.
The dollar also declined against the British pound, which cost $1.5670 in New York, compared with $1.5585 late Monday. And it was basically unchanged against the Japanese yen, at 143.20 yen.

McCaw Offers to Sweeten Its Bid for Lin

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 28

 BODY:
McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. said today that it would make its offer for the Lin Broadcasting Corporation more attractive, if the New York-based cellular telephone company would accept a friendly transaction. Lin, trying to fight off McCaw's advances, has agreed to merge with the BellSouth Corporation.
Craig O. McCaw, chairman of the nation's largest cellular telephone company, in a letter to Lin's board of directors dated Monday, said that Lin shareholders would be given more favorable tax treatment, although the revised deal ''would mirror the economics of our present proposal.'' His letter was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
A spokesman for Lin, the nation's seventh-largest cellular company, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Lin's shares rose 37.5 cents today, to $120.25, in the over-the-counter market. McCaw rose $1.50, to $37.50.
 
Increased McCaw Offer
Last week, McCaw raised its offer for Lin to $150 a share for 22.5 million Lin shares, or 46 percent. With the 10 percent it already owns, it would thus have control. The earlier offer was $125 a share for 22 million shares.
Lin has said that it will review the sweetened bid and respond at an appropriate time.
Under McCaw's complex new proposal, Lin would issue new common stock, and McCaw would buy 46.1 million of those shares directly from Lin for $3.37 billion, or $73.21 a share. Then, Lin would buy $425 million of McCaw class A common stock and distribute to shareholders $69.19 in cash and $8.71 in McCaw stock for each remaining Lin share.
McCaw said this distribution would be treated partly as a dividend, partly as a return of capital and partly as capital gains. Over all, this would result in lower taxes than the previous deal.
Following the transaction, McCaw said it would control 52 percent of Lin's outstanding shares.
BellSouth, the giant telephone concern, has argued that its offer is still superior to the new McCaw bid.
BellSouth has offered a cash dividend of $42 a share plus stock in BellSouth's television and cellular companies. Lin has scheduled a shareholders meeting to consider the merger on Jan. 12, and McCaw contends its offer should also be put to the shareholders.
In general, however, analysts discounted the significance of the latest McCaw proposal.

Clamor in the East;
Gorbachev's Hope for Future: 'A Common European Home'

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Nov. 29

 BODY:
When it comes to the future of Europe, no one accuses President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of lacking vision.
The Soviet leader's vision - he calls it ''a common European home'' - is in some respects utopian. It has been shaped in large part by the tumult of events beyond the Kremlin's control, including economic desperation at home and explosive popular aspirations in Eastern Europe.
From the time Mr. Gorbachev first broached the ''common home'' notion on a visit to France in 1985, it has been regarded in the West as more a speechwriter's conceit than a basis for serious discussion.
 
Taking a Closer Look
But as Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush prepare to survey together the wreckage of the postwar order in Europe, both Soviet and Western specialists have begun to look more seriously at the Soviet leader's vision of what might replace it. 
In interviews conducted as successive spasms of democracy struck Eastern Europe, Soviet officials and scholars and Western diplomats here said the West had not yet grasped the magnitude of what Mr. Gorbachev wants in Europe, of the overall vision toward which he would like to maneuver Mr. Bush in their meeting this week.
In effect, what Mr. Gorbachev seeks is a huge exchange, in which Moscow surrenders its costly ambitions of expansionism - at least beyond its postwar borders.
 
Admission to the Club
In return, Moscow wants admission to the club of Western industrial countries, bringing with it technology and a period of calm in which to focus on the problem that really threatens Soviet security: an economy that cannot compete in the world or satisfy the growing wants of its own people.
''The common European home means decomposition of the empire, in our own interest,'' said Andranik Migranyan, an analyst at one of the most influential research groups, the Institute for the Economy of the World Socialist System.
''In the end, it means the return to a single European civilization,'' said Fyodor M. Burlatsky, chairman of the human rights panel of the parliamentary committee on foreign relations.
As Mr. Burlatsky suggests, this Europe is not so much a geographical concept as a cultural one - it means Western civilization, including the United States.
What follows is a rough floor plan, based on these interviews and Mr. Gorbachev's own comments, of the Soviet leader's European home.
 
Freedom of Choice, Even With Capitalists
The first and most startling feature of this new Europe is the breakup of the Communist bloc.
''Of course, there is still a bloc of Eastern European states, in which the Soviet Union is clearly the most formidable partner,'' said a Western European diplomat. ''But it is no longer uniformly Communist, and it seems even Communist parties within those countries are not bound by Moscow.''
Although Soviet officials do not like to advertise it, they agree that the freedom of Eastern European countries to run their own affairs includes the right to reject Communism altogether, to adopt multiparty democracies and market economies and even to call themselves capitalists.
''Once you've determined the principle of freedom of choice, I don't see how any limit can be set,'' said a Foreign Ministry official, interviewed on the condition he not be named. ''You cannot say 'This is socialism; this line you cannot cross.' ''
 
How Quick the Pace: It's Dominoes Away
Mr. Gorbachev has been increasingly categorical about a policy of noninterference in the internal affairs of his allies, and has backed up his words by accepting - even applauding - the dislodging of Communist regimes in Poland and Hungary.
''One can argue about the degree to which Gorbachev had a choice, and about his motives,'' said a Western diplomat. ''But it is hard to make the case any longer that he doesn't mean it.''
This diplomat speculates that if Mr. Gorbachev had any lingering qualms about a hands-off policy, they were erased this year as he watched the horrified reaction to China's suppression of its democracy movement, and the bitter domestic backlash after troops killed demonstrators in Soviet Georgia.
At the same time, Soviet officials and Western diplomats generally agree that Mr. Gorbachev had not engineered the tumbling of Eastern Europe's dominoes, nor foreseen the pace and sequence of events.
He has, rather, played the role of catalyst, both publicly, by opening a vigorous debate of Communism's failures at home, and privately, by making it clear Moscow would not intervene to prop up old regimes.
''A signal may be either indirect or indirect,'' Gennadi I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, observed the other day when asked to describe Moscow's role in Eastern Europe. ''We are not waving a conductor's baton.''
 
All the Party's Horses And All of Its Men
Perhaps the best metaphor for Mr. Gorbachev's approach to his restive allies is the opening of the Berlin wall.
Just as East Germany opened its borders to slow the headlong defection of its citizens - by assuring them they could wait a while, size up the changes at home, and leave whenever they wanted - Mr. Gorbachev's policy is to open the bloc in hopes that the members will remain together voluntarily.
So far the more independent voices in Eastern Europe have been careful to pledge their allegiance to the Warsaw Pact and to the postwar boundaries of Europe - and not only because they worry how Moscow would respond if a country bolted from the pact.
''Now the Governments in Poland and Hungary have changed,'' said Marshal Sergei F. Akhromeyev, the former chief of the armed forces general staff and now an adviser to Mr. Gorbachev in the Soviet legislature. ''There are non-Communists at the heads of the governments. But the state interests of Poland and Hungary have remained the same, to a significant degree.''
''First of all, there's the stability of the territory and state boundaries,'' he continued. ''Second, there are the economic interests of the states. After all, they've been linked for many decades. That is why the military-political alliance remains.''
 
Staying Together, For Old Time's Sake 
The next stage, already under way, is a transformation of the eastern military and economic alliances - the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance.
While Soviets once talked of disbanding NATO and the Warsaw Pact simultaneously - a bluff the West did not take seriously - they now tend to agree that it is better to preserve the alliances for the foreseeable future, since on its own each country might be tempted to renew historical disputes with its neighbors.
In Mr. Gorbachev's vision, the military alliances that now face off across a central European front will evolve into political alliances, in which the military role has withered.
Beginning with a meeting of Warsaw Pact leaders in Bucharest, Rumania, last July, where the group for the first time declared a policy of noninterference in its members' internal affairs, the Eastern alliance has begun to take on some trappings of a more political, NATO-style fraternity.
According to Western and Soviet specialists, the Soviet side has signaled that it will accept changes in the Warsaw Pact Constitution that would ban use of troops in internal affairs, declare that the pact does not include promoting Communism, and make membership more equal and voluntary.
''The pact will dissolve, that seems irreversible,'' said a Polish journalist who visited Moscow last week with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's new non-Communist Prime Minister. ''So why waste our energy pushing it? The only thing we have to do is avoid posing a threat to the Soviet Union, and we are not that stupid.''
In the Soviet vision, the remaking of the pacts would include a rollback of military forces on both sides.
''The state interests of both alliances still remain, and the contradictions remain,'' Marshal Akhromeyev said. ''And a certain quantity of arms and armed forces will remain. But what matters is that it be such a quantity which would not permit the country to start a war, even if it wanted to.''
Mr. Akhromeyev and Mr. Gorbachev publicly insist these reductions must be mutual, worked out at the conventional arms talks under way in Vienna between the 16 NATO allies and the 7 members of the Warsaw Pact.
But among the Soviet researchers, some theorists now argue openly for more dramatic, one-sided moves.
 
To Have Troops Or Not to Have Troops
Vladimir N. Chernega, vice rector of the diplomatic academy of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, suggests that the Soviet Union could withdraw its troops entirely from Eastern Europe without demanding that America match it.
''If the Governments of Eastern Europe want it, we must withdraw our troops from their territory,'' he said, stressing that this was a personal opinion. ''We can do this even unilaterally. As for American troops - I would leave that up to the Western European Governments. I know that some circles in Western Europe feel their security is greater with American troops. It's an understandable position. Let them have it.''
''We have a historical chance now and we have to make the most of it,'' he said. ''In this context, a certain presence of Americans troops - a limited presence - poses no danger.''
Like Mr. Gorbachev's own series of announced military budget cuts ''the pact will dissolve, that seems irreversible,'' said a Polish journalist who visited Moscow last week with Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's new non-Communist Prime Minister. ''So why waste our energy pushing it? The only thing we have to do is avoid posing a threat to the Soviet Union, and we are not that stupid.''
''For us, this is not just reducing military spending and reallocating resources to civilian purposes,'' Mr. Chernega noted. ''It is a matter of structural reorganization of our whole economy. Forty percent of our machine-tool industry and 75 percent of our spending on science go to the military. This is no basis for a normal economy.''
 
Is Finlandization Coming to the East?
Ultimately, after the withering of military confrontation, some Soviet analysts expect that some of the Soviet allies will become neutral-but-careful neighbors like Finland.
On his visit to Helsinki in October, Mr. Gorbachev hailed Finland as a model neighbor. Mr. Migranyan predicts that Finlandization of the Eastern bloc will come more quickly than anyone in the West anticipates.
Mr. Burlatsky, a legislator close to the leadership, is more cautious, but he says neutrality is entirely possible.
''If Austria can be neutral, then why not Hungary?'' he said. ''But that's in the future, after radical structural changes in the two blocs.''
If the Warsaw Pact is being revamped, the Eastern economic alliance seems to be quickly coming apart, as budding market economies like Hungary and Poland find it harder to coexist with the older, planned economies.
The more market-minded members of the alliance, including the Soviet Union, are aggressivly seeking to open new relationships with the European Community, and with individual Western countries.
But the Eastern European countries are so bound together by common backwardness and mutual trade dependencies, that economic integration with the West may prove more difficult than reducing military confrontation.
''There is an asymmetry between the disintegration of Eastern Europe and the growing integration of Western Europe,'' Mr. Burlatsky said, noting the Western European countries' planned 1992 market consolidation.
''It seems there is a danger of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union turning into an economic appendage of the West, a supplier of raw materials,'' he said. ''That would create political problems, because a great superpower such as the Soviet Union will not feel comfortable in such a role.''
Mr. Burlatsky argues for ''a common market on the entire European continent,'' but he predicts a difficult decade or two before that is possible.
 
Wooing the Money And Then Some More
In the meantime, Mr. Gorbachev seems to accept, even welcome the flow of Western credits, guarantees and investment to Eastern European countries. Although he warns against ''exporting capitalism,'' he realizes that Western capital relieves him of an unbearable economic burden, and that hopes that it will help Eastern Europe become a bridge by which the Soviet Union can reach Western technology and markets.
Some portions of Mr. Gorbachev's design remain deliberately unfinished.
One is Germany. The Soviets are uneasy about the potential clout of a reunified Germany, and they are reluctant to be seen undermining the authority of their allies in East Berlin.
But some Soviet analysts say privately they are not alarmed about some new arrangement short of complete reunification, with security guarantees to reassure the neighbors.
And Soviet officials say they do not rule out reunification in the future, after ''overcoming the division of Europe,'' as the Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said today.
 
Whither the Baltics? A Gray Area for Soviets
Another gray area in the blueprint is the fate of the Baltic republics, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, which yearn to rejoin Europe as independent states. Moscow is willing to concede these republics greater autonomy and closer economic links with the West, but balks at complete independence.
So far, most Western governments seem to accept this as Mr. Gorbachev's domestic problem, and they have not pressed him on behalf of the Baltics. But the three republics are pushing ahead without foreign encouragement.
The overriding question about Mr. Gorbachev's vision is how widely it is shared within the Soviet power structure. Clearly there are conservatives here who chafe at the retrenchment of Soviet power and the flouting of Communist verities, but they are understandable quiet about it.
Mr. Migranyan, for one, contends that the collapse of territorial ambitions has now very nearly reached the point where it would be impossible to reverse even if Mr. Gorbachev were replaced by a conservative.
''Even the most conservative government here will have to accept the changes in Eastern Europe,'' he said. ''It would cost too much to reverse them.''
Future articles will include the views from Washington and Western Europe.

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
Bush Hoping to Use Malta Talks to Speed Strategic Arms Pact

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
President Bush wants his meeting this weekend with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to speed up talks on reducing long-range nuclear weapons, possibly by giving negotiators a timetable for dealing with the remaining obstacles to a treaty before the next Soviet-American summit meeting in 1990, senior officials said today.
Making it clear that the meeting will not merely be the ''feet on the table'' get-together that Mr. Bush first advertised, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today outlined an ambitious agenda for Mr. Bush's first summit talks with Mr. Gorbachev.
Mr. Baker hinted that the two leaders might reach some understanding, even if they do not take specific action, on lowering barriers to trade between the Soviet Union and the West, including the American restrictions on granting Moscow the most-favored-nation trading status it has long sought.
 
Will Protest Arms Shipments
Saying the Administration is ''interested in exploring the opportunities for mutual advantage across the board in our relations,'' Mr. Baker highlighted only one area of fundamental dispute. He said Mr. Bush would strongly protest to Mr. Gorbachev about the shipment of Soviet arms to Moscow's ''Brezhnevite clients in Central America, Afghanistan, Cambodia and Ethiopia.'' 
Mr. Baker called the shipments ''a cold-war relic'' and said arms shipments to Nicaragua and the leftist rebels in El Salvador have continued through Cuba despite repeated assurances that Moscow would use its influence to stop them.
''All I can gather is that either the Nicaraguans are lying to the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union is lying to us,'' Mr. Baker said at a White House news conference. ''We prefer to believe it's the former.''
 
Linkage Not Specified
''Soviet behavior in Central America remains the biggest obstacle to an across-the-board improvement in United States-Soviet relations,'' Mr. Baker said. But he stopped short of saying that Mr. Bush would tie the issue to progress in other areas during his talks with Mr. Gorbachev this weekend.
Another senior Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the United States thought Mr. Gorbachev might propose a ''trade-off'' under which the Soviet Union would agree to end arms shipments to Central America if the United States stopped support for the Afghan rebels. Mr. Bush would reject such an approach, the official said.
Mr. Baker said Central America is part of a five-part agenda that Mr. Bush is bringing to the Malta talks. The other parts are Eastern Europe, arms control, Soviet political reforms and the Soviet economy, he said.
Mr. Baker said Mr. Bush will want to discuss ''what preparations we might make to accelerate further progress'' in arms control.
The other senior official said Mr. Bush wants to put ''some more political impetus behind'' the Geneva negotiations on long-range nuclear weapons.
The Malta meeting, he said, could help by ''setting out a timetable designed to have covered the major outstanding issues by the time of the summit,'' which is to be held in the United States next year. The two sides are still apart on some key verification issues, as well as on American development of a space-based anti-missile shield.
On conventional armed forces in Europe, the official said, ''both sides are likely to agree to push hard and try to get an agreement next year.'' Beyond that, he said, ''it would be logical that there would be a general discussion about what's next.''
 
Sea-Launched Missiles
Mr. Gorbachev has indicated that he also wants to discuss nuclear weapons deployed at sea, the senior official said. Mr. Bush is prepared to talk about the issue, but will not negotiate toward an agreement, the official said.
On Eastern Europe, Mr. Baker said the President, who spoke by telephone today with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany as part of a round of consultations with European allies, plans to tell Mr. Gorbachev that ''continued change and reform is the only path to long-term legitimacy and stability'' in the area. He will also say that ''any attempts to forcibly intervene and prevent continued reform will be extremely destabilizing and dangerous,'' Mr. Baker said.
Senior Administration officials said Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev were likely to discuss German reunification in broad terms and not set forth a timetable.
Mr. Baker said the United States would like the process to be gradual and sets no conditions. But Mr. Baker said the United States does not want a neutral unified Germany and believes that Germany should continue to be aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the European Community.
 
Soviet Human Rights
Mr. Baker said the President was eager to use the summit meeting ''to hear about the steps Mr. Gorbachev may be planning to institutionalize the rule of law and to guarantee human rights in the Soviet Union.''
Administration officials said the Soviets have made it clear that trade issues are at the top of their agenda, and some of these questions have been tied by the United States to Soviet domestic policies.
The Soviets, American officials said, hoped to win Mr. Bush's backing for a waiver of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which says that Communist countries may not receive favorable tariff treatment or credits from the United States until they permit free emigration.
And, Mr. Gorbachev is hoping to win Mr. Bush's endorsement for observer status, and eventual membership, for Moscow in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Question of Waiving Requirement
Mr. Baker said Mr. Bush would discuss both issues in detail with Mr. Gorbachev, but declined to say whether the Malta meeting could produce an agreement to waive the Jackson-Vanik barriers. Mr. Baker noted that the Supreme Soviet was not able to pass new emigration laws in time for the meeting.
''We need that legislation before we can actually waive Jackson-Vanik,'' he said. But he added, ''That's not to say, I don't think, that the General Secretary might not be in a position to give some assurances, if he felt it advisable to do so, with respect to when that legislation might be passed.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Staff Told To Take Refuge In San Salvador

DATELINE: SAN SALVADOR, Nov. 29

 BODY:
In the face of a new rebel attack here in the capital, the United States Embassy today urged its officers, contract employees and dependent families to leave their homes for safer quarters on embassy property. It also offered to grant special leaves to diplomatic personnel who wished to leave the country.
The request, broadcast over a special embassy radio network, came a few hours after leftist guerrillas slipped into wealthy neighborhoods on the west and south of the capital. Their attacks provoked fierce new fighting, trapping residents, knocking out power to the headquarters of the Salvadoran armed forces and destroying the house of a senior American diplomat. 
 
Fighting Continues in Capital
Heavy fighting continued through the day in the Escalon and San Francisco neighborhoods, but tapered off to sniper fire in the San Benito and Ciudad Delgado sections.
About 400 to 500 American Embassy personnel, contract workers and dependents are thought to be in San Salvador. Those who do not leave the country will be given floor space in the embassy and the Agency for International Development buildings.
United States officials said today that no Americans were killed or injured in the fighting, but that some Americans remained trapped within the rebel-held zone.
French diplomats said that an undetermined number of French citizens were trapped in a house that was seized by the guerrillas at the city's northwest edge and that negotiations were under way to free them. Guerrillas were also said to have entered offices belonging to the Japanese Embassy, but its employees were believed to have escaped unharmed.
In view of such attacks, the United Nations also ordered all but a handful of its international personnel in San Salvador to leave the country until the situation has stabilized.
American Embassy spokesmen here declined to comment on the identity of the diplomat whose residence was attacked. But diplomats familiar with the embassy staff said the high-walled house, which was still smoldering today under a layer of charred debris and spent shells, belonged to a senior American intelligence officer. And neighbors said they believed the man had been rescued after the attack began by troops who arrived in a column of tanks and armored troop carriers.
American officials said the house of the embassy's security officer was also among those attacked, but that he, too, had been rescued by Salvadoran troops.
 
'We Are Not Evacuating'
Officials at the embassy, which was closed today as a standard precaution during heavy fighting, played down the announcement and refused to describe it as an evacuation. They emphasized that it was a voluntary measure for diplomats who felt themselves to be in danger.
''We are lowering our profile,'' an embassy spokesman said. ''We are not evacuating. It seems obvious that with the fighting in neighborhoods where we all live, this would be a good time to leave.''
But embassy personnel said the message was delivered to them with the manner of an order rather than an offer. And the announcement appeared certain to deepen the atmosphere of uncertainty and tension that has prevailed here since the beginning of the guerrilla offensive on Nov. 11.
American officials have repeatedly emphasized their confidence in the Salvadoran Government's ability to control the fighting, which until last week was limited largely to the city's working-class suburbs. But official expressions of optimism by the Salvadoran authorities have repeatedly been upstaged by new guerrilla attacks.
The first important aftershock in the offensive came last week when guerrillas attacked the elegant neighborhood of Escalon, on the northwest side of the capital, trapping 12 American Green Berets and other foreigners in a luxury hotel during a one-day standoff.
The most recent fighting began on Monday when guerrilla columns returned to attack positions that they had earlier abandoned on the north of the city. The renewed offensive quickly gained momentum on Tuesday night as guerrilla units again seized strategic points in Escalon and extended their attack to the western neighborhood of San Benito and the southern district of San Francisco.
The number of guerrillas involved in the most recent attacks is believed to be only a fraction of the 2,000 who took part in the broader offensive earlier this month. But the psychological effect of bringing the offensive to wealthier districts, which had remained virtually untouched by the 10-year civil war, has been great. And it has been dramatically increased by the selectivity of the guerrillas' recent attacks, which today appeared in some cases to be focused directly on the country's American community.
The overall American presence here includes thousands of people in official and unofficial capacities.
The number of American military trainers who live here and advise the Salvadoran armed forces is limited by Congress to 55. But military officials here say that that number is augmented by those Americans assigned to the embassy as military attaches and by the continuing rotation of special evaluation and exercise teams, bringing the number of military personnel in the country to anaverage of 125.
Although Americans live throughout the country and the capital region, the majority live in its western neighborhoods, many of which were attacked last night.

This Is El Dorado? Gold and Death in the Jungle

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOA VISTA, Brazil, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The streets of this jungle city may not be paved with gold, but Albert Dunbar Beckers finds it worthwhile to sweep the sidewalks.
Every morning, Mr. Beckers, a spry 62-year-old native of Guyana, is out, broom in hand, to sweep in front of the gold-buying shops on Gold Street.
''On a good day, I can get two or three grams,'' he said, referring to the flecks of gold dust lifted by the wind from shops patronized by rough-cut miners coming in from the gold camps for provisions and a night on the town. ''It's just like the Yukon, just like California.'' 
Younger men - 50,000 at last count - seek their El Dorados in a nearby chunk of Amazon jungle the size of Portugal. Panning gravel and water-blasting mud, they are following one of Brazil's biggest gold rushes of the 1980's. #400 Killed in a Year Brazil became the world's sixth-largest gold producer in the 1980's, behind South Africa, the Soviet Union, the United States, Canada and Australia. Today, Brazil produces about 100 tons of gold a year, triple the production at the start of the decade.
Here in Roraima, a territory that is scheduled to achieve full statehood next year, claim jumping, gunfights and plane crashes in the rain forest are the currency of the day.
The newspaper Critica captured the spirit of Boa Vista today with a banner headline: ''Eight dead in firefight in Roraima gold camp.''
Since the gold rush started in earnest about a year ago, more than 400 miners have died in gunfights or in plane crashes. In a frontier where many people are known only by their nicknames, most burials amount to litle more than a few words from a priest and a circle of friends standing at graveside, hats in hand.
Last January, during the dry season, overworked bush planes were crashing at the rate of one a day. That month, air traffic become so thick -7,995 takeoffs and landings - that the local civil aviation director announced that Boa Vista airport was Brazil's busiest.
In the last two years, commercial flights from Manaus, the nearest major city, have increased from one a week to four. The number of buses plying the 400-mile route has tripled.
The fact that the gold rush is taking place on traditional lands of the Yanomami Indians, South America's largest unassimilated tribe, does not disturb the gold seekers.
''The opening of the Brazilian frontier is just like the American pioneers, with covered wagons, fighting Indians,'' said Athos Vieira, an ebullient gold and diamond mine operator, piloting his Dodge toward a dirt airstrip behind the Jockey Club, the city's racetrack. ''We don't have horses, we have airplanes.''
 
Keeping the Planes Flying
The improvised airstrip captured the single-minded pursuit of gold that has gripped the territory. Without the formalities of flight plans, radar or mechanical inspections, small planes took off and landed at the rate of one every five minutes. Under a flapping blue tarpaulin, grease-stained mechanics - earning more than they could in a Sao Paulo automobile factory - labored to keep aging Pipers and Cessnas airworthy.
''There are 126 strips out there, and a new one opening every day,'' said Valdeni Lopes de Oliveira, a pilot who goes by the name Baby Onion. Aeronautical maps of Roraima show only three officially designated airstrips.
One of the Amazon air jockeys is an American nuclear physics professor who found he could make 10 times as much money flying here than he could teaching in Sao Paulo, 2,500 miles to the South.
Miners and pilots also say they are are tired of outsiders who complain about the decimation of the Indians. ''The U.S. gave us the example,'' Baby Onion said as he dug into a $5 plate of beef and rice at the airport. ''I've seen all those movies on television of cowboys and Indians.''
Jose Teixeira Peixoto, president of the Roraima Goldminers Union, elaborated a homespun conspiracy theory that is popular here.
''Multinationals, foreigners and the Vatican'' are behind the international fuss over the Indians, said Mr. Peixoto. All three groups want the gold and are using the Indian issue to block the miners, he said.
If Mr. Peixoto had a telephone, he would need to go no further than the 1990 Roraima telephone book to find the legal explanation for the dispute over the Yanomami land. Reprinting Brazil's 1988 Constitution, the telephone book contains on page 18 a key clause: ''Mining of mineral resources in indigenous lands can take place only with the authorization of the National Congress.''
At the state house, Marcelo Couto Chagas, the Governor's chief of staff, said, ''That's something very Brazilian - tying to stop natural economic forces with laws.''

HEADLINE: Clamor in the East;
Rumania Getting an Unfamiliar Cold Shoulder in the West

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BUCHAREST, Rumania, Nov. 25

 BODY:
Having been treated with sympathy by Western Governments over most of the last two decades, Rumania's hard-line Communist Government seems both surprised and confused to find itself suddenly under attack from the West for its human rights record.
Although many in the West charge that rights abuses have grown in recent years, puzzled Rumanian officials argue that little has changed here since the days when President Nicolae Ceausescu was a welcome guest in Washington, London and Paris.
The West's view of the Ceausescu leadership, however, appears to have been changed less by developments here than by events beyond Rumania's borders - with this country's increased isolation coming almost as a side effect. 
Today, with just a hint of embarrassment, Western diplomats concede that while a Stalinist-style Government intolerant of internal dissent was always in power here, Rumania was courted until the early 1980's as a Communist country of Eastern Europe that maintained a foreign policy independent of the Soviet Union.
Most dramatically, it denounced the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. But it also maintained diplomatic relations with Israel after the Middle East war of 1967 and, in the same year, it became the first East bloc country to recognize West Germany.
 
How It Won Friends
Further, Rumania acted as an intermediary between the United States and China in the early 1970's and between Israel and Egypt in the late 1970's. It won the gratitude of the United States when, in 1984, alone among East bloc countries, it ignored the Soviet boycott and participated in the Los Angeles Olympic Games.
The West responded by treating Mr. Ceausescu with some deference. President Richard M. Nixon visited Bucharest in 1969, while Mr. Ceausescu came to Washington in 1973, 1975 and 1978. In 1980, the Rumanian leader was received by both Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France, and as recently as 1983, George Bush came here as Vice President to acknowledge, in the words of officials at the time, ''the continued independence of Rumanian foreign policy.''
But since then, first as relations between Moscow and Washington improved, and more recently as East European Communist leaderships started to crumble, Mr. Ceausescu's maverick stance appears to have lost its usefulness to the West. In turn, Western Governments have begun distancing themselves from Bucharest.
During a visit here in October 1988, the former Deputy Secretary of State, John C. Whitehead, for the first time publicly expressed American concern about human rights here. Then, last February, Rumania rejected the trade benefits of most-favored-nation treatment by the United States after learning that this was about to be revoked by Congress.
Rumania's isolation in the East bloc also continues because it is considered a Stalinist regime that refuses to contemplate political or economic liberalization.
Today, the Ceausescu Government must look as far away as China, North Korea and Cuba for understanding. After a visit by a high-level Cuban delegation here last week, it was disclosed that President Fidel Castro would visit Bucharest in January.

Gorbachev, Visiting Italy, Urges Talks on Naval Arms

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Striding triumphantly through Rome on his first state visit, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticized the West today for not discussing naval arms control, and proposed talks on American and Soviet naval bases in the Mediterranean.
Mr. Gorbachev also said the rapid shifts under way in Eastern Europe should be accompanied by changes in Western attitudes that would help usher in a new age of peace.
''The cold war has ended, or is ending, not because there are victors and vanquished but because there is neither one nor the other,'' he told his Italian hosts at a banquet tonight in the 16th-century Quirinal Palace. ''Therefore it is perfectly possible to avoid a period of 'cold peace' and to proceed with greater courage toward a period of peace for human history.'' 
 
Talk on Naval Weapons Possible
The Soviet leader's mention of the Mediterranean, a point of obvious sensitivity for Italy, raised the possibility that he might pursue naval arms control - something that NATO has resisted - when he meets with President Bush off Malta this weekend.
Mr. Gorbachev offered no specifics in his wide-ranging speech tonight. But he proposed discussions with the United States and Italy, and possibly also within the United Nations Security Council, on whether permanent American and Soviet naval bases are really needed in the Mediterranean. ''During the cold war some justifications could be found for this,'' he said. ''Now, the situation has changed.''
Naval forces must be considered as part of the overall disarmament process, he said, adding that NATO's reluctance on this matter ''can only arouse concern'' and ''can put in doubt, even in danger, much that has been accomplished in recent times.''
Mr. Gorbachev also talked at length about his attempts to restructure Soviet society and, in more general terms, the fast-paced political developments in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union, he suggested, has no intention of interfering with the changes that are taking place.
''Real politics deal with real issues,'' he said. ''Therefore, it is necessary that the principles of noninterference and free choice are strictly observed.''
 
Meeting With the Pope
The visit here is Mr. Gorbachev's first trip to the West since the explosions of change began this fall in Eastern Europe. It is his sole opportunity to experience Western reaction first-hand before his seaborne meetings with Mr. Bush. Before he leaves on Friday, he will also meet at the Vatican with Pope John Paul II - the first encounter between a Pope and a Kremlin leader.
Security was tight across Rome, with sharpshooters posted atop many of the city's ornate palaces and monuments. But it was clear that this capital was as captivated with Mr. Gorbachev as have been other major European cities he has visited.
Hoping for a glimpse as Mr. Gorbachev passed, several thousand people lined downtown streets. The Soviet leader stopped to shake hands before ducking inside the Colosseum for 10 minutes of sightseeing.
The crowds were perhaps not as demonstrative as those who had lionized him on visits to Paris and Bonn. But for Rome, which greets virtually all visitors with studied insouciance, the reception amounted to unbridled enthusiasm.
 
Likened to Kennedy
''He's the Kennedy of the 90's,'' several people said. Giovanni Civica, a building superintendent, summed up the feelings of many Italians when he said of the Soviet leader: ''He has finally given Europe a new face, the face it should have, and he has done it all by himself. He has managed to upstage America, and this takes both courage and risk.''
As dusk settled, Mr. Gorbachev stopped briefly for coffee at a cafe on the Pincio hill, which offers a breathtaking view of the city and is a place that has been frequented over the decades by Benito Mussolini, King Farouk and Chiang Kai-shek. ''We thought we would have serious talks in Italy and a warm welcome from Italians,'' the visitor from Moscow told reporters. ''My expectation was not only right but we have begun a very serious dialogue.''
 
Talks With Italian Leaders
The Soviet leader's plans for political and economic restructuring took up much of his separate conversations with Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti and President Francesco Cossiga, who hosted tonight's banquet and praised Mr. Gorbachev for ''bold realism and farsighted resolve.''
This trip is also about money, and business contracts and Government agreements are scheduled to be signed that would set in motion an estimated $3 billion worth of Italian commercial enterprises in the Soviet Union.
It is understandable, and welcome, that Western countries would want to help Mr. Gorbachev succeed by giving his economy a much needed hand, the Soviet President said tonight, but he cautioned that ''all the riches of the West cannot replace that which we must do ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Collapse of Lincoln Savings Leaves Scars for Rich, Poor and the Faithful

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Much has been made of the $2 billion that it will cost taxpayers to bail out Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan Association. But for the people who were persuaded to invest their life savings in now-worthless securities, the cost is emotional as well as financial.
Many of them live in the retirement communities of California, where Lincoln was based, and when they look at the bright orange bond certificates of the American Continental Corporation, Lincoln's parent company, they feel duped, incensed and embarrassed.
''I am supposed to be retired,'' said Morris W. Rubenacker, a 68-year-old former contractor who put $75,000 into high-yield American Continental bonds. ''But now upon looking back, I'd call myself retarded for buying those things.'' 
 
Hungry for Cash
From 1987 to 1989, as American Continental was growing increasingly cash hungry to cover losses in development projects and land purchases, Lincoln customers say they were called at home by branch managers, told that their insured certificates of deposit were coming due and asked whether they would like to invest in higher yielding bonds that paid a monthly interest rate. And in the branch offices, tellers urged the bonds upon them.
Many of the 23,000 people who bought more than $200 million in American Continental bonds at the 29 Lincoln branches in California say they were told by smiling and bright-faced young bank officials that the instruments were either insured by the Government or the next thing to it, and that they were assured right up until the Government took over Lincoln last April that their investments were absolutely safe.
American Continental was in the Fortune 500, they were told, and Lincoln would support its parent company in any crisis.
But some of the victims are now saying that the Government should make good on their losses as well, citing the fact that Mr. Keating was permitted to sell the bonds on bank premises. Others are seeking damages from Mr. Keating himself, in class action suits.
 
Lincoln's Ailing Parent
Both the Federal and California governments are conducting criminal investigations into the legality of the sales, asking such questions as whether unlicensed bank employees were selling the bonds, whether illegal bonuses were paid to the best salesmen and whether Lincoln concealed the true financial condition of its parent company.
What follows are four case studies, chosen to illustrate the cross section of investors - from the rich to those of modest means - who once trusted Mr. Keating and other Lincoln officials.
 
The Truck Driver
'Bigger and Better' Turns to Nothing
Kenneth Ludwig had been banking with the Lincoln Savings branch in Santa Ana, Calif., for 24 years. Mr. Ludwig, a truck driver for the Prudential Overall Supply Company, a uniform cleaning outfit, had to retire at the age of 59 because of a back injury.
But he had managed to save almost $45,000, and had invested it in federally insured certificates of deposit at Lincoln. When he went in to renew them last year, the tellers asked if he wanted an investment that paid ''bigger and better interest.''
 
'How Safe Can It Get?'
Mr. Ludwig was introduced to a young man named Peterson, he said, ''a real nice guy - I think he was an honest guy - who told me he had gotten his father into this deal for $3,000.''
''He said, 'How safe can it get?' '' Mr. Ludwig recalled. '' 'A.C.C. is the parent organization of Lincoln. There is no risk whatsoever. Lincoln is there to protect A.C.C. and you know Lincoln is under the F.S.L.I.C.' '' The reference was to the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, which insures deposits up to $100,000.
Convinced, Mr. Ludwig proceeded to invest $30,000 in the A.C.C. bonds, and received monthly interest checks of $286. But in April 1989, when Lincoln was taken over by the Government, he found out that the bonds had become worthless and that he had lost two-thirds of his life savings.
''I can't believe I have done it,'' Mr. Ludwig said. ''It's humiliating. I have been working for 25 years and could not have imagined that I could have done such a stupid thing.''
He added that with the $30,000 loss, his plans to move with his 72-year-old wife, Loraine, into a retirement community have had to be scrapped and their monthly income has now been reduced by one-third to around $900.
Mr. Ludwig saves his harshest words for Senator Alan Cranston, the California Democrat who along with four other Senators met with regulators on behalf of Mr. Keating. The five, who are under investigation in the Senate, received a total of $1.4 million in contributions from Mr. Keating and his associates, with Mr. Cranston receiving almost $1 million of that amount.
After voting for Senator Cranston, Mr. Ludwig promises not to vote for him again. ''We counted on him,'' he said. ''I really thought the guy was a good guy and always stood up for the little man. I think he should be impeached.''
 
The Stockbroker
Riding a Wave Up; Then the Plunge
Not all those who suffered losses from the collapse of Lincoln Savings were members of the working- or middle-classes. Some very large investors bet their fortunes on Mr. Keating and now regret it.
James D. Mussio, a 47-year-old broker for Queen City Securities in Cincinnati, says he lost half a million dollars on his investments in American Continental securities and that customers of his firm have lost almost $5 million.
For Mr. Mussio and Queen City, the loss is particularly bitter because his firm aggressively sold both American Continental common stock and other now-worthless securities, and now has clients suing.
''Not only have I lost money and my clients have lost money, but can you imagine what it is like the next time I call a client with another idea,'' Mr. Mussio said. ''They're not too quick to listen.''
 
Believing in Auditors
Mr. Mussio complains bitterly about the public accounting firms that gave their seal of approval to the financial statements of American Continental in 1985, 1986 and 1987. In saying that the profits that American Continental reported accurately reflected the true financial condition of Lincoln and its parent company, Mr. Mussio argues, the accounting firms betrayed their obligation to shareholders and the public. There was little he could have done, he insists, to detect the troubles at Lincoln apart from having insider knowledge.
''The C.P.A.'s are supposed to be the Bible, the Gospel as to the condition of a company,'' he said. ''They are the ones who say the numbers are accurate. How else are you supposed to be able to judge a company? If you can't believe in the auditors, what can you believe in? Then nothing is good.''
He added that during the years in which he was selling Lincoln stock and bonds, he attended shareholder meetings, met frequently with management officials in Phoenix, and was in personal touch with Mr. Keating, who repeatedly told him how well the company was doing.
''A lot of people in Cincinnati trusted Keating and rode his wave up and down,'' Mr. Mussio said.
 
The Construction Worker
'A Little Mistake' And a Life's Savings
Rene Hugo Heimann, a 49-year-old construction worker who lives in Ceritos, Calif., lost $48,000 from buying American Continental bonds in his local office of Lincoln Savings. But unlike Mr. Ludwig's case, the money was Mr. Heimann's entire savings.
Mr. Heimann, a Bolivian-born naturalized American whose family fled Nazi Germany, had sold his home and took the proceeds in October 1987 to the Lincoln branch in Ceritos to invest in insured certificates of deposit. A Lincoln teller advised him to look into American Continental bonds.
''I was told that the bank backed up the bonds 100 percent,'' Mr. Heimann said. ''They showed me a list of 30 companies that Continental owned and told me that if anything happens I would get my money back.'' He twice went to Lincoln officials when he heard there might be trouble with American Continental bonds, he said, but was told the reports were ''a misprint in the paper, and that as proof of the company's health they had just bought another hotel in Phoenix.''
While he could retire from his job within three years, after putting in 25 years of work, that is now impossible.
''The Senators say they made a little mistake,'' Mr. Heimann said, referring to the five lawmakers who are being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee. ''I make a little mistake at work and I am gone,''
 
The Nuns
Embarrassment And Prayers
The swath of investment enthusiasm generated by Mr. Keating also reached inside the walls of the Sisters of Charity, a Roman Catholic order of nuns based in Cincinnati.
According to one official of the order, who asked not to be identified, an investment of $440,000 from the order's retirement money, which has to support 900 sisters throughout the country, was made in the mid-1980's by the order, at the recommendation of a group of local business advisers.
''We're not very happy with the situation,'' the official said. ''We're praying everything works out.''
One local businessman, familiar with the investment, said that the $440,000 did not represent a major portion of the order's resources, and was within investment guidelines.
He added that officials of the order were mainly embarrassed by its involvement with Mr. Keating, and have wanted to keep it quiet.
''The point is not that some little sister got taken by Charlie Keating,'' said one investment expert, who asked not to be identified.

For the Homeless: New Old Hotels

 BODY:
The soft real estate market that darkens New York City's economic future opens a bright window of opportunity for New York State and City governments seeking ways to develop more housing for the homeless mentally ill.
In the early 1980's, demand for high-priced housing prompted developers to buy and tear down many old single-room-occupancy hotels. The Koch administration smiled on the phenomenon at first: the squalid S.R.O.'s, offering cheap rooms to the poorest of the poor, provided little in municipal taxes. Replacing them with glossy high-rises improved neighborhoods and city revenues. 
But as the homeless problem grew in the mid-1980's, second thoughts set in. Turning $200-a-month rooms into $200,000 condos spruced up neighborhoods but left former residents of the cheap rooms with nowhere to go. The most fragile were the mentally ill, no longer welcome at upstate hospitals.
In 1987, belatedly realizing the importance of the S.R.O.'s, the Koch administration clamped a moratorium on conversions. But owners of the buildings sued, and last July the state Court of Appeals threw out the moratorium. This week the Supreme Court refused to review that ruling.
That leaves S.R.O. owners once again free to sell. But not many are likely to do so right away because the city's real estate market has cooled. Moreover, in some cases, other state and city laws may complicate quick conversion to apartments. This opens the way for enterprising mental health officials to buy some of the buildings, keeping them in business as supported S.R.O.'s, offering services, as well as housing, for the mentally ill homeless. The few such residences now operating in the city not only provide better housing than the city's shelters; they do so at about half the cost.
Several hundred old S.R.O. buildings may be available. At current depressed prices, they could be purchased and renovated for the same cost, $50,000 per room, of putting up a new building.
Renovation is far preferable to new construction. A new building usually requires a planning and siting process that may include confrontations and even lawsuits with angry neighbors. That's less likely with the purchase of an existing S.R.O. To the neighbors, a renovated building run by competent nonprofit managers and staffed by mental health workers would be a welcome improvement over a squalid flophouse.
There is already some money in the state budget for community housing of the mentally ill, and legislators are studying ways to provide more.
The quiet real estate market, and the opportunity it creates for developing supported S.R.O.'s, extends the potential value of those state dollars. Albany, facing a season of austerity, can't afford anything less than a good deal. For the homeless mentally ill - and for all New Yorkers worried about the city's decline into a New Calcutta - S.R.O. purchases are the best deal in sight.

The I.R.A., You Say?

 BODY:
For several months rumors have circulated in Britain and the U.S. that McDonald's, the fast-food chain, has given financial support to the Irish Republican Army through Noraid, the I.R.A.'s North American fund-raising group. McDonald's itself couldn't figure where the implausible charge came from, and denied it flatly at every opportunity. But the rumor, and the mystery, persisted.
Now The Economist of London has tracked it down. One of its sleuths discovered that, some time back, on a financial talk show carried by the Cable News Network, McDonald's was cited for its generosity in contributing to employees' Individual Retirement Accounts - commonly called I.R.A.'s on this side of the Atlantic. But CNN can be viewed overseas now, via satellite, and in Britain I.R.A. means something else entirely.
Mystery solved. Rumor quashed. But not the cautionary question: Is the world really ready for modern telecommunications?

Proponents of the House of Representatives voting itself a 33 percent pay increase argued that the increase would attract bright new talent (news report, Nov. 17). They overlooked the 95 percent rate of incumbent return. Even off-again, on-again drug users boast a lower rate of recidivism. 
Nowhere in the private sector do salaries in the $89,000 range boast perquisites of nearly $30,000 in value. In corporate America, such a Tuesday-to-Thursday club as Congress is would soon find itself unemployed. Keeping campaign contributions on retirement far exceeds the benefits of even the most generous corporate golden parachute. Where in the private sector do pensions match those in government?
Surrendering honorariums rather than contributions from political action committees, which always favor incumbents, demonstrates how likely it is that bright new talent will be attracted and how welcome they'd be to the senior leadership.
Why not peg Congressional salaries to the median American wage earner's salary? Nothing would be more likely to provide insight into the financial problems of the ordinary American, that Congress is elected to serve. We'd know too that our representatives run out of a desire to provide benefits, not receive them. If Congress believes judges and top Federal employees need raises to prevent their departure to private industry, let Congress provide those raises, but forgo its own. Let's not forget that private industry considers merit before bestowing raises.
Even with salaries at the median American level, our elected representatives would fare considerably better than most with their perquisites of office: staff allowances, offices in Washington and in constitutent districts, assigned free parking at the Capitol and the airport, franking privileges, more recesses than the average American kindergartener and a variety and regularity of travel that has added a word to the language: junket.

HEADLINE: Bottom-Line Thinking Won't Save Our Climate

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Economic Watch article on the costs of limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide (front page, Nov. 19) raises troublesome issues. The extent to which society chooses to spend money slowing greenhouse gas emissions or adapting to inevitable climatic impacts does depend partly on the costs and benefits of the different actions. But traditional cost-benefit studies, such as the ones you cite, are an unsatisfactory basis for guiding such decisions. 
The true costs to society of global climatic changes are unknown, and they are unlikely ever to be accurately determined. We are not likely to know the full range of global consequences until climatic changes are upon us because of the difficulties of accurately modeling the climate. More important, many of the probable effects, such as the extinction of species, the loss of natural ecosystems and long-term human health effects, simply cannot be put into classic economic terms. Even calculating the costs to society of the more obvious effects, such as a rise in sea level, is fraught with computational pitfalls, methodological complications and controversial assumptions. Economic analysis simply ignores these issues, leading to the fallacy that what can be most easily counted is what really counts.
Equally disturbing, however, the costs of climatic impacts and the costs of reducing emissions will be unequally distributed. Many of the worst impacts of climatic change are likely to fall on poorer, developing countries without the resources to adapt to the changes. But the costs of prevention will fall on the industrialized countries responsible for the vast majority of the emissions. Thus the richer countries responsible for the problem may prefer to delay action on limiting emissions, while poor countries that cannot build sea walls or develop irrigation systems to save their agricultural production will be forced to suffer the consequences.
Finally, many studies suggest that some actions to slow the rate of climate change are economical and could be taken today, such as improving our energy efficiency to the level of Japan's, or eliminating chlorofluorocarbons that contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and to the greenhouse effect. Such actions should be considered prudent and inexpensive, preferable to taking no action and suffering the consequences. Waiting until imperfect traditional cost-benefit studies are done means waiting until climatic changes are upon us.

HEADLINE: Bush 'Talking Points' at Malta

BYLINE: By Richard Perle; Richard Perle was Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When President Bush sits down with Mikhail Gorbachev on Saturday, he will have in his briefcase a set of ''talking points'' from his top advisers suggesting what issues to raise and how to raise them. Here are proposed talking points that could help him seize the initiative from Mr. Gorbachev:
We continue to be concerned by your willingness to pour vast sums into military forces. Military spending is draining the Soviet economy, threatening your perestroika program and creating unecessary and most unwelcome tension between us.
We are particularly troubled by your continuing support for some of the world's most repressive and violent regimes: North Korea, Afghanistan, Nicaragua, Cuba, Vietnam. In Afghanistan, you spend $250 million a month to prop up a regime that cannot gain popular support. It is Moscow that ultimately is at the end of the supply line reaching the guerrillas in El Salvador. This must stop. 
There is a great deal of discussion in the West about how we might help your program to reform the economy. The best thing I can do for you is remind you of how much of your national wealth is devoted to military spending and conflicts abroad. (Note to President Bush: Since financial assistance for the Soviet Union would rightly infuriate many Americans, this approach will head off criticism at home.) We have made a good start toward the goal of sharply reducing conventional and nuclear weapons, but we could go further.
We should be prepared to reduce strategic nuclear forces below the levels originally proposed by President Reagan to Leonid Brezhnev. Since those negotiations got under way, the number of weapons that would be allowed under a strategic arms treaty has actually increased. Surely, we can do better today. If you are prepared to agree in principle to even deeper reductions in strategic weapons, I propose that we state in our communique that our negotiators in Geneva will be instructed to explore further reductions. We are also prepared to consider deeper cuts in conventional forces. Our proposals in Vienna call for sharp reductions in armor, artillery, aircraft and personnel. But why not reduce forces by, say, 20 percent beyond what is now under discussion? We both need relief from unnecessary military spending. Here's a way to accomplish that without risk to security on either side. If you agree, the communique could reflect our desire to move in this direction.
We have been watching with great interest as events have unfolded in Eastern Europe. I want you to know that we approve of the process of change taking place there. We have always believed in self-determination for the people of Eastern Europe and we are pleased that you appear to have accepted this principle. The people of Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia are demanding freedom. They should have it. They are demanding new leadership. They should have that, too. And, finally, they are demanding a new political and economic system. This too must be allowed.
I want to assure you that we have no desire, no intention, to exploit in any way the changes in Eastern Europe. We do not see the rejection of socialism as an opening to threaten Soviet security.
You should understand that the people of Eastern Europe believe socialism has failed them. That is their judgment to make. If they wish to establish free markets along with free political institutions, that is their right. I trust that when you were quoted as warning against the ''export of capitalism,'' you did not mean the Soviet Union would seek to interfere with the free choice of the countries concerned. We would view with grave concern any action to block their choice.
As you know, the Jackson-Vanik amendment denies most-favored-nation status to nations that deny their citizens the right and opportunity to emigrate freely. I have the authority to waive that restriction but only if I have received assurances that doing so will lead to substantially freer emigration. If you are prepared to give me those assurances, I would ask for a waiver under the amendment's conditions.

HEADLINE: THE TALK OF FORT DRUM;
Boom Times for Army Base and Its Region

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: FORT DRUM, N.Y., Nov. 29

 BODY:
On 2,000 bleak acres here in northern New York, the Army has opened a computerized firing range to hone the skills of 21st-century warriors. At a time of glasnost, the opening of the Berlin wall and talk of troop cutbacks in Europe, an M-60 tank demonstrating at the range's dedication on Tuesday fired at mock Soviet tanks and plastic soldiers called ''Ivans.''
The firing-range paradox - ''the way things are going, we'll be shooting with them, not at them,'' said Staff Sgt. Rafael Alvarez, the M-60's commander - is just one of many byproducts of the Army buildup at Fort Drum that began in 1985, when the 10th Mountain Division was reactivated.
In bringing 11,000 soldiers to the sleepy World War II-era base, the division has also brought monumental changes to one of the state's most depressed regions, flooding the area with jobs and people, causing a crisis of homelessness next to a housing boom. 
The newly completed $5 million firing range, which took almost 12 years to plan and build in the northern reaches of this 107,000-acre Army reservation, is the latest manifestation of the military side of the boom. It is a vast shooting gallery in which remote-controlled tank targets, complete with the smoke and sound of simulated muzzle flashes that pop up from behind hills. Other tank targets speed along hidden rail cars at more than 20 miles an hour.
''It helps us prepare for real live combat,'' said Sergeant Alvarez, whose tank gave the firing demonstration to a group of visiting military officials.
And then there are the Ivans, as soldiers have nicknamed the 60 plastic head-and-torso infantry targets in green overcoats and caps with the red Soviet star. Even the most dedicated soldiers concede that new designs may be in order.
 
Incomes on the Rise
The boom at Fort Drum has set off an economic, social and physical transformation in this region between the Adirondacks and the St. Lawrence River, known as the North Country.
The Army has built 4,000 new houses and apartments, on the post and as far as 30 miles away, for the 25,000 soldiers and their families. Private developers are building nearly 6,000 more.
The rapid demand for housing has rejuvenated the region's construction industry and triggered a demand for workers in service industries. The unemployment rate, which topped 20 percent five years ago, now hovers around 6 percent.
Per-capita income in Jefferson County has jumped to $13,338 from $10,252. Shoppers who once had to drive 75 miles to Syracuse to visit a mall now have the 95-store Salmon Run Mall with its choice of eight movies.
The signs of growth are everywhere. Housing developments have gobbled up hundreds of acres of farmland. Fast-food restaurants have sprouted practically overnight along Arsenal Street, a main thoroughfare in Watertown, the region's largest community, with nearly 30,000 people.
The Watertown Daily Times added a Sunday edition three years ago, and the paper's advertising volume is up 20 percent since the base's expansion. The hamlet of Great Bend is moving its post office out of a trailer and into a brand-new building.
''We're eons better off than where we were,'' said Terrence L. Roche, executive director of the Fort Drum Steering Council, an organization of local elected officials and civic leaders charged with helping to plan growth for the region.
That is a difficult task, since virtually none of the villages, towns and counties had zoning master plans. Under the review of newly hired planners, roads are being widened, sewer lines extended and water mains built.
The expansion at Fort Drum, also a training site for Army Reserve and National Guard Units from throughout the Northeast, has brought social changes to a region with a minority population of less than 1 percent. The A.&P. in Watertown now carries a wide assortment of ethnic foods, like smoked ham hocks.
One out of four soldiers is black, but the racial tension that many residents feared with the division's arrival has been replaced with acceptance. Black, Hispanic and Asian-American soldiers are volunteer firefighters, Little League coaches and church leaders.
''Our whole community is broadened and improved,'' said John B. Johnson Jr., managing editor of The Daily Times.
 
The New Homeless
Overnight success for some has meant overnight hardships for others. The demand for housing has sent rents and the price of new houses soaring, displacing many longtime residents on fixed incomes or with low-paying, entry-level jobs. Rents for a two-bedroom apartment, for example, have increased to $375 a month from $207 a month in 1984, modest by New York City standards but hefty in this market.
''We never had a homeless problem before,'' said Robert C. Dorr, housing coordinator for Jefferson County.
Right now, the county is housing 137 people in shelters or motels, compared with 30 a year ago.
''I'm as low as I've ever been,'' said Michelle, a 25-year-old Watertown resident who was evicted from her apartment in July. She has been staying at one of two shelters operated by the Community Action Planning Council, a group that helps the poor.
The rapid expansion has spawned other problems. The number of reported crimes in Watertown, mainly thefts and assaults, increased to 1,530 in 1988 from 1,186 in 1985, said Police Chief Michael J. Hennegan.
''We're definitely going through growing pains,'' said Carmen Bocciolatt, executive director of the Community Action Planning Council.
 
Flowers on the Graves
In the northwestern corner of the reservation, in a small clearing off of Fort Drum Road marked by two large pine trees, seven tombstones stand.
They are the burial markers of seven prisoners of war - one German and six Italians - who died during their internment during World War II at what was then known as Pine Camp.
The tiny cemetery is a forgotten reminder to many people here that Fort Drum onced had nearly 1,500 P.O.W.'s.
Lois Welser, however, has not forgotten. She remembers when the prisoners were here and remembers when she first heard about the little cemetary overgrown with brush at the edge of the woods.
''I thought they deserved better than a cemetary full of weeds,'' said Mrs. Welser, who lives two miles down the road.
So for 16 years, until 1973, Mrs. Welser cut the grass around the tombstones and laid flowers on the graves once a month. She badgered Army officials for the addresses of the soldiers' relatives. She reached all but one family and for years exchanged small gifts and cards at Easter, Christmas or whenever the mood struck her.
Mrs. Welser, who is now 65, eventually passed her caretaking duties on to the son of Italian immigrants. The Army now tends to the graves, and the letters from Germany and Italy are fewer. But Mrs. Welser doesn't forget. ''It'll always have a special place in my thoughts.''

HEADLINE: White House Won't Back Chip Subsidy

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The White House's science adviser said today that the Administration does not endorse an advisory committee's recommendation to provide Federal subsidies to rebuild the nation's semiconductor and consumer electronics industries.
''The money for direct Government subsidies to somehow reverse the situation by brute force is not now available, and it is unlikely ever to be available,'' the adviser, D. Allan Bromley, told a Senate Armed Services subcommittee.
''Even if such funding were available,'' he said, ''it is unlikely that such an approach would work.''
 
Aid to Consortium
But Dr. Bromley also denied reports that the Bush Administration may seek to slash Federal support for Sematech, an industry-government consortium working to develop advanced computer chips. 
''I personally am completely unaware of any move to reduce support for Sematech,'' he said.
Dr. Bromley said, however, that the Administration does not endorse the recommendation in the recent report by the National Advisory Committee on Semiconductors that Government financing for Sematech be substantially increased from its current level of $100 million a year. That amount is matched by another $100 million from American companies.
Senator Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat and the subcommittee's chairman, said he was ''concerned over recent reports of attempts by Administration officials to drastically reduce or eliminate funding for a number of existing programs, such as Sematech.''
Those reports emerged earlier this month when four lawmakers, in a letter sent to President Bush, said they had learned of classified and unclassified documents that called for cutting programs financed by the Defense Advanced Researched Projects Agency. The programs believed under jeopardy included Sematech.
The other Pentagon-financed programs facing cutbacks, according to the letter and comments by Senator Bingaman today, include manufacturing technology to develop robots and other computer-assisted equipment; high-definition computer displays, which involves an advanced technology that provides a much sharper television picture, and X-ray lithography, a technique used for producing powerful semiconductor chips.
Senator Bingaman said the Defense Department ''has an appropriate role in supporting research in long-term, high-risk, high-potential technologies.''
Dr. Bromley, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, testified that he shares the concerns about American leadership in semiconductors expressed in the recent report by the advisory committee, which was created in Congress's trade bill last year.
 
'Corrective Actions'
''In many ways, what has and is happening to the semiconductor industry is a paradigm for what could happen to other U.S. industries, such as the computer and telecommunications industries, unless corrective actions are taken in the immediate future,'' he said.
Dr. Bromley and Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher are two officials in the Administration who have been generally thought to favor Federal programs that will strengthen United States industrial competitiveness. The White House officials who reportedly support a Government pullback from financing high-technology initiatives include Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers.
The comments today by Dr. Bromley are the closest the Administration has come to responding to the reports that it is planning to cut support for high-technology companies that are trying to compete with Japanese and European rivals.
 
Panel's Recommendations
The semiconductor advisory committee recommended that Sematech's financing be increased immediately by $100 million a year, split evenly between industry and Government. It said an additional $800 million will be required over the next three years.
But Dr. Bromley said the Bush Administration does not endorse ''major increases in Federal funding levels for Sematech.''
He also said the Administration opposes creation of a publicly supported corporation to rebuild the consumer electronics industry in the United States.

HEADLINE: G.N.P. Rate In Quarter Put at 2.7%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The nation's economy grew at a moderate rate of 2.7 percent in the July-September quarter, slightly higher than previously estimated, the Commerce Department said today.
But most private analysts predicted a sharply weaker performance in the final three months of the year and the first quarter of 1990. A few even said they feared that the nation's longest peacetime expansion, which enters its eighth year in December, could be in jeopardy.
''We should enjoy these numbers because the chances are we're not going to see their like anytime soon,'' said Robert Dederick, an economist with the Northern Trust Company. 
 
Administration's Reaction
The White House was generally pleased with today's report. ''We always like to see increase in growth,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the Presidential spokesman. ''And this report is relatively good news in that sense.''
The Commerce Department had estimated last month that the gross national product, the broadest measure of economic health, grew at a 2.5 percent rate in the third quarter, matching the growth in the April-June quarter.
The revision was attributed mostly to a better-than-anticipated trade performance. The September trade deficit, which was the smallest monthly gap in five years, had not been reported when the original G.N.P. estimate was made.
Today's report said exports climbed at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter, compared with the Commerce Department's initial estimate that there had been no change. Imports grew 9.5 percent, compared with the 15.1 percent jump in the initial report.
Analysts, however, are pessimistic about trade, believing that the strength in the dollar will stall a further narrowing of the deficit.
 
Spending Remains Brisk
Today's revised report also reflected stronger consumer spending than previously estimated: It rose at a brisk annual rate of 6.2 percent, the strongest since the first quarter of 1988, compared with a preliminary estimate of 5.8 percent.
But analysts generally do not expect a repetition of the third-quarter jump in spending, saying that much of that surge came from automobile purchases encouraged by dealer discounts and financing incentives.
In another disturbing sign, the Commerce Department said today in a separate report that after-tax corporate profits declined a sharp 7.2 percent in the third quarter, matching the decline in the second quarter, which was the worst performance in three years. It was the third consecutive quarter that profits have dropped.
Most economists attribute the current sluggishness in the economy to a yearlong anti-inflation campaign by the Federal Reserve Board, which kept interest rates rising until the spring. Since then, the Fed has nudged rates lower, but the economy will not reflect the full benefit of rate cuts, and any further declines in the next few months, until later next year.
 
Improvement in Inflation
The Commerce Department also said today that inflation eased substantially in the third quarter as measured by the implicit price deflator, a price index tied to the G.N.P. The deflator showed inflation at an annual rate of 2.9 percent in the quarter, the same as initially estimated. That is down from a 5 percent jump in the April-June quarter.
The department also said that business capital spending, a bright spot in previous quarters, slowed to an annual growth rate of 4.6 percent, compared with the advance estimate of 5.8 percent. Analysts say falling corporate profits will cause businesses to cut back further in this area.
Housing construction, which has been in a slump because of higher interest rates, fell at an annual rate of 8.4 percent, nearly double the advance estimate of a 4.8 percent decline.
A positive sign was that inventories grew at a $21.2 billion annual rate, instead of the previous estimate of $30.2 billion. The downward revision reduces the prospect that an overhang of inventories will lead to production cutbacks and layoffs.
The various changes left the economy, after adjusting for inflation, growing at an annual rate of $4.16 trillion in the third quarter, $27.7 billion higher than the second-quarter pace.
Data included in the revision of the gross national product for the third quarter of 1989 follow, with all dollar amounts in billions at seasonally adjusted annual rates. Percentage changes are from the previous quarter at seasonally adjusted annual rates:

CORRECTION-DATE: December 1, 1989, Friday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about the economy misstated the third-quarter change in two price indexes.
The implicit price deflator was revised to a 3.2 percent rate for the quarter, from the 2.9 percent initially estimated. The fixed-weight price index was unchanged at 2.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Expanding the Atlantic Air Lanes

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
In talks that could intensify competition among European and American carriers and clear the way for trans-Atlantic travelers to fly directly to myriad new destinations, the United States is negotiating new treaties governing international airline service with its four biggest European trading partners.
If the talks succeed, American Airlines, as one example, might be able to offer new service from New York to Manchester, England, or from Chicago to Milan, Italy, while Lufthansa, the West German airline, might offer flights to Detroit or Tampa, Fla.
In a tactic meant in part to speed the European talks, the United States has already proposed giving foreign airlines what it calls unprecedented access to American cities that do not have comprehensive international service, as a reward for loosening the restrictions in many bilateral agreements. This offer is widely viewed as a sign that the Bush Administration wants to foster economic growth and widen competition among airlines by encouraging more flights to more cities in this country and abroad.
 
An Official Viewpoint
''What we should be doing is talking about how we open the market up. What is different is the acknowledgment by the United States of the larger economic value of international aviation,'' said Jeffrey Shane, the Transportation Department's Assistant Secretary for policy and international affairs and previously the State Department's chief negotiator of international aviation agreements. 
In an interview, Mr. Shane also said American attitudes are being affected by the plans for the economic integration of Western Europe in 1992. ''As the Europeans pull together, it is beginning to look to us like there may at last be a market overseas that is as large and as robust as our own,'' he said.
Negotiators in London today began a new round of talks on modifying the British-American treaty. Talks are also in progress or beginning soon with West Germany, Italy and France, as well as with many smaller nations in Europe and elsewhere. Earlier this month, the United States signed a new agreement with Japan that should expand air service between the two Pacific powers by at least 30 percent.
International aviation, unlike trade in most other goods and services, remains tightly regulated under a series of bilateral agreements reached through talks in which each side seeks overseas business for its own airlines while limiting access to its domestic market. The talks involve routes, fares and limits on service between the countries.
Representatives of a number of American cities have pleaded for the United States to liberalize access to their airports. A single daily flight from Europe, they say, translates into hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year at the American destination.
Europe is particularly attractive to United States carriers as well, because the elimination of trade barriers between nations of the European Community, scheduled for 1992, could form a single market as large as the United States, both in population and in the number of cities in which airlines could operate profitably.
 
Varied Reactions at Airlines
Some domestic airlines, like American Airlines, are enthusiastic about the latest United States proposals, contending that they will offer more opportunity for airlines to expand overseas.
American wants to expand the service it offers from Chicago to Manchester and to inaugurate service from New York to Manchester and possibly London. American also wants to fly from Chicago to Milan and Rome, a request the Italians have been resisting, said Jim Brown, an American spokesman.
But other airlines, including Pan Am and Trans World Airlines, are worried that the United States may trade away valuable rights to foreign air carriers without seeking equivalent rights for American carriers in foreign markets. New foreign flights into the United States, they fear, would undermine their most profitable operations without giving them enough in return.
European nations, for their part, are increasingly demanding broader access to American cities - for instance, by carrying more passengers between cities in the United States, something they are allowed to do now only for passengers who are going on to Europe.
The Europeans are also asking to be allowed to fly to more American cities. For example, the list of cities that Lufthansa's would like to add includes Detroit, Pittsburgh, Tampa and Charlotte, N.C. Airlines from the United States already have substantially free access to West Germany.
 
'Commercial Disarmament'
''If Europe is to be open to U.S. airlines, the United States must be opened to European airlines,'' said Lord King, the chairman of British Airways, in a speech in Washington on Tuesday. He said he considers his company and his Government to be proponents of free trade, but he added, ''I am not advocating, and will not practice, unilateral commercial disarmament.''
Aviation treaty negotiators have historically respected the interests of individual countries and their airlines far more than the interests of local communities and groups of nations.
Among the most vocal groups pleading for the United States to change that course are 16 cities and airports calling themselves the United States Airports for Better International Air Service.
One of those cities, Charlotte, is a prime example of a city with a thriving airport beckoning to international airlines. Charlotte appears to be well positioned to take advantage of a rule proposed recently by the Bush Administration that would allow many cities to be freely served by foreign airlines on international routes when no United States airline is offering similar service.
The new routes could be granted without bilateral talks if the foreign country already had in place a liberal aviation trade agreement with the United States.
 
Hartford's Ambition
Another city striving to enter the ranks of international entry points is Hartford, where there is no European service and where KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has offered to begin service to Amsterdam. ''A foreign carrier is our only hope at this time'' for getting international service, Governor William A. O'Neill recently told the Transportation Department.
The complex process of reaching route agreements has been complicated by the scheduled removal of trade barriers within the European Community.
This development will allow European airlines to operate freely inside Europe, presenting them with a competitive advantage over American carriers. ''The integration of the market will make possible the development of hub-and-spoke operations in Europe just as powerful in marketing terms as Dallas-Fort Worth or Atlanta or Chicago,'' Lord King said. His company is negotiating with KLM and Sabena of Belgium to set up a hub in Brussels serving most of Europe, he said.
The big question will then become whether American carriers will win the right to carry passengers between European cities in different countries even if the passengers are not flying on to the United States, and whether European airlines will demand the right to carry passengers between American cities even if the passengers are not going to Europe.
Lord King said that for years United States carriers have enjoyed an unfair advantage in their huge domestic market. ''Disparity in market strength has enabled the U.S. to trade limited access to the American market for larger access to the European,'' he said. ''Do not expect the nations of Europe to continue to accept such an unequal state of affairs.''
 
A New European Market
Mr. Shane of the Transportation Department said that the United States had not decided exactly how to seek its objectives in air route negotiations between now and 1992. ''What we are thinking very hard about right now is the prospect of a single European market,'' he said.
The United States appears to have chosen to seek benchmark agreements with a few European nations, granting them new access to American cities in exchange for loosening their own restrictions. In theory, this would lead to other liberal trade agreements with European countries before 1992.
But if the current negotiations fail, an alternate approach would be to delay signing new bilateral agreements and instead hold out for a single comprehensive agreement with the whole European Community.
Whatever course is taken, Mr. Shane said, the United States is committed to expanding international aviation, even if that means relaxing the United States' historical insistence on quid pro quo agreements.
The group of American cities that is pressing for expanded international service agrees wholeheartedly.
In formal comments to the Transportation Department, the City of Charlotte rejected the traditional idea, detailed in American aviation laws, that foreign airline routes should be awarded only if exchanged for benefits of similar worth to American carriers. ''Under that approach, the needs of communities, not balanced in this equation, often have suffered,'' lawyers for Charlotte said.
Foreign airlines have been quick to side with the smaller cities, and they say their strategy is working. ''We sensed a change in mood with the change in Administration,'' said Rolf D. Hoehn, Lufthansa's general manager in the United States.
Talks with West Germany recessed in October without an agreement, but they resume next month in Germany and both sides appear optimistic. Even without a new treaty, the newly proposed United States rule might allow German flights to cities like Charlotte. That proposal, made after the bilateral talks recessed, ''put a whole new light on the negotiations,'' Mr. Hoehn said. Not every city Lufthansa wants to serve would qualify for the special program. Detroit and Pittsburgh, for example, already have service on American carriers to and from Germany, so additional flights would depend on a new route agreement.
 
Split Among U.S. Carriers
The United States' new flexibility appears to have split domestic airlines. Pan Am, in its comments on the proposal to liberalize service to some American cities, called it ''a logical extension of the United States Government's quest for the unobtainable - a completely free and open market for international air transportation.''
''Why should countries receive any additional U.S. rights for free?'' asked David M. O'Connor, the company's special counsel for international affairs.
But American Airlines, in its comments, endorsed the philosophy of the Transportation Department, which holds that the new flying rights, reserved for nations with liberal bilateral agreements in place, can be an important incentive during negotiations between nations.
''The department's proposal can serve as a tool for removing the shackles that presently exist in several significant markets,'' American said.
Robert L. Crandall, the company's chairman, in a separate letter to Mr. Shane, was more explicit. Referring to two nations with tightly restricted aviation markets where American wants to expand its service, he said, ''We shall hope for rapid progress, particularly in the U.K. and Italy.''

HEADLINE: Treasury Official Seen As Choice for Fed Seat

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
David W. Mullins Jr., Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance, is the front-runner to fill a vacant seat on the Federal Reserve Board, Administration officials said today.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Mullins was the ''top candidate'' for the position, and that an announcement of President Bush's choice for the nomination ''could come any day.''
Other officials said Mr. Bush's top advisers on the matter, including Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, had recommended that Mr. Mullin be put on the Fed, but they could not say whether the President had made a final decision. 
The likelihood of the Mullins nomination was first reported today by The Wall Street Journal.
 
Popular in Congress
Mr. Mullins was an architect of the Administration's plan to rescue the savings industry and had primary responsibility for shepherding the measure through Congress. He is admired by many lawmakers and is not expected to have trouble winning Senate confirmation. The seat has been vacant since June, when H. Robert Heller resigned to become executive vice president of Visa International, the credit card company.
In recent months, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have been somewhat at odds. The Treasury has favored a lowering of interest rates to stimulate economic growth and bring down the value of the dollar. The Fed, focusing on fighting inflation, has insisted on keeping interest rates relatively high.
Mr. Mullins, 43 years old, who would be the first person named by President Bush to the seven-member board, could give the Treasury a stronger voice in policy making.
On the other hand, Mr. Mullins, a former professor at the Harvard Business School, is a specialist in banking, capital markets and corporate finance and not in overall economic and monetary policy. As a result, he might be expected to concentrate on the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.
 
Central Bank's Duties
In addition to controlling the nation's money supply and thus affecting interest rates, the central bank is responsible for regulating banking companies and the margin requirements that govern the use of borrowed money to buy securities.
Two years ago, Mr. Brady retained Mr. Mullins and Robert R. Glauber, who was also at Harvard Business School, as senior staff members on the commission he headed to investigate the causes of the stock market plunge in October 1987.
After he became Treasury Secretary, Mr. Brady named Mr. Glauber Under Secretary for Finance and Mr. Mullins his assistant.

HEADLINE: Shift Urged In Controls On Exports

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Business and labor advisers to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, called on the White House today to give the ''highest priority'' to streamlining its export controls.
They warned that if the United States did not move rapidly enough, Europeans would buy fewer American high-technology products and cut American companies out of cooperative research projects.
The planned removal of the European Community's trade frontiers by the end of 1992 and the march toward democratic capitalism of some Eastern European countries are already causing strains in the multilateral control system, the advisers said in a report entitled ''Europe 1992.'' 
 
Rising Tensions at Cocom
Europeans view a continuing American preoccupation with restrictive East-West technology transfer policies as misguided. Tensions have risen at recent meetings of the Allied control agency, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known as Cocom.
Mrs. Hills said she welcomed the report and added that the recommendations would receive ''careful attention.''
A European Community representative said the report would be ''looked at closely.''
''Our view is that the market will remain open,'' he said. ''We have no intention to raise barriers.''
In their 51-page report, the advisers said, ''The convergence of economic and political change in Europe is placing new strains on the ability of the U.S. to unilaterally control the flow of sensitive technologies that could enhance Soviet military capabilities.''
 
'Cutting Edge' of Trade Policy
Known as the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations, the group of business and labor representatives was set up by Congress in 1974 to advise the President on international trade negotiations.
In A letter to Mrs. Hills, James D. Robinson 3d, the committee chairman and chief executive of American Express, and Lawrence A. Bossidy, the director of the European task force and a vice chairman of General Electric, said that the issues raised by the European Community's plans for 1992 were the ''cutting edge'' of international trade policy and that their resolution would require ''innovative solutions in both bilateral and multilateral arenas.''
The report outlined other problems facing the United States as a result of the single European market, including the difficulties for American companies in breaking into such sectors as telecommunications and heavy electrical equipment. Because they are are largely Government-controlled, these European industries generally buy products exclusively from their national manufacturers.

HEADLINE: Dow Drops By 13.23, To 2,688.78

BYLINE: By PHILLIP H. WIGGINS

 BODY:
Stock prices fell across a broad front yesterday as traders concluded there was no possibility of an imminent cut in interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 13.23 points, to 2,688.78, as volume on the New York Stock Exchange slipped to 147.3 million shares, from 153.8 million shares on Tuesday. Declines on the exchange ran ahead of advances by about a 3-to-2 ratio, with 892 issues lower in price and 595 higher. 
The Southwest Bank of St. Louis, which often takes the lead in prime rate moves, raised the level it charges its most creditworthy customers to 10 1/2 percent, in line with other banks. Southwest's reduction of its prime to 10 percent on Nov. 8 was not followed by other banks. Analysts said that Southwest's return to the prevailing level indicated that it realized that the Federal Reserve Board was not easing credit as expected.
 
Future Easing Expected
''I believe, however, that because the economy has weakened significantly, a Fed easing and a cut in the prime rate are likely to occur in the near future,'' said Theodore Tung, chief economist at the National City Corporation in Cleveland.
Analysts also cited concern over the Commerce Department's report that corporate earnings were off by 7.2 percent in the third quarter. The department also reported that the gross national product expanded at a revised adjusted annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter.
Among individual issues, I.B.M. dropped 1 1/8, to 97 3/4. The company said it was continuing its efforts to reduce its work force but that there would be no forced layoffs.
Telecom plunged 5 5/8, to 25, and was the biggest point loser on the Big Board. The company said that earnings per share for the year might be lower than many projections of $1.30 to $1.35 because of lower revenues caused in part by increased use of volume discounts by customers.
 
L.A. Gear Down 5 3/8, to 36
L.A. Gear tumbled 5 3/8, to 36, and was the second-biggest point loser. Merrill Lynch lowered its earnings estimate on the athletic footwear maker for 1989.
Philip Morris added 3/8, to 41 7/8. The company said that it would buy back up to $1.5 billion of its outstanding shares from time to time on the open market.
Active blue chips included Chevron, up 5/8, to 68 3/8; BankAmerica, off 1 1/4, to 27 5/8; Chemical Banking, off 1/2, to 32 1/8, and Penn Central, off 1/8, to 25 5/8.
On the American Stock Exchange, the market-value index slipped 1.46 points, to 373.64, while in over-the-counter trading, the Nasdaq composite index dipped 0.85, to 455.81 Occupational-Urgent Care jumped 2, to 19 1/2, in over-the-counter trading. Analysts said investors appeared to be realizing the potential of an agreement between the company and a unit of General Motors.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-stock index set a record for the sixth consecutive day. The bellwether measure rose 36.16 points, to 37,021.46, its first close above the 37,000 level.
Japanese stocks traded here fared well in response, with Hitachi up 4 3/4, to 109 5/8, and Matsushita Electric up 2 5/8, to 160.
In Taiwan, stocks recovered with a record one-day gain after their record plunge on Tuesday. The primary stock market index surged 590.19 points yesterday, to 9,630.28, more than regaining Tuesday's loss of 547.98.

HEADLINE: Holiday Sales: Mixed Pattern

 BODY:
Sales in the early part of the Christmas shopping season ''have been pretty good but nothing exceptional,'' with a mixed pattern and regional differences, Rosalind Wells, chief economist of the National Retail Merchants Association, said at a news conference yesterday. 
Ms. Wells said apparel sales were strong, especially in women's clothing. But she added that sales were weak in goods like furniture, curtains and floor coverings.
 
Business was strong in the
Northeast, she said, ''very good in the Midwest and weaker on the West Coast, some of which may be due to the recent earthquake in Northern California.''

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Trading Focuses on Mark As Dollar Finishes Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance yesterday as the West German mark continued to dominate the foreign exchange markets.
''The dollar was relatively neutral'' as most currency traders focused on the mark, said Ronald Holzer, the chief dealer with Harris Trust and Company in Chicago. 
The mark fell amid profit taking in response to an increase since East Germany opened the Berlin wall on Nov. 9. The opening raised expectations that West German industry would benefit from the relaxation of East-West tensions.
Mr. Holzer said the dollar gained some support from a Commerce Department report that the gross national product grew at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the third quarter, slightly higher than the 2.5 percent rate originally reported last month.
In New York, the dollar rose to 1.7875 marks, from 1.7770 marks late on Tuesday.
The dollar weakened slightly against the British pound, which edged up to $1.5678 in New York, from $1.5670 late on Tuesday, and it fell to 142.86 yen, from 143.20 yen late on Tuesday.
Other late-dollar rates in New York, compared with those late on Tuesday, included: 1.5920 Swiss francs, up from 1.5880; 6.0935 French francs, up from 6.0710; 1,318.75 Italian lire, up from 1,312.75, and 1.16525 Canadian dollars, down from 1.6645.

 BODY:

 
September 1959: President Eisenhower and Nikita S. Khrushchev meet at Camp David, Md. The talks result in the ''Spirit of Camp Daivd,'' an effort to press for scientific and cultural exchanges and disarmament.
 
May 1960: Eisenhower and Khrushchev go to Paris. But the Soviet leader, angry after his country sights and downs an American U-2 spy plane over the Soviet Union, cancels the meeting. 
 
June 1961: Khrushchev and President Kennedy have heated exchanges in Vienna. There are no formal agreements. A year later, the Soviets send nuclear missiles to Cuba; the United States forces their removal.
 
June 1967: President Johnson meets in Glasboro, N.J. with Alesksei N. Kosygin to discuss the Middle East, the Vietnam War and nuclear arms. They come to no terms on those issues.
 
may 1972: President Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhnev, in Moscow, sign the first treaties setting limits on strategic nuclear arms, known as SALT I, and on curbing anti-ballistic missile systems. They agree to keep negotiating on arms, but regional issues divide them.
 
June 1973: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Washington. They agree to try to complete a new arms treaty by 1974.
 
June-July 1974: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Moscow and Yalta. They agree to a treaty banning underground nuclear-arms tests with yields exceeding 150 kilotons, and they arrange a 10-year economic accord.
 
November 1974: President Ford and Brezhnev, in Vladivostok, reach a tentative deal limiting missile launchers and bombers and lay a base for a second strategic arms treaty. The treaty is not completed before President Carter takes office.
 
June 1979: Carter and Brezhnev, in Vienna, sign the second treaty limiting strategic arms, or SALT II. Although the Senate never approves the treaty because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December of 1979, both sides agree informally to observe the limits.
 
November 1985: President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Geneva for wide-ranging talks on arms control and other subjects. They agree to revive cultural exchanges and to enhance air safety, but no arms-control agreements are acheived.
 
October 1986: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Reykjavik, Iceland, to provide momemtum to arms-control talks. The two sides speak of vast cuts in strategic arms and medium-range missiles, but the accord falls through because of disagreements over the American plan for a space-based missile defense system, or Star Wars, and over Moscow's insistence on putting all arms issues in one package.
 
December 1987: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Washington. They sign a treaty to destroy intermediate-range nuclear forces, known as I.N.F., and agree to seek a treaty cutting long-range nuclear arsenals. But Star Wars remains a sticking point.
 
may-June 1988: Gorbachev and Reagan, in Moscow, ratify the intermediate-range weapons treaty but make no breakthrough on cutting long-range nuclear forces. Reagan says important work has been accomplished but Gorbachev complains of ''missed opportunities.''
 
December 1988: Gorbachev says farewell to Reagan and greets President-elect George Bush at a two-hour luncheon on Govenors Island in New York harbor. Reagan assures Gorbachev of continuity under Bush.
