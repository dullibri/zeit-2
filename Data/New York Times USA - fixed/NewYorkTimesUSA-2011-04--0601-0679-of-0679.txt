HEADLINE: Why Johnson & Johnson Is Using Stock to Buy Synthes

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Johnson &#038; Johnson is paying for the deal in stock and cash, rather than incurring a tax penalty for repatriating money from abroad. 

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson's bid for Synthes, a Swiss-American medical equipment manufacturer, makes a lot of strategic sense.
The $21.3 billion deal will give Johnson & Johnson a leading position in the main orthopedic device markets. The combined company, for example, would have an estimated 60 percent share in trauma care. The acquisition will also increase J.&J.'s global reach, particularly in fast-growing emerging markets. 
But one part that is disappointing analysts and investors is why J.&J. is using cash and shares to pay for Synthes -- rather than simply cash. Roughly 65 percent of the total price is in stock. 
"The big surprise with the deal was the inclusion of shares and the amount," a Citigroup analyst, Matthew J. Dodds, wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday. "The long-anticipated deal for Synthes was less attractive for Johnson & Johnson than we previously thought," in part given the structure. He added, though, that the purchase "still makes sense."
When news of the deal discussions first emerged this month, Wall Street speculated that it would would be a good way for J.&J. to put a big chunk of its overseas cash to use. The company has $28 billion in cash and short-term investments, with roughly 70 percent of it outside the United States, according to Derrick Sung, a senior analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. 
Given that Synthes trades on the Swiss exchange, analysts figured Johnson & Johnson could use the overseas funds and not generate a big domestic tax bill. The pile of money sitting outside the United States has been an "overhang" on the company, Mr. Sung said.
But it turns out Johnson & Johnson would not have been able to avoid the tax bite as the Street had hoped. Synthes is based in West Chester, Pa. So the company would have faced a significant tax penalty for repatriating the funds from abroad. 
"We would love to use all of our cash, but we want to do it in a tax-efficient manner," Dominic J. Caruso, the company's chief financial officer, said on a conference call on Wednesday with investors and analysts. 
He added that Johnson & Johnson, like other companies with worldwide operations, is in talks with the Obama administration and the Treasury Department about changing the tax structure to make multinationals in the United States "more competitive on a global scale."
"We are hopeful that the administration and the industry can come to a more reasonable approach to the taxation" of large, global companies, Mr. Caruso said on on the call. 
To come up with the cash, Johnson & Johnson could have issued debt at a low cost given the current interest-rate environment. But management emphasized its "longstanding commitment to maintain our financial strength and flexibility," and perhaps more important, its vaunted AAA credit rating, a rarity in corporate America. On Wednesday, Moody's reaffimed the company's top score, although it changed its outlook to negative in light of the deal. 
Now, analysts are wondering whether Johnson & Johnson will move to buy back shares, to offset the dilutive nature of the deal. The company estimates the acquisition will reduce earnings per share by 1 to 2 percent. 
But Johnson & Johnson did not give specific guidance on that front. After repurchasing billions of dollars of shares in the last couple of years, the company has been mum on its plans for this year. 
On the call, Mr. Caruso said the first priority would be the dividend. After that, he said, Johnson & Johnson would use its cash "to build the business to create long-term shareholder value," be it through "appropriate deals" or "buybacks."

HEADLINE: Helping Students Find the Right Path

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
Maria Rodriguez, an associate professor of psychology at Hunter College, has been working with students in CUNY's career-conscious SEEK program -- the acronym stands for Search for Education, Elevation and Knowledge -- since joining the faculty in 1982. SEEK's mission is to provide academically and economically disadvantaged students access to a college education and to help them find appropriate career opportunities. In addition to teaching, Dr. Rodriguez, a licensed psychologist, offers academic, career and personal counseling. She is 57 and lives in Brooklyn Heights.
Humble beginnings: I was born in Coamo, P.R., and moved with my family to Camden, N.J., when I was 6 months old. My parents were factory workers. I went to Catholic school until eighth grade, and I was headed toward a vocational high school to study power sewing or beautician skills because we couldn't afford the tuition for a Catholic high school. But based on my grades, an eighth-grade teacher found me a scholarship to Cathedral Academy high school. 
The wrong track: Once I got there, I realized I had been assigned to classes on the secretarial track. I made an appointment to see a counselor and request a change to the college-bound track, but it was a different time back in the early '70s, and the school authorities and nuns were very tough. I had to go to them and challenge them in a nice way. I guess I sort of had to sell myself and prove I deserved it. But the counselor supported me, and it was a life-changing moment for me.
Making a difference: That's when the light bulb went off about how a counselor could really make a difference in a student's life and future. Because it happened to me.
Education, education, education: I received a grant to attend the Catholic University of Puerto Rico in Ponce. I wanted to get in touch with my Puerto Rican roots. I started out majoring in biology but didn't like the long hours in the lab. I ended up graduating with a gold medal in psychology. I went back to the States for graduate school, first at Bowling Green in Ohio, and then at SUNY Albany. I earned a master's there in 1977 and my Ph.D. in counseling in 1986. I got financial support to study at the New School and earned a second master's degree, this one in anthropology, in 1990.
More than money: A lot of students just out of high school are influenced by externals. They come to me and say, ''Tell me what's popular, and tell me what to do to make a lot of money.'' This is a difficult job climate; the hot occupation is nursing and health care, but it may not be the right choice. Yes, there's a need, but students need to consider if that's the field they really want. They need to think about what they have to offer. Too many students look at a job advertisement and try to match themselves to it.
Narrowing the gap: I provide culturally relevant education and career interventions for at-risk students, but I can't tell them what career to pursue. Oftentimes they do perceive a gap between how they present now and how they would like to see themselves in the future, and that's where I come in to narrow the gap, and help them compete.
Person to person: I love the fact that I'm dealing with students as a whole person, that if they have a personal problem, I don't have to refer them on to someone else. I work with students for four or five years and see them blossom. I can provide the kind of feedback they're not going to get from a computer.

PERSON: David Barton 

HEADLINE: The Man Who Made Workouts Cool

BYLINE: By TIM MURPHY

 BODY:
ON a recent Thursday night, the 38,000-square-foot David Barton Gym on Astor Place was throbbing to the Scorpions' ''Rock You Like a Hurricane.'' Up the white-plaster staircase, candles flickered in the virgin springwood-paneled yoga room. Down below, a line of porcelain doll heads grinned over the moodily lighted lobby as lithe young things churned past the reception desk, designer gym bags in tow.
In the center of the lobby, presiding over it all, was David Barton himself. In his 20 years as the bodybuilder-in-chief to downtown celebrities and partygoers, he has morphed into a kind of self-created cartoon superhero.
At 5 feet 5 inches tall, Mr. Barton is so hugely, broadly muscled that he appears almost cube-shaped. His thatch of brown hair was spiked and shellacked, his ample, exposed biceps tanned a blood-orange. He wore a chain dripping with silver fake razor blades, a tie-dyed sweatshirt revealing his bulging pectoral cleavage and stacked-heel boots that put him at eye-level with his female employees. 
''We call this Victorian punk,'' Mr. Barton, 46, said of the decor in his raspy, staccato, Mickey Rourke voice, his right biceps spasming, as it constantly does. ''It's like some punk rockers took over an old East Village church and made it cool.''
Few things at a David Barton gym look uncool. Since Mr. Barton opened his first gym in Chelsea in 1991, he estimates that he has grossed $230 million with six fitness centers in New York, Miami Beach, Chicago and elsewhere that feel more like nightclubs (noirish lighting, live D.J.'s, spalike locker rooms) than workaday gyms.
But recently, Mr. Barton has ''failed out'' -- bodybuilder jargon for not finishing a workout set. In December, he confirmed news reports that he was separating from Susanne Bartsch, the nightclub promoter and his wife of 15 years. In January, two former trainers filed a harassment suit alleging that managers called them anti-lesbian names and made offensive jokes about sex toys. Then a month later, the company announced it was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and partnering with Meridian Sports Club, a group of mid-priced gyms in California, to help restructure $65 million in debt.
''I don't know how to answer,'' Mr. Barton said, when asked about his current state of mind. It was a remarkable admission for a hard-driving, self-promoting man who, as a 20-something personal trainer, built a fitness empire with ''a pillowcase full of money.'' Added Mr. Barton: ''Nobody ever said this business was going to be a cakewalk.''
DAVID BARTON grew up in Queens and New Jersey, the son of a Shell executive and a United Nations secretary, but he made his mark in Chelsea, where he still lives and works.
His first gym, in the unlovely basement of a 1970s apartment building on West 15th Street, was an instant hit among the neighborhood's burgeoning gay populace. It featured a relentless house-music track, lush spotlighting and wall-to-wall mirrors that seemed to magnify a culture of muscle worship.
''I'd never worked out before, and that gym pretty much changed my life,'' said Amanda Lepore, the transsexual party hostess whose surgically enhanced body Mr. Barton has featured in ads. Mr. Barton would let Ms. Lepore and other downtown club figures work out free in exchange for the buzz. ''David showed me that I could sculpt my body with weights,'' Ms. Lepore said, ''which is better than plastic surgery, because you can control it more.''
Other clubs followed on the Upper East Side and in other cities, including Miami Beach, where the opening of the David Barton gym in the Delano hotel in 1995 helped brand that hotel as one of South Beach's hot spots and where, later, its move to the Gansevoort South was seen as something of a coup for that hotel. Toned down somewhat from the flamboyant Chelsea original, the subsequent locations still succeeded in defining an entirely new kind of gym experience, one that felt as much like hitting a glitzy party as logging an everyday workout.
''David Barton created the prototype of the gym-as-nightclub that has been widely imitated,'' said Taylor Hamilton, a senior analyst covering sports and fitness for IBISWorld, a market research company. ''They're probably the highest cachet gyms in the U.S. other than Equinox.''
In 2004, Mr. Barton fulfilled a dream to move his Chelsea flagship to a higher-profile site: the former McBurney YMCA, a century-old landmark on West 23rd Street. It became his most nightclubby gym, with the weight room swathed in theatrical shadows, D.J.'s pumping dance music at night and a fiber-optic light show in the steam room.
Tales of hijinks in the men's locker room became the stuff of gay urban legend. In 2005, a member, Carlos Sosa, sued, alleging ''emotional distress'' after witnessing sex in the showers and steam room. Gay news blogs had a field day, noting that such a grievance was akin to complaining about witnessing animals frolicing at the zoo.
It wasn't the first time that the gay issue bedeviled Mr. Barton. With his huge gay following and his own flamboyant, muscle-freak style, some had assumed that Mr. Barton was himself gay. ''I have every part of the gay gene except for the desire to sleep with men,'' he said. ''But I'm glad the gays want me to be one of them.''
Rumors persisted even after he and Ms. Bartsch, who is 13 years older and two inches taller, married in 1995. Held at the Manhattan Center with 1,400 guests, their wedding, sponsored by Playboy, featured Ms. Bartsch in a skintight Thierry Mugler bodysuit, Mr. Barton in a loincloth and their year-old son, Bailey, in a white suit.
There were 43 bridesmaids, most of them drag queens, along with Kate Pierson of the B-52s and the designer Betsey Johnson. ''It was almost ridiculous,'' recalled Kenny Kenny, a party promoter. ''It was a P.R. wedding. They're both really good at P.R.''
But the marriage that many thought was a publicity stunt had surprising heft. ''They were attracted to each other because of each other's power,'' Kenny Kenny added. ''They saw something dynamic in each other.''
The bond was strengthened by Bailey. Ms. Bartsch took time away from her nocturnal work schedule to raise him in his youngest years. ''I'm a drag queen, basically,'' Ms. Bartsch said. ''I never thought I was going to have a son. But David gave me one, and we ended up having an amazing adventure.'' (Bailey is now 17 and a junior at St. Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights.)
The family lived in the Chelsea Hotel, in three apartments combined into one. It was filled with massive canvases of sexy superheroes, an all-red master bedroom, Chinese opium beds, a separate bathroom for the cat and an endless parade of characters filing in and out. ''It was very Alice in Wonderland Goes to the Disco,'' Mr. Barton said.
But in other ways, the family's life together was touchingly mundane. The three would have cook-offs to see who would make the best tuna pasta.
''David and Susanne wouldn't have raised such a good kid if there hadn't been a lot of love in that family,'' said Derrick Smit, a longtime trainer at Mr. Barton's gyms.
Meanwhile, they had their much larger public family. For the past 10 years, they have hosted a holiday toy drive that Mr. Barton estimates has collected 150,000 toys for low-income children. The party, co-hosted by downtown royalty like Debbie Harry, Alan Cumming and Marc Jacobs, cemented the couple's status as king and queen of everything fabulous and freaky downtown.
A number of factors appear to have plunged Mr. Barton from boom to bankruptcy. To the delight of gym members, he developed a taste for design extravagance, hiring the high-end design firm Studio Sofield to create spaces where every square inch was swathed in luxe finishes and custom-made art, and spending an estimated $8 million to convert a former Barnes & Noble into the Astor Place gym.
Mr. Barton argues that bankruptcy was the result of opening several high-end gyms just before the recession hit. ''I made mistakes, but there was also a gym bubble that burst,'' he said.
But Rick Caro, the president of Management Vision, a fitness consulting company, said that the bankruptcy was more than just bad timing. ''Spending an average of $11 million per club is pretty rich in terms of build-out, even for the high-end sector,'' he said.
Mr. Barton's outsize personality might have also contributed to fiscal excesses. His office antics -- profanity-laced tirades, off-color remarks and mouthy bravado -- are legend among current and former employees.
''He doesn't have an inside voice,'' said Kevin Campos, a photographer who worked at the Astor Place gym, scheduling trainers. ''He would come in and never say hi to me, just glare. Then one day they just fired me and said, 'David doesn't like your energy.' ''
As for the harassment suit filed by the two former trainers, neither party would comment further. But Mr. Barton did offer that they had been dismissed, before the lawsuit, for training outside clients in violation of gym policy.
With the new partners, Mr. Barton no longer has total control over his clubs. But ''I'm still C.E.O.,'' he insisted. ''I still wake up every morning and say, 'This is great, I'm David Barton, I get to go work in my gyms.' ''
AS Mr. Barton's financials were declining, so was his marriage. The couple and their close friends were tight-lipped about the details of the separation. But several friends suggested that Mr. Barton's obsession with work contributed.
''He was like many others who've said 'career, career, career,' then wakes up one day not quite sure where else he's going to have happiness,'' Mr. Smit said.
Indeed, Mr. Barton can sometimes sound as if he's having a midlife crisis.
''I do want to have a little more balance in my life,'' he said. ''I think about my son getting into college, I want to play more music'' -- Mr. Barton has played drums since his teenage years -- ''and I want to play more with Bippy, the love of my life.'' (Mr. Barton sounds happiest and most at ease when talking about Bippy, his schnauzer.)
But Ms. Bartsch suggested that her husband's workload had little to do with it. ''I probably would have been bored if he'd worked less and come home at 8 and said, 'Where's my dinner?' '' she said, in her Gabor-like accent. ''That's not me, darling. I'm an independent woman.''
Friends of the couple say that the marriage broke up over Mr. Barton's wandering eye, an issue Mr. Barton said he did not want to discuss. ''We've split up a couple of times,'' he said. The first was in 1999, for about two years. ''I don't want to talk about the details of my marriage.''
Ms. Bartsch was similarly mum: ''I'm a big flirt, too, and he can handle that.''
The separation became official when Mr. Barton moved into a nearby apartment he had bought four years ago. ''It's a big lofty space with room to play catch with Bippy,'' is all he would say.
The couple remain friendly. Mr. Barton plans to play drums at Ms. Bartsch's Sunday party at Vandam. For now, they are merely separated, not divorcing. ''I'm sad,'' Mr. Barton said. ''But I think things are where they're supposed to be.''
The past few years have been rocky for Mr. Barton, even without the separation and bankruptcy. His sister Diane Barton, a doctor in the Philadelphia area with whom he was very close, died in 2005 after a long battle with ovarian cancer. His father died a year later. (His mother now lives nearby in Chelsea.)
''I went to a dark place, and I wasn't myself,'' he said. He channeled his despair by raising more than $100,000 for the Clearity Foundation, an ovarian cancer research group.
Large pictures of his late sister, as well as those of Ms. Bartsch and Bailey, hang over his desk, a kitsch-free touch in an otherwise Pop Art orange office in Chelsea. It was a Thursday afternoon, and Mr. Barton was poring over designer finishes -- python-skin laminate, see-through perforated concrete -- for four new gyms, including three in Los Angeles and one in Las Vegas.
How was he financing four new clubs amid a bankruptcy? ''It's a big Ponzi scheme,'' he joked, awkwardly. ''Every new membership is paying for the one behind it.''
Later that day, he led a walk-through of his Astor Place trophy with a king-of-his-castle strut that suggested that he's not going anywhere. He slipped into the men's locker room, where Tom Cole was on his way to the showers, a plush towel draped beneath his broad torso. An employee of a Broadway investor, he offered Mr. Barton tickets to ''Book of Mormon'' and thanked him for creating a chic space that inspired him to slim down and build up his pecs.
Mr. Barton felt vindicated. ''My clients lead intense lives, and we fuel that intensity,'' he said. ''The last time I checked, vanity and self-confidence were still in style.''

HEADLINE: Most States Seen Raising Jobless Tax On Businesses

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
As persistently high unemployment has drained the funds that are used to pay jobless benefits, more than two-thirds of the states expect to raise taxes on businesses this year to replenish them, according to a survey of labor agencies released Wednesday. 
Unemployment taxes remain low by historical standards: the survey, by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies, found that states have effectively cut the unemployment tax rate on businesses by 64 percent since the unemployment program began collecting taxes from employers in 1938.
The stubbornly high unemployment that has upended the lives of millions of Americans has also depleted the unemployment trust funds of most states: 32 of them owe the federal government more than $48.3 billion that they borrowed to continue paying jobless benefits.
Unless Congress acts, that money will have to be repaid -- with interest. The survey found that seven states were thinking about borrowing from the private sector to repay the loans.
Some analysts say that states kept unemployment taxes too low during boom years, so their trust funds were ill-prepared to weather the downturn. Now states find themselves forced to raise taxes on employers just as they need them to create jobs, and to consider cutting benefits while huge numbers of people are relying on them to survive.
Richard A. Hobbie, the executive director of the association of work force agencies, said the survey found that states would collect an average of 16.5 percent more in unemployment insurance taxes this year than they did last year.
The survey did not measure reductions to benefits. Michigan recently decided to pay only 20 weeks of jobless benefits, down from the 26 weeks that most states pay, and other states are following its lead. (The federal government pays for extended benefits after the state benefits run out.) Other states are capping or reducing the amount of money they pay in benefits.
George Wentworth, a senior staff lawyer for the National Employment Law Project, said an unusually large number of states were contemplating benefit cuts. ''A number of state legislatures are looking at reducing benefits as one of the ways to try to restore solvency, even though in most states it's not going to get you there,'' he said. ''It really erodes the stimulus aspect of the program, and it undermines its purpose, which is to provide workers with a partial wage replacement that they can manage on until they find another job.''

Darren Robbins and a partner founded Big D Custom Screen Printing in 2007. In its first year, the company, which is based in Austin, Tex., and specializes in printing T-shirts, recorded sales of $325,000 and a small loss.
THE CHALLENGE To become profitable, Big D must determine whether to cater to customers with large printing orders or small.
THE BACKGROUND Mr. Robbins, a former full-time musician who still plays in a band, was nostalgic for the multicolor tour shirts of his youth, which he described as ''works of art.'' He said he was appalled by the one-color shirts sold at today's shows. He was also disappointed by the quality of shirts created by some of Austin's many screen printers and said he could do better.
With that goal, Mr. Robbins and his partner, who worked for Capitol Records, invested a total of $225,000 to open Big D. The division of labor was clear. ''I was a natural-born customer-service geek, and he was a natural-born salesman,'' said Mr. Robbins, who resolved to take care of the customers his partner brought in. ''We wanted to be one of the big boys.'' 
As his partner traveled the country trying to win accounts, Mr. Robbins ran the shop, frequently declining business from potential customers who requested small orders. Mr. Robbins, 44, who has a background in ad agency account management, said that turning away business kept him up nights. He wanted every call to end with a sale.
By the end of its first year, Big D had grabbed a few big accounts -- local video game and record companies that placed orders for 5,000 to 15,000 shirts. But when the shop was not cranking out large orders, it sat idle. Mr. Robbins said his partner feared that small orders would prevent Big D from handling bigger jobs should they come in. But given his ad agency experience, Mr. Robbins said he was used to demanding clients and short deadlines. ''With effective scheduling, you can pretty much accommodate any customer,'' he said. Following the lead of his competitors, he charged more per shirt for the smaller orders he did take.
THE OPTIONS At first, Mr. Robbins and his partner agreed on strategy. With their industry contacts, they said they believed they could land accounts from major bands. Focusing on high-volume orders made sense to them in part because Big D's suppliers offered a price break on large quantity T-shirt orders.
But the partners did not realize that most bands were locked in to long-term contracts for their tour shirts. Given that, Mr. Robbins started to wonder about the strategy of chasing down high-volume clients, particularly when he had so many smaller prospects knocking on his door. But, he said, his partner saw no point in accepting orders for one or two shirts. His partner continued to believe big orders were crucial to profitability and that he could best win those accounts by conducting in-office presentations for corporate prospects across the country.
THE DECISION After a year in business, Mr. Robbins threw an anniversary party in April 2008 to thank his employees for their dedication. His partner, however, opposed the modest celebration because its cost meant the difference between breaking even and showing a loss on Big D's first-year sales. This disagreement highlighted the increasing tension between the partners' growth philosophies.
Determined to accept smaller orders, Mr. Robbins bought out his partner around the time of the party. The split was amicable, Mr. Robbins said, with his former partner breaking even on the sale and returning to the music business. And then the economy crashed. ''Almost overnight, companies tightened their belts,'' Mr. Robbins said.
At that point, he decided that no order was too small. He would find a way to take all business, even an order for a single T-shirt. He knew there would not be a lot of competition from the other local screen printers for the small orders. ''I noticed they weren't in a huge hurry to fit them in,'' he said.
Big D began catering to those with small needs, including a Houston comedian who wanted 20 shirts. Once he made a decision to take all orders, Mr. Robbins reassessed his costs and determined that he could make a profit on the smaller orders, even without charging the significant markup that many of his competitors charged -- a markup that effectively discouraged customers from placing small orders. Instead, Mr. Robbins lowered prices on smaller orders, bringing them more in line with the per-shirt price for large orders. Big D charges $5 per shirt for 40 to 499 white T-shirts printed with one color, while the charge for an order of 1,000 or more shirts is $3.50 per shirt. He was able to take this step and still make a profit because, regardless of order size, Big D's costs to print the shirts were not that high. Because of the quantity discount, the company would still make a greater profit on its large orders, but Mr. Robbins said he decided to ''be as fair as possible'' on the smaller orders. His prices for one shirt, a ''micro-run,'' begin at $25.
He also eliminated set-up charges, a common fee charged by printers, and put his prices on Big D's Web site, mostly so he did not have to memorize them. ''Many of our competitors make you come to them for a price quote, adding a day to the process,'' Mr. Robbins said. He hoped that Big D's transparent pricing would become another way for the company to differentiate itself.
''The competition -- and my partner -- thought I was nuts,'' he said. But Mr. Robbins said he understood his costs and could become profitable ''without gouging people.''
WHAT OTHERS SAY Carol Adams, owner of TorlyKid, (a children's clothing store: ''If a business focuses solely on fewer large accounts, and one of those disappears, the consequences can be devastating. We try to expose as many people as possible to our business, and that exposure can only come by nurturing the smaller clients as well as the large ones.''
John Olson, chief executive, Graystone Industries, a pond and fountain supply business: ''The partners should have targeted midsize accounts, handling larger orders when they arose and smaller ones to fill gaps. Mr. Robbins limited himself to a niche within a niche with little upside potential. He can run profitably and perhaps make a nice living, but the company won't be efficient.''
Michael Araten, president, K'NEX Brands, a toymaker: ''Like Mr. Robbins, Wal-Mart, Zappos and Amazon.com focused on small customers and transparent pricing, while making it easy for them to get customized products. Small orders pay for the day-to-day. Large orders are incremental profit that leverage Mr. Robbins's expertise. I'm certain he can have it all.''

HEADLINE: A.I.G. to Sue 2 Firms to Recover Some Losses

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
The American International Group, the giant insurer rescued by the federal government during the financial crisis, on Thursday will file the first of what could be a series of lawsuits against Wall Street firms, contending that it was the victim of fraud.
The initial suit, against ICP Asset Management and Moore Capital, will claim that A.I.G. suffered losses insuring mortgage securities created by ICP. The suit says ICP manipulated those securities in a way that benefited itself and Moore Capital, which is not accused of fraud, but harmed A.I.G.
Though the insurer received a hefty bailout, much of that money ultimately flowed to banks. Now, A.I.G. is trying to ''recoup potentially billions of dollars from the fraudulent conduct of these defendants and other parties,'' according to a copy of the suit obtained by The New York Times.
Because A.I.G. is still largely owned by the government, taxpayers would share in any recovery. A.I.G. informed the Treasury Department of the suit on Wednesday but made the decision to sue on its own, according to a person with knowledge of the litigation. A.I.G. did not notify the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which orchestrated its $182 billion bailout in 2008, because the company has repaid the Fed and is no longer tightly overseen by that regulator. 
As part of the bailout, A.I.G. waived its right to sue banks over most of the mortgage securities that it had insured through complex financial contracts known as derivatives. But the company did not give up its right to sue the managers of those deals -- like ICP -- nor did it cede rights to sue over $40 billion of mortgage bonds that it had purchased outright from banks. These bonds were responsible for a substantial portion of the company's losses and were held in a unit that handled securities lending, separate from the derivatives unit.
A.I.G. is preparing several suits against banks, like Bank of America and Goldman Sachs, that created the $40 billion in mortgage bonds, according to the person with knowledge of the litigation, who was not authorized to talk about it publicly. The company says it believes the banks issued misleading statements about the quality of the mortgages within those bonds, the person said.
Mark Herr, a spokesman for A.I.G., declined to comment on the company's planned cases against big banks -- which could be settled before going to court -- or the ICP case to be filed on Thursday.
A.I.G.'s suit against ICP mirrors a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commissionlast summer. The commission cited four mortgage securities, including two deals known as Triaxx, that were insured by A.I.G. ICP caused Triaxx to overpay for mortgage bonds to benefit itself and a favored client, the commission said.
ICP has denied the S.E.C.'s allegations in court filings and said that the company acted in good faith, did not make misleading statements and did not intend to defraud its investors. Margaret Keeley, a lawyer for ICP, declined to comment on the S.E.C.'s allegations on Wednesday. Ms. Keeley and ICP have not seen the A.I.G. suit.
The S.E.C. did not identify Moore, a large hedge fund in New York run by Louis Bacon, or accuse it of wrongdoing. Moore benefited from some actions of ICP, however, and should give up its gains, the insurer argues. Two spokesmen for Moore, which was also unaware of A.I.G.'s complaint, declined to comment.
A.I.G. believes other investors made similar profits and plans to sue them as well, once it learns their identities, the person briefed on the litigation said.
ICP may be one of few lawsuits brought by A.I.G. involving its derivatives unit called A.I.G. Financial Products, based in Wilton, Conn. Another derivatives case could be brought against Goldman involving seven of its deals known as Abacus. A.I.G. will have trouble suing over most of its other derivatives deals, because when it canceled those contracts, it signed a legal waiver agreeing to release the banks on the other side of the contracts from any future legal claims related to those contracts.
A.I.G. is said to believe it will be far easier to pursue lawsuits related to the unit that ran its securities lending operation because that unit had bought the bonds outright and did not renegotiate them as part of its 2008 bailout. The unit sought to make profits for A.I.G. by using shares of stock and bonds owned by its life insurance subsidiaries. To do so, A.I.G. lent shares to banks and hedge funds in exchange for cash. Then A.I.G. reinvested much of that cash in mortgage bonds that it believed were safe bets. Like many investors, A.I.G. was surprised when the bonds -- called residential-mortgage-backed securities -- plummeted in value in 2008.
These future lawsuits will focus on misrepresentations that A.I.G. claims banks made when selling the mortgage bonds. Bank of America has the largest exposure because it acquired Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. Other banks that underwrote bonds in A.I.G.'s securities lending unit and may be sued are Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns, which is now owned by JPMorgan Chase. The banks may try to reach settlements with A.I.G. to avoid going to court.
The law firm representing A.I.G., Quinn Emanuel, has filed other suits involving mortgage bonds on behalf of other insurers. A.I.G.'s suits against banks are likely to mimic those cases, which allege misrepresentations to investors over the quality of loans inside the bonds, the person with knowledge of the matter said.
In an unusual twist, A.I.G. no longer owns the mortgage bonds that will be the subject of the suits. The company sold them to the New York Federal Reserve in 2008 in a deal called ''Maiden Lane II.'' At the time of that sale, A.I.G. was paid about half of the bonds' face value -- locking in a large loss.
The road map for A.I.G.'s lawsuit against ICP was outlined by the S.E.C. Each case involves two collateralized debt obligations -- bundles of mortgage bonds -- called Triaxx that were worth $7.7 billion. When ICP created the deals in 2006, it partnered with A.I.G. to insure the performance of the deal. That allowed banks like UBS and Goldman -- the largest participants -- to buy both positive bets on Triaxx and insurance from A.I.G. in case it failed.
ICP managed lots of funds and other deals. A.I.G. says in its suit that those deals presented conflicts. ICP was supposed to ask A.I.G. for permission before it put new bonds inside Triaxx, the suit says. But as the mortgage market worsened, the suit says, ICP failed to do so on several occasions. In addition, A.I.G. says that ICP used Triaxx to help another one of its funds meet a demand for cash. Furthermore, ICP earned money from Triaxx longer than it should have because it overcharged Triaxx for certain assets, A.I.G. says.
A.I.G. is seeking $350 million in damages from ICP as well as what it calls a ''windfall'' made by Moore.

HEADLINE: Deficit Complicates City Ballet Labor Talks

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
As New York City Ballet prepares for its spring gala on May 11, the company is engaged in contentious negotiations with its dancers over their union contract, which expired in August. A federal mediator has been brought in to help with the talks, which have grown unusually acrimonious over issues like salary increases, overtime, sick-pay policies and dancers' participation in small off-season tours.
''It was never like this,'' said Alan S. Gordon, national executive director of the American Guild of Musical Artists, the union representing the dancers. ''Our goal is to make a deal, not to prompt a strike. I'm not optimistic.'' 
Facing a $6 million deficit on an operating budget of $62 million, the ballet company says it is simply trying to grapple with the tough economic conditions affecting all cultural organizations, namely a drop in repeat attendance and flat fund-raising. Katherine Brown, City Ballet's executive director, said the company's policies regarding dancers have been ''very generous'' and often more than the industry standard. ''There are certain things that have been givens for so many years that we simply cannot afford anymore,'' she said. ''We need to take a responsible approach to the organization so we can be viable and vibrant and around.''
Ms. Brown said the company hoped to break even in the next four to five years through audience growth, increased fund-raising and expense reductions. ''Right now our focus is on getting our financial house in order,'' she said.
The dancers say City Ballet is responsible for its own financial straits. ''They're chasing a bygone subscription model and doing a poor job of bringing the audience into the theater,'' said Devin Alberda, a member of the company's corps de ballet who serves on the dancers' six-member negotiating committee. ''We're not addressing some of the more troubling marketing or artistic decisions that are being made. We're not sure why the first place they would come to slash the budget would be the artists.''
The dancers have been more involved in the negotiations than they have been in the past. Mr. Gordon said about 50 of them showed up for discussions on Friday. Mr. Alberda added: ''There's been a real sense of unity. It has felt more and more like management doesn't respect its artists, and they're using economic conditions as an excuse to devalue the dancers' work.''
Overseeing the talks now is Joel Schaffer, of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, who is based in Oakland, Calif., and has experience with ballet labor disputes. The two parties, which have had three sessions with Mr. Schaffer, are to meet again on Monday.
The dancers are seeking a 3 percent salary increase for the year beginning in August and retroactively for the current year. The ballet has proposed a 1.5 percent increase for 2011-12 and a pay freeze for the current year, although Ms. Brown said about 25 percent of the company would still receive salary increases because of a contractual seniority schedule. She added that the administrative staff and orchestra members had recently taken salary cuts and freezes.
The company has proposed reducing overtime pay. ''We currently pay overtime when other companies do not,'' Ms. Brown said. But Mr. Gordon said this would put the dancers at physical risk. ''It's not only a money issue, but a safety issue,'' he said.
The two parties are also at a standoff over illness and injury policies. Although the current contract calls for sick or injured dancers to be paid for only 21 days, the policy has never been enforced. The dancers have proposed full sick pay for one 38-week season and at 75 percent for a second season. The company is seeking more limited parameters.
There are also disagreements about the terms under which dancers participate in small tours outside of the regular season. In January the company announced the creation of a smaller touring troupe, New York City Ballet Moves, that would perform at theaters and summer festivals. At the time the union moved to block the ensemble.
''If I were management and I wanted to provoke a strike, I would make the kind of proposals they're making,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''It's out of character for City Ballet to be so destructive in their proposals and so cheap.''
Ms. Brown said the company was simply doing what it must. ''We feel like we have the best dancers in the world, and we love them, and we want to be as generous as we can be,'' she said. ''There was a time when that was more doable. The world was a different place.''

HEADLINE: Starbucks's Profit Gains 20%

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SEATTLE (AP) -- The Starbucks Corporationsaid on Wednesday that its second-quarter profit rose 20 percent as more customers visited its stores, and it raised its earnings forecast for the year. 
The company said it earned $261.6 million, or 34 cents a share, for the quarter, which ended April 3, meeting analysts' average expectations. The profit was up from $217.3 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier.
Revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $2.79 billion, beating expectations for $2.73 billion, according to FactSet.
Starbucks said the underlying health of its business had never been better, despite the challenges of higher costs and a weak economy. The results showed the company's strength.
The company, based in Seattle, now expects to earn $1.46 to $1.48 a share for the year, up from $1.44 to $1.47 a share.
But that is just short of Wall Street's average forecast for $1.49 a share, and Starbucks shares dipped 69 cents, to $35.92, in after-hours trading.
The company said the new forecast accounted for a still bigger increase in commodity costs than it foresaw in January. It now says those rising costs will cut earnings for the year by 22 cents a share, up from 20 cents a share. The 2-cent difference reflects an expectation that dairy and fuel costs will keep rising, Starbucks said.

HEADLINE: The Chip That Powers Cars

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK and STEVE LOHR; Andrew Pollack reported from Hitachinaka, Japan, and Steve Lohr from New York.

 BODY:
HITACHINAKA, Japan -- A modern car is a computer on wheels. The window openers, the dashboard navigation maps, the fuel injectors -- these and many other operations are controlled by some of the 100 or so electronic systems in a typical car.
No wonder the magnitude 9.0 earthquake that knocked out one of the world's leading automotive computer-chip factories struck such a severe and lasting blow to the global auto industry.
Since the March 11 earthquake, the lack of chips from this plant is a big reason automobile production has slowed to half its normal rate in Japan, and is at a crawl in some factories in the United States and elsewhere.
And plant officials here on Wednesday acknowledged that this critical link in the supply chain would be restored only gradually, despite the round-the-clock efforts of an army of workers to repair the cracked walls, collapsed ceilings and out-of-kilter equipment caused by the quake. 
The factory here, 70 miles northeast of Tokyo, belongs to Renesas Electronics, which supplies about 40 percent of the world market for those crucial chips, known as automobile microcontrollers.
If it were the PC industry, customers by now might have found alternative suppliers for their standardized chips. But because of the way the automobile industry has evolved in the digital era, microcontrollers are usually customized for each car model.
That makes it difficult for automakers to quickly switch suppliers. And it has left manufacturers desperate for Renesas to resume production as soon as possible.
''We have an important role and responsibility,'' Tetsuya Tsurumaru, senior vice president in charge of manufacturing at Renesas, said on Wednesday, during the first plant tour for reporters since the disaster. ''We are aware of this and are doing our best to restore the supply chain as soon as possible.''
Mr. Tsurumaru said the company hoped to restart microcontroller production on June 15, about a month earlier than previously estimated. But output will initially be only 10 percent of capacity, he said, declining to predict when Renesas would resume full production.
To help meet demand, the company is shifting some production from the factory here to another Renesas factory in Japan not damaged by the quake. It is also farming out some manufacturing of automobile controllers to GlobalFoundries, a contract manufacturer in Singapore that has produced microcontrollers in the past. But shortages are expected to persist for months.
''Let's show Renesas's inner strength and unite our hearts to restart in June,'' read banners hung from the buildings here. ''Customers from all over the world are waiting.''
Thus exhorted, workers have repaired the factory's ceiling, as well as a crucial air filtering system intended to keep out dust particles that can ruin the microscopic circuitry of the chips.
Test production has begun. Workers in white suits with facemasks and hoods worked in the clean room to repair and realign sophisticated machines that must be precise to billionths of a meter. But red lights next to most pieces of equipment indicated they were not in operation.
To be sure, Renesas is not the only parts supplier knocked out by the earthquake and, in some cases, by the tsunami that followed.
Toyota said recently that it faced shortages of 150 critical parts, not only electronic controllers but also rubber parts and paint additives. The company, Japan's biggest automobile manufacturer, said it would not be able to resume full production until the end of this year.
Still, as a sign of how crucial this plant is, Japanese automakers, auto parts companies and other customers have sent as many as 2,500 workers to help repair the factory, called the Naka plant.
Automobile companies are not the only ones dependent on Renesas. For instance, Ricoh, maker of copiers and office equipment, gets some customized chips from Renesas. Ricoh executives say the Naka factory is their biggest concern among parts suppliers.
But microcontrollers, which are called mi-con in Japan (pronounced my-kone), are extremely important in automobiles because they act as the brains of electronic control systems.
A reason for the industry's heavy reliance on Renesas is that it is the product of mergers involving three Japanese semiconductor companies. Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric merged their semiconductor operations in 2003 to form Renesas Technology. Then, last April, Renesas Technology merged with NEC Electronics, the former semiconductor division of NEC, to form the current company, Renesas Electronics.
While different automakers once had their preferred electronics suppliers, after the merger everyone ended up buying chips from the same company, said Koji Endo, an automobile analyst at Advanced Research Japan, an equity research firm.
Renesas has emerged as one of the largest semiconductor companies in the world, with net sales of 1.06 trillion yen (about $13 billion), in the fiscal year that ended March 2010. (Partly because of the weak economy, its net loss that year was 137.8 billion yen, or $1.69 billion.)
While publicly traded, the company, which is based in Tokyo, is 90 percent owned by NEC, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric.
The Naka factory once belonged to Hitachi and is in a region where the electronics giant was founded as a motor manufacturer in 1910.
In automobile microcontrollers, Renesas's main competitors include Freescale Semiconductor and STMicroelectronics.
Automotive microcontrollers are mainly bespoke chips, with many different hardware designs and different types of software tailored for each design. That is partly a legacy of the auto industry tradition of each company designing and building vehicles to its own specifications. The automotive electronics industry is much the same, with many competing designs.
''These microcontrollers are different in small but important ways,'' said Tom Starnes, an analyst at Objective Analysis, a technology research firm. ''That makes it very difficult to switch to alternate suppliers, at least not quickly.'' Switching could take six months or more, analysts say.
A particular challenge is the highly customized software that provides instructions for the various chips. From automaker to automaker, ''there's no software compatibility at all,'' said Tomoaki Nakamura, who once oversaw automotive electronics for Hitachi and is now vice president for research at IDC Japan, a market research firm.
The lack of technical standards is in marked contrast to the way the personal computer industry evolved -- with its standard formats for disk storage, memory chips, microprocessors and a dominant operating system in Microsoft's Windows, although Apple's Macintosh operating system is gaining a bit of ground lately.
In recent years big automakers in the United States, Europe and Japan have formed consortiums to try standardizing some of their technology. The two main groups, AutoSAR and the Genivi Alliance, focus on software and electronics standards for drive train, information and entertainment systems.
Analysts say the crisis in Japan could accelerate progress on these standards-setting efforts, while prompting some automakers to reduce their dependence on Renesas.
''In the long term, automakers will probably spread their bets more to other major suppliers,'' said Egil Juliussen, an auto electronics analyst at IHS iSuppli, a research firm. ''And there will be more reason to push the industry standardization efforts, now that automakers have seen what can happen when a key supplier goes down.''

HEADLINE: A Mideast Private Equity Pioneer Looks Beyond the Unrest

BYLINE: By SARA HAMDAN

 BODY:
DUBAI, United Arab Emirates - Arif Naqvi isn't spooked by turmoil.
Abraaj Capital, his Dubai-based private equity firm, made one of its first buyouts in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, acquiring Aramex, a Jordanian express mail company that traded in New York.
''It was the first transaction post Sept. 11 of one Arab company buying another Arab company off of Nasdaq, so you can imagine the heightened level of scrutiny,'' Mr. Naqvi said. ''We bought Aramex, and it set us off on the journey of Abraaj.''
He took Aramex public in Dubai for $190 million, nearly triple the amount Abraaj paid, and it now has a market value approaching $1 billion. 
Abraaj is now the largest private equity player in the Middle East, with more than $6.2 billion in assets under management. In the last two years, the firm has been involved in 25 percent of the region's private equity deals, experience that has made Abraaj an important partner for buyout shops based in America that are looking to explore the area.
''Arif is a pioneer,'' said Fadi Ghandour, the founder and chief executive of Aramex. ''He is the quintessential deal-doer, never fearing to venture into new territories.''
Once again, Mr. Naqvi sees opportunity in unrest.
Amid the upheaval in Syria, Egypt, Libya and Bahrain, private equity activity in the Middle East has come largely to a standstill. Fund-raising is at a six-year low. Deals are being suspended, and some firms are pulling out of the region altogether.
But Mr. Naqvi says buyout candidates will be more plentiful in this environment, with companies coming up for sale that were previously unavailable. He is also pushing ahead on deals despite the current challenges.
Abraaj is on track to complete a $544 million deal negotiated in December for Network International, an electronics payment provider based in the United Arab Emirates. If it closes, the deal would be the biggest since the onset of the financial crisis in 2008.
''Abraaj announced one of their largest and most significant transactions at the end of 2010, showing clearly that there is real excitement about new investment opportunities,'' said Yahya Jalil, private equity director of the National Investor, an investment firm based in Abu Dhabi.
While acknowledging the region's difficulties, Mr. Naqvi is quick to point out that political and social change in the region is good for potential growth of the local economies.
''Am I concerned about our investments? No, because I hold long-term views and believe fundamentals in the region remain strong,'' he said.
His comfort comes from spending much of his professional life in the Middle East. After short stints at Arthur Andersen in London and American Express in his hometown, Karachi, Pakistan, Mr. Naqvi took a job in the early 1990s as a regional business development manager for the investment company Olayan Group in Saudi Arabia.
''I landed in Saudi on the first day of the gulf war,'' he said. ''The timing was near perfect. It was ideal to look for innovative business opportunities.''
When an oil spill in the Persian Gulf began spreading to Saudi Arabia, he reached out to a small American company in Anchorage that provided cleanup services after the Exxon Valdez disaster in 1989. Without even securing visas, he quickly brought the firm to the region to work on the country's decontamination efforts. Olayan, according to Mr. Naqvi, made millions on the venture by recovering oil and protecting investor interests.
In 1994, he branched out on his own, starting an investment firm in Dubai called Cupola. At the time, he said he had a ''grand total of $50,000 in savings'' and a Range Rover won in a raffle at a local mall. He also had few contacts. On the company's first day, an assistant accidentally deleted the information in his Casio digital address book.
Five years later, Mr. Naqvi was bidding against the world's largest players for the Middle East business of the logistics company Inchcape Shipping Services. After camping out in London with 14 employees for nearly a week, his firm won out, buying the business for $116 million. It was the region's first leveraged buyout.
He said the firm faced many difficulties in acquiring the Inchcape unit, but added that when the company was eventually sold, ''we made close to 20 times our capital.''
By the end of 2000, Cupola owned 35 companies in a variety sectors. With the business expanding, Mr. Naqvi hired McKinsey & Company to analyze the firm's operations and help set direction. The consultant concluded that Mr. Naqvi was running Cupola like a traditional private equity firm.
With its strategy newly defined, Mr. Naqvi decided to change the firm's name.
''We went to every conceivable P.R. agency and rejected hundreds of names,'' he said.
''Then one day my colleague, who now works for Deutsche Bank, was making doodles of Emirates Towers - or Abraaj al Emarat in Arabic - and said, 'Hey, why not just call it Abraaj?' The name brought us good luck.''
Aside from occasional trips to New York to visit his son at Columbia, Mr. Naqvi spends most of his time traveling across the Middle East. He recently added sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia to his travel agenda.
Abraaj is looking for companies in countries like India that are poised to benefit from the commodities boom and increasing industrialization. Last month, the firm opened a Mumbai office, adding to its outposts in Singapore, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.
Along with larger buyouts, Abraaj is focused on nurturing small and midsize businesses, in part to help increase the job pool for the young, unemployed population in the Middle East. It is a critical issue, Mr. Naqvi said, that has come to the forefront in places like Egypt and Syria, where protests that began as student demonstrations about jobs evolved into political revolution.
''In every speech I've given over the past few years, I've talked about the young population and the growing unemployment - and how economic reform is not being accompanied by political reform,'' said Mr. Naqvi, who addressed the topic at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this year.
''When it actually happened, I was as surprised as everyone else, but this doesn't change fundamentals in the region.''
With job creation in mind, Mr. Naqvi has set up a number of funds to support entrepreneurs and small business owners. In 2009, Abraaj created the Riyada Enterprise Development Fund, a $50 million fund that invests in small and midsize companies in the region. He has also partnered with the Palestine Investment Fund to support Palestinian companies.
His work has encouraged investment from abroad. Last summer, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, a United States government agency, pledged $455 million to five technology-focused funds in the Middle East and North Africa. Up to $150 million will be directed toward the Abraaj-owned Riyada Enterprise fund.
''It's about building a culture of inclusiveness in a fragmented region,'' Mr. Naqvi said. ''A lot of people say entrepreneurship is about failure, but I say it's about ensuring success by paying attention to every little detail.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bleak Outlook for U.S.-China Talks on Human Rights

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- By many accounts, the two decades of off-again-on-again human rights talks between the United States and China have been tedious and unrewarding exercises in diplomatic theater. If the Chinese are in an obliging mood, criticisms of Beijing's human rights record are grudgingly noted, allowing both sides to issue communiques describing the meetings as ''meaningful'' or ''constructive to enhancing mutual understanding.''
Michael H. Posner, the State Department official who is in the midst of two-day discussions with his Chinese counterparts in Beijing, is most likely finding the meetings more challenging than usual. To start with, Chinese intellectuals, dissidents and civil society advocates are experiencing the most severe government crackdown in years, with dozens of people -- among them leaders of several underground Christian churches and the artist and critic Ai Weiwei -- having been locked up without charge over the past two months.
The Chinese government has been in no mood to discuss its heavy-handed behavior, warning the United States this week that it would brook no interference in its domestic affairs and adding, as a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman explained, that ''China does not fear the antagonism of other countries.'' 
American frustration has been on display, too. In a break from diplomatic protocol, the State Department on Friday unilaterally announced the meeting just days before the event, even though the Chinese are the hosts, and used unusually blunt language in insisting that the recent wave of detentions would be high on the agenda.
''Things are looking pretty grim,'' said Kerry Brown, a China expert at Chatham House, an international affairs research organization in London, referring to the prospect of anything productive emerging from the meetings. ''Since the 1990s, these dialogues have maintained their presence pathetically, but they are at the moment at a new low.''
Such assessments, heard with increasing frequency among Western diplomats and rights advocates, add weight to an argument being made by some that the time has come for the United States and its allies to find new ways to press China on human rights. Until now, the administration of President Obama has sought to separate discussions of the subject from other thorny issues, like differences over currency rates or trade.
Although Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said this month that she was ''deeply concerned'' about the crackdown on dissent in China, she has been an advocate for separating human rights concerns from other discussions. In 2009, during her first visit to China as secretary of state, she suggested that human rights should not impede American and Chinese cooperation on climate change, security issues and the global economic downturn.
Nicholas Bequelin, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch, said the annual human rights talks that several Western countries had with China had become a cynical mechanism that allowed leaders to avoid raising such issues with Chinese officials during the rest of the year.
''Such dialogues are often used by governments to justify their lack of engagement and silence on human rights,'' Mr. Bequelin said.
The meetings also serve Beijing well, keeping talk of uncomfortable issues like religious repression, extralegal detention and the use of torture by the police largely confined to closed-door sessions that more often than not produce few concrete results.
As one British diplomat put it, ''It allows the Chinese to put all their poison in a box and call it human rights so no other leaders can talk about it.''
Despite their criticisms, few diplomats and human rights advocates are calling for an end to the sessions, which have been suspended several times in the past -- most recently between 2004 and 2008.
But some administration officials are privately saying that if the current talks end with no useful response from China, the human rights discussion should be shifted to the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue, a bilateral forum attended by high-level officials that will be held in Washington next month.
''The U.S. can't at once be encouraging people in the Middle East to stand up for their rights, and then not respond robustly to what's happening in China,'' said Sam Zarifi, Amnesty International's Asia-Pacific director. ''Something has to be done.''
Although they have long been a target for criticism, such human rights meetings -- and there have been more than 100 since the early 1990s involving eight countries and the United Nations -- have produced measurable results at times.
John Kamm, the executive director of Dui Hua Foundation, which advocates on behalf of political prisoners, said the discussions that took place soon after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, when American-Chinese cooperation was at a high level, spurred the early release of eight people on a list the American delegation presented to Beijing. In more recent years, he said, the discussions paved the way for death penalty reforms that led to a sharp drop in the number of executions in China.
Lorne W. Craner, Mr. Posner's counterpart during President George W. Bush's administration, said his job was made easier by the White House's muscular advocacy of democracy and human rights, issues Mr. Bush repeatedly raised with Jiang Zemin, China's leader at the time. ''They couldn't just roll their eyes and say, 'Here comes the human rights guy,' '' said Mr. Craner, who now directs the International Republican Institute, a Washington-based organization that advocates for democracy around the world. ''There was no ambiguity about how Bush felt on the issue. The message coming out of the White House now is just not as strong.''
In more recent years, as China's economic might has grown, those who participate in such sessions say they have become alternately combative and perfunctory, with Chinese officials lecturing American and other Western officials on their perceived human rights failings -- among them violent crime, racial discrimination and high rates of incarceration in the United States -- while refusing to discuss such matters as greater autonomy for Tibetans.
Despite his past support of the dialogues, Mr. Kamm of the Dui Hua Foundation said he was prepared to change his tune, especially if Mr. Posner's efforts this week proved to be for naught -- something that will become apparent in due course if none of the more than 100 political prisoners on the administration's list -- among them the American geologist Xue Feng, serving an eight-year sentence for espionage -- gain early release.
''It's hard to justify flying a whole bunch of people to Beijing at taxpayer expense if the Chinese only want to talk about human rights in broad ideological terms,'' Mr. Kamm said, adding, ''If you can't talk about human rights without talking about human beings, then I don't think the dialogues should go on.''

HEADLINE: Recidivism's High Cost and a Way to Cut It

 BODY:
Corrections costs for the states have quadrupled in the last 20 years -- to about $52 billion a year nationally -- making prison spending their second-fastest growing budget item after Medicaid. To cut those costs, the states must first rethink parole and probation policies that drive hundreds of thousands of people back to prison every year, not for new crimes, but for technical violations that present no threat to public safety. 
According to a new study by the Pew Charitable Trusts' Center on the States, 43 percent of prisoners nationally return to the lockup within three years. The authors estimate that the 41 states covered in the study would reap a significant savings -- $635 million in the first year -- if they managed to cut their recidivism rates by just 10 percent. For California's hugely costly prison system, that would mean $233 million in savings; for New York, $42 million; and for Texas, $33.6 million.
The study, which looked at prisoner release data in 1999 and 2004, found recidivism rates varied widely. Some of the highest rates were in California (57.8 percent) and Missouri (54.4). New York is slightly under the national average (39.9 percent). Oregon had the lowest: only 22.8 percent of inmates released in 2004 returned within three years. Crime has also declined significantly.
In the 1990s, the Oregon Legislature created a rating system that allows parole officers to employ a range of sanctions -- short of a return to prison -- for offenders whose infractions were minor and did not present a danger. A parolee who fails a drug test can be sent to residential drug treatment or sentenced to house arrest or community service. In 2003, the state passed a law requiring all state-financed correctional treatment programs to use methods that have been shown to improve client compliance and to reduce recidivism.
Pressured by the dismal economy, many states, including New York, are looking for ways to cut recidivism. The wise approach would be to adopt the programs that have proved so successful in Oregon.

HEADLINE: BP Profit Falls as Costs of Gulf of Mexico Spill Outweigh Higher Oil Prices

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- An increase in oil prices over the last year helped BP's first-quarter earnings, but not enough to outweigh the costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
But there are signs that the high prices have started to hurt demand in the United States and other developed countries, which could start pushing prices down again. Lower prices could make the rest of 2011 more difficult for BP and other big oil companies.
BP's rivals, including Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil, are still expected to report strong results when they release their first-quarter performances on Thursday. 
But some analysts said oil prices could drop about $20 a barrel in the near term, raising questions about whether such companies could keep up the stellar profit growth of last year.
''Concern about supply might fade, and there is a possibility that the world economy will slow,'' said Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics in London.
But ''the future is still bright for oil companies,'' he added. ''Oil prices will fall back but remain historically high.''
An improving world economy returned oil prices to higher levels in 2010 after a sharp drop in 2009. Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, reported a 53 percent increase in profit for the fourth quarter of last year. Chevron earnings in that period rose 72 percent, and ConocoPhillips reported a 46 percent rise.
On Wednesday, BP was the first of the largest publicly traded oil companies to report first-quarter earnings.
For BP, a higher oil price was offset by asset sales to pay for the repercussions from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. Earnings were $5.48 billion in the first three months of this year, down from $5.6 billion in the period a year earlier.
The company has sold more than $24 billion of assets to raise money to cover the oil spill costs. Production fell as a result. Including lost production from the Gulf accident, production fell 11 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.
BP set aside an additional $384 million for the oil spill in the first quarter, bringing the total to $41 billion.
BP's shares have fallen 23 percent in the last 12 months, while those of its largest competitors have risen at least 18 percent.
To win back investors, the company focused on exploration and signed cooperation agreements in India and Russia. But its Russian deal with the government-owned Rosneft was held up this year because of a legal challenge from its Russian shareholders. Russia has surpassed Saudi Arabia as the biggest oil producer in the world. New oil from the region could play an important part in ensuring sufficient supplies and the future level of oil prices.
Those analysts who predicted a decline in the price of oil said concerns about political tensions in North Africa and the Middle East had increased prices but were likely to fade. At the same time, there are signs that high oil prices discourage consumers from filling their tanks just as the summer vacation season starts in the northern hemisphere.
''The oil price is, to an extent, too high at the moment,'' said Christopher Wheaton, a director at the asset management firm RCM in London. ''We are at the point at which we get demand destruction.''
Still, oil prices are expected to remain high enough for companies to increase investments in drilling aimed at raising production in the longer term. Exxon Mobil said last month that it planned to spend about $100 million a day for the next six years on new oil and gas projects.
The drilling for reserves in more remote and harder-to-reach areas has increased costs for oil companies as they compete for talent and technology. The Gulf of Mexico oil spill also led regulators to tighten safety rules and delay decisions on exploration permits, often further increasing costs for oil companies.
One year after the rig explosion that led to the spill in the Gulf of Mexico, BP is still seeking to resume drilling in the region's waters, and investors continue to wait for BP to give a total figure for the costs of the spill.

HEADLINE: In a Mother's Case, Reminders of Educational Inequalities

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME

 BODY:
NORWALK, Conn. -- The tale outlined outside court by the defendant's supporters had a heartbreaking story line -- a child tossed out of school, a homeless mother charged with felony theft for the crime of sending him to a better school than the one available to her, the inequalities that define America's schools.
But despite the torrent of angry calls and e-mails that have flooded Norwalk's City Hall and school district as a result of the recent publicity, the case of the mother, Tanya McDowell, got only murkier on Wednesday as she pleaded not guilty to first-degree larceny and conspiracy charges stemming from accusations that she illegally sent her child to a suburban Norwalk school when he really lived in urban Bridgeport. 
Ms. McDowell's story has become something of a cause celebre since her arrest two weeks ago; education and civil rights advocates on Wednesday harshly criticized the charges against her. Others claim the child was summarily booted out of his elementary school in an affluent neighborhood.
Yet the larger issue of access to equal education is in danger of being blurred by the far more complicated matter of just what happened to Ms. McDowell and her son, Andrew Justin Patches, a kindergartner.
What is clear is that Ms. McDowell's story has become a window onto the gaping differences in educational quality from town to town or school to school, and the lengths that some parents will go to get the best education for their own children.
Connecticut, with its patchwork of poor cities and wealthy suburbs, has the largest achievement gap between black and white students of any state in the country. With economic distress widening and school budgets tightening, many districts are increasingly focused on making sure that enrolled students belong in the district.
''I'd do the same thing, we all would,'' Gwen Samuel, founder of Connecticut Parents Union, an education advocacy group, said of Ms. McDowell's actions. Ms. Samuels was among several supporters, including local N.A.A.C.P. officials, who turned out on Wednesday as Ms. McDowell made her first court appearance.
Ms. McDowell, 33, was arrested April 14 on felony charges of committing and attempting to commit first-degree larceny by using her baby sitter's address to enroll her son in a Norwalk school in the fall. She could face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, if convicted, and could be ordered to pay more than $15,000 in restitution, roughly the cost of a year's tuition in Norwalk schools.
''They went from zero to 90,'' Ms. Samuel said, ''without ever thinking about what they were doing to the child.''
The police began investigating Ms. McDowell after they were contacted by a lawyer for the Norwalk Housing Authority, which was in the process of evicting her baby sitter, Ana Marquez. Ms. Marquez was found to be in violation of her lease agreement, because Ms. McDowell had listed the apartment as her primary address so her son could go to Brookside Elementary School, where he attended kindergarten from September to Jan. 19.
Beyond that, much of Ms. McDowell's story remains in dispute.
She said she received a call from the school district in January telling her to remove her child from the school. The district says that no such call was made and that she withdrew him on her own. Under federal law, Ms. McDowell would have been allowed to keep her child at Brookside had she been homeless, but officials said that she never claimed to be homeless and that they were unaware of any evidence that she was homeless while he was enrolled.
Ms. McDowell says she is now living out of a van while her son stays with relatives in Bridgeport.
Her lawyer and N.A.A.C.P. officials said Wednesday that she was subjected to a body-cavity search when she was arrested. Norwalk's police chief, Harry W. Rilling, said that he had reviewed a videotape and that no strip-search had taken place. He said he was still awaiting permission from Ms. McDowell's lawyer to release the tape as proof.
The chief said the charges against Ms. McDowell did not merit the attention they had received; he provided news articles of several other cases, including three in Connecticut, in which parents faced similar charges of fraud and larceny.
Aside from this case, Ms. McDowell has three other charges pending, including two serious felony charges related to a Nov. 9 arrest. The police said she was found to be in possession of 60 bags of marijuana and had 14 bags of crack cocaine stashed under a black wig she was wearing.
Her lawyer, Darnell Crosland, said her pending charges had no relevance to this case. And school officials and advocates said that whatever her personal circumstances, they did not obscure the broader disparities in Connecticut and elsewhere that led some parents to stretch the rules in the interest of their children's education.
''Whatever the facts of this case, the challenge in the state of Connecticut and beyond is providing a quality education for all children,'' said Bruce Morris, director of human relations for the Norwalk schools. ''The failure of school systems to provide that is the larger issue that goes well beyond whatever happened in this case.''

UNITED NATIONS -- An attempt by the United States and its European allies to condemn Syria in the United Nations Security Council was rebuffed on Wednesday, as the willingness to intervene in the region -- strong enough to lead to military action against Libya under similar circumstances just weeks ago -- appeared to evaporate.
Western nations failed to secure the simplest of Security Council measures: a press statement calling on Syria's leaders to stop the violence against their own people. 
Envoys for several wary Council members that had agreed to at least abstain in the vote against Libya, particularly Russia, spoke out against any international intervention on Wednesday, while Lebanon would have found it impossible to support criticism given the influence Syria holds over it. The required unanimity among the 15 members for a press statement was impossible.
''The current situation in Syria, despite the increase in tension, does not represent a threat to international peace and security,'' said Alexander Pankin, the Russian deputy permanent representative to the United Nations. Intervening would be ''an invitation to civil war,'' he said. All council members addressed the body after it became clear that no consensus would emerge.
Russian leaders have been particularly scathing in recent days about events in Libya, accusing the countries taking part in military action against Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's forces of greatly exceeding the mandate that the Security Council gave them. Russian officials thought the United Nations intervention in Ivory Coast that followed, also carried out in the name of protecting civilians, went too far as well.
Diplomats and other analysts noted important differences in the circumstances surrounding the antigovernment uprisings in Libya and Syria. First, the March decision to take military action against Libya was preceded by appeals for such a step from the Arab League. ''Their voices can be important for the Council, at least in taking the first step,'' said Joanna Weschler of the Security Council Report, a group that analyzes the Council's actions.
The Arab League has been more generic on Syria, urging all states in the region to avoid answering protests with bullets.
In addition, Libya's United Nations ambassador himself appealed for action in announcing his own defection. Finally, Libya is an important oil-producing state, but it is marginal in terms of the dynamics of the region.
Syria, on the other hand, is a former close ally of the Soviet Union and a linchpin for efforts to end the Arab-Israeli dispute. Also, member states do not want it to descend into the kind of bloody stalemate that has evolved in Libya. The stability of Syria, said the Brazilian ambassador, Maria Luiza Ribeiro Viotti, is ''central to regional stability.''
China, which also abstained in the Libya vote, called for Syria to address the concerns of the demonstrators and, like many countries, supported an impartial investigation into the hundreds of deaths there. But it said that the threat to regional stability and the impact on the global economic recovery had to be considered.
Many states suggested that Syria had to be given more time to carry out the reforms promised by President Bashar al-Assad. Western states noted that Mr. Assad had repeatedly promised reforms after succeeding his father 11 years ago, while simultaneously jailing critics.
Various ambassadors said their efforts would now shift to other avenues. European Union members are threatening to impose their own sanctions within days, and a meeting of another United Nations body, the Human Rights Council, will convene in Geneva on Friday to discuss Syria, though the Arab League has reiterated its support for having Syria join the Council in May.
Syrian ambassadors were summoned in London, Paris, Berlin, Rome and Madrid to be told that Mr. Assad must refrain from further violence. If not, senior European officials said, measures that include an arms embargo, asset freezes and travel restrictions are inevitable.
Syria's ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar Jaafari, accused the United States of being quick to try to force United Nations action against Syria, while fighting efforts to stop Israeli violence against Palestinians living under occupation.

HEADLINE: Marathon Organizers Highlight City's Economic Gain

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
The New York City Marathon produces about $340 million in economic activity for the city, 25 percent more than it did in 2006, according to a new study produced by the New York Road Runners, which hosts the event.
The stronger economic impact race mirrors growth in the race -- which included more than 45,000 participants last year, compared with about 38,000 five years ago -- and other associated events. About half the runners come from overseas, and they tend to stay longer in the city, spend more money here and bring more family and friends with them.
The release of the findings comes weeks after the New York Police Department said it would charge organizers of the marathon and other ''noncharitable athletic parades'' that use the city streets for the cost of controlling traffic and other services associated with shutting down roads. 
The decision is expected to cost the Road Runners and other event organizers millions of dollars each year, and it almost certainly will force them to raise their entry fees in 2012, when the police department begins to bill for its services. The department has not divulged how much it spends on traffic control for races, or what formula it will use to bill organizers.
Because entry fees for races in 2011 are already set, the department agreed not to start billing organizers until 2012. Mary Wittenberg, the chief executive of the Road Runners, said that while she did not know how much extra her group would have to pay, she expected entry fees to run the marathon to increase proportionately.
''We are willing to continue to bear some of the costs,'' Wittenberg said Wednesday, but added, ''We're waiting to find out the arrangement for next year and then we'll finalize our fees.''
Entry fees for the marathon range from $168 to $400, depending on whether runners are members of the Road Runners and whether they live in the United States or oversees.
The Road Runners has long maintained that the race generates far more in economic benefits than it costs the city. Its latest study supports that point. According to a survey of 1,012 participants in last year's race, runners spend on average $1,778 per person on hotels, transportation, food and beverage and other items during their time in New York.
Runners from overseas spend $2,647 per person and stay 5.7 days on average. They also bring an average of 3.6 guests with them. Runners from elsewhere in the United States but outside New York -- an additional 20 percent of the participants -- spend $1,585 on average and bring 3.8 guests with them.
Over all, the race produces $304 million to $378 million in direct and indirect spending, the survey showed.
Wittenberg said unlike the Olympics, the Super Bowl, the World Series and the Stanley Cup, ''the marathon is here year in and year out.''
Richard Finn, a spokesman for the Road Runners, said that 80 percent of the $30 million in charitable donations raised during the race went to groups in the New York City area.
The race also generates about $17 million in city, state and other taxes, the survey showed.
''It's a very important part of New York's overall tourist industry,'' said Josh Wallack, the chief operating officer of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
Also on Wednesday, the Road Runners started announcing which recreational runners, out of the more than 90,000 applicants, had been accepted to run in the race this November. The winners of the 2010 race, Gebre Gebremariam of Ethiopia and Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, as well as the 2009 men's champion, Meb Keflezighi, have announced they plan to run this year.

HEADLINE: Pakistan Nudges Afghans Toward China, Officials Say

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- With Afghan discussions under way about the future involvement of the United States in the country and the prospect of long-term military bases, the Pakistani government has urged Afghanistan to distance itself from the West and tie its future more tightly to that of China and Pakistan, according to Afghans and Americans who are knowledgeable about a meeting between the leaders of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
During a landmark April 16 meeting here in Kabul, for which the most powerful figures in the Pakistani government flew to Afghanistan, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani of Pakistan suggested that Afghanistan needed to look to China, a power in the ascendance, rather than hewing closely to the United States. 
''There was a mention of China in the meeting, China as a country, as an emerging economic power, and that maybe we should reach out to a new global economic power,'' said an Afghan official knowledgeable about the meeting. ''And there was the suggestion that Afghanistan and Pakistan should strengthen relations.''
''You couldn't tell exactly what they meant, whether China could possibly be an alternative to the United States, but they were saying it could help both countries,'' the official said, referring to Pakistan and Afghanistan. The official asked not to be named because of the delicacy of the subject, which he was not authorized to speak about publicly.
The focus on China makes sense because it is a great power that would be acceptable to Afghanistan as an ally in ways that Russia never could be because of its history as a hated occupier of Afghanistan during the 1980s. And, from Pakistan's point of view, China provides a counterbalance to India, its archenemy.
The effort to draw Afghanistan away from the United States and toward China was first reported in The Wall Street Journal, and it was one of several proposals floated by Pakistan at the meeting, according to the Afghan news media. In Afghanistan, a number of Pakistan's other supposed proposals have gotten far more notice -- although it is not clear that they were portrayed accurately or proposed at all.
All the leaks, however, reflect the fears of different Afghan factions about the direction of Afghanistan's policy. One supposedly leaked list of Pakistan's proposals stated that the Pakistanis had asked that members of the Haqqani network, a Taliban ally based in Pakistan, be given a share of government power. People close to the Afghan government emphatically denied that Pakistan requested anything like that. ''It's ridiculous,'' said a government official.
Another proposal apparently brought up again was an offer from Pakistan to train the Afghan National Army, said an American official knowledgeable about the talks, but who also did not wish to quoted by name because of the delicacy of the subject.
On Tuesday the Pakistani government released a statement saying that it rejected the ''baseless assertions'' made in the Wall Street Journal article and that ''it fully supports an Afghan-led, Afghan-owned process for peace and reconciliation,'' as well as ''the key role of the United States in promoting stability, peace and harmony in Afghanistan.''
The statement noted that a trilateral meeting of Afghanistan, Pakistan and the United States was scheduled to be held in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, early next month, with the purpose of having ''strategic coherence and clarity.''
Stepping back, the jockeying seems reminiscent of the 19th-century Great Game days when larger powers sought to claim and influence Afghanistan. Then, Russia and England were vying for power. Today there are many more geopolitical actors: the United States, China, Iran, Russia, India and above all Pakistan, with which Afghanistan has close ties and deep enmities.
Pakistan, more than any other country, has leverage over Afghanistan's future because so much support for the insurgency in Afghanistan emanates from Pakistan's tribal areas and because Afghanistan is landlocked and will always be reliant on Pakistan for supplies. If the Pakistani government moved decisively to halt the insurgent activity, the war in Afghanistan would be greatly diminished.
For now the Afghan government is weighing the Pakistani requests, according to people close to the government and to its opponents. Dr. Abdullah Abdullah, a onetime presidential opponent of President Hamid Karzai, who served as Afghanistan's foreign minister and has been allied with the United States, said he saw this as a moment when Afghanistan was faced with a choice about which way to go. He said that he had some knowledge of what was discussed at the meeting and that the Pakistanis had brought a document with them that outlined their thinking.
''They said that the goals of the United States are confusing and uncertain, the American force is not reliable, and their power is not a reliable power,'' Dr. Abdullah said.
That perspective is influenced heavily by Pakistan's increasingly negative view of the United States, said Mr. Abdullah -- a point echoed by other officials knowledgeable about the meeting.
''One of the schools of thought in the Pakistani establishment is that the U.S. presence in Afghanistan is not for the stabilization of Afghanistan, but is for seizing Pakistan's nuclear assets in due time,'' Mr. Abdullah said.
However, the critical question for Afghanistan is what would it get out of closer ties with Pakistan and more distance from the United States, he said. ''They have failed to recognize Afghanistan as a sovereign country,'' he said, referring to Pakistani government officials. ''They still consider it as their back yard.''
''There isn't anything in it for Afghanistan,'' he added. ''It doesn't talk about the Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan, so it's like giving Pakistan a protectorate role vis-a-vis Afghanistan,'' he said.
People close to the talks said Mr. Karzai was considering Pakistan's points carefully, but had not yet committed to most of them and viewed them with caution because of Pakistan's long history of destabilizing Afghanistan through its support for the Taliban.
''The discussions were a good start; there are many issues to be discussed,'' said an official close to the talks. ''Of course it's a long way to go because in terms of our past experience with Pakistan, we would need to see some serious, pragmatic steps.''

HEADLINE: A Bernanke Conference, A Fed First

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday conducted the first scheduled press conference in the central bank's history, sitting behind a mahogany desk as cameras clicked and flashed. Mr. Bernanke explained his management of the economy in the calm, patient and serious manner of the college professor that he used to be.
He mostly retraced familiar ground, and the markets rose only slightly as he spoke, suggesting that investors learned little of consequence, although the three major indexes ended the day strongly. The news was in the spectacle of a Fed chairman addressing public concerns on live television. 
The central bank, so careful for so long to cultivate a sense that it was above politics, will now hold regular news conferences just like so many others in Washington, hoping to improve its image and build support for its policies.
Mr. Bernanke's message Wednesday was that the Fed was doing all it could to spur growth and increase employment without causing inflation to rise. He said that inflation must take precedence over employment because inflation would result in job losses.
''While it is very, very important to help the economy create jobs and help to support the recovery, I think every central banker understands that keeping inflation low is absolutely essential to a successful economy, and we will do what we can to make sure that happens,'' he said.
He spoke after the Fed lowered its projections for domestic economic growth in 2011, predicting growth of 3.1 to 3.3 percent. In January, the Fed had predicted growth of 3.4 to 3.9 percent, but Mr. Bernanke said that exports, construction spending and military spending had all been lower than expected.
The Fed also raised its forecast of inflation, projecting that prices could rise 2.1 to 2.8 percent this year, mostly because of higher oil prices, although it stressed that those increases would subside.
The Fed's policy-making committee voted unanimously on Wednesday to continue several policies intended to stimulate growth, including holding short-term interest rates near zero, and keeping the size of the Fed's investment portfolio at more than $2 trillion once the scheduled purchase of $600 billion in Treasury securities ends in June.
''Increases in the prices of energy and other commodities have pushed up inflation in recent months.,'' the statement said. ''The committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.''
Mr. Bernanke said that the recovery had become self-sustaining, meaning that growth could continue even without extraordinary government support, but he added that he still wanted to see a faster pace of growth and more job creation.
The government's official unemployment rate -- the share of the labor force actively seeking jobs -- remains at very high levels, although it fell to 8.8 percent in March from 10.1 percent in late 2009. Moreover, the unemployment rate would be more than twice as high if the government chose to include the large numbers of Americans who had stopped looking for work or accepted part-time jobs.
Mr. Bernanke cautioned that if the economy did falter, it could prove difficult for the central bank to provide fresh support because of growing inflationary pressures.
''The trade-offs are getting harder at this point,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Inflation is getting higher. It's not clear that we can get substantial improvements in payrolls'' without creating a considerable risk of a dangerous rise in inflation.
Mr. Bernanke spoke on the top floor of an annex behind the Federal Reserve's headquarters. The Fed allowed about 60 print and broadcast reporters to attend, passing them through heavy security and escorting them to assigned seats at long rows of tables. At the front were two flags and the mahogany desk.
The questions reflected the difficulty of the choices the Fed now faces. Some reporters pressed Mr. Bernanke to explain why he was not more concerned about inflation. Others asked why he was not more concerned about unemployment.
When Mr. Bernanke testifies before Congress, he often faces questions about a wide range of issues -- and sometimes issues that have little to do with economics -- but on Wednesday the questions stayed focused on the compact and complicated world of monetary policy. Mr. Bernanke responded in kind, offering technical answers that at times may have passed beyond the reach of any casual viewers.
The Fed's hope in part is to reach the broader public, to address widespread anger over the central bank's extraordinary response to the financial crisis by building public understanding of its actions. But the Fed also wants to speak more clearly to an audience of specialists and investors who hang on its every word.
In particular, by speaking immediately after the committee meets, Mr. Bernanke may create a reference point for investors confused by the cacophony of contradictory speeches given by other members of the policy-making committee in the wake of each meeting.
The Fed said Wednesday that it would maintain short-term rates near zero ''for an extended period'' -- which Mr. Bernanke defined as meaning that there would be no changes for several meetings. The committee meets eight times each year.
Critics of the Fed's position on inflation argue that higher commodity prices will push up the price of other goods and services. But Mr. Bernanke and his allies consider it more likely that the higher prices will force Americans to reduce consumption, because wages are not rising and therefore Americans do not have more money to spend. As demand drops, they say, the price of food, oil and other commodities will also fall.
Fed officials emphasize that they are concerned about the price of food and oil. But they say that best way to keep those prices stable over the long term is to ignore short-term fluctuations.
The decision by the committee was once again unanimous, despite public speeches by some members expressing misgivings that the Fed is underestimating the risks of inflation. So far, however, the most vocal critics -- Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, and Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas -- have not registered their concerns in the form of dissenting votes.
The committee next meets June 21-22.

HEADLINE: Pain at the Pump? We Need More

BYLINE: By DANIEL C. ESTY and MICHAEL E. PORTER. 
Daniel C. Esty is the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection. Michael E. Porter is a professor at Harvard Business School.

 BODY:
GASOLINE prices are above $4 per gallon in much of the country, a reminder that our dependence on oil carries a great cost. President Obama has promised that the Justice Department will be vigilant in pursuing price-gouging at the pump, but what we really need is to address the full set of energy-related problems, with a focus on spurring clean energy innovation.
Our trade deficit arises in large measure from the hundreds of billions of dollars we pay for foreign oil. The imbalances threaten America's economic stability and national security. Our consumption of fossil fuels and our energy inefficiency are a drag on our competitiveness and increase air pollution and the threat of climate change. 
To compete globally, we need to encourage clean energy innovation while letting the market decide which particular technologies prevail. Experience in fields like information technology and telecommunications suggests that creating demand for innovation is far more effective than subsidizing company-specific research projects or providing incentives for particular technologies. Governments just aren't good at picking winners; witness the billions wasted on corn-based ethanol subsidies.
The best way to drive energy innovation would be an emissions charge of $5 per ton of greenhouse gases beginning in 2012, rising to $100 per ton by 2032. The low initial charge, starting next year, would make the short-term burden on consumers and businesses almost negligible.
An emissions charge is not a radical idea; making people pay for the harm they cause lies at the heart of property rights. European countries participate in a cap-and-trade system that effectively imposes a carbon charge. Even China is pushing to shut down inefficient coal-burning plants by imposing emissions charges. Thus, instituting a carbon charge would have only a minimal impact on American competitiveness -- and might even improve it as the incentive for efficiency and innovation kicked in.
Our proposal would apply to all greenhouse gas emissions, so that everybody, and every fossil-fuel-dependent form of energy, would be included. Coal-burning power plants would pay based on the emissions measured at their smokestacks. Oil companies would pay for every gallon of gas or oil delivered. Yes, these costs would be passed on to consumers, but this is what motivates changes in behavior and technological investments.
Some will say that even the modest emissions charge we propose is politically impossible, given the death of the cap-and-trade bill that the House passed in 2009. But the ballooning federal deficit has created a new political imperative. A modest emissions charge will look attractive compared with raising individual income taxes or burdening the economy with new corporate or payroll taxes.
Let's be clear: the main goal is not to raise revenue. It is to create a powerful incentive for a gradual but steady shift toward clean and sustainable energy sources. In the short term, an emissions charge would create a major impetus for a move from oil and coal to natural gas, with its much lower carbon content. Gas would likely become the preferred fuel for new power generation, and by extension, for transportation, as electric vehicles become cost-effective alternatives to internal combustion cars.
Technological advances have made vast quantities of domestic shale gas accessible. The shift to gas as a transitional fuel would allow the United States to cut greenhouse-gas emissions by up to 50 percent over the next decade. In the longer term, the prospect of a steadily rising emissions charge would focus the private sector's attention on energy-saving and carbon-reducing innovations. The calculus for investments would immediately change. Anyone pursuing an energy-consuming project, like a power plant, would factor in the rising long-term charge into their choice of technology. People buying new cars would have an added incentive to think about fuel economy.
Entrepreneurial spirit would be unleashed in companies from multinational enterprises to back-of-the-garage inventors. By stimulating major gains in energy productivity and renewable energy, our approach would help stimulate global growth and free up resources to meet other pressing needs.
In tackling our trade imbalance, budget deficit, competitiveness challenges and oil-related vulnerability -- not to mention climate change -- our plan has a powerful logic. And because it harnesses our capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship, it could attract broad support, and a bipartisan majority in Congress.

HEADLINE: Great Leap Backward

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
SHANGHAI
Since China is in the middle of its harshest crackdown on independent thought in two decades, I thought that on this visit I might write about a woman named Cheng Jianping who is imprisoned for tweeting.
Ms. Cheng was arrested on what was supposed to have been her wedding day last fall for sending a single sarcastic Twitter message that included the words ''charge, angry youth.'' The government, lacking a sense of humor, sentenced her to a year in labor camp.
So I tried to interview her fiance, Hua Chunhui, but it turns out that Mr. Hua was recently arrested and imprisoned as well. That's the way it goes in China these days. The government's crackdown is rippling through the country, undercutting China's prodigious growth and representing the harshest clampdown since the crushing of the Tiananmen democracy movement in 1989. 
The reason? Surprising as it may seem, the government is worried that China could become the next Egypt or Tunisia, unless security forces act early and ruthlessly.
''Of course, they're scared that the same thing might happen here,'' one Chinese friend with family and professional ties to top leaders told me. A family member of another Chinese leader put it this way: ''They're just terrified. That's why they're cracking down.''
Yet another official says that the Politburo internalized a basic lesson from the Tiananmen movement: It's crucial to suppress protests early, before they gain traction. He says that from China's point of view, the mistake that autocrats in Egypt and Tunisia made was not cracking down earlier and harder.
Paranoia also plays a role. Some Chinese leaders believe that America is nurturing a movement to subvert the government. Chen Jiping, a senior official, expressed this fear when he warned recently against ''hostile Western forces attempting to Westernize and split us.'' China, for a time, even blocked access to the blog of the outgoing American ambassador, Jon Huntsman Jr.
In truth, the differences with Egypt and Tunisia are profound. China's leaders may be just as autocratic as those in the Middle East, and just as corrupt, but they're far more competent. They've overseen astonishing improvements in the standard of living, in education, in health, in infrastructure. But I don't want to get ahead of myself: That's the topic of my next column.
Another reason for the crackdown seems to be jitters over the transfer of power next year. President Hu Jintao, who seems, to me, to be the least visionary Communist Party leader since Hua Guofeng in the late-1970s, is expected to step down and be replaced by Xi Jinping, the current vice president. Officials say that the plan is for Li Keqiang to be prime minister and Wang Qishan (perhaps the ablest of the three) to be deputy prime minister.
But there is still jockeying, partly because President Hu is weak. Chinese officials are remarkably open about criticizing Mr. Hu, and the critics are said to include the military brass and former President Jiang Zemin. The complaints have little to do with the crackdown on dissent (''That's just a very small issue to them,'' one Chinese official explained to me), and more to do with the way Mr. Hu has frozen or backtracked on economic and political reforms, allowed inflation to stir and harmed relations with the U.S.
Many ordinary Chinese seem to feel the same way. Most Chinese I have talked to don't care much about dissidents; their main concerns are inflation, corruption and better jobs. Moreover, they feel freer in their daily lives -- so long as they don't challenge the government, it mostly will leave them alone.
Still, the crackdown represents a great leap backward, and it is particularly nasty in two respects.
First, the government is arresting not only dissidents and Christians but also their family members and even their lawyers. Second, after a long period in which police would torture working-class prisoners but usually not intellectuals, the authorities are again brutalizing white-collar dissidents.
One lawyer, Gao Zhisheng, was arrested and, by his account, subjected to beatings and electric shocks because he had represented Christians and dissidents. After a brief stint of freedom nearly a year ago, he apparently was arrested again and vanished. In China, ''disappear'' has become a transitive verb.
The crackdown has extended to the Internet. My teenage daughter, with me on this trip, complains that in China ''everything is blocked.'' By that, she means that Facebook and YouTube are walled off, access to Gmail and Google searches comes and goes, and even her homework on Google Documents is inaccessible.
Here we have a country that is coming of age, with an economic rise that is pretty much unprecedented in the history of the world -- and it tarnishes those achievements with a harsh crackdown. For those of us who love China and believe in its future, this retreat is painful to watch.

HEADLINE: Citing 'Silliness,' Obama Shows Birth Certificate

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama released his long-form birth certificate on Wednesday, a step that injected him directly into the simmering ''birther'' controversy in the hope of finally ending it, or even turning it to his advantage.
The gamble produced dramatic television as Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room to address, head on, a subject that had been deemed irrelevant by everyone in his orbit for years even as it stoked conservative efforts to undermine his legitimacy as president. 
Mr. Obama's comments risked elevating the discredited questions about where he was born, but also allowed him to cast his political opponents as focused on the trivial at a time when the nation is facing more important issues.
And because much of the recent attention about where he was born came from Donald J. Trump, who says he is considering a run for the Republican presidential nomination and spent the day campaigning in New Hampshire, it allowed the White House to use Mr. Trump as a foil for the president's efforts to cast himself as a more serious leader than his potential rivals in the 2012 race.
''We're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers,'' Mr. Obama said, a clear reference -- if not by name -- to Mr. Trump.
Mr. Obama's complaint that the controversy threatened to distract politicians from the country's big problems produced a hall-of-mirrors-like reverberation from his Republican adversaries, some of whom had raised doubts about his birthplace but now accused the president of releasing the documents to distract from the country's big problems.
Reince Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, said in a statement: ''The president ought to spend his time getting serious about repairing our economy, working with Republicans and focusing on the long-term sustainability of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Unfortunately his campaign politics and talk about birth certificates is distracting him from our No. 1 priority -- our economy.''
Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and a potential 2012 rival, said in a Twitter message that the news media should not ''let the WH distract you w/the birth crt'' from stories like the public comments of Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve bank.
False accusations about Mr. Obama's being born abroad -- and the implication that his election was thus invalid -- have percolated on the Internet and among conspiracy theorists since the early days of his presidential campaign, when aides distributed a shorter version of the birth certificate that is normally given out by officials in Hawaii.
But White House officials concluded about a month ago that the falsehoods had moved from ''the nether regions of the Internet'' into the mainstream political arena, thanks in large part to the efforts of Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and reality television host who has used the issue as a media magnet.
A New York Times survey taken two weeks ago found that nearly 25 percent of Americans believed Mr. Obama was born in another country; 45 percent of Republicans said they believed that.
Some Democratic activists crowed Wednesday that Mr. Obama had slyly offered a contrast between the president and his likely Republican challengers. Markos Moulitsas, a liberal blogger, wrote, ''What better way to show how out of touch and irrational Republicans are than to rub this in their face?''
But White House aides turned back that suggestion, saying it would have been more politically savvy to let the Republicans continue to question his birth certificate since the conservatives most interested in that issue are unlikely to vote for Mr. Obama anyway.
The birth certificate, which is posted on the White House Web site, shows that Mr. Obama was born in Honolulu and is signed by state officials and his mother. It is more detailed than the one officials presented during the 2008 campaign, showing the name of the hospital where Mr. Obama was born and including the signature of the attending physician.
Hawaii does not normally release the long-form certificate, but did so in response to a request for a waiver of state policy by Mr. Obama and his lawyers.
In a news conference Wednesday morning that produced split-screen images on cable television networks, Mr. Trump claimed credit for forcing Mr. Obama's hand, saying, ''I feel I've accomplished something really, really important.'' But he said the document would have to be examined for authenticity.
''We have to look at it. A lot of people have to look at it,'' he said. ''I hope it's true, and the reason I hope it's true is because we have real problems in this country.''
Chatter on Internet forums suggested that hard-core conspiracy buffs were unlikely to be convinced by the White House disclosure. Several postings suggested that the document might be a forgery; others sought to shift the topic to questions about Mr. Obama's adoption by his stepfather.
White House officials said they hoped to at least bring an end to discussion of the topic in the mainstream news.
''I know that there's going to be a segment of people for which, no matter what we put out, this issue will not be put to rest,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But I'm speaking to the vast majority of the American people, as well as to the press. We do not have time for this kind of silliness.''
Mr. Obama, at a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York on Wednesday night, made light of the issue. ''My name is Barack Obama, I was born in Hawaii, I'm president of the United States, and I'm running for re-election,'' he said, grinning. The Democratic Party faithful cheered.

HEADLINE: On Trail, Trump Basks In Spotlight

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
PORTSMOUTH, N.H. -- Donald J. Trump descended from a black helicopter emblazoned with his name, strode across the tarmac and stood for 30 seconds until he made sure the cameras were in place.
''You ready?'' he said, a confident smile spreading across his face. ''Is everybody ready?''
Mr. Trump's visit to New Hampshire on Wednesday had all the makings of a made-for-television moment well before the White House produced President Obama's ''long-form'' birth certificate. But Mr. Obama's decision to weigh into the debate over the authenticity of his American citizenship added another curious layer of complexity to Mr. Trump's arrival here. 
''I'm very proud of myself because I've accomplished something that nobody else has been able to accomplish,'' Mr. Trump said. ''I am really honored, frankly, to have played such a big role in hopefully, hopefully, getting rid of this issue.''
Yet throughout the day on his inaugural trip to New Hampshire -- in this election cycle, at least -- Mr. Trump proceeded to keep bringing up the subject, which he has pushed repeatedly in recent weeks in attacking Mr. Obama. He mentioned it in a stop at the Roundabout Diner. He raised it during a private Republican fund-raising luncheon. And he asked factory workers whether they had heard the news.
''Oh, by the way, I don't know if you heard? Did you hear?'' he asked employees of Wilcox Industries, a military manufacturing firm in nearby Newington. ''I am so proud of myself. I got this guy to release his birth certificate. I'm really, really happy.''
But Mr. Trump, who was introduced to crowds here as a business mogul, entrepreneur and entertainment icon, had much more to say during his visit to the state that holds the first primary of the Republican presidential nominating contest. He said that he was ''very serious'' about joining the presidential race and would disclose his decision after May 22, when his television show ''Celebrity Apprentice'' ends.
''I know in my mind, yes. I know what I am going to do,'' Mr. Trump said in an interview with WMUR-TV, a destination for all visiting political figures. ''If I run, I give up a lot.''
Mr. Trump has flashed his presidential aspirations before: in 1988 (as a Democrat) and in 1999 (as a Reform Party candidate). But his visit, which lasted a little more than seven hours, was filled with all of the requisite stops that presidential candidates make, far more than simply a drive-by photo opportunity.
It is difficult to divine how seriously Mr. Trump should be treated this time. And it is unclear whether he could claim victory on the birth certificate issue (even though his suggestions that no birth certificate existed turned out to be false) and move along to his next pursuit.
There are, of course, other questions that Mr. Trump has not answered. He has not said whether he still supports the idea he introduced a decade ago to impose a one-time 14.25 percent tax on the net worth of individuals and trusts worth $10 million or more. He has not explained his evolution from supporting abortion rights to being opposed to abortion. And he has swatted away inquiries about his own finances, even though he said Wednesday that he would release his records ''almost simultaneously of when I announce, if I announce.''
But his presence here alone underscored that he has the capacity to leave his stamp on the race, whether he runs or not.
He reserved most of his criticism for the administration, particularly about how Mr. Obama has handled the economy, the Libya conflict and the trade relationship with China. He grew animated discussing global competition.
''China is raping this country,'' Mr. Trump said, adding that the United States has fallen short on technology and innovation. ''OPEC is laughing at us.''
Mr. Trump created not only a media circus on Wednesday, but a rolling media circus. At one point, he inched along in his rented black stretch limousine (with a New Hampshire license plate, Regal 50) and stopped every few feet to roll down his tinted windows to make another point.
He shook hands along Hanover Street in downtown Portsmouth, a departure from his normal protocol, given his known worries about germs, and he basked in the reception from scores of people who turned out to see him.
''Does anybody else get this crowd? I don't think so,'' Mr. Trump said, raising his hands in the air. In conversations with voters and reporters, he closed with, ''Have a good time!''
Several residents who saw Mr. Trump said they were amused, but not necessarily won over.
''I think he puts on a good show,'' said Joe Lovell, 69, a retired shipyard worker from Somersworth. ''He's a showman.''
Haven Hayes, 76, a retired university researcher, said: ''I can't see myself voting for him. He's too much of a playboy.''
Mike Roe, an insurance agent in Portsmouth, said he wished Mr. Trump would drop the birth certificate issue, but added that he was drawn to Mr. Trump's swagger and his call to increase the global muscle of the United States. ''We've got to become deal makers again,'' Mr. Roe said.
Before entering a cigar shop, Mr. Trump called out: ''Did you hear that, press? They are thanking me for getting the birth certificate.'' He lingered on the cobblestone streets as though he was leading a parade, telling dozens of admirers, ''Come on, we're going this way.''
''Don't worry,'' he added, ''I'll be back in two weeks.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler Expected to Erase Its Debt to Government

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Of the three Detroit carmakers, Chrysler was in the worst condition when the recession hit. And even with a taxpayer bailout, it has been slower to recover than its rivals.
But on Thursday, the company will announce a milestone in its comeback effort, declaring its intention to repay its $7.5 billion in high-interest loans -- $5.8 billion to the United States government and $1.7 billion to Canada's -- as soon as next month by selling new bonds to investors.
Once it pays back the loans, Chrysler can strengthen its ties to Fiat, its Italian partner, and begin adding more fuel-efficient cars to its truck-heavy lineup. 
Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive of both Chrysler and Fiat, is expected to announce the debt plan Thursday when he welcomes the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, for a tour of the company's Jeep plant on Detroit's east side.
Although details of the debt offering, to be led by Goldman Sachs, are still being negotiated, Chrysler intends to use the proceeds of the sale to help it pay off all of the government loans, according to people familiar with Chrysler's plans.
Both Chrysler and the Treasury Department declined to comment on the announcement.
The loans have been a psychological and financial drag on Chrysler's efforts to revamp its operations and gain market share since emerging from its government-sponsored bankruptcy in 2009.
''They started in a very deep hole after the bankruptcy,'' said Dennis Virag, president of the Automotive Consulting Group in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''Now they are making progress both in the product area and the financial area.''
Mr. Marchionne has said that interest payments on its government loans were the only obstacle keeping Chrysler from being profitable in 2010, when the company lost $652 million.
Paying off the loans would also free Fiat to raise its ownership stake in Chrysler.
Fiat currently owns 30 percent of Chrysler, a stake it received in stages as part in the United States government's rescue of the smallest of Detroit's Big Three. In exchange for the ownership interest, Fiat agreed to provide engines and technology to make Chrysler's lineup more diverse and fuel-efficient.
Once the government loans are retired, Fiat plans to pay $1.3 billion for newly issued Chrysler shares, raising its ownership stake to 46 percent.
That deal will most likely accelerate the integration of Fiat and Chrysler and speed the arrival of new Fiat-based models for Chrysler to sell in the American market.
The refinancing is also expected to save money overall for Chrysler, which is paying high interest rates on the $5.8 billion it owes to the American government and the $1.7 billion it owes the Canadians.
''It's great they are tuning up their balance sheet by reducing debt,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with the research firm IHS Global Insight. ''That will help them direct more money towards product development.''
Under Mr. Marchionne's leadership, Chrysler has methodically improved its core products since coming out of Chapter 11. In the last year, Chrysler has introduced new, well-received versions of its Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle and the Chrysler 300 flagship sedan.
The company has also benefited from positive reaction to its ''Imported from Detroit'' ad campaign that promotes its corporate resilience and improved product quality.
So far this year, Chrysler's sales are up 22 percent -- slightly higher than the 20 percent increase in sales for the overall industry. The increase, however, is almost entirely attributable to improved sales of its Jeep models and Dodge trucks. The company's domestic market share has remained flat at 9 percent.
But the Fiat influence will be felt soon. Chrysler has just started to sell the Fiat 500 minicar in its American dealerships, and more new passenger-car models are in the pipeline.
Chrysler needs a more balanced portfolio to take advantage of the steady rise in popularity of smaller cars. The Ford Motor Company reported a sparkling $2.5 billion first-quarter profit on Tuesday, largely because of the success of its new Fiesta and Focus cars.
''Chrysler is in a better position now than a year ago, but they are still reliant on trucks versus cars,'' said Ms. Lindland.
Paying back the government loans will leave the federal government's ownership stake in Chrysler unchanged at 8 percent. But the new debt structure is considered a vital step toward a public stock offering by the company this year or in early 2012.
The majority owner of Chrysler is the health care trust for retired members of the United Auto Workers union, which has a 55 percent stake.
Chrysler has not suffered the same consumer disapproval that General Motors experienced from its government bailout. That was mostly because of G.M. came out of bankruptcy with the American taxpayer as its majority owner.
But G.M. has mostly shed its dreaded image as ''Government Motors'' since the federal government cut its stake to 26 percent from 60 percent in G.M.'s stock offering last November.
In Chrysler's case, its biggest problem was a weak lineup of vehicles and tight constraints on product spending. But it now appears to be gaining momentum with new Fiat models.
Analysts who had written off Chrysler after bankruptcy are now applauding Mr. Marchionne's slow, steady rebuilding of its product portfolio.
''It's sort of like the cat with 17 lives,'' said Mr. Virag. ''They used up their nine, and they apparently still have more.''

HEADLINE: Obama Heads to New York to Try to Thaw Donors From Wall Street

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
President Obama, seeking to mend fences with big New York donors to the Democratic Party, came to New York to headline three back-to-back fund-raisers on Wednesday night, casting his re-election campaign as the next step in the effort to speed up the economic recovery. 
''People are worried about the future of the American dream,'' Mr. Obama told some 60 donors who paid up to $35,800 a plate to be part of the first scheduled event, a dinner party with the president at the Manhattan home of Jon S. Corzine, the former governor of New Jersey.
Mr. Obama tried to distinguish between the haves -- including those gathered around him at five tables in two rooms -- and the have-nots as a reason to continue to support his economic policies. ''Everybody here almost by definition has lived out that American dream,'' he said, looking around the rooms, crowded with sequined women in Christian Louboutin designer shoes.
''The question is, will that same story be told by our children and grandchildren?'' the president asked. ''Will it be told by the folks who do all the work here in New York City and across the country, washing dishes?''
Mr. Obama flew to New York from Chicago, where he had made a trip to tape an episode of ''The Oprah Winfrey Show,'' one of the last before it ends. The appearance will be broadcast Monday, White House officials said.
Ms. Winfrey gave Mr. Obama a huge political lift in 2007 when she endorsed him early in the Democratic primary season. During the campaign, Ms. Winfrey joined the Obamas at a number of rallies and helped raise money for his presidential effort.
Getting money from Wall Street for next year's re-election campaign might be a much harder sell, and Mr. Obama's visit to New York was timed to kick off that effort.
In particular, Democrats are hoping that Mr. Obama can make peace, somewhat at least, with Wall Street, where financiers have expressed increased alienation with the party and the White House after the oratorical pounding they have taken for their part in the financial crisis that began in 2008. Several hedge fund managers who supported Mr. Obama in 2008 now indicate that they will support the Republican Party in 2012.
Mr. Obama began his kiss-and-make-up effort at the home of Mr. Corzine, a former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Corzine has deep ties to the financial services industry, and now heads MF Global, a financial services firm.
Democrats are hoping that Mr. Obama's fund-raising efforts can top the $750 million he raised in the 2008 campaign, and possibly reach $1 billion.
Also on Mr. Obama's Manhattan schedule were a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria and a concert at the Town Hall theater for his young supporters featuring the Roots, a hip-hop band.
The events were expected to raise $2 million to $3 million, Democratic officials said. The proceeds will go to the Obama Victory Fund, a joint account of the Democratic National Committee and the Obama campaign.

HEADLINE: Why Sales of Green Products Are Down

BYLINE: TOM SZAKY


HIGHLIGHT: At TerraCycle, we've always believed that green products shouldn't cost more than traditional products.

 BODY:
Last week, The New York Times published an intriguing article -- "As Consumers Cut Spending, 'Green' Products Lose Allure" -- about a major decline in the sales of green products. The article makes a point I have long believed: the average consumer will not pay more for a product just because it's green, especially during a recession.
What I found most interesting about the article is that independent brands such as Method and Seventh Generation have been less affected by the drop in sales seen during the recession, while more traditional companies like Clorox have seen their green offerings decline sharply or be pulled from shelves all together. 
The difference here is that Method and Seventh Generation appeal to "dark green" consumers -- those who support eco-friendly products at almost all costs. This consumer group has long shown its willingness to pay a premium for a green product. The problem is that this segment constitutes a tiny percentage of the market. On the other hand, Clorox GreenWorks products are targeted more to "light green" consumers -- those who want to be more responsible in their purchasing but will not or cannot pay more.
Consumer behavior toward green products offers a challenge as well as an opportunity. By creating an environmentally and socially responsible product that is effective and competitively priced, a company can steal customers from both sides of the equation. Light green consumers can be won over if they know they can buy a green product without paying more. And dark green consumers are also likely to switch if they know they can buy a good product for less money -- even the most committed environmentalists also like to save money.
TerraCycle has tried to accomplish this very tactic with our own cleaner and fertilizer lines. Both are certified non-toxic and biodegradable, and they are packaged in reused plastic bottles. Most important, both are priced competitively with traditional cleaners. Our challenge has been to educate the consumer on the items' efficacy and to overcome the perception that green products are less effective and more expensive -- without the benefits of a massive marketing campaign that would drive up our costs.
What do you think? Are you surprised that consumers are spending less on green products? What will it take for green products to really go mainstream?
Tom Szaky is the chief executive of TerraCycle, which is based in Trenton, N.J.

HEADLINE: Guessing Game Builds Over Buffett's Next Deal

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Some analysts and investors say the biggest damage from the Sokol affair may be to Warren Buffett's reputation, but it is unlikely to deter deal-making at Berkshire Hathaway. 

 BODY:
Among the questions nagging at investors making the pilgrimage to Omaha this weekend to attend the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway will be this: Will the outcry over David L. Sokol affect Warren E. Buffett's deal machine?
Only two months ago, Berkshire appeared to be riding high. The conglomerate posted a 61 percent gain in annual profit for last year. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that he was again on the hunt.
"We're prepared," he wrote. "Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy."
In March, Mr. Buffett appeared to at least partly sate that itch when he agreed to buy the chemicals manufacturer Lubrizol for $9 billion in cash.
Yet that deal has now trapped Berkshire in controversy. Mr. Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, resigned after disclosures that he had bought shares in Lubrizol shortly before recommending the company to Mr. Buffett as a takeover target. Initially hesitant, Mr. Buffett eventually agreed to the deal, the third-largest purchase in his career.
On Wednesday, the audit committee of Berkshire's board condemned Mr. Sokol's actions as violations of the company's insider stock-trading policy and hinted that the company might sue Mr. Sokol, a onetime star manager. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Mr. Sokol's trades, people briefed on the matter have said previously.
It is unclear whether the Sokol affair will have lasting implications for Berkshire. Some Buffett-watchers say that the biggest damage may be to the investor's reputation.
"Buffett was on an unrealistically high pedestal to begin with," Alice Schroeder, the author of an authorized biography of Mr. Buffett, said. "A lot of Berkshire's business advantage came from that mystique."
But it is unlikely to deter Berkshire from its takeover safari.
"I don't think if there are any deals on the horizon that this is going to cause Buffett to pause in the least," said Michael Yoshikami, the chairman and chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a Berkshire shareholder.
The fundamentals for why Berkshire must pursue even more acquisitions have not changed. The company generated $17.9 billion in cash from its operations last year, and currently has more than $38 billion to spend.
And its underlying businesses, apart from its commercial insurance operations, have rebounded well from the recession, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.
"I expect no changes and that we may see Berkshire do a $10 billion deal in the next 12 months," he said.
And despite the reputational damage done to the Buffett brand, the executive still exerts a magnetic charm and has a strongly performing business that many companies still want to join, Ms. Schroeder said.
Just what exactly Berkshire will buy next remains a parlor game among analysts and investors.
Mr. Buffett has hewed to a fairly rigid set of criteria for potential deal targets, including consistently high earnings, little debt and strong management teams in place.
Mr. Buffett has long regarded his big investments as crucial to continuing Berkshire's strong financial performance. He singled out his $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern as a big contributor to Berkshire's bottom line. The deal appeared likely to raise Berkshire's earning power by nearly 40 percent before taxes, and the cash needed to strike the deal was quickly replenished.
"The economics of this transaction have turned out very well," he wrote in this year's investor letter.
While Mr. Buffett most recent shareholder letter sang the praises of the United States - he described the country as ripe with an abundance of opportunity - many observers say that his next trophy may well be abroad.
Mr. Yoshikami noted that many of Berkshire's recent big deals, including those for Lubrizol, Burlington Northern and the industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings, had been largely for developed companies with high cash flow.
A logical next step may be in finding a high-growth but stable foreign company, as Berkshire did in 2008 when it acquired a 10 percent stake in the Chinese auto parts maker BYD, Mr. Yoshikami said.
That opportunity may lie in a growing economy like India, which Mr. Buffett visited last month.
"I've been dropping my phone number around as I cover the city," he told reporters then. "I hope someone rings me Monday morning with good news."

HEADLINE: U.S. Loses Bids to Supply Jets to India

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The United States lost a hard-fought competition to supply a new generation of fighter jets to India, which has listed two European manufacturers as the finalists for an order estimated to be worth $10 billion.
The decision was a blow for President Obama, who had pushed hard for this and other defense deals during his visit to India in November as part of his agenda to deepen and broaden the United States' relationship with India. The American ambassador to India, Timothy J. Roemer, who separately announced on Thursday that he would resign from his post for personal reasons, said the United States was ''deeply disappointed by this news.'' 
While political and economic relations between India and the United States have been warming for years, American arms makers have struggled to win big contracts here. After decades of frosty relations during the cold war, which pushed India to rely extensively on the Soviet Union for military hardware, many in the Indian defense establishment are still wary of American intentions and United States military aid to Pakistan, India's main adversary.
The American bid to build the fighters came from Boeing and Lockheed Martin. Boeing had offered its F/A -18 jets, and Lockheed Martin pitched its F-16 planes. But India instead narrowed the list to the Rafale fighter from Dassault and the Eurofighter Typhoon jet made by a consortium of European companies. Russian and Swedish bids were also turned down.
The 126 planes are meant to replace aging Russian jets. A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said the country hoped to make a final decision by the end of March 2012.
Both American companies are also looking to sell other military hardware to India, which unlike much of the Western world has been sharply increasing its defense spending. Some analysts say India could spend $50 billion to $80 billion on equipment in the next five years.
One Indian international affairs analyst, C. Raja Mohan, played down the significance of the American companies' loss of this deal. He said that the Indian government was buying more from United States contractors than ever before.
''One deal doesn't make everything,'' said Mr. Mohan, a senior fellow at the Center for Policy Research in New Delhi. ''There has been a lot of hype about this deal. We are doing things with the U.S. that we never did before.''
But another analyst, Nitin Pai, argued that India's decision would hurt relations with the United States, at a time when the country needed stronger ties with America to advance its interests in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the United Nations Security Council, on which India is seeking a permanent seat.
''This move will most certainly reduce India's geopolitical leverage with the U.S. military-industrial complex, at a time when India needs it most,'' Mr. Pai wrote on his blog, The Acorn. He added, ''Is the United States more likely to be sympathetic to India's interests after an $11 billion contract -- which means much needed jobs for the U.S. economy -- is awarded to someone else?''
Dinesh Keskar, president of Boeing's Indian operation, said that while the company was ''obviously disappointed'' about not making the cut for the fighter jets, it was ''quite excited about the opportunities in India.'' He added that the company was seeking a meeting with Indian officials to find out why its planes were not selected.
Boeing said the company and the Indian Air Force were in the final stages of negotiating a contract for C-17 cargo planes that was announced by Mr. Obama and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in November. And it is hoping to win orders for attack and heavy-lift helicopters.
''We are quite engaged with and will continue our partnership with India,'' Mr. Keskar said in a telephone interview.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Eugene Von Bruenchenhein: Freelance Artist -- Poet and Sculptor -- Inovator -- Arrow maker and Plant man -- Bone artifacts constructor -- Photographer and Architect -- Philosopher,' through Oct. 9. Whether photographing his wife as a sweetly chaste pinup girl; fashioning plant forms from scrounged clay or little thrones from salvaged turkey bones; or making delicate ballpoint-pen drawings or hallucinatory paintings rife with intimations of exotic undersea or sci-fi worlds, this self-taught, self-proclaimed multitasker (as made clear in the show's subtitle) never wavered in his sense of his own greatness. Mounted 27 years after his death, his first American museum survey doesn't quite do him justice and especially shortchanges the paintings, but it presents the fruits of his ceaseless labors with a clarity that makes them feel of a piece, and like a gift. 45 West 53rd Street , (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)20110428 
- Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Stargazers: Elizabeth Catlett in Conversation with 21 Contemporary Artists,' through May 29. This celebration of the artist Elizabeth Catlett, 96, includes contributions by a stellar array of younger colleagues from two generations. But Ms. Catlett herself, with her formally assured and expressively commanding art, is the life of the party just by being the quietest, wisest voice in the room. (An exhibition titled ''Digame: Elizabeth Catlett's Forever Love'' is on view in the Neil L. and Angelica Zander Rudenstine Gallery, W. E. B. Du Bois Institute for African and African-American Research at Harvard University, through May 26.) 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania , (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)20110428
Brooklyn Museum: 'Tipi: Heritage of the Great Plains,' through May 15. Lavishly decorated war outfits and weapons, women's dresses, saddles, storage bags, baby carriers, children's toys, sporting goods and much more attest to a wonderfully soulful and inventive artistic vitality among members of the Arapaho, Blackfoot, Crow, Lakota and other tribes that once nomadically roamed the prairies from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains. The exhibition is a good introduction to the art and craft of the Plains Indians, but it unfortunately mixes in contemporary Indian art of doubtful aesthetic and historic value. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park , (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)20110428
- Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Color Moves: Art and Fashion by Sonia Delaunay,' through June 19. Examining the more practical side of Delaunay's pioneering achievement, this beautiful, enlightening exhibition offers some alluring artworks, garments and accessories, especially a passel of radiant scarves. But it bets most of the house on fabric swatches -- Delaunay's textile designs -- and succeeds with a display of some 90 gouache studies for textiles and their equally vibrant commercial results: more than 120 hand-printed silks, velvets and cottons laid out in large vitrines. Patterns ranging from geometric to floral variously revisit, amplify and presage much of the history of modern painting and may even deserve a place in that history. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Smith)20110428
Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum: 'Set in Style: The Jewelry of Van Cleef & Arpels,' through July 4. Van Cleef & Arpels, the century-old French jewelry firm, is the primary sponsor of this show and has supplied much of its megacarat menu: some 350 lavish pieces worn by royals, screen sirens and social swans. Although extravagance doesn't seem out of place in this former Carnegie mansion, the show often looks as if it were put together by the company's creative directors and merchandisers. The visitors lining up around the block don't seem to care, as long as they can linger over pieces like a maharani's carved-emerald necklace and large sapphire-and-diamond pendant earrings worn by Elizabeth Taylor. 2 East 91st Street , (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Karen Rosenberg)20110428
- Frick Collection: 'Rembrandt and His School: Masterworks from the Frick and Lugt Collections,' through May 15. Rembrandt's jowly, battered face glows like a night light in the great 1658 self-portrait in the Frick Collection. And it glows more brightly than ever now that layers of old varnish have been cleaned away. The return of the picture after conservation is the pretext for a marvelous show of drawings by Rembrandt from a European collection, along with work by some of his virtuosic followers. 1 East 70th Street , (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Cotter)20110428
- Guggenheim Museum: 'The Great Upheaval: Modern Art from the Guggenheim Collection, 1910-1918,' through June 1. Full of the art that Frank Lloyd Wright's spiral was built for, this meticulous and spacious installation of gems from the Guggenheim's admittedly patchy, idiosyncratic collection of early Modernist works is a trifle serene, considering its focus. There are masterpieces by Chagall, Malevich, Mondrian and others, as well as works of more purely historical interest that together indicate both the startling innovations of Modernism and the challenges these presented for lesser artists. But at times the upheaval in question seems to be unfolding in slow motion, at a remove, with the sound off. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street , (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)20110428
- International Center of Photography: 'The Mexican Suitcase,' through May 8. In 1939, at the start of World War II, the photographer Robert Capa fled Paris. Before leaving, he packed up some 4,500 negatives and gave them to a friend to forward to him in New York. Almost all of the images in the collection were from the Spanish Civil War and taken by Capa; David Seymour, also known as Chim; and by Gerda Taro, who had died in action two years before. The negatives, which finally arrived in New York in 2007 after a mysterious journey, are the subject of a fascinating show that rewards the close looking it requires. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)20110428
- International Center of Photography: 'Wang Qingsong: When Worlds Collide,' through May 8. The photographs and videos in this small survey satirize recent changes in Chinese culture -- the proliferation of McDonald's, overcrowded cities, even a booming art scene -- with sophistication and elaborate staging. The show, Mr. Wang's biggest New York solo so far, leaves you wondering what the future holds for this gimlet-eyed artist. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street , (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
- Japan Society: 'Bye Bye Kitty!!! Between Heaven and Hell in Contemporary Japanese Art,' through June 12. This piquant exhibition of dark-minded work was conceived as a sharp counterweight to the cult of cuteness that has been Japan's dominant aesthetic for decades. No one could have known that the show's images of material fragility and decay would end up being seen in the light of real-life disaster. But such is the case, and the mood of anxiety that pervades the work of the 16 artists is more evident than it might have been otherwise. 333 East 47th Street , (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Cotter)20110428
Jewish Museum: 'Maira Kalman: Various Illuminations (of a Crazy World),' through July 31. Like her fellow New Yorker magazine contributors Ed Koren and Roz Chast, Ms. Kalman offers gently humorous cartoon commentary on the trials and tribulations of modern metropolitan life. Ranging in style from faux-naive eccentricity to suave realism, the more than two decades worth of drawings and paintings on paper in this career survey make for an entertaining if not deeply provocative experience. With a flea market-like installation of nondescript objects from her personal collection, however, she tries too hard to be amazingly original. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street , (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110428
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Cezanne's Card Players,' through May 8. This mini-blockbuster, organized by the Met and the Courtauld Gallery of London, finds Cezanne taking a subject from genre painting and transforming it. His ''Card Players'' separates the motif from its attendant morality, replacing the sloppy-drunk gamblers of 17th-century works with sober, stone-faced tradesmen. And it's impossible to ignore the paintings' overtures to Modernism, especially in the versions in which two players face off across a tilted table. Related paintings of smokers and other peasants come close to portraiture, but ultimately remain types. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Guitar Heroes: Legendary Craftsmen from Italy to New York,' through July 4. The heroes of this exceptionally interesting show are three craftsmen known for producing some of the most sought-after jazz guitars of the 20th century. Part I surveys a history of Italian luthiers from 17th-century Naples to Italian immigrants producing string instruments in New York in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Part II presents lovingly made archtop guitars and mandolins dating from 1923 to 2008 by inheritors of that tradition: John D'Angelico, James D'Aquisto and John Monteleone. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110428
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art,' through Aug. 14. This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110428
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rooms with a View: The Open Window in the 19th Century,' through July 4. This compact, quietly splendid exhibition explores the window as luminous light source, as semi-abstract compositional element and as the focal point for a certain poignant, implicitly Romantic yearning. The images -- mostly by German, French and Scandinavian artists before 1830 -- depict both domestic settings and artists' studios and are passively subversive in their avoidance of large-scale, historic themes and formal portraiture. They show us a world on the verge of electricity, photography and industrialization, a moment of irretrievable, partly fictive calm that incites some yearning of its own. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)20110428
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Katrin Sigurdardottir at the Met,' through May 30. This Icelandic New Yorker has created a pair of fanciful, quasi-architectural constructions inspired by two of the museum's French neo-Classical period rooms. Ms. Sigurdardottir's versions are all-white abstractions of their models, made with exacting craft but with simplified details. One with skewed windows and doors in a descending spiral of abutted panels could be a Modernist set for ''Alice in Wonderland.'' At 85 percent life-size, the other, an octagonal interior viewable only through one-way mirrors, has a magical, otherworldly glow. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110428
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tibetan Arms and Armor From the Permanent Collection,' through fall. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Met's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Later Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, created this follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including five acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense; examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Diary: Three Centuries of Private Lives,' through May 22. You don't get to fully read the journals and diaries of Charlotte Bronte, Bob Dylan, Albert Einstein, Nathaniel Hawthorne, John Steinbeck, Tennessee Williams or any of the others on display here from the Morgan's incredible collection. But these riches are propped open in display cases for viewing, each revealing more than a tweet's worth of tantalizing self-revelation or self-concealment. The museum provides transcriptions for those who can't readily decipher 18th-century script, 19th-century microscopic penmanship and 20th-century scrawls. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)20110428
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Luis Camnitzer,' through May 29. Some stars take longer than others to come into telescopic range, as is the case with Luis Camnitzer, a pioneer of 1960s Conceptualism who is just now having his first New York museum survey. Much of what's here is based on language: cryptic propositions, lists of words, descriptive phrases -- unmoored from, or very loosely tethered to, spare-to-barely-there visual matter. The results are terse, political, funny and lyrical. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem , (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)20110428
- Museum of Arts and Design: 'The Global Africa Project,' through May 15. This ambitious if flawed survey exuberantly mixes contemporary art, design and craft by some 120 participants who are mostly African or of African descent. Setting an example of curatorial porousness that more museums should follow, it ranges from high-end luxury items (including art) to industrial design using recycled materials, from D.I.Y. urban renewal to resurgent craft traditions. The resulting friction between nonfunctional and functional, spiritual and practical, handmade and machine-made, and professional and self-taught is music to the eyes and will attune them to the important ideas and attitudes that continue to come out of Africa. This show had to be done. It should recur on a regular basis. Africa and its legacy will never be less important. 2 Columbus Circle , (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)20110428
Museum of Biblical Art: 'Passion in Venice: Crivelli to Tintoretto and Veronese,' through June 12. This fascinating exhibition presents about 60 well-chosen paintings, sculptures and objects by famous artists and unidentified artisans, all representing a major iconic image of Christendom: Jesus as the Man of Sorrows, post-Crucifixion, pre-Resurrection. Michele Giambono's 15th-century painting pictures him in anguish with bleeding palms and blood dripping from the thorns of his crown. In a late 16th-century, classicizing painting by Paolo Veronose, he slumps in the arms of an angel like a defeated athlete. Don't miss the small, wooden head of Jesus with a tiny, spring-loaded, pop-up Man of Sorrows. 1865 Broadway, at 61st Street , (212) 408-1500, mobia.org. (Johnson)20110428
- Museum of Modern Art: 'German Expressionism: The Graphic Impulse,' through July 11. MoMA's largest ever survey of Germany's first modern art movement is infused with an urgent, crackling energy, by turns joyful, satiric, grim and tragic. Presenting some 250 works -- most of them little-seen prints -- it celebrates one of the 20th century's most brutally effective, socially responsive unions of medium and message and shakes up the (understandable) conventional wisdom that the museum is almost terminally Francophile. While lavish, the show reveals but a fraction of the museum's 3,200 Expressionist works on paper, all of which are newly available for digital viewing at moma.org/explore/multimedia/interactives/161. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110428
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing,' through Sept. 19. This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Picasso: Guitars 1912-1914,' through June 6. Five years after painting his history-altering ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' and inspired by his friend Georges Braque, Picasso left the figure behind and immersed himself in an alternative reality of still lifes that collapsed space and took him to the brink of abstraction. MoMA's subtly buzzing manifesto of a show -- made up of 70 thematically related paintings, drawings and collages, along with a pair of renowned guitar sculptures -- is a record of that moment, a brief revolution that generated some of the most challenging ideas in modern art. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)20110428
Museum of Modern Art: 'Staging Action: Performance in Photography Since 1960,' through May 9. This show of some 50 works drawn from the photography department, nearly half of them acquired over the past five years, emphasizes performances staged for (rather than simply documented with) the camera. Some of the artists -- Lee Friedlander, Richard Prince -- are better known as photographers than as performers. The works range from 1960s Vienna to 1990s Beijing and from solipsism to exhibitionism. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
Neue Galerie: 'Vienna 1900: Style and Identity,' through June 27. One of history's more fraught fin-de-siecle efflorescences of art and thought is recounted in a shifting kaleidoscope of paintings, drawings, architectural models, posters and several species of decorative arts. Among paintings by Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka and Egon Schiele, there is also a recreation of Freud's psychoanalytic couch, an eye-popping tribute to the Vienna Secession and a crowded face-off between the designer-theoreticians Josef Hoffmann and Adolf Loos. Over all, it resembles a tasting menu with enough rich and disparate flavors that the gaps and omissions can be overlooked. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street , (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.com. (Smith)20110428
- New Museum: 'Lynda Benglis,' through June 19. This startlingly excellent resurrection of the prescient Post-Minimalist renegade and her gaudy, multidexterous, often gender-bending segues among Process, Performance and Body Art is long overdue. Carefully chosen, it includes her notorious 1974 Artforum ad, but it gives pride of place to her equally flamboyant, if abstract, evocations of the body in pigmented wax, latex and polyurethane foam. Taking tips from Pollock, these works combine the dancer and the dance, unleash painting into real space and mock the less colorful efforts of her mostly masculine contemporaries. The through line: feminist intuition, formalist excess and a reckless disregard for art-world standards and practices. Bravo. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)20110428
- New Museum: 'George Condo: Mental States,' through May 8. The American artist George Condo first made a splash in New York in the 1980s with a line of Surrealist-style figure paintings. They were tasty, erudite stuff, freaky but classy, Mixmaster-version old master, with a big glop of pop tossed in. He went to Europe for a successful decade, then came back to Manhattan in the 1990s without quite gaining main-stage status here. Now, finally, he's having a New York museum survey, and it's sensational. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side , (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)20110428
P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center: 'Laurel Nakadate: Only the Lonely,' through Aug. 8. Laurel Nakadate might be on the cusp of a great new career. She is known for disconcerting, sad and sexually provocative videos that she enlisted older, worse-for-wear men to participate in, but in the past three years she has made two feature-length films. Included in this enthralling survey of her 10-year career, they focus with lingering, heart-aching care on adolescent girls, lost souls looking for love and only getting into trouble. P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens , (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)20110428
- Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: 'Soulful Stitching: Patchwork Quilts by Africans (Siddis) of India,' through June 30. The 15 brilliant contemporary quilts in this show were made by women of the Siddi ethnic group, descendants of early African migrants to South Asia, including slaves brought by Portuguese colonists in the 16th century. Strips and patches of recycled cloth -- solid-colored, patterned or shot through with glittery threads -- are the basic components. Together the results look like a spring garden in bloom. New York Public Library, 515 Lenox Avenue, at 135th Street, Hamilton Heights , nypl.org. (Cotter)20110428
Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian: 'A Song for the Horse Nation,' through July 7. Including saddles, riding blankets, clothing, beaded bags and much more, this exhibition brings to light a fascinating and ultimately sad chapter in American history: the hundred-year period during which horses were central to the lives of the Plains Indians. A highly efficient form of transportation, horses enabled Navajo, Crow, Comanche, Pawnee and others to expand their territories and flourish more than they otherwise would have. It also enabled them to make war more effectively, though ultimately not effectively enough. George Gustav Heye Center, 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan , (212) 514-3700, americanindian.si.edu.

- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Glenn Ligon: America,' through June 5. Sometimes a career survey doubles as a scan of social history. This is true of Glenn Ligon's retrospective, a tight but ample show that refers back to America's slave-holding past and forward to the Obama present, but focuses on the late 1980s and 1990s, a too-seldom-revisited stretch of recent art. Is shared culture -- being American -- in the end a stronger source of communality than race or sexual orientation? That's an important question that Mr. Ligon's beautifully made work asks. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)20110428
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Singular Visions,' continuing. With its ''one artwork per room'' rule, ''Singular Visions'' is a refreshing departure from the typical collection sampler. The show's work includes pieces by A A Bronson, Sarah Charlesworth, Robert Grosvenor, Eva Hesse, Edward Kienholz and Georgia O'Keeffe; some rooms are more intriguing than others, but on the whole the show feels like a necessary experiment. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
Galleries: Uptown
Rafael Ferrer: 'Recent Work,' through May 7. A gridded arrangement of zany faces on brown paper bags, drawn in color in many different mediums and styles, including Cubist, Expressionist, Pop and psychedelic, covers one gallery wall. Similarly engrossing is a set of almost 100 small, wood-framed blackboards, each bearing a black-and-white painting; among them are abstractions, portraits, still lifes, nudes and gnomic texts. Mr. Ferrer projects an infectiously lively imagination. Adam Baumgold, 60 East 66th Street , (212) 861-7338, adambaumgoldgallery.com. (Johnson)20110428
- 'Eva Hesse and Sol LeWitt,' through May 27. This beautiful duet of works by Hesse and her friend and mentor LeWitt is like a love affair between rational mind and passionate intuition. Both artists were preoccupied with the grid, but while his are strictly abstract, hers are sensual and surrealistic. His all-white, 3-D, gridded cube skeleton is Platonically pure; her cube of perforated steel with hundreds of little rubber tubes inserted to create a furry interior is weirdly sexual. Craig F. Starr, 5 East 73rd Street , (212) 570-1739, starr-art.com. (Johnson)20110428
'Nubia: Ancient Kingdoms of Africa,' through June 12. ''Nubia'' takes you deep into the history of a volatile part of Africa. The show occupies just two small galleries but spans a 500-mile stretch of the Nile River Valley (now northern Sudan and southern Egypt) and more than 2,250 years (from about 3000 B.C. through 750 B.C.). Pottery, statues and funerary objects chart the dizzying power swings between Egypt and Nubia, cultures that traded goods as well as blows. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, 15 East 84th Street , (212) 992-7800, nyu.edu/isaw. (Rosenberg)20110428
- 'Unpainted Paintings,' through May 27. The 37 works in this astute if star-struck exhibition explore post-Pollock paintings that favor nontraditional materials and approaches and a great deal of chance. The generally excellent selections range from a gold-leaf painting by Robert Rauschenberg and a urine-on-canvas work by Andy Warhol to a stained and acid-eaten wool rug by Anna Betbeze, a promising newcomer. Also on hand are works by Alberto Burri, Mike Kelley, Piero Manzoni and Rosemarie Trockel. The show's single-mindedness is a tad monotonous, but this is museum-quality effort that some museum should do larger, less predictably and more ecumenically. Luxembourg & Dayan, 64 East 77th Street , (212) 452-4646, luxembourgdayan.com. (Smith)20110428
Galleries: 57th Street
- Romare Bearden: 'Collage: A Centennial Celebration,' through May 21. Bearden (1911-88) spent decades striving to be a great artist, and in the early 1960s, when he took up collage in earnest, he became one. That much is confirmed by this small but superb selection of 21 works made between 1964 and 1983, seen in a context that facilitates savoring their every formal twist and narrative turn, not to mention the ingenious mixing of mediums and techniques that takes them far beyond collage. These elements, as well as the scaled-up version of collage and pieced-together, abstraction-infused figures that Bearden devised, have many echoes in contemporary art. Michael Rosenfeld Gallery, 24 West 57th Street , (212) 247-0082, michaelrosenfeldart.com. (Smith)20110428
Galleries: Chelsea
- Picasso and Marie-Therese: 'L'Amour Fou,' through June 25. While falling short of the exhibition of late Picasso paintings and prints that filled this space two years ago, the latest Gagosian exegesis into Picasso land is a wonderfully motley, almost scattershot affair, brilliantly installed. It presents works in all mediums and several styles that Picasso made during the late 1920s and '30s, when he was under the spell of the voluptuous, Roman-nosed, level-eyed, full-limbed Marie-Therese Walter, arguably the love of his life. Anchored by this single if perpetually mutating subject, the art on hand confirms that when Picasso told Walter she had saved his life, he meant that she had also saved his art. Gagosian Gallery, 522 West 21st Street , (212) 741-1717, gagosian.com. (Smith)20110428
Justin Samson: 'Multikulti,' through May 14. In his latest work, Mr. Samson's interest in extraterrestrial beings, unearthly light, infinite space and humble craft techniques are leavened with an astute Modernist irreverence. The results are searingly bright, textured geometric reliefs (framed in painted fake fur) and jaggedly figurative sculpture (appended with fluorescent tubes). Kandinsky, Malevich and Hans Hofmann come to mind; the glaring and the gravity-free forms also suggest Peter Halley's prisons, unmoored. Kravets/Wehby Gallery, 521 West 21st Street , (212) 352-2238, kravetswehbygallery.com. (Smith)20110428
Galleries: SoHo
- Alvin Baltrop: 'Photographs 1965-2003,' through May 28. All but unknown in his lifetime, the photographer Alvin Baltrop (1948-2004) focused much of his energy on documenting the illicit erotic and aesthetic life on abandoned shipping piers along Manhattan's West Side in the 1970s and '80s. Image by image, the work is uneven, but there are wonderful things, and the cumulative impact is potent, not only as art produced by an exceptional eye but as a record of a turning-point moment in time, just before and after AIDS struck. Third Streaming, 10 Greene Street, second floor , (646) 370-3877, thirdstreaming.com. (Cotter)20110428
- 'Drawing and Its Double: Selections from the Istituto Nazionale per la Grafica,' through June 24. The drawings in this show take an unusual form: they are the designs etched by artists, using burins and acid, on metal plates from which prints (the ''double'' of the title) are made. The selection begins on a grand note with a set of 10 oddly shaped copper plates made for a 16th-century print version of Michelanglo's ''Last Judgment'' and concludes with expressionistic illustrations by the contemporary artist Paolo Canevari on the Ten Commandments. Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street , (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)20110428
Galleries: Other
John Storrs: 'Machine-Age Modernist,' through July 9. The Chicago-born artist John Storrs (1885-1956) compacted utopian, machine-age dreaming into Cubist-Art Deco-style sculptures resembling pieces of architectural ornament and models of skyscrapers. There is nothing quite like his dense, carefully wrought stone and metal sculptures in early American -- or European, for that matter -- Modernism, and this finely tuned show gives a good account of his progress from the late '10s to the early '30s. Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East , (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart. (Johnson)20110428
Public Art
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire,' through Aug. 28. At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, Public Art Fund , (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)20110428
Out of Town
- African Art Museum of the SMA Fathers: 'Permanent Collection, Part I,' through May 29. If you're looking for some visual magic -- a Yoruba dance mask with a mini-zoo on top; a brocaded body wrap from Ivory Coast that seems to float on air; a 10-foot-high figure of the 1960s Malian soccer hero Salif Keita -- this small, unorthodox museum in a stained-glass-windowed hall beside a church, on the residential campus of a Roman Catholic missionary order in a leafy New Jersey suburb, is for you. 23 Bliss Avenue, Tenafly, N.J. , (201) 894-8611, smafathers.org/museum. (Cotter)20110428
- Anacostia Community Museum: 'Word, Shout, Song: Lorenzo Dow Turner, Connecting Communities Through Language,' through July 24. Housed in a converted movie theater in a predominantly African-American neighborhood that is a cab ride's distance from the National Mall, the Anacostia Community Museum is one of Washington's cultural secrets. Its exhibition on the scholar Lorenzo Dow Turner (1890-1972), who documented surviving traces of African languages and customs in modern African-American culture, is both an archival homage and a well-paced drama of ideas. Smithsonian Institution, 1901 Fort Place SE, Washington , (202) 633-4820, anacostia.si.edu. (Cotter)20110428
- Princeton University Art Museum: 'Kurt Schwitters: Color and Collage,' through June 26. The German artist Kurt Schwitters, who died in 1948, is one of Modernism's true delights, though seen far less often than he deserves to be. This smallish show, his first substantial survey since the 1985 Museum of Modern Art retrospective, is made up primarily of wonderful collages spanning his career, from garrulous early examples made from the odds and ends of urban life -- tram tickets, stamps, receipts -- to the light-and-shadow late ones, done when he was in wartime exile in England and living, as he loved to be, surrounded by nature. From very first to very last, he's golden, and worth the trip to see. Princeton, N.J. , (609) 258-3788, artmuseum.princeton.edu. (Cotter)20110428
- Walters Art Museum: 'Treasures of Heaven: Saints, Relics and Devotion in Medieval Europe,' through May 15. Holy relics -- the physical remains of the venerated dead -- were objects of Christian devotion from Roman times. And reliquaries, containers made to hold such remains, are the subject of the most beautifully mysterious exhibition this season, a show that is also a model of institutional sharing as the Walters, the Cleveland Museum of Art and the British Museum, all with deep medieval holdings, combine their forces brilliantly. A smaller New York show, ''Objects of Devotion and Desire: Medieval Relic to Contemporary Art'' -- at the Bertha and Karl Leubsdorf Art Gallery at Hunter College, Lexington Avenue at 68th Street -- complements ''Treasures of Heaven''; it runs through Saturday. 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore , (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Cotter)20110428
Last Chance
- Tim Dlugos and Philip Monaghan: 'At Moments Like These He Feels Farthest Away'; closes on Friday. In 1983 the poet Tim Dlugos, a bright presence on the Lower East Side literary scene, was commissioned by the Grey Art Gallery at New York University to create an installation using one of his poems in the gallery's windows. He in turn asked the painter Philip Monaghan to handle the visual side of the project. Mr. Dlugos died of AIDS-related complications with the installation unrealized. Now Mr. Monaghan has completed it with 54 paintings illustrating a grave surreal poem called ''Gilligan's Island,'' about the psychic life in America around 1964. Fales Library & Special Collections, Bobst Library, New York University, 70 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village , (212) 998-2596, library.nyu.edu/fales. (Cotter)20110428
Rochelle Feinstein: 'The Estate of Rochelle F.'; closes on Sunday. In a handwritten cri de coeur, Ms. Feinstein meditates on the dismal economy's effects on herself and other American citizens and contemplates liquidating her inventory and retiring. But the invigorating effects of her multimedia paintings combining feminist insouciance and Rauschenbergian exuberance argue eloquently against the notion of giving up the struggle. On Stellar Rays, 133 Orchard Street, Lower East Side , (212) 598-3012, onstellarrays.com. (Johnson)20110428
- Joseph Kosuth: 'Texts (Waiting for-) for Nothing': Samuel Beckett, in play'; closes on Saturday. Overlook the overwrought title. The show's three works span this pioneering Conceptualist's career: 10 dictionary definitions of the word ''nothing'' from 1968; a 1998 neon star-map-like installation that charts the 18 encounters of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'' in terms of their Greek inspirations; and a new piece, also involving neon, that brings together Beckett and Caspar David Friedrich with further stargazing. The combination confirms that Mr. Kosuth's 40-year commitment to language has not only served him well, but also often yields its own kind of poetry. Sean Kelly Gallery, 528 West 29th Street, Chelsea , (212) 239-1181, skny.com. (Smith)20110428
'Malevich and the American Legacy'; closes on Saturday. This show surrounds major canvases by the Suprematist artist Kazimir Malevich with geometric works by Dan Flavin, Donald Judd, Ellsworth Kelly and many others. Sometimes there's a mismatch between the show's Maleviches and the works that constitute his legacy; in other cases, the Americans' selective interpretations look fantastic. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, between 76th and 77th Streets , (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Rosenberg)20110428
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Emperor's Private Paradise: Treasures from the Forbidden City'; closes on Sunday. Named for one of China's great, late emperors and located within the Forbidden City's precincts, the palace known as the Qianlong Garden was locked up and moldering away until the World Monuments Fund spearheaded a rescue project a few years ago. The objects in this show -- furniture, murals, ceramics -- are both spectacular evidence of restoration work done so far and bold emblems of 18th-century imperial taste, with its marriage of extreme finesse and grandstanding luxe. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)20110428
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Display: Chinese Art in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries'; closes on Sunday. This enthralling exhibition presents about 160 mostly desktop-scale works from the museum's Chinese collections, including ornate boxes; carvings in wood, jade, amber, ivory and other semi-precious materials; ceramic vases; and a selection of lavishly embroidered silk kimonos used in royal theatrical performances. To pore over these objects is to be repeatedly astounded by the level of design and technical achievement, and, perhaps most importantly, to appreciate the spiritually inspiring power of a lovingly made object. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)20110428
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Mannerism and Modernism: The Kasper Collection of Drawings and Photographs'; closes on Sunday. This unusual collection assembled by the American fashion designer Herbert Kasper includes old-master drawings; modern and contemporary works on paper; and (mostly recent) photographs. A high point of the installation is a mid-20th-century mix of Dubuffet works on paper and photographs of graffitied walls by Aaron Siskind, Helen Levitt and Brassai. The interest in marked and abraded surfaces links writing, drawing and photography. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street , (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)20110428
- Mark Morrisroe: 'From This Moment On'; closes on Sunday. Morrisroe, who died at 30 in 1989, had impeccable maudit credentials: child of a drug addict and with a habit of his own, he started hustling men for sex when he was 15 and spent much of his short life surviving on handouts. He produced thousands of photographs, most of them portraits of himself and his friends, many truly astonishing in their inventive, queer, polymorphous gorgeousness. This superb survey, organized by Richard Birkett and Stefan Kalmar of Artist Space and Beatrix Ruf, director of Kunsthalle Zurich, is an event. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo , (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)20110428
- Elizabeth Murray: 'Painting in the '70s'; closes on Saturday. In this stirring examination of the origins of Murray's comedic, thoroughly loquacious brand of formalism, she evokes Cubist still lifes; sidesteps the dictates of Minimalism with a series of endearingly patchy monochromes interrupted by assorted shaky, linear motifs; and then progressively establishes her vocabulary of semi-abstract caroming vessels and spilling liquids with paintings that flesh out her distinctive geometry, heat up her color and tilt, distort and finally shatter the rectangular format. The assembled works display her gathering strength. Pace Gallery, 534 West 25th Street, Chelsea , (212) 929-7000, thepacegallery.com. (Smith)20110428
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Counter Space: Design and the Modern Kitchen'; closes on Monday. Sometimes a kitchen is just a kitchen, but not often. This elaborate show, which draws from every department in the museum and includes some 300 design objects, examines the kitchen's complex role in everyday life (and lifestyle), product development, advertising, sexual stereotyping, at least two war efforts, contemporary art and, throughout, in the evolution of design itself. The centerpiece is a rare, nearly complete example of the cockpitlike, mass-produced Frankfurt Kitchen from 1926-27, an exemplar of the modern spirit that still looks invitingly usable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)20110428
Kenneth Noland: 'Paintings, 1958-1968'; closes on Saturday. This invigorating survey of early, casually geometric stain canvases by an exemplar of Color Field painting emphasizes unknown, idiosyncratic works. They helpfully expand the sense of both his formal vocabulary and his achievement by emphasizing its links to everyday motifs (airplane propellers, military insignia) and to the less austere styles of preceding painters like Adolph Gottlieb, Marsden Hartley and Jackson Pollock. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea , (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Smith)20110428
'Sascha Braunig'; closes on Saturday. Ms. Braunig cooks up a strange brew of portraiture, Surrealism and luminescent abstraction in her auspicious, first solo exhibition. Painting on medium-small canvases with a sensuous, greasy touch, Ms. Braunig renders humanoid heads that have been weirdly transformed. In the nocturnally dark ''Eyes Peeled,'' a head tightly wrapped in fabric sprinkled with shiny flecks and with a hank of red, flyaway hair gazes back with scary, orbicular eyes like a remonstrative demon. Foxy Production, 623 West 27th Street, Chelsea , (212) 239-2758, foxyproduction.com. (Johnson)20110428
'Sammlung Ludwig: Art of the Sixties & Hans Haacke: The Chocolate Master'; closes on Friday. In 1969 the German businessman and art collector Peter Ludwig published a remarkable catalog of his collection of contemporary works mostly by Americans who would become blue-chip commodities. Presented here unbound, its pages in grids covering the gallery walls, it is a fascinating time capsule. The gallery has also provided commentary in the form of an artist's book by Hans Haacke that details Ludwig's anti-labor business practices and the tax advantages he enjoyed as an art collector. Specific Object, 601 West 26th Street , (212) 242-6253, specificobject.com. (Johnson)20110428
- Friedrich Schroder-Sonnenstern: 'From Barefoot Prophet to Avant-Garde Artist'; closes on Saturday. Was Friedrich Schroder-Sonnenstern crazy? Or was he crazy like a fox? Either way, the German artist long known to fans of outsider art was certainly some kind of crackpot genius, and his cartoonish, sexually charged, mystically suggestive colored pencil drawings from the 1950s are as compelling for their beautiful draftsmanship as they are for their bizarre metaphysics and gleefully fierce satire.

HEADLINE: New Census Finds China's Population Growth Has Slowed

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES and SHARON LaFRANIERE

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China's population grew more urbanized, educated and older as the growth of the world's most populous nation slowed to a pace half that of the previous decade, results of the 2010 census released on Thursday indicated.
The census also documented a vast internal migration, concluding that more than 261 million citizens -- nearly one in five -- were living in places other than where China's household registration process had indicated that they did. Most of those are probably migrant laborers who have swelled big cities in search of higher-paying jobs so as to send money back to families that remain in rural areas. 
The government said China's population was 1.34 billion, an increase of 73.9 million, or 5.8 percent, from the last tally in 2000. That was below the 1.4 billion that United Nations demographers were predicting when the head count was conducted last November, and the slowest rate of growth in nearly half a century, demographers said.
The average household size shrank by 10 percent, to 3.1 people, and the urban population surged by more than 45 percent, leaving urban and rural Chinese nearly equal in number, the census indicated.
Wang Feng, head of the Center for Public Policy at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said the data show that China ''has completely turned a page in its demographic history.''
''It is now a post-transitional population, with very low fertility, quite low mortality, and is being increasingly urbanized,'' he said in an e-mail on Thursday. ''Such a highly mobile society produces a tremendous dynamism for the Chinese economy and society, and at the same time poses great challenges for the government's political control.''
Mr. Wang also said that documentation of a rapidly aging society raised new questions about China's population-control policies, which since 1980 have limited many families to a single child. But President Hu Jintao struck a cautious note in a speech on Tuesday, the state news service Xinhua reported, telling a bureau of the Communist Party's Central Committee that China should ''stick to and improve its current family planning policy and maintain a low birthrate.''
For a country dead set on joining the ranks of the globe's most advanced nations, the huge count yielded both promising and disturbing results.
The share of Chinese who were educated rose sharply. University graduates are now about 8.9 out of 100 citizens, an increase of about 2.5 times, and rates of those who have graduated from high school and vocational schools also rose, though not as much.
Yu Xie, a professor of sociology, statistics and population studies at the University of Michigan, said the increase in the number of college-educated Chinese would ''place China in a better position in international competition for economic growth.''
''Future economic growth will not only come from manufacturing but from services and high technology,'' he said, which will require better-educated workers. ''China is already prepared for a post-industrial transition.''
But the figures also revealed less promising trends. They confirmed a yawning gender gap, with 118 male newborns for every 100 females, a disparity researchers blame partly on family planning policies that they say have encouraged abortions of female fetuses.
The population aged markedly: the share of Chinese under age 15 dropped 6.3 percent, while that of those over 60 rose by 2.93 percent. That presages a shrinking labor market, which economists predict will increase pressure for higher wages and divert a gusher of government money into pensions, medical care and other services for the elderly.
The growing proportion of older people can be explained partly by China's low fertility rate in recent decades, with fewer births to offset the aged. Cai Yong, a demographer at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, said the number of children under 15 was even lower than expected, pointing to a fertility rate of about 1.4 children per woman.
That is significantly below the government's estimated fertility rate of 1.8, and should put pressure on China's leaders to loosen family planning policies, he said.
Ma Jianting, the director of China's National Bureau of Statistics, said at a news conference on Thursday that the slowed rate of population growth showed that the one-child policy had ''eased the pressure on resources and the environment and laid a relatively good foundation for steady and rapid economic and social development.''
But he suggested that the population's rapid aging was a matter of potential concern. ''We also need to pay close attention to the new changes of our population structure, adhering to the family planning policy while cautiously and gradually improving the policy to promote more balanced population growth in the country,'' the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying.

HEADLINE: Weak Link in an Export Chain

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- For years, China's export juggernaut has been fed by highly efficient factories, low-cost labor and a fleet of container ships capable of transporting huge volumes of toys, textiles, electronics and other goods to every corner of the world.
But there is a surprisingly weak link in the Made in China chain.
Moving those goods from the factory floor to one of China's enormous seaports -- often a drive of less than two hours -- typically means relying on an independent trucking company. And as vital as trucking is to China's mighty export machine, the government seems to be ignoring the drawbacks of what analysts say is an increasingly disorganized, inefficient and even costly way to transport factory goods to seaports.
Trucking's tenuous status has been underscored by recent protests and demonstrations by drivers. Last week, in an unusually bold display of public anger, 2,000 truckers went on strike in Shanghai to complain about the rising cost of fuel and unfair government transportation fees. Some protestors hurled rocks, tried to overturn police cars and smashed the windshields of truck drivers who refused to join the strike. 
The Shanghai municipal government eventually ended the three-day strike by arresting protestors and threatening strike organizers, while also promising to lower some fees that trucking companies must pay to use the roads and seaport.
But the challenges that trucking pose to China's $1.5 trillion a year in exports are still in place -- and could become even greater, now that huge factories have begun relocating to poorer, inland regions to save on labor costs.
''Our concern is that as these factories move away from the coast, the service standards won't keep pace,'' said Ken Glenn, an executive at APL, a transportation services company. ''Rail and barge are even less developed.''
Within China, thousands of small trucking companies, many of them family-owned, compete by promising low-cost delivery. Then they overload their 18-wheelers in dangerous ways, pay bribes to ward off highway inspectors and hope to eke out tiny profits.
Now, though, with global oil prices sending the cost of fuel soaring, many truckers say they are heading toward bankruptcy.
''We're paying a lot more money for fuel than we did three years ago, but what we get paid for freight has stayed the same,'' said Qi Zhenwei, a truck owner stationed at a dusty trucking depot near one of Shanghai's busiest ports. ''How am I supposed to survive?''
Mark Millar, a China logistics expert at M Power Associates in Hong Kong, sees Chinese trucking as ''a seriously fragmented and brutally competitive industry.''
''Most of the drivers are owner-operators, and in order to make money, they carry more cargo than the truck is supposed to hold,'' Mr. Millar said. ''This is obviously not a healthy model.''
Not all trucking in China is such a seat-of-the-pants affair. Some global companies transport goods by truck in sealed shipping containers from factory to dock, sometimes accompanied by security escorts.
But more often, goods destined for export are delivered to seaports by small trucking companies -- usually hired by logistics firms that bargain to get the lowest possible shipping price. To scrape by, many of the small trucking firms violate the law, pay bribes to avoid heavy fines and transportation restrictions, and even force drivers to sleep in the trucks overnight, sometimes in insecure parking lots.
These rigors might seem to contradict the heavy investment in infrastructure and expressways that China has made to make its transportation network more efficient.
But many of this country's modern roadways are expensive toll roads. And the government has placed tough regulations on many aspects of the transportation industry, which analysts say have burdened companies with heavy taxes, insurance and government fees. As a result, transporting goods by truck in China is relatively more expensive than doing so in the United States.
According to the American Trucking Associations, moving goods by truck in the United States costs about $1.75 per mile. That includes driver salaries, truck leases, insurance, tolls and many other related costs.
By comparison, trucking costs in China's two biggest export regions -- the Yangtze River Delta region near Shanghai and the Pearl River Delta around Hong Kong -- are $2.50 to $3 a mile. That is despite low pay to Chinese drivers, who might earn only 25 cents an hour, versus about $17 an hour in the United States.
Corruption is also a major problem. Chinese truck drivers say highway and port inspectors routinely demand payoffs or bribes. Drivers who refuse to pay may find themselves hit by large fines for even the smallest infraction. (That many of the trucks are overweight makes them ripe for sanctions.) Some regions even operate illegal toll booths.
Rachel Katz, a Fulbright research fellow from the United States who is spending a year in China traveling with long-haul truck drivers, says the drivers are constantly harassed by highway officials.
''There's every kind of fine you can imagine,'' she said in a telephone interview from Chengdu, in southwest China. ''There are many different people regulating the roads and finding a way to tax the truckers. I can't believe the system operates this way.''
Ms. Katz recalls one driver telling her: ''In the U.S., you issue tickets in order to control traffic. In China, we control traffic in order to issue tickets.''
Truck drivers do not get much sympathy from their clients -- factory bosses who are also struggling to cope with inflation. With labor and raw material and energy prices soaring here, factories are reluctant to pay higher fees to move goods to the major ports.
Besides, many of the factory bosses seem to recognize that there is an oversupply of small trucking companies desperate for cargo.
''They face a situation of absolutely cutthroat competition, and many of them are not well educated,'' said Tyrrell Duncan, a transportation director at the Asian Development Bank. ''There aren't programs to train them.''
Qi Zhenwei, who is 35, and his 31-year-old brother, Qi Erwei, are typical trucking bosses working in Shanghai's bustling Baoshan port district.
Despite fears of government reprisals, they agreed to talk this week in the rusted metal container that now serves as a lounge at their dusty truck depot, amid engine parts and a bucket filled with cigarette butts. Between phone calls and dashes in and out of the makeshift lounge to talk to colleagues, they told their story.
Until about seven years ago, they were peasant farmers struggling to make a living in Henan Province, one of the country's poorest regions. Neither of them had finished high school.
They traveled more than 500 miles east to Shanghai and found work as truck drivers. (''I once went 24 consecutive days without sleeping in a bed,'' Qi Zhenwei said.) Eventually, they earned enough to combine their savings with $100,000 they borrowed from some friends and relatives to buy their own fleet of five new and used Chinese-made trucks.
But shortly after they invested in some of their most expensive vehicles, the global financial crisis struck. Exports plummeted, devastating their container hauling business. A year later, in 2009, when China's exports began to rebound, so did inflation and fuel prices. And now, the brothers are faced with greater competition from a growing number of small trucking companies.
''So far, I didn't make any money,'' Qi Zhenwei complained.
The brothers refused to talk about the recent strike here, saying the government had been visiting all truckers in the area. But they freely discussed their costs: tire fees, insurance, driver salaries, road use fees, oil changes, repairs and even fees that trucks pay to enter the city.
''If I had a chance to sell the truck, I'd get out of the business,'' the older brother said, dejectedly smoking a cigarette. ''I'd go back to my hometown. Now, people there are planting crops for Chinese medicine. And they're making good money.''

HEADLINE: Chrysler Says Government Loans Are Now Unnecessary

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Chrysler will soon pay back its government loans because they have become ''redundant and unnecessary'' now that the automaker is more financially stable, its chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, said Thursday.
Mr. Marchionne said Chrysler would save enough interest by refinancing the loans to ''make a material difference on our profit-and-loss table.'' He declined to say how much less the company expected to pay.
''The markets are there now, and our performance is consistent with the objectives we set for ourselves,'' he told reporters at Chrysler's sport utility vehicle plant on the east side of Detroit. ''It's time to try and close the loop on what had been an incredibly necessary intervention.'' 
Mr. Marchionne has said repeatedly that the interest payments to the two governments were the sole reason that Chrysler was in the red. But he stopped short of saying that Chrysler would be profitable after repaying the $7.5 billion in loans to the American and Canadian governments later this quarter. The company lost $652 million last year and paid $1.23 billion in interest on the bailout loans.
In February, Mr. Marchionne complained that Chrysler was forced to pay ''shyster'' interest rates on its government loans before later apologizing for using the term.
Chrysler said it planned to sell bonds to investors and take out a credit line from several banks to repay the loans. Mr. Marchionne said the deal was not finished but expressed confidence that the company was ''quite attractive to the capital markets.''
''When we become accountable to the capital markets, it's much healthier,'' he said.
At the same time, the Italian automaker Fiat, which owns 30 percent of Chrysler, intends to pay $1.27 billion for an additional 16 percent. Fiat can become Chrysler's majority owner after Chrysler begins selling a car that is rated at 40 miles a gallon, the last of three milestones laid out in the two companies' partnership agreement.
Mr. Marchionne spoke after giving the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, a tour of the Detroit plant, which builds the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango.
Mr. Geithner told the Detroit Economic Club that the government would lose money on its investment in the auto industry -- though less than expected. Still, Mr. Geithner said, the Treasury was working to get the best possible return on taxpayers' investment.
''We didn't do these things to maximize return. We did them to save jobs,'' he said. ''The biggest impact of these programs was in the millions of jobs saved.''
The Treasury still owns 26 percent of General Motors, which repaid $8.1 billion in government loans a year ago, but shares of G.M. have fallen below their $33 initial public offering price.
''We are in a much stronger position today as a country'' because of the intervention, he said.
Mr. Marchionne said that eliminating its government ownership would not result in significant changes in Chrysler's operations but it could help sales somewhat.
''There's no doubt in my mind the perception of our brands and the perception of this house is going to improve,'' he said.
Jesse Toprak, vice president for industry trends and insight at TrueCar.com, which researches the auto industry, said only a small percentage of consumers were likely to see Chrysler differently after it repaid the loans, because most people did not follow the company closely enough.
Chrysler has more work to do before it can be considered healthy, Mr. Toprak said, but it has made enormous progress since being close to collapse two years ago.
''Chrysler made the best of what they could in this period of recovery and this limbo ownership situation,'' he said. ''They were actually surprisingly good in some of their new vehicle introductions.''

HEADLINE: Lincoln Center to Venture Into China as Adviser for a Performing Arts Project

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
Venturing into a possible new area of revenue, Lincoln Center has agreed to serve as a paid adviser to the developers of a proposed performing arts complex in Tianjin, China's fifth largest city, the center announced on Thursday.
Lincoln Center officials described the three-year agreement, with an undisclosed dollar value, as the beginning of an effort to supplement ticket sales and donations by serving as expert consultants to clients from around the world who might want to adopt the center's model of cultural programming. 
Under the deal, which is subject to the completion of a binding agreement, Lincoln Center will recommend the content of artistic programming, propose an economic model for the performing arts center's operations, establish a design and construction process, and provide staff training. Center officials already offer informal advice to cultural counterparts who visit the New York campus.
''Since Lincoln Center is the world's largest performing arts center, this is a natural role for us to assume,'' Katherine A. Farley, the chairwoman of the center, said in an interview Thursday.
At a ceremony scheduled for Thursday evening, center officials planned to sign a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese state-owned company, the Tianjin Innovative Finance Investment Company, that is creating the arts center as part of a larger development in the city. The ceremony was to include dinner on the stage of Alice Tully Hall and a performance by Jie Yuan, a Chinese pianist in the Julliard School's masters program, followed by a performance of the New York Philharmonic featuring the pianist Emanuel Ax. Li Bo, the investment company's chairman, was scheduled to attend, along with Cui Jindu, the vice mayor of Tianjin.
''It is the first step in the establishment of a world-class arts center that will have an incredible impact on the community reaching far beyond Tianjin,'' Mr. Li said in a statement.
The president of Lincoln Center, Reynold Levy, said, ''This is the first time that any performing arts center in America has achieved a memorandum of understanding with the Chinese government for these kinds of services.''
Lincoln Center is not the first American cultural organization to market its expertise. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation has for years teamed up with foreign institutions to develop satellite branches. In this case Lincoln Center is not building a franchise, but helping generate arts centers that will ultimately operate independently of Lincoln Center.
The new Chinese arts center is scheduled to be built in Yujiapu, a development of about 1.5 square miles, which is about 45 minutes by a bullet train from Beijing. In concept Yujiapu is to resemble the Pudong District in Shanghai, which has emerged as China's financial and commercial hub since it was developed in the 1990s. Yujiapu is within commuting distance of about 32 million residents in Tianjin and Beijing, Lincoln Center officials said.
Executives from the investment company have visited Lincoln Center twice, and center officials have met with them once in China. Ms. Farley said the company's officials were interested in the center's $1.2 billion physical redevelopment project, as well as its programming.
''There is a national focus in China now that came out of the recent National People's Congress stating that culture is one of the key priorities for China,'' Ms. Farley said. ''One of the challenges that China is facing like many other countries is that they have new performing arts centers, and they have not been able to fill them with appropriate content.''
Tianjin is in the midst of a major expansion, to be anchored by Yujiapu. The performing arts complex is scheduled to open around 2015.
Lincoln Center officials said they had yet to work out the details of adding staff and resources to manage its new consulting activities, but they added that they have had discussions with other potential clients.
''Once we know we definitely have a deal, we will be retaining additional capacity to make sure we have the leverage to support those services,'' Ms. Farley said, ''but to continue keeping our eye on the ball of the main Lincoln Center mission.''
Ms. Farley said she became aware of the performing arts center project because the real estate firm Tishman Speyer, where she is a senior managing director, has an office in Tianjin. Lincoln Center said it would continue to provide free advice to outside arts executives who make brief visits to the campus, though in considerably less depth. ''We are going to be very selective about these intense engagements which are time consuming and serious and important and extend over a significant period,'' Mr. Levy said. ''But we have an obligation we feel as the leading performing arts center in the world to help our colleagues.''

HEADLINE: How the Law Accepted Gays

BYLINE: By DALE CARPENTER. 
Dale Carpenter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, is the author of the forthcoming ''Flagrant Conduct: The Story of Lawrence v. Texas.''

 BODY:
Minneapolis
THE prestigious law firm King & Spalding has not fully explained its decision this week to stop assisting Congress in defending the law that forbids federal recognition of same-sex marriage. But its reversal suggests the extent to which gay men and lesbians have persuaded much of the legal profession to accept the basic proposition that sexual orientation is irrelevant to a person's worth and that the law should reflect this judgment. The decision cannot be dismissed simply as a matter of political correctness or bullying by gays.
Gay-rights supporters have transformed the law and the legal profession, opening the doors of law firms, law schools and courts to people who were once casually and cruelly shut out because of their sexual orientation. 
But it was a process that took a half-century to unfold. In 1961, a Harvard-trained astronomer, Frank Kameny, stood alone against the federal government. Fired from his federal job simply for being gay, he wanted to petition the Supreme Court. But at a time when all 50 states still criminalized sodomy, even the American Civil Liberties Union declared it had no interest in challenging laws ''aimed at the suppression or elimination of homosexuals.'' Mr. Kameny wrote his own appellate brief; without comment, the court turned him away.
Over the next quarter-century, lifted by gales of change in sexual morality and in the status of women, gay-rights advocates mobilized at every level of the legal profession. In the late 1960s, they successfully challenged the antigay civil service policies under which Mr. Kameny had been discharged. In 1973, a small group of gay lawyers formed the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, enlisting the help of prominent heterosexual lawyers. They drafted legislation protecting gays from discrimination in housing and employment.
At the same time, gay-rights supporters began lobbying law schools, and then professional organizations like the American Bar Association, to adopt nondiscrimination policies. With these in place, they pressured schools to exclude law firms from on-campus recruiting unless they agreed not to discriminate against gay students in hiring. The Association of American Law Schools endorsed this approach. These developments paved the way for firms that had once fired suspected homosexuals to adopt their own nondiscrimination policies.
Changes in the profession ran in parallel with the evolution of jurisprudence on sexuality. In 1986, in Bowers v. Hardwick, the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia sodomy law. Five justices -- one of whom told a closeted law clerk that he had never met a gay person -- dismissed the idea of a right to gay sex as ''at best, facetious.'' But four justices disagreed -- a harbinger. Within a decade, openly gay law clerks had become unremarkable.
In 1996, the year Congress passed the Defense of Marriage Act -- the law it is now defending -- the Supreme Court struck down an antigay state constitutional amendment in Colorado. Justice Antonin Scalia, dissenting, saw the tide turning. He tried to rewrite the narrative from one of a small and despised minority to one of an elitist legal corps disparaging ordinary Americans. The majority decision, he wrote, reflected ''the views and values of the lawyer class from which the court's members are drawn.''
Any doubt left about where most lawyers stood was eliminated in 2003 in Lawrence v. Texas, which involved another sodomy law. Lambda Legal led the challenge, helped by Jenner & Block, a firm with extensive Supreme Court experience. Other big firms, groups like the American Bar Association and scholars filed supporting briefs. The cumulative effect of decades of work by gay-rights advocates was that the best firms and many of the best lawyers were unwilling to defend sodomy laws on constitutional, let alone policy, grounds. The court agreed, holding in Lawrence that such laws demeaned the very existence of gay people.
No serious case can be made that an institution as powerful as Congress has a right to the services of the biggest law firms and the most credentialed lawyers. The Defense of Marriage Act is not unpopular, and while Congress may be indebted, it is not indigent. A thornier question arises when a firm withdraws from a representation, though in this case the quick withdrawal evidently caused no harm to the client. More troubling is the possibility that a firm might quit because of outside economic pressure rather than principle, though it is unclear whether such pressure played a role in this case.
As Mr. Kameny's lone crusade showed, the legal profession was not in the vanguard of gay rights. Unlike Mr. Kameny, of course, the House will have excellent counsel on its side: a former solicitor general who resigned from King & Spalding to protest its decision. The world of legal professionals is still a diverse one where basic values collide every day. Respectable constitutional arguments for the Defense of Marriage Act will surely be made -- but grounded in ideas, one hopes, not contempt.

HEADLINE: Growth Slowed In First Quarter For U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
American economic expansion slowed to a crawl in the first quarter, but economists are hopeful that the setback will be temporary. Total output grew at an annual rate of 1.8 percent from January through March, the Commerce Department said Thursday, after expanding at a 3.1 percent pace in the fourth quarter of 2010.
When the year began, economists expected a more robust growth rate of about 4 percent, only to be barraged by bad report after bad report. Turmoil in the Middle East led to higher oil prices, which had already been climbing because of increased demand in emerging markets like China. Housing sales dropped sharply. Winter blizzards closed businesses and delayed construction, causing investments in nonresidential structures like office buildings to fall 21.7 percent from the previous quarter. Imports, which are subtracted from gross domestic product, surged. Military spending sank. 
Economists say many of these problems will fade later in the year and economic growth will hasten through the spring. Last quarter's dismal news was, fingers crossed, ''a pause, not a trend,'' said Kathy Bostjancic, director for macroeconomic analysis at the Conference Board.
The American public seems less certain.
Every time the economy has appeared to be on the verge of taking off, prospects have been thwarted by troubles at home (like housing) and abroad (like the European debt crises last year). As a result, Americans seem to be tiring of predictions that things will pick up ''soon.'' A Gallup poll released Thursday found that 29 percent of Americans believed the economy was in a depression.
''The G.D.P. went up, and that's all fine and good, but in the real marketplace that's definitely not the case,'' said Jeff Beatty, a 62-year-old information technology professional in Richmond, Ky. Despite applying for 214 jobs ''across half of the country,'' he said, he has been unable to find work for the last year.
To some extent these frustrations, and false starts in the economy, may have been predictable. Historical research by the economists Carmen and Vincent Reinhart has shown that economic recoveries after financial crises are always fragile and painfully slow. So even though the work-stopping blizzards of winter have passed, and export growth looks likely to pick up again, other obstacles may rock the remainder of the year.
Of these various economic menaces, the most threatening is higher commodity prices, which reduce the amount of money that households and businesses have available to spend on other purchases and, in the case of companies, additional employees. Crude oil prices have risen 32 percent over the last three months and have shown little sign of falling in recent weeks. These increases, along with those on food and other goods, have nearly neutralized the 2011 payroll tax cuts that were intended as a stimulus.
''For rising prices of oil and gasoline, the main place it hurts the economy is the pain it puts on consumers, and we continue to monitor that impact,'' said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. He said he expected consumer spending to continue growing apace, however.
Declines in government spending will probably remain a drag on the economy throughout the year, as state and local governments cut back and the federal government tries to cut spending over all. Last quarter's steep drop in military spending, a category that tends to be volatile, will probably reverse itself later in the year, economists said.
Investors largely shrugged off the report for the last quarter, with stock prices little changed on the day.
The main sources of strength last quarter were greater inventories on stockroom shelves and more business spending on equipment and software. Equipment and software purchases have grown for eight consecutive quarters and have only recently been accompanied by hiring strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
At an unprecedented news conference on Wednesday, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, addressed concerns about sluggish growth so far this year.
''Most of the slowdown in the first quarter is viewed by the committee as being transitory,'' Mr. Bernanke said, referring to the opinions of the Fed's Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates. ''That being said, we've taken our forecast down just a bit, taking into account factors like weaker construction and possibly just a bit less momentum in the economy.''
Several economic reports in recent weeks have been relatively optimistic, including industrial production, corporate earnings and -- finally -- job growth. The nation's employers added 216,000 jobs in March, the fastest growth since last spring, when the federal government temporarily increased hiring for the decennial census. The job growth this year has been spread through almost every sector.
''The broad set of labor market indicators still look good,'' said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs, which is forecasting that the economy will accelerate and expand at a 4 percent annual rate in the second quarter.
Still, given the ground lost during the recession, the economy has a long way to go before its job market and output are feeling healthy again. There are some fears that the slow expansion in the first quarter may weigh on job growth, since employment trends tend to lag whatever happens in the rest of the economy.
''Payroll growth may have a temporary wobble,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''This is not a fundamental shift in the path of recovery but maybe a temporary distortion.''
Economists played down the economic threat to the United States from Japan's deadly earthquake and tsunami in March.
''It only happened at the very end of the quarter, and any disruptions to supply chains would take a few weeks to come through,'' said Paul Dales, a senior United States economist at Capital Economics. ''If there's any effect, it'll happen in the second quarter, but the impact should be minimal.''

HEADLINE: In a Small Town, Big Life-Changers

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''Lebanon, Pa.'' retells the old story of the city mouse and the country mouse while meticulously applying it to America's simmering culture wars. Written, directed and edited by Ben Hickernell, the movie avoids making any grand statements or raising emotional temperatures more than necessary.
That's not easy given that abortion is the central issue riling up the characters as they argue over the choices facing a smart, pregnant, college-bound 17-year-old girl. 
Just as Ellen Page was the spark that ignited ''Juno,''Rachel Kitson, who plays CJ, the mouthy, forthright teenager at the center of the storm, illuminates a movie that is otherwise so studiously balanced an examination of teenage pregnancy that it deserves a medal for evenhandedness.
The city mouse, Will (Josh Hopkins), is a cynical 35-year-old advertising executive in Philadelphia with a history of sour relationships -- one of which shatters in the movie's opening moments when his girlfriend of four years tells him he is incapable of love.
The country mouse is Will's second cousin Andy (Ian Merrill Peakes), who lives in Lebanon, Pa., where Will's father settled after divorcing his wife, Jeanette (Mary Beth Hurt). When his father dies, Will makes the two-hour drive to Lebanon to settle his dad's affairs. His car is plastered with stickers that announce, ''I vote pro-choice!'' and ''Go green!''
Once in Lebanon, he meets Andy, a Catholic and a strict father who lives across the street with his two children, CJ and her younger brother. Will is mildly taken aback when Andy, after welcoming him into the house, insists they all hold hands and say grace. When CJ, with whom he develops a playful friendship, impulsively confides to him that she is pregnant, he finds himself drawn into the family drama. In the meantime, the messages stuck on his car draw dirty looks from the conservative townspeople.
A major subplot involves Will's affair with Vicki (Samantha Mathis), an attractive married teacher he meets in a bar and not so discreetly pursues. The movie asks us to believe that after a lifetime of failed relationships Will's desire for Vicki has a depth and selflessness he has never before exhibited. But Mr. Hopkins's performance gives scant indication of any positive sea change in his character.
If ''Lebanon, Pa.'' is a tidy little indie with steady acting, it is too politically self-aware to transcend its well-mannered sense of fairness. But the performances by Ms. Kitson and Ms. Hurt give it spritzes of energy.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders, in Letter, Will Urge Albany to Legalize Gay Marriage

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Two dozen high-profile New York business leaders plan to release an open letter on Friday urging state lawmakers to legalize same-sex marriage, arguing that the measure would help companies attract and retain employees. 
The letter's release comes as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and gay rights advocates prepare what they say will be a major push to pass legislation this spring that would make New York the sixth state in the nation to allow same-sex couples to wed. The letter's signers, from the legal, financial and real estate worlds, include Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; Jerry I. Speyer, chairman of Tishman Speyer Properties; and Paul E. Singer, a prominent hedge fund executive.
''In an age where talent determines the economic winners, great states and cities must demonstrate a commitment to creating an open, healthy and equitable environment in which to live and work,'' the letter reads. ''As other states, cities and countries across the world extend marriage rights regardless of sexual orientation, it will become increasingly difficult to recruit the best talent if New York cannot offer the same benefits and protection.''
The letter reflects efforts by gay rights advocates to broaden their coalition after an embarrassing defeat in Albany, where a proposal to legalize same-sex marriage lost in the State Senate in 2009. This year, advocates are focusing on a few Democrats and Republicans who are thought to be open to switching their votes.
Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, an influential business group, said she hoped the letter would ''provide an opportunity for legislators who may not have heard the voice of business to feel that they've got some cover to rethink their position on this issue.'' Ms. Wylde helped collect signatures for the letter at the urging of Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council, who has been lobbying the Legislature to approve a bill.
In an interview, Ms. Quinn said, ''I knew there was support out there, yet when you talked and did lobbying in Albany, there was no way to show that to people.''
One prominent supporter, John J. Mack, the chairman of Morgan Stanley, said that he believed legalizing same-sex marriage would help attract more talent to New York, but that he saw the issue chiefly as one of fairness. ''It's that simple,'' Mr. Mack said. ''I grew up in North Carolina. I'm 66 years old. I grew up when there was segregation. It makes an impression on you.''
Some of the executives who signed the letter are well known in political circles, including Alan J. Patricof, a venture capitalist and major Democratic donor, Mr. Mack and Mr. Singer, who is active in Republican politics. Others venture more rarely into the political spotlight, including the corporate lawyer Martin Lipton.
Some of the business leaders are close to the Senate Republican caucus, which voted unanimously against the marriage bill two years ago. Mr. Speyer, for example, is an influential voice among the city's real estate developers, whose financial support was decisive in helping Republicans take control of the Senate in the election last fall.

HEADLINE: Revenue From Refining Helped Lift Profit at Exxon Mobil and Shell

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell reported huge increases in their first-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by higher oil prices and earnings from refining.
Exxon Mobil, the largest American oil company, said net income rose 69 percent to $10.7 billion, or $2.14 a share, in the first three months of this year, from $6.3 billion, or $1.33 a share, in the same period last year. 
The earnings beat some analysts' expectations, and was the fifth consecutive quarter that Exxon reported an earnings increase.
Shell reported earlier on Thursday that its profit for the period rose 30 percent.
Oil companies are benefiting from a rise of more than 30 percent of the price of oil over the last year. Concerns about political unrest in North Africa and the Middle East have pushed prices to heights some analysts said were not justified by the level of demand. Continued growth in economic demand is expected to support a relatively high price of oil but there are signs that rising gasoline prices are keeping some consumers in the United States from filling up their tanks.
Exxon's earnings ''reflect continued leadership in operational performance during a period of strong commodity prices,'' Exxon's chairman, Rex W. Tillerson, said in a statement.
Exxon's and Shell's earnings were much better than those of its rivals BP and ConocoPhillips, which reported figures Wednesday. BP reported a drop in first-quarter earnings because of costs linked to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and ConocoPhillips missed some analysts' expectations because of a decline in production. Chevron, the second-largest American oil company, is set to report earnings on Friday.
Revenue at Exxon increased 26 percent, to $114 billion, from $90.3 billion; oil-equivalent production increased more than 10 percent from the first quarter of last year. A group of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters on average expected Exxon to report a first-quarter profit of $2.07 a share.
Royal Dutch Shell, Europe's biggest oil company by market value, said profit excluding one-time items rose to $6.3 billion from $4.8 billion after refining profit more than doubled to $1.65 billion.
Shell has been cutting costs and selling assets to make the company more profitable. Earlier this year, Peter Voser, Shell chief executive of Shell, said he would continue to reduce costs by another $1 billion and at the same time increase output by investing in new projects, including in Qatar.
''We are making good progress against our targets, to deliver a more competitive performance,'' Mr. Voser said in a statement Thursday.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Utopian Society Made Up of Business Moguls in Fedoras

BYLINE: By CARINA CHOCANO

 BODY:
Could anyone have guessed, way back when it was published in 1957, that ''Atlas Shrugged,'' Ayn Rand's grandiloquent doorstop of a masterwork, would one day reach the big screen as high-camp comedy? Because stilted prose and silly plotting notwithstanding, Rand's unrelentingly popular book has exerted a powerful ideological hold on the culture, an influence that has only intensified in recent years with the emergence of the Tea Party. Still, for unintentional yet somehow boring hilarity, the novel can't touch the cinematic adaptation, which shifts the action to 2016 and presents Rand's ham-fisted fable of laissez-faire capitalism as something C-Span might make if it ever set out to create a futuristic, proto-libertarian nighttime soap. In the 1980s. 
''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' may be set only five years from now, but the world it portrays is completely unrecognizable. It imagines an America in the stranglehold of a Soviet-style government, given to legislating equal opportunity and making it illegal for profitable corporations to lay off employees. An opening TV news panic montage lets us know that the country is in the grip of an economic crisis and plagued by oil shortages and rampant unemployment. It's also apparently beset with bizarre aesthetic forays into the past, when mysterious men in fedoras skulked past hobo trashcan fires on their way into diners where waitresses served homemade pie, and socialites took their hair-styling cues from Aaron Spelling.
In this backward-glancing world, it makes sense that trains should once again become the preferred mode of transport of the future. This anachronism should mean good news for the steely blond railroad executive Dagny Taggart (Taylor Schilling) of Taggart Transcontinental, if only her spineless brother James (Matthew Marsden) didn't insist on letting his friends in Washington tell him how to run his business.
Finally tiring of James's incompetence, Dagny teams up with the visionary metallurgist Hank Rearden (Grant Bowler) and the blustery oil magnate Ellis Wyatt (Graham Beckel) to update an old railway line through Colorado. Meanwhile, magnates, moguls, business titans and captains of industry are vanishing, each fresh disappearance marked with a murmured question, ''Who is John Galt?''
''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' never flinches from its mission to portray those more fortunate as victims of a lazy, parasitic society that would bleed them dry and leave them for dead, given the chance. (''Why all these stupid altruistic urges?'' Dagny asks Hank at one point. ''What's wrong with people today?'' Hank doesn't know. He's just happy to be with someone who hates humanity as attractively as he does.) It's a hard sell, and you've got to admire the gumption and the commitment, but it would take a far smarter, more subtle movie than this even to approach pulling it off.
This project was in development for 18 years, and was finally rushed into being by one of its producers, John Aglialoro, who wrote the script with Brian Patrick O'Toole and reportedly spent about $10 million of his own money, before the option ran out. (The movie, which is envisioned as part of a trilogy, opened on April 15.)
The resulting film, directed by Paul Johansson, feels rushed, amateurish and clumsy. It's not just the ideologies that feel oddly out of step with the present day, but the clothes, hairstyles and interiors -- which are meant to register as lavish -- instead come across as low-rent and sad. The idea that a billionaire industrialist like Hank Rearden would submit to the mean-spirited harping of a frigid, frizzy-haired wife who despises him feels like a relic from another era, before trophy wives were invented. If this is how the mega-rich live in Ayn Rand's America, they might want to take a tip or two from the Russian oligarchs.
''I'm simply cultivating a world that celebrates individual achievement,'' says John Galt, the Pied Piper of the business-class set, as he lures away yet another top business leader to his utopian society consisting entirely of, uh, top business leaders -- and if that sounds appealing to you, you may form part of the intended audience. Because it takes some serious brand identity to get away with dialogue like that, or this:
''Midas Mulligan!'' a man in a fedora calls out to a passing banker on a shadowy street.
''Who's asking?'' says the banker.
''Someone who knows what it's like to work for himself and not let others feed off the profit of his energy!''
''That's funny,'' replies the banker. ''Exactly what I've been thinking.''
It is funny, especially considering the derivative nature of his job. But ''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' is in many ways charmingly oblivious to its inherent contradictions and the fact that its capitalist titans appear to be squatting in old, abandoned ''Dynasty'' sets, eating food-court baked potatoes.
''Atlas Shrugged: Part I'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some very bland sexuality and near-lethal levels of exposition.

HEADLINE: In Shuttle's Waning Days, One of the Last Reasons to Cheer

BYLINE: By HENRY FOUNTAIN

 BODY:
TITUSVILLE, Fla. -- As it has many times before, sometime Friday afternoon the stretch of Route 1 in front of Chris Galorneau's restaurant will turn into a parking lot.
Drivers will abandon their cars, and customers will pour out of the Village Inn, where Mr. Galorneau is the general manager, as they will at businesses up and down Route 1, which serves as a main street for this city of 45,000.
Shortly before 4 p.m., all eyes will turn toward the Kennedy Space Center, 12 miles east across the wide expanse of the Indian River Lagoon. There, at Launch Pad 39A, if the weather allows, the shuttle Endeavour will thunder into the sky on a pedestal of flame, carrying six astronauts on a two-week mission to the International Space Station. 
''The place will clear out,'' Mr. Galorneau said Wednesday while waitresses bustled around him, and every diner got a free piece of pie for Pie Rush Wednesday. ''Everybody crowds down to the river. And then, as soon it goes up, 10 minutes later I have a packed restaurant and I have a waiting list for hours.''
The brief but jaw-dropping spectacle that is a shuttle launching has occurred 133 times before, and Mr. Galorneau has seen his share (except for the time he was stuck inside making pancake batter -- ''You can't run a pancake house without pancake batter,'' he said -- and got to feel the building shake). This launching is expected to be one of the biggest ever, with perhaps three-quarters of a million people jamming Titusville, Cape Canaveral and other nearby towns.
Some of the interest in the Endeavour mission is no doubt because of the drama involving its commander, Capt. Mark E. Kelly, whose wife, Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona, was gravely wounded in a shooting in January. She is here to watch the launching. And some of it is no doubt because of an anticipated visit by President Obama.
But the main draw is the fact that after this liftoff, and the launching of the Atlantis in two months, there will be no more space shuttle voyages. After three decades, the program has just about reached the end of the line.
''You're not going to see another one -- this is going to be it,'' said Truman Scarborough, who was Titusville's mayor in the 1980s and served as a Brevard County commissioner for 20 years.
Mr. Scarborough and others said that for the past three or four launchings, the crowds have been getting larger as the program nears its end. Officials were forecasting perhaps a million or more for the Atlantis launch, a crowd that would rival the glory days of the space program, when a mammoth Saturn V rocket propelled the Apollo 11 astronauts toward the moon.
At the space center, the shuttle program's demise is apparent in the physical changes taking place. At Launch Pad 39B, a twin to the pad where the Endeavour sits, workers were dismantling, bit by bit, the giant steel structures that coddled many shuttles before liftoff -- including the Challenger, which rocketed off in 1986, never to return.
Several miles away, at a huge bay where workers would normally be swarming over the shuttle Discovery to ready it for its next mission, they were instead preparing it to be shipped next year to the Smithsonian Institution.
But in Titusville and other towns nearby, the changes are being measured in terms of humans, not hardware. While the shuttle program never really achieved its lofty goal of making spaceflight routine, it did provide a routine for thousands of aerospace workers here.
Some of them -- mostly employees of contractors, not NASA -- have already received pink slips. Many more layoffs and buyouts are to come this summer -- in all, about 8,000.
''It's been our livelihood forever,'' said the Rev. Tom Porter, pastor of Temple Baptist Church here, who said some laid-off members of his congregation had already left for new jobs elsewhere.
Titusville and other communities saw this coming; discussions about the end of the shuttle program began as early as seven years ago. And old-timers have seen this kind of thing before, especially when the Apollo moon program ended in 1973. ''In the early '70s, I used to come over here from St. Petersburg, and it was a ghost town,'' Pastor Porter said.
Indeed, it was the shuttle program that shook the area out of its post-Apollo doldrums. And while NASA plans eventually to replace the shuttles with commercial manned rockets that would use the space center, no one knows how soon that would happen.
Local officials say that the region is much more diverse economically now and that the effect of the space industry, for better or worse, is not as great as it used to be. With its many shuttered businesses -- the Miracle City Mall, just down the block from Mr. Galorneau's restaurant, is a shell of its former self, with only a few stores open -- Titusville is not that different from other Florida cities, far from the Space Coast, which overbuilt in the boom years only to fall hard in the economic downturn.
Aside from the economic diversity, Mr. Scarborough said, there is something else that is different: life is more complicated. Apollo employed a lot of young engineers who quickly pulled up stakes when the program closed. These days the engineers and other workers are older, and many of their spouses work. Leaving for a new job may not be so easy; it may not even be desired.
''Breaking and running, when you're within 10 or 15 years of retirement, doesn't seem to be making sense to them,'' Mr. Scarborough said. ''Which is not what happened after Apollo.''
Pastor Porter said that this week his congregation prayed that President Obama, who has continued to nudge the manned spaceflight program away from NASA and toward private companies, ''would see the launch and be so moved to keep the program going.'' Did he think that would happen? ''No,'' he said. ''Humanly speaking, no way.''
Pastor Porter said that some workers have already taken steps to be ready for layoffs. But others have not.
''The Bible says consider the ants,'' he said. ''The ants -- you know, they toil, they save up, they prepare. Yeah, in a perfect world that would be great.''

HEADLINE: High-Speed Rail

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How Not to Plan for the Future'' (editorial, April 21): 
Investing in high-speed rail in the Northeast corridor may make sense because it has a population density sufficient to generate enough riders to sustain the billions of dollars required to build, maintain and operate the system. Given the current federal spending freeze on high-speed rail, I believe that the time is right to consider seeking private capital to help shoulder the substantial investment needed to achieve true high-speed rail along the corridor.
Under this kind of a public-private partnership, high-speed rail projects would be evaluated by private investors based on the full costs of installation, maintenance and operation, as well as on economic benefits to riders -- rather than blithely following the costly ''build it and they will come'' philosophy.
If we're able to achieve this partnership in the Northeast corridor, it could serve as a model for how to modernize our nation's crumbling infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Japan's Crises Cut The Bottom Lines At Some Concerns

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER; Nick Bunkley and Christopher Drew contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When the earthquake and tsunami struck Japan in March, economists and corporate leaders knew it was only a matter of time for the financial effects to reach American companies.
That time has come.
With quarterly earnings season in full swing, companies are reporting in hard numbers what analysts and business leaders could only predict after the March 11 disaster: consumer sales were lost; breaks with suppliers have led to output cuts; and earnings weakened.
The corporate reporting, based on statements from more than a dozen American companies over the last few weeks, demonstrates how intertwined global markets are, when a disaster thousands of miles away in a coastal area of northern Japan rippled through to an auto retailer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. It also shows that a broad spectrum of companies, like jewelers, handbag makers, clothing retailers and technology companies, were affected. 
Some companies saw opportunity, like General Electric, where officials say a potential market opened for power turbines after the Japanese nuclear plant failed. Others, like Ford Motor, idled plants briefly to conserve parts.
Over all, economists are starting to gauge the effects on the wider economy, evaluating how any slackening in production by individual companies, especially in the automobile and technology sectors, could affect gross domestic product for the rest of the year.
Economists from Goldman Sachs forecast the risk of a cut of a third to a half percentage point to annualized G.D.P. growth in the second quarter, depending mostly on how vehicle production, supply chains and assembly lines are affected.
On Thursday, the Commerce Department said that G.D.P. slowed to an annual pace of 1.8 percent in the first quarter.
''The issue with the Japan earthquake is that there are certain key components which already have caused slowing in certain industries, most notably autos,'' said Andrew Tilton, a senior Goldman Sachs economist and the author of a recent research report on Japan and its effect on economic growth. He added there would be more clarity on the full effect on the economy in the coming weeks.
In fact, some analysts said recent corporate results for the first quarter have not been all that bad, a reflection perhaps of the timing of the earthquake, which happened with just 20 days left in March.
Nearly 80 percent of the 244 companies that have reported first-quarter results so far said sales and operating earnings were better this year than in the first quarter of 2010, according to Howard Silverblatt, Standard & Poor's senior index analyst.
''We have not seen major damage done in Q1, but given the 20-day run we would not have expected that at this point,'' Mr. Silverblatt said. The greater impact could be in the second quarter.
The most immediate effect has been on companies that sell goods in Japan, like Coca-Cola and Gap, which said the events there had lopped off a few cents from earnings per share.
The handbag retailer Coach on Tuesday released its report for the fiscal third quarter ended April 2, estimating the company took a $20 million hit to sales and two and a half cents to earnings per share. It expects a similar blow in the next quarter.
''Obviously consumers in Japan are going to be cutting back on discretionary spending, so U.S. firms of luxury goods will probably find a market that is not as good now as prior to the natural disasters,'' said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group.
A main theme during the current quarter has been how companies recovered from cuts or delays in supplies because of the disaster. Many of them avoided serious disruptions because of a diversified network of suppliers.
Ford, for example, said this week that parts shortages cut output at some plants, but it did not expect profitability to be diminished. ''We're pretty diversified throughout our supply base around the world,'' Alan R. Mulally, the chief executive, said in a conference call with analysts.
Some of Boeing's suppliers encountered transportation problems because of the earthquake, but were still able to meet delivery schedules, W. James McNerney, the chief executive, told analysts Wednesday. He said the problems in Japan had not hurt Boeing's operations significantly.
DuPont said it tapped alternative sources on its supply network when its Utsunomiya polymer plant was damaged.
Still, there is much uncertainty about the future. For example, Tiffany & Company reported in late March that for its first quarter, which started in February, sales in Japan would decline 15 percent and earnings per share would be reduced by 5 cents.
''We cannot provide meaningful forecasts about sales in Japan beyond the first quarter and, therefore, have not adjusted our sales or earnings plan for the remaining quarters of 2011,'' said Michael J. Kowalski, the chief executive.
AutoNation Inc., the auto retailer based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said this week that first-quarter profit climbed 26 percent, but it lowered its sales forecast for the entire year because of Japan-related supply constraints.
But other companies said there could be a recovery in the later part of the year.
John P. Surma, the chairman of United States Steel, this week forecast a recovery after some of its customers reduced production because of parts shortages. ''We expect reductions in automotive production during the quarter to be made up in 2011 as vehicle inventories, presently low compared to historical levels, will need to be replenished,'' he said in a statement.

HEADLINE: County Was Struggling Even Before the Storm

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and ROBBIE BROWN; Michael Cooper reported from New York, and Robbie Brown from Pleasant Grove, Ala.

 BODY:
There are few places in America with more precarious finances than Jefferson County, Ala., the scene of some of the worst devastation from this week's deadly tornadoes.
Even before the dark funnel clouds touched down, the heavily indebted county, which includes the city of Birmingham, was teetering on the edge of what could be the biggest municipal bankruptcy in American history. It is drowning under $3.2 billion in debt, the legacy of a giant sewer project and corrupt, risky bond deals that sent a former top official to prison. And it recently lost one of its main sources of revenue when the State Supreme Court struck down its tax on workers. County officials are worried that they could run out of money in late July or early August.
Now the strained county must struggle to perform a central role of government: protecting the lives and safety of its residents. So as county search and rescue workers sought the living and the dead, triage centers treated the injured and work crews struggled to clear the debris, the Jefferson County Commission met Thursday to make sure that some of the money-saving measures it had instituted would not impede the response to the disaster. 
''The needs of the citizens will come first,'' said Commissioner James A. Stephens, who oversees the county's finances and whose district saw some of the worst destruction. ''If we have to burn through this cash we're attempting to preserve, in order to get us through this disaster, the County Commission most certainly will do so.''
People in Jefferson County have spoken about the sky falling, in a figurative sense, long before the clouds lowered this week and swirling winds leveled whole neighborhoods. For many residents, the tornadoes seemed like the latest in a long litany of woes.
''This is not a county that needed this,'' said Lexis Bennett, 36, a paramedic who lives in Pleasant Grove, a Birmingham suburb among the hardest-hit places.
His house was destroyed. His dogs were killed. He barely survived by huddling in a closet with three other people and then crawling out of the rubble.
Asked about Jefferson County's troubles, he shook his head and laughed. ''Money?'' he asked. ''They ain't got none. And now this tornado.''
County officials expect the federal government to cover much of the cost of the disaster, said Mark Kelly, a spokesman for the county's Emergency Management Agency. He said the county's response had not been constrained by its fiscal woes.
But a natural disaster was the last thing the county wanted to face as it sought to untangle itself from a series of man-made ones.
The county's trouble began more than a decade ago. Its sewers were discharging raw sewage into local rivers during heavy rains, and a federal court ordered the county to refurbish the system. The county began borrowing money to pay for the upgrade. Then things went badly awry.
Local officials signed off on risky, and ultimately very expensive, exotic bond deals that they barely understood -- some after they had been bribed.
Larry P. Langford, the former president of the county commission, was sentenced last year to 15 years in prison after he was found guilty of accepting more than $230,000 in cash, expensive clothing and jewelry in exchange for steering millions of dollars in bond business to a prominent investment banker. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in 2009 charging that J. P. Morgan Securities had made unlawful payments to friends of the county commissioners to help it win bond business; J. P. Morgan settled the suit, agreeing to drop its claims for $647 million in fees it had been seeking, and to pay a $25 million penalty to the commission and $50 million to the county.
Those exotic deals backfired when the economy collapsed, and they sharply drove up the county's costs instead of reducing them. The county defaulted on its bond payments; a court-appointed receiver is preparing a plan to help pay down the debt.
The Alabama Supreme Court dealt the county another blow in March, when it upheld a ruling striking down the county's occupational tax -- basically an income tax on people who work in the county -- on the grounds that it was not properly advertised before the Legislature approved it in 2009. The tax netted the county $74 million a year, but the new Legislature -- which, after November's elections, is now in Republican hands -- has been reluctant to approve a new tax.
The new sewer system suffered minor damage in the tornado, said John Young, the receiver who oversees it. But he said it should be quickly repaired.

HEADLINE: At Home With Artifacts in Their Natural Habitats

BYLINE: By EVE M. KAHN

 BODY:
Michael Gotkin, a historian and landscape architect, keeps tabs on doomed arrays of furniture, artwork and knickknacks. He tracks the homes of aging artists: the custom built-ins designed by their prominent friends, the shelves packed with inspiring artifacts ranging from fertility goddess statues to fishing lures.
He mourns when the creators or their heirs destroy the environments. He and the photographer Don Freeman have paid homage to 13 reasonably or meticulously well-preserved places in a new book, ''Artists' Handmade Houses'' (Abrams).
''This really is the final documentation,'' Mr. Gotkin said during a recent interview at a cafe near his Manhattan apartment. He was leafing through his chapter about Eliphante, a 1980s concrete cave in the Arizona desert that a married couple, the artists Michael Kahn and Leda Livant, studded with seashells and broken glass. Ms. Livant, now a widow in her 80s, moved to Santa Fe, N.M., soon after Mr. Gotkin and Mr. Freeman spent a few days clambering around the house's crannies.
''This is a built-in; it's still there,'' Mr. Gotkin said, pausing at an image of a kitchen counter made from a burst of redwood slabs. A foundation now allows occasional tours of the property, but Ms. Livant's paintings and gossamer fabrics have been removed. 
The book's case studies date back to Olana, the landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church's 1870s estate perched on a Hudson riverbank and lined in Persian stenciling. During the photography session at Olana, the museum staff used white gloves to handle anything that needed to be moved. But at the painter Ruth Hatch's 1960s weathered cottage nestled in beach scrub on Cape Cod, Mr. Gotkin said, ''As we finished one room, the family took everything out and took it down to the Wellfleet thrift store'' or into storage.
The building, on National Park Service land, has been leased to a preservation group but is vacant and deteriorating.
Mr. Gotkin originally had a dozen more properties on his shortlist for the book, including the homes of Donald Judd and Georgia O'Keeffe, but they fell through for various reasons. He had hoped that the ceramist Toshiko Takaezu, who died in March, at 88, would let him document her home and workshop in rural central New Jersey. She firmly refused the distraction. ''She wanted to work till she couldn't work anymore,'' Mr. Gotkin said. Her house's contents have been dispersed.
As he combs the Internet or takes drives these days, he keeps checking up on artists' houses. Renovations are in progress at the abstract sculptor Costantino Nivola's farmhouse in East Hampton, N.Y., but most of the sculptures have been donated to a museum in his native Sardinia. When photographing the Nivola site about two years ago, Mr. Gotkin stopped at the landscape painter Thomas Moran's 1880s house nearby. ''It was a wreck, with the ceiling caving in, bushes growing through the floor and animals living there,'' he said. ''I was horrified.'' (A foundation has been raising money to shore it up.)
Bad news keeps coming in his niche field, in discouraging economic times for anyone planning to open new house museums. When reminded that an auction last fall scattered much of the contents of the graphic artist and muralist Ben Shahn's 1930s modernist home near Princeton, N.J., Mr. Gotkin replied, ''Don't get me started.''
AMERICANA ILLUMINATED
The saleroom lights are likely to have to be dimmed during three days of auctions in Ohio next week, so the auctioneer will not be blinded by the lots: about 500 neon clocks, from the collection of the clock repairman Wayne Woodrum.
For previews starting Thursday, Rich Penn Auctions will hang the timepieces on pegboards around an expo center near Dayton. The clocks, mainly made between the 1930s and '50s, advertise now-obscure products with slogans like ''White Oak Smokeless Coal, the Suns Only Rival'' and ''Red Goose Shoes, They're Half the Fun of Having Feet.''
Mr. Woodrum has been fixing, collecting and selling clocks for four decades, trolling flea markets with his wife and two children. ''And sometimes we'd even take the dog,'' he said during a recent phone interview. As the proprietor of Wayne's Neon Clocks in New Carlisle, Ohio, he received phone calls from owners of decrepit commercial strips who had just made discoveries on their roofs.
The callers, he said, would announce: ''There's an old clock laying up here. If you want it, come and get the thing.''
He has also studied the history of neon-clock manufacturers. They would offer unconditional guarantees for repairs and replace a clock that had been stolen. ''Interstate highways put them out of business,'' he said; the neon slogans were no longer legible from the road.
Every time he thinks he has encountered all of the clock models in existence, he said, ''As soon as I go 'round the corner, there'll be something I run across, something I've never heard of before, just sitting on someone's table as if it were as common as a pair of shoes.''
The clocks are mostly expected to bring a few thousand dollars each. Values are higher for faces with spinning wheels, and hands and numerals that light up. Multiple layers of concave glass can also increase prices, in certain regions. ''A lot of folks in the Carolinas,'' he said, ''just went nuts over double-bubbles.''
PLEASE PASS THE WOODCUTS
Renaissance aristocrats and monks felt little of modern-day collectors' reverence for engravings and woodcuts as frameable art for the walls. They routinely cut up works on paper to glue onto album pages and storage containers and would sometimes eat bits of religious prints during church and shrine rituals.
The Art Institute of Chicago is displaying slight and major desecrations in ''Altered and Adorned: Using Renaissance Prints in Daily Life,'' which opens on Saturday.
A Nativity woodcut is tucked into the lid of a 15th-century wooden reliquary box, possibly used by traveling priests. Fabric and foil bits are attached to an 18th-century Madonna woodcut. In a 1490s history book, the margins between portraits of saints bear the rusty outlines of a pair of scissors that may have served as a bookmark.
In a 1790s scrapbook, a Bavarian priest glued down cutouts of biblical scenes and saint portraits. ''The taste for this type of picture was once almost universal among the Catholics,'' the priest wrote in an essay on the opening page. In his own era, he added, ''nobody believes them worth saving.''
He ensured their survival in the goatskin album. ''I believe someone will thank me for this someday,'' he wrote.

HEADLINE: Huntington Theater in Boston Receives $10 Million Gift

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
A decades-long relationship between Boston's Huntington Theater Company and Stanford and Norma Jean Calderwood has yielded a $10 million gift to the endowment of the theater, its leaders announced on Thursday. The gift from the Calderwood Charitable Foundation, by far the largest in the theater's 29-year history, doubles the size of the Huntington's endowment. 
The financial boost comes as private support for the nation's major regional theaters is decidedly mixed. Arena Stage in Washington has undertaken more ambitious programming after a $135 million expansion financed by private and public dollars, including a $35 million private gift, while the Intiman Theater in Seattle announced this month that it was canceling the rest of its 2011 season and laying off its staff because of weak revenue projections after a period of significant cost overruns.
The Huntington, which produces a mix of classic works and new American plays, has for years been a major beneficiary of its well-nurtured ties to the Calderwoods, who became subscribers in the 1980s. Mr. Calderwood was a former Polaroid executive who became a leading money manager in Boston; he was also actively involved in arts and media organizations and was perhaps best known for brokering the deal that brought ''Masterpiece Theater'' to public television in the United States in 1971. He died in 2002, and his wife died four years later.
Michael Maso, the Huntington's managing director since the theater was founded in 1982, said in an interview on Thursday that the board of trustees and the staff would spend the next 12 months considering ways to use the gift to draw financial support from others. New construction was less of an immediate priority for the Huntington, Mr. Maso said; further enriching and expanding its theater offerings and making tickets more affordable for potential theatergoers was more important. The theater's endowment is now approximately $20 million; the Huntington's annual operating budget is $13 million, rebounding from about a 10 percent cut during the recession.
''Chiefly, though, this incredible gift provides us with support for everything we do, as well as stability,'' Mr. Maso said. Referring to the Huntington's artistic director, Peter DuBois, Mr. Maso added: ''As Peter says, 'stability is sexy.'''
Financial support from the Calderwood Charitable Foundation led to a meaningful expansion of theater in Boston during the last decade. The foundation's gift of $4 million to the Huntington's first capital campaign, which raised a total of $24 million by 2006, helped create the Huntington's Stanford Calderwood Pavilion in Boston's South End in 2004. The pavilion includes a 370-seat proscenium theater and a 200-seat black box theater, as well as two sizable rehearsal rooms that are frequently in use by Boston theater troupes as well as Huntington artists.
The pavilion helped make the South End even more of a cultural destination in the city, and marked a significant expansion of programming for the Huntington, which has long operated out of the 890-seat Boston University Theater, a few miles to the west of the Calderwood Pavilion.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Pledge on Taxes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In your April 22 editorial ''Rethinking Their Pledge,'' you suggest that ''a few Republicans'' have changed their minds and now wish to raise taxes on Americans even though they signed the Taxpayer Protection Pledge. 
All but four Republicans in the House voted for the budget proposal of Representative Paul D. Ryan, which has no tax increase and cuts $6 trillion in the coming decade from President Obama's overspending.
Across the nation, governors who have signed the pledge are holding firm and reforming government to reduce spending. And Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, whom you cite, has signed in writing a pledge to the voters of Oklahoma -- not to me or Americans for Tax Reform -- that he will oppose any net tax increase.
On Feb. 17 he and the other two Republicans in the Gang of Six wrote an open letter to me reiterating that they would support ''a proposal where any increase in revenue generation will be the result of the pro-growth effects of lower individual and corporate tax rates for all Americans.'' That is pledge-compliant and good policy.
Every single Republican senator has endorsed a balanced budget amendment that would require a two-thirds vote for higher taxes and limiting federal spending to 18 percent of gross domestic product.
Where do you see a left-wing pro-tax-increase revolt in the G.O.P. caucus?

HEADLINE: The Intimidated Fed

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Last month more than 14 million Americans were unemployed by the official definition -- that is, seeking work but unable to find it. Millions more were stuck in part-time work because they couldn't find full-time jobs. And we're not talking about temporary hardship. Long-term unemployment, once rare in this country, has become all too normal: More than four million Americans have been out of work for a year or more.
Given this dismal picture, you might have expected unemployment, and what to do about it, to have been a major focus of Wednesday's press conference with Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. And it should have been. But it wasn't. 
After the conference, Reuters put together a ''word cloud'' of Mr. Bernanke's remarks, a visual representation of the frequency with which he used various words. The cloud is dominated by the word ''inflation.'' ''Unemployment,'' in much smaller type, is tucked in the background.
This misplaced emphasis wasn't entirely Mr. Bernanke's fault, since he was responding to questions -- and those questions focused much more on inflation than on unemployment. But that focus was, in itself, a symptom of the extent to which Washington has lost interest in the plight of the unemployed. And the Bernanke Fed, which should be taking a firm stand against these skewed priorities, is instead letting itself be bullied into following the herd.
Some background: The Fed normally takes primary responsibility for short-term economic management, using its influence over interest rates to cool the economy when it's running too hot, which raises the threat of inflation, and to heat it up when it's running too cold, leading to high unemployment. And the Fed has more or less explicitly indicated what it considers a Goldilocks outcome, neither too hot nor too cold: inflation at 2 percent or a bit lower, unemployment at 5 percent or a bit higher.
But Goldilocks has left the building, and shows no sign of returning soon. The Fed's latest forecasts, unveiled at that press conference, show low inflation and high unemployment for the foreseeable future.
True, the Fed expects inflation this year to run a bit above target, but Mr. Bernanke declared (and I agree) that we're looking at a temporary bulge from higher raw material prices; measures of underlying inflation remain well below target, and the forecast sees inflation falling sharply next year and remaining low at least through 2013.
Meanwhile, as I've already pointed out, unemployment -- although down from its 2009 peak -- remains devastatingly high. And the Fed expects only slow improvement, with unemployment at the end of 2013 expected to still be around 7 percent.
It all adds up to a clear case for more action. Yet Mr. Bernanke indicated that he has done all he's likely to do. Why?
He could have argued that he lacks the ability to do more, that he and his colleagues no longer have much traction over the economy. But he didn't. On the contrary, he argued that the Fed's recent policy of buying long-term bonds, generally referred to as ''quantitative easing,'' has been effective. So why not do more?
Mr. Bernanke's answer was deeply disheartening. He declared that further expansion might lead to higher inflation.
What you need to bear in mind here is that the Fed's own forecasts say that inflation will be below target over the next few years, so that some rise in inflation would actually be a good thing, not a reason to avoid tackling unemployment. Those forecasts could, of course, be wrong, but they could be too high as well as too low.
The only way to make sense of Mr. Bernanke's aversion to further action is to say that he's deathly afraid of overshooting the inflation target, while being far less worried about undershooting -- even though doing too little means condemning millions of Americans to the nightmare of long-term unemployment.
What's going on here? My interpretation is that Mr. Bernanke is allowing himself to be bullied by the inflationistas: the people who keep seeing runaway inflation just around the corner and are undeterred by the fact that they keep on being wrong.
Lately the inflationistas have seized on rising oil prices as evidence in their favor, even though -- as Mr. Bernanke himself pointed out -- these prices have nothing to do with Fed policy. The way oil prices are coloring the discussion led the economist Tim Duy to suggest, sarcastically, that basic Fed policy is now to do nothing about unemployment ''because some people in the Middle East are seeking democracy.''
But I'd put it differently. I'd say that the Fed's policy is to do nothing about unemployment because Ron Paul is now the chairman of the House subcommittee on monetary policy.
So much for the Fed's independence. And so much for the future of America's increasingly desperate jobless.

HEADLINE: A Big Question For Berkshire

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and ROBERT COLE

 BODY:
Warren E. Buffett has many unpleasant questions to address at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday. The stock dealings of David L. Sokol, a former heir apparent, have raised concerns over the company's internal controls -- even about Mr. Buffett's judgment. But one subject may be a step too far for the Buffett faithful congregating in Omaha: isn't it time to break up the company?
To Mr. Buffett's acolytes, the idea of splintering Berkshire into pieces borders on heresy. But the furor over Mr. Sokol's share trading, resignation and lack of remorse for his behavior has highlighted the difficulty of grooming a successor capable of steering the $200 billion behemoth into a brighter tomorrow. Moreover, a breakup may even be more lucrative for shareholders. 
Berkshire's share price is suffering. Over the last six months, the stock has gained 4 percent, significantly underperforming the 15 percent rise in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. As a result, the discount at which Berkshire shares trade relative to the stand-alone value of its assets has widened to a point where breaking up can't be ruled out.
A calculation by Barclays Capital a year ago valued Berkshire's holdings at around $87 per Class B share. At the time, that meant the stock was trading 13 percent below the sum of its parts a year ago. Apply the S.& P.'s gain since then to Barclays' estimate, and the stock could be worth around $99. Trouble is, as a result of Berkshire's performance that means the theoretical discount has increased to nearly 20 percent.
Though a back-of-the-envelope calculation, it does suggest dismantling the group into manageable parts is a reasonable alternative, and worthy of the Berkshire's board's consideration. The board's report on the Sokol matter this week exhibited an uncharacteristic willingness to challenge the chairman's judgment. Why not extend this independence to revisiting the group's structure?
Berkshire's stellar returns for most of the last half-century reflected its founder's instincts, impeccable reputation and eye for value. The Sokol affair suggests these can no longer be counted on, nor easily replicated. Yet without these features, Berkshire is just another conglomerate whose shares trade at a discount to their true value. That would be a sad legacy for Mr. Buffett to leave.
Royalty's Worth
Britain's royal family is an affordable indulgence. If taxpayers stopped financing the clan destined to be led by William Windsor and Catherine Middleton, they would escape a $:1.14 billion (or $1.9 billion) liability. For some, this is a burden the financially hurting nation could do without. In fact, it's a national treasure.
True, the royal wedding will lead to some large one-time costs. There's the extra public holiday. Assuming Britain's economy is evenly spread across the 260 working days of a normal year, that's $:5.9 billion in lost output. The direct cost of the celebration may add another $:50 million.
Both these figures look too high, however. Some of the costs are sunk. Others are shared. Much of the lost gross domestic product will be recovered. The financial focus should instead be on the continuing overhead the monarchy creates.
The latest report of the Royal Trustees shows that the queen and her entourage were awarded $:39.9 million in the year ended March 2011. This figure has been quite stable, rising by just 1.6 percent a year over the last decade.
Assume these payments, ignoring inflation, stretch into perpetuity, apply a discount equivalent to the yield on 10-year British government bonds, and the present value of this liability is $:1.14 billion -- or less than $:19 for every British subject.
With national debt at $:1.1 trillion and all manner of public services now being squeezed, cutting off the royals would represent a symbolic saving. But the economy would miss the tourism and other income generated from brand Windsor. Besides, another head of state would still cost money. Even elected ones don't come free with afternoon tea.
Britain's royal family is an anachronism that wouldn't be invented if it didn't exist. But for the global entertainment value alone -- regardless of whether the Windsors appreciate that people are laughing at them as well as with them -- the monarchy earns its place in the national portfolio. Pageantry as represented in apogee by this royal wedding should be preserved, paid for from a controlled budget, and enjoyed.

HEADLINE: Despite Bipartisan Support, Nuclear Reactor Projects Falter

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In an effort to encourage nuclear power, Congress voted in 2005 to authorize $17.5 billion in loan guarantees for new reactors. Now, six years later, with the industry stalled by poor market conditions and the Fukushima disaster, nearly half of the fund remains unclaimed. And yet Congress, at the request of the Obama administration, is preparing to add $36 billion in nuclear loan guarantees to next year's budget.
Even supporters of the technology doubt that new projects will surface any time soon to replace those that have been all but abandoned.
''My gut feeling is that there is going to be a delay,'' said Neil Wilmshurst, a vice president of the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium based in Palo Alto, Calif. News on Thursday that Exelon Corporation, the nation's largest reactor operator, planned to buy a rival, the Constellation Energy Group, only reinforces the trend; until late last year, Constellation wanted to build, while Exelon was firmly against it. 
Mr. Wilmshurst said the continued depressed price of natural gas had clouded the economics of new reactors, and he predicted that construction activity would ''go quiet'' for two to five years. His group has shifted its efforts to helping figure out how existing plants can extend their licenses to 80 years from the current limit of 60.
Of the four nuclear reactor construction projects that the Energy Department identified in 2009 as the most deserving for the loans, two have lost major partners and seem unlikely to recover soon. In addition to low prices for natural gas, the demand for electricity is down, and the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that damaged the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant could bring new rules.
Only $8.8 billion of the 2005 guarantee has been allocated -- to a twin reactor project in Georgia. Ground has been broken on the fourth candidate, a twin reactor project in South Carolina, but its sponsors may get a better deal in the commercial finance market.
The initial $17.5 billion was approved during the Bush administration, but President Obama has also embraced the idea of marrying nuclear power to solar, wind and ''clean coal'' to reach his administration's goal of generating 80 percent of American electricity from those sources by 2035. Mr. Obama's call for new loan guarantees came when the administration was seeking Republican votes in the Senate for a limit on carbon dioxide emissions, but he has stuck with the loan guarantees even after prospects for such legislation died after last fall's midterm elections.
The Republicans, who won control of the House, have portrayed such regulatory legislation as an energy tax. A White House spokesman, Clark Stevens, said that in the president's view, nuclear power would continue to be an important part of the ''clean energy economy'' he was seeking.
The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said on Wednesday that he favored more nuclear reactors and that loan guarantees were the only way to get them.
The idea was approved by the Republican Congress in 2005. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, now the ranking Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has praised the Energy Department for issuing the first nuclear loan guarantee, for the Alvin W. Vogtle plant expansion, in Georgia. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, supports loan guarantees as a step to build 100 new nuclear reactors.
One reason for all the financial support may be the way Congress does its accounting. The guarantees cost little or nothing to approve. ''It's not real money,'' Mr. Wilmshurst said.
A federal loan guarantee is a little like a parent co-signing a child's car loan; if the child makes the payments, the parent pays nothing. Under the 2005 law, borrowers pay a lump sum to the government to compensate the Treasury for the risk it is undertaking, and if the companies finish the projects and can pay back the loans, the government makes a profit.
The precise shape of new loan guarantees is uncertain, but when ''scoring'' the provisions for the purpose of calculating their expense, the White House says they cost nothing, and Congress assumes they cost 1 percent of the face value. But they are not without risk.
If the builders default, as happened on some nuclear construction projects in the 1980s, the taxpayer liabilities could run into the billions of dollars.
Officials at the Energy Department, which administers the loans, said they were confident that other developers would come forward and apply for the guarantees. Jonathan M. Silver, the executive director of the loan programs office, said, ''There is a significant queue of nuclear power plants in house that we will and are working on.''
''They may just go forward under a different time frame,'' he said, but he declined to estimate how many years it would be before the government could reach its goal of providing loan guarantees to six to eight reactor projects.
Mr. Silver said that by the time a reactor could be finished and brought on line, market factors might be more in the industry's favor. ''There are so many variables in this equation, taking a snapshot may be less relevant than watching the whole movie,'' he said.
Duke Power, for example, has been seeking to build a twin reactor in South Carolina that would also serve North Carolina. Company executives said that to move forward, it would need approval to charge customers for some construction expenses before the plant is completed. The company is still trying to line up additional partners, and has not made a final decision to build, a spokesman said.
Entergy Corporation, of New Orleans, has applied to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to build reactors in two locations, but has not reached the point of applying for loan guarantees. It will build ''in the event that we do decide that economics, load demand and other factors make new units favorable,'' the company said.
''There's not much else I'm aware of that's really actively moving forward right now,'' said Michael J. Wallace, a former Constellation executive who was the chief operating officer of its partnership with a French firm to build the Maryland project, the proposed Calvert Cliffs 3 reactor. With a carbon tax no longer appearing likely, he said a new kind of help, like a federal ''clean energy'' standard that would set a quota for nuclear and renewable electricity, might be needed.
Henry D. Sokolski, executive director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, said he opposed government assistance for new reactors. He said that because the loan guarantees covered only 80 percent of the construction cost, project sponsors had to come up with the remaining 20 percent.
''Since the most likely candidates to pony up the 20 percent bailed out,'' he said, ''it doesn't augur well.''

HEADLINE: New School Board Tackles Familiar Worries

BYLINE: By REBECCA VEVEA and CRYSTAL YEDNAK. 
rvevea@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
The final meeting for Mayor Richard M. Daley's Board of Education was marked by a tiny ripple of resistance among the ranks of a group that has largely marched in step since Mr. Daley took control of the city's public school system in 1995. 
Next month, a new school board appointed by Mayor-elect Rahm Emanuel will take over, the first complete overhaul since mayoral control began. The players may be switching, but a longtime observer is not convinced that the game will change.
''I really don't see much difference between the positions of Emanuel and Daley; I see very similar board members on both boards,'' said Donald Moore, executive director for Designs for Change, which advocates for increased community participation in school decisions. ''I think the only way you can get the board to listen is to pass legislation telling them what they must do, because otherwise they won't.''
The board meeting on Wednesday was consumed by the contentious issue of school closings, with dozens of people lining up to ask board members for leniency.
''As an outgoing board, don't let your legacy be putting politics and business over education,'' said Cynthia Lloyd, chairwoman of the Local School Council for Anderson Elementary School.
But the comments did not sway board members from voting to consolidate 12 schools, as requested by Terry Mazany, the interim schools chief executive.
The board has usually unanimously approved the resolutions put forward by the schools chief, but in this case, Peggy A. Davis, a board member, voted against the consolidations, which were lumped together in a roll-call vote.
The meeting concluded the work of one of the first boards of education in a major city to answer to a mayor. Two members, Norman R. Bobins and Tariq Butt, have sat on the board almost from the day that Mr. Daley took control of the school system.
Except for the outgoing president, Mary B. Richardson-Lowry, who took her seat a year ago, the remaining six members have served 5 to 12 years. The most notable board member during the Daley era was Michael Scott, a political intimate of the mayor who was appointed in 2001, served until 2006, was reappointed in February 2009 and served until his death later that year. Board members are not paid.
When Mr. Daley took charge, the public schools system had fallen into financial crisis, faced biennial teacher strikes, and in 1987 was called the worst school system in the country by then-Education Secretary William J. Bennett.
Since 1995, the system has seen several major initiatives, including the introduction of academic probation, charter schools, mandated summer school for students who fail state tests and a recent push for a ''culture of calm'' in response to neighborhood violence.
Now, the district faces many of the same challenges it did 20 years ago: low-performing schools, a 50 percent graduation rate and a multimillion-dollar budget deficit.
Mr. Emanuel has promised big changes. Earlier this month he appointed the new board members, as well as a new schools chief, Jean-Claude Brizard, who brings with him a reputation for reform and controversy.

HEADLINE: Central Bank of Japan Cuts Its Forecast for Economic Growth

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Bank of Japan slashed its economic growth forecast Thursday in the aftermath of the natural disasters that hit the country last month but refrained from announcing fresh steps to stimulate the economy -- a sign that the central bank expects rebuilding activity to lead to solid growth again later this year.
The bank said it now expected the Japanese economy, the world's third-largest, after those of the United States and China, to expand only 0.6 percent in the current business year, which ends March 31, 2012. That is down from the rate of 1.6 percent the bank had forecast in January. 
''As a result of the disaster, the economy will inevitably continue to face strong downward pressure for the time being,'' the bank said.
Corporate profits are likely to fall significantly, and private consumption and business investment will remain weak for some time, the bank added.
Bleak data published separately Thursday underlined the economic weakness created by the March 11 earthquake and tsunami and the nuclear crisis and supply chain disruptions that followed. Industrial output in March fell a record 15.3 percent from the previous month, according to the trade ministry.
''Today's data releases provide another powerful reminder of the devastating effect of Japan's recent disaster,'' Frederic Neumann, a regional economist at HSBC in Hong Kong, commented in a research note. ''While data will look better from here on, the Bank of Japan will still need to announce additional monetary easing measures this quarter to abet the recovery.''
In a bid to calm a near panic in the financial markets immediately after the earthquake, the Bank of Japan flooded the markets with liquidity and expanded a program to purchase government and corporate bonds.
This month, the bank announced a loan program totaling <5>1 trillion, or $12.2 billion, to help financial institutions in the disaster area extend reconstruction-related loans.
On Thursday, the central bank left its key interest rate at zero to 0.1 percent, as had been widely expected, in a bid to help the recovery. But it announced no additional measures, saying it wanted to assess the effect of its previous steps before taking more action.
''The B.O.J. took the decisive step of increasing asset buying in March, and actual purchases have only just begun,'' Masaaki Shirakawa, the central bank governor, said, according to Reuters. ''It's important to examine the effects of the move for the time being.''
The bank also struck a positive note on the prospects for recovery later this year and raised its forecasts for growth during the financial year that starts in April 2012 to 2.9 percent, from an earlier forecast of 2 percent.
Like other forecasters, the bank expects the Japanese economy to rebound once rebuilding gets under way in earnest and power supplies and the flow of components and spare parts in the manufacturing sector get back to normal. Unlike the situation during the global financial crisis, economies elsewhere are growing, meaning that international demand for Japanese goods remains solid.
''From the beginning of autumn 2011, supply-side constraints are likely to ease,'' the central bank wrote. ''Moreover, efforts to restore capital stock damaged by the earthquake disaster are projected to gradually provide a boost to Japan's economy.''
Still, the government and the central bank will need to provide support to affected areas, and the Japanese economy as a whole, for months to come.
Hampered by an aging population, high government debt and intermittent deflation, the Japanese economy is unlikely to expand much more than 1 percent per year in the medium term, even as the effects of the March disasters wane, the ratings agency Standard & Poor's said Wednesday.
That makes Japan one of the slowest-growing developed countries in the world.
Japan is also a laggard within Asia, where developing nations like China and India are expanding at rates not far off 10 percent a year.

HEADLINE: Amid Scandal, Guessing Game Builds Over Buffett's Next Deal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Among the questions nagging at investors making the pilgrimage to Omaha this weekend to attend the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway will be this: Will the outcry over David L. Sokol affect Warren E. Buffett's deal machine?
Only two months ago, Berkshire appeared to be riding high. The conglomerate posted a 61 percent gain in annual profit for last year. Perhaps most notably, Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders that he was again on the hunt. 
''We're prepared,'' he wrote. ''Our elephant gun has been reloaded, and my trigger finger is itchy.''
In March, Mr. Buffett appeared to at least partly sate that itch when he agreed to buy the chemicals manufacturer Lubrizol for $9 billion in cash.
Yet that deal has now trapped Berkshire in controversy. Mr. Sokol, the chairman of MidAmerican Energy Holdings, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, resigned after disclosures that he had bought shares in Lubrizol shortly before recommending the company to Mr. Buffett as a takeover target. Initially hesitant, Mr. Buffett eventually agreed to the deal, the third-largest purchase in his career.
On Wednesday, the audit committee of Berkshire's board condemned Mr. Sokol's actions as violations of the company's insider stock-trading policy and hinted that the company might sue Mr. Sokol, a onetime star manager. The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking into Mr. Sokol's trades, people briefed on the matter have said previously.
It is unclear whether the Sokol affair will have lasting implications for Berkshire. Some Buffett-watchers say that the biggest damage may be to the investor's reputation.
''Buffett was on an unrealistically high pedestal to begin with,'' Alice Schroeder, the author of an authorized biography of Mr. Buffett, said. ''A lot of Berkshire's business advantage came from that mystique.''
But it is unlikely to deter Berkshire from its takeover safari.
''I don't think if there are any deals on the horizon that this is going to cause Buffett to pause in the least,'' said Michael Yoshikami, the chairman and chief executive of YCMNET Advisors, a Berkshire shareholder.
The fundamentals for why Berkshire must pursue even more acquisitions have not changed. The company generated $17.9 billion in cash from its operations last year, and currently has more than $38 billion to spend.
And its underlying businesses, apart from its commercial insurance operations, have rebounded well from the recession, said Meyer Shields, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus.
''I expect no changes and that we may see Berkshire do a $10 billion deal in the next 12 months,'' he said.
And despite the reputational damage done to the Buffett brand, the executive still exerts a magnetic charm and has a strongly performing business that many companies still want to join, Ms. Schroeder said.
Just what exactly Berkshire will buy next remains a parlor game among analysts and investors.
Mr. Buffett has hewed to a fairly rigid set of criteria for potential deal targets, including consistently high earnings, little debt and strong management teams in place.
Mr. Buffett has long regarded his big investments as crucial to continuing Berkshire's strong financial performance. He singled out his $26 billion purchase of Burlington Northern as a big contributor to Berkshire's bottom line. The deal appeared likely to raise Berkshire's earning power by nearly 40 percent before taxes, and the cash needed to strike the deal was quickly replenished.
''The economics of this transaction have turned out very well,'' he wrote in this year's investor letter.
While Mr. Buffett most recent shareholder letter sang the praises of the United States - he described the country as ripe with an abundance of opportunity - many observers say that his next trophy may well be abroad.
Mr. Yoshikami noted that many of Berkshire's recent big deals, including those for Lubrizol, Burlington Northern and the industrial conglomerate Marmon Holdings, had been largely for developed companies with high cash flow.
A logical next step may be in finding a high-growth but stable foreign company, as Berkshire did in 2008 when it acquired a 10 percent stake in the Chinese auto parts maker BYD, Mr. Yoshikami said.
That opportunity may lie in a growing economy like India, which Mr. Buffett visited last month.
''I've been dropping my phone number around as I cover the city,'' he told reporters then. ''I hope someone rings me Monday morning with good news.''

HEADLINE: For the Fed, A Narrowing Of Options

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The American economic revival stumbled in early 2011. Could that be more than the ''transitory'' phenomenon that Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called it at his news conference this week?
It makes sense to think the pause in growth will be temporary. Part of the first-quarter slowdown was caused by a weakness in the growth rate of exports that should not endure as developing economies continue to expand. There was also severe weather, which if anything should accelerate second-quarter growth with catch-up spending. And military spending declined.
With all those things, the economy grew at a 1.8 percent annual rate, according to the first estimate released by the government on Thursday.
To make the case for a rebound even stronger, the commentary from companies reporting first-quarter earnings has generally been upbeat. They are continuing to see sales rise, and profits are looking good. They are more awash in cash than ever, and many of them say they plan to hire more American workers. The recent surprise in unemployment numbers has been in how rapidly they fell. 
This week, even as the Fed was lowering its forecast for economic growth in 2011, it was also lowering its expectations for unemployment. It had no choice. Back in January the consensus among Fed officials was that the unemployment rate would be 8.8 to 9 percent in the final quarter of 2011. It has already fallen to 8.8 percent, and the new consensus, of 8.4 to 8.7 percent, could be far too pessimistic if companies mean what they say about hiring.
But there could be a sign of possible problems in, of all places, China.
China's steel prices, which had been rising rapidly, started to slide in mid-February. They bounced back for a week after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, but have slipped since then.
What does that mean? Maybe nothing. China's steel market is a wondrous combination of socialism and capitalism. Chinese steel is mostly sold through markets where prices can bounce wildly, and traders seek to profit from volatility. There are few good statistics on such basic things as inventories, making markets nervous about any change in direction. The producers are mostly government-owned companies, often managed by local governments more interested in jobs than profits. (Can you imagine such a thing in a developed economy?)
So Chinese steel statistics must be approached with caution.
One interpretation of the slipping prices is that the pre-tsunami decline was just market noise, and that the decline since then represents a correct analysis that Japan will be importing a lot less steel as manufacturing is interrupted by parts shortages. There is talk that the Japanese economy will shrink at a rate of 5 to 8 percent in the second quarter.
A steel analyst I have trusted for many years, Michelle Applebaum, the managing partner of Steel Market Intelligence, an equity research firm, cautioned me against leaping to conclusions, but added that if the decline in Chinese prices continued, ''then, of course, it would be indicative that their rate of growth is slowing.'' China, she said, is ''growing in a very steel-intensive way.''
That is a prospect that should make the world at least a little nervous. China grew at an annual rate of 9.7 percent in the first quarter, according to official statistics. Europe, meanwhile, seems determined to impose austerity and debt reduction at the same time the European Central Bank raises interest rates.
Think of China as the primary engine of world growth and Europe as a brake. The world may not grow much if that engine starts to stutter before the old primary engine -- the United States -- starts to rev up.
China's government keeps vowing to do something to slow its inflation, and has been trying to discourage credit growth and reduce the volume of new construction projects. In the West, there has been general disbelief that it could possibly succeed. After all, by tying the renminbi to the dollar, China has effectively turned over its monetary policy to Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues, whose dual mandate of promoting American growth and fighting American inflation says nothing about stopping China from overheating.
China's economy may well not be slowing. Perhaps the steel figures represent government efforts to hold down reported inflation by putting pressure on producers, a la President John F. Kennedy and United States Steel in 1962. But all good things come to an end, and someday China's growth rate will slow. By then, the world may no longer need the help. But it does now.
The Fed has been doing everything it can to stimulate the American economy, but has been rewarded for its efforts with denunciations. Liberals gripe that it is not doing enough to bring down unemployment. Conservatives complain that it is encouraging inflation by printing money. To hear some of them tell it, Mr. Bernanke is a member of the Obama administration who is destroying the currency to help the president win re-election.
That is not how you would expect conservatives to view a man who used to be chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under George W. Bush, but these days many Republicans view Mr. Bush as something of a heretic for raising government spending.
Monetary policy is clearly on hold now. Mr. Bernanke may or may not think it is a good idea to end the Fed's purchases of longer-term Treasuries -- the program known as QE2, for quantitative easing. But he had no choice, given the political realities.
The Fed is caught in a bind, with inflation rising and growth perhaps slowing. ''A surge in commodity prices unavoidably impairs performance with respect to both aspects of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate,'' Janet L. Yellin, the Fed's vice chairwoman, pointed out in her talk to the Economic Club of New York earlier this month. ''Such shocks push up unemployment and raise inflation. A policy easing might alleviate the effects on employment but would tend to exacerbate the inflationary effects; conversely, policy firming might mitigate the rise in inflation but would contribute to an even weaker economic recovery.''
For much of the last two years, growth in federal government spending helped. But now, that spending is falling. And state and local government spending, adjusted for inflation, is at its lowest level in nine years.
The American outlook would be much worse if there really was much chance of a rapid reduction in government spending, as the politicians say they want. With the recovery stumbling, tighter monetary and fiscal policy could be disastrous. But it is probable that there will be no deal and that after a new episode of ''The Perils of Pauline,'' the debt ceiling will be raised and a temporary deal worked out that makes no one happy.
The risk is that if things do get worse, perhaps because that fall in Chinese steel prices really does mean something, the government will be impotent. Stalemate could keep fiscal policy in neutral or worse, and political pressures could prevent any monetary easing until it is far too late to prevent a new downturn.
Let's hope that Mr. Bernanke is right to think both the slow growth rate of the first quarter and the rise in inflation are transitory phenomena.

HEADLINE: Relieved by Earnings, Investors Send Shares Up

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Shares rose, sending the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to the highest level since June 2008, as better-than-estimated corporate earnings tempered investors' concern over slowing economic growth.
Insurers led the gains as Allstate, Aflac and Lincoln National posted earnings that topped estimates. Sprint Nextel rallied 6.68 percent after it reported a narrower loss.
The Dow Jones industrial average rise 72.35 points, or 0.57 percent, to 12,763.31. The S.& P. 500 climbed 0.36 percent to 1,360.48. 
''Corporate America has managed to do very well in this environment of sluggish growth,'' said Randy Bateman, chief investment officer of Huntington Asset Management in Columbus, Ohio. ''Earnings are beating estimates. Companies are adding value to their shareholders. There are just not that many alternatives that can compete with corporate America at this point.''
The rise comes a day after stocks rallied on Wednesday as the Federal Reserve renewed its pledge to stimulate growth with low interest rates.
The S.& P. climbed to an almost three-year high on Wednesday, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks reached a record after the central bank renewed its pledge to keep interest rates near zero to stimulate the economy. The Federal Open Market Committee agreed to finish $600 billion of Treasury purchases in June.
Another round of buying is not needed to sustain the rally and there will not be an economic slump in the second half, predicted Mark Mobius, the executive chairman of Templeton Asset Management's emerging markets group.
''We are in a bull market and it will continue,'' Mr. Mobius said. ''There will be corrections along the way, but these will be very temporary. The consumer in Europe and America is back. They're not spending like crazy but they are spending.''
The S.& P. 500 insurance index rose 1.7 percent, the biggest gain within 24 groups, as 21 of its 22 stocks rallied.
Constellation Energy Group climbed 5.71 percent to $36.26. Exelon Corporation, the operator of nuclear power plants, agreed to buy the power producer for about $7.9 billion in stock, adding stakes in five reactors and becoming the largest electricity marketer in the United States.
Over all, there have been more than 8,000 deals announced globally this year, totaling $794.7 billion, a 26 percent increase from the $629.7 billion in the same period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Boeing gained 3.19 percent, the most in the Dow, to $78.55. Citigroup raised its share-price estimate for the world's largest aerospace company to $90, citing positive momentum over the next several years.
The home builder PulteGroup. gained 3.26 percent to $8.24. Pulte forecast profit in the second half of the year. The company focused on cutting costs in the face of weak demand for new homes. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter decreased 10 percent from a year earlier to $136 million. The rate of cancellations declined and visits to the company's sale centers increased, Richard J. Dugas, chairman and chief executive, said.
Energy shares had the biggest decline in the S.& P. 500, falling 0.2 percent as a group.
ConocoPhillips slumped 2.98 percent to $77.45. The company was cut to ''hold'' at Deutsche Bank, which cited disappointment with first-quarter earnings and said that the outperformance potential was limited.
Akamai Technologies Inc. tumbled 14.74 percent to $34.94. Traffic growth in the company's volume business has ''moderated,'' and it was ''too early'' to predict the pace of growth for the rest of the year, said its chief executive, Paul Sagan.
The Treasury's 10-year note fell 12/32, to 102 19/32. The yield fell to 3.31 percent, from 3.36 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: McDonnell Says a Governor Should Replace Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR and BEN WERSCHKUL


HIGHLIGHT: In a 25-minute interview in Virginia's Capitol building, Gov. Robert F. McDonnell said, "I do want to be part of the national debate." 

 BODY:
Robert F. McDonnell of Virginia, a Republican governor, said President Obama should be replaced next year with ... a Republican governor.
Not himself, he quickly adds, though he concedes that if he got the call to be someone's running mate he would be "honored and flattered and would certainly have to consider it." In a 25-minute interview with The Caucus in Virginia's Capitol building in Richmond on Friday, he said, "I do want to be part of the national debate."
Mr. McDonnell, who was elected in 2009, says Republican governors are best positioned to reverse Mr. Obama's economic policies, put the brakes on spending and confront the nation's long-term debt, which he calls the No. 1 threat to America.
"That is the enemy from within," he said during the interview.
In 15 months in office, Mr. McDonnell has earned a reputation beyond Virginia as a budget hawk, slashing state spending on health care and education. He has been overshadowed nationally by Republican governors in Wisconsin, New Jersey and elsewhere who have waged high-profile battles with public unions.
But Mr. McDonnell says his experience in Virginia has convinced him that the nation needs a president with executive experience, something he says Mr. Obama lacks.Bob Brown/Richmond Times-Dispatch, Via Associated PressGov. Robert F. McDonnell said President Obama had failed to promote "the free market system.""Coming into this job, he really never held an executive position, and it shows," the governor said of Mr. Obama. "I do know from the office that the buck stops at your desk. Unlike Congress, you can't form a committee. You can't have a study. You've got to make decisions."
Mr. McDonnell is cagey when it comes to picking his favorite among the likely Republican candidates for president.
He calls Gov. Mitch Danielof Indiana "an exceptional governor." He says Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, is "a world-class guy" with a "rock-star campaign team." Mr. McDonnell says Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, is the front-runner and has expertise "on the things people care about." And he says that Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House, is the "best idea guy in the history of the Congress."
But he is blunt about Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska. He says she has contributed to the national debate, but adds, "I don't think she's going to run."
Mr. McDonnell has recently praised Donald J. Trump, the real estate mogul and reality TV host, for his "straight talk." But he said he disagreed with Mr. Trump's decision to focus on Mr. Obama's birth certificate and educational qualifications, calling them "side issues."
"It's been resolved. The president's an American citizen," he said. "The problem is not where he was born. It's what he is doing in the White House."
Mr. McDonnell accuses Mr. Obama of failing to promote "the free enterprise system and balancing the budget and having a credible foreign policy to restore America's respect in the world."
While acknowledging his limited experience in foreign affairs and praising Mr. Obama's handling of the uprising in Egypt, Mr. McDonnell was critical of the president's actions in Libya, where a limited American intervention has given way to a NATO operation that is ongoing.
He said he disagreed with "our partial tip-toeing into the confrontations in Libya."
"We know we are the leader of the free world," he said. "NATO is not going to do anything unless America is leading the way. We had, to me, no clearly defined mission. We were in, out, in, out. You gotta be decisive."
But the Virginia governor got most animated when he was talking about the nation's fiscal challenges.
"What we have is decades of Republican and Democrats in Congress overpromising and overspending, and now the bills are due," he said. "We have an unsustainable and immoral national debt that's being foisted on our kids and our grand kids."
Republicans in Congress, he said, should stand firm in their demands for spending cuts and budget reforms before agreeing to an increase in the nation's debt limit.
"I'm going to express confidence that they are going to get that done," he said. "The doomsday scenarios are always out there, and that pressure makes people come to the table and negotiate."
He waved aside political concerns that embracing cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security might harm the fortunes of Republican candidates. In fact, he said, the budget passed by House Republicans did not go far enough or fast enough in cutting those and other programs.
"The question is not what's a winning political formula'" he said. "It's what's best for our country. Of course, when you reduce spending, there are various interest groups and various people that are not going to be happy in the short run. But I think you have got to make the case, and be honest and be straightforward."
The entire interview is available here.

HEADLINE: Does the Ryan Plan Curb Health Spending?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Many people seem unwilling to acknowledge that they ration themselves by what they decide to buy and not buy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
My post last week, on the budget plan offered by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin and chairman of the House Budget Committee, ended with the observation that the plan did not propose measures to control overall health spending in the United States, "nor does that appear to have been Mr. Ryan's objective."
To which one reader responded: 
I do completely reject that there are no cost controls in the Ryan budget. If there is no federal, state, insurance or private money to pay for extremely expensive care such as in Post No. 7 above, such care will simply not be delivered or paid for.
Let me, for all to see, acknowledge this well-taken point. If less money were available to be spent on health care, then overall health spending would be lower.
But let me also reproduce a comment from that Post No. 7: 
If cutting Medicare is so important, why not start now, rather than with today's 55-year-olds? Start by not paying for life-support treatments for critically ill very old people, as Medicare did for my 92-year-old father's PEG feeding tube three years ago. He got one, recovered enough to spend three more years in nursing homes and died last month after running up another $300K or so in medical bills paid by Medicare and his health insurance as a retired teacher.

Clearly, these comments land us smack in the middle of the treacherous terrain of cost-effectiveness analysis, end-of-life care and rationing of health care - all issues over which President Obama and his allies in Congress got into hot water during the health care debate of the last two years.
Among the harshest critics were Betsy McCaughey, the former lieutenant governor of New York, and Sarah Palin. Longtime readers of this blog may recall that I have explored all of these topics in a number of earlier posts, for example in a piece on rationing; a poston cost-effectiveness analysis and one on pricing human life. 
The two readers I cite above advocate rationing of health care through the marketplace, by price and the patient's own ability to pay, rather than by government. Furthermore, at least one of them argues, with apparent approval, that the Ryan plan will force that result.
The general idea is that, using whatever financial resources are available to them, patients or their loved ones will, of necessity, engage in a benefit-cost analysis and decide whether the anticipated benefits of end-of-life care exceed its expected cost to the household in terms of what that household has to forgo to buy the extra care. This is how markets work.
Economic theory suggests that, other things being equal, rich and less rich households will come to different conclusions on this question. If less money is available over all to spend on elderly Americans, it is the lower middle class that is likely to do most of the self-rationing. 
Note that the Ryan plan proposes a means test to determine the federal contribution to Medicare - the very poor elderly will receive larger federal subsidies, although the size of these subsidies remain unspecified. But the middle and lower-middle class is likely to be on its own.
Another way of putting this issue is that patients and their loved ones will calculate the cost of end-of-life year per unit of medical outcome, measured by "quality-adjusted life years" (known as QALYs, pronounced KWAH-lee). That cost is, in effect, a price at which the household can purchase added QALYs from the health care sector.
Once that price is known, patients or those responsible for them can decide whether to buy the added QALYs yielded by end-of-life care at the available price. This forces patients or loved ones to compare the price with the monetary equivalent value of the benefits they anticipate from those QALYs. 
This is the private version of what is known as cost-utility analysis, the analytic approach that is anathema in the halls of Congress (see the section starting on Page 519).
For reasons that escape me, many Americans do not regard rationing scarce resources through the marketplace, by price and ability to pay, as rationing at all, reserving that term for government withholding of marginally beneficial procedures, based on formal cost-effectiveness analysis. 
I do beg to differ. In their well-known textbook "Microeconomics," Michael L. Katz of Harvard and Harvey S. Rosen of Princeton, put it thus: 
Prices ration scarce resources. If bread were free, a huge quantity of it would be demanded. Because the resources used to produce bread are scarce, the actual amount of bread has to be rationed among its potential users. Not everyone can have all the bread that they could possibly want. The bread must be rationed somehow; the price system accomplishes this in the following way: Everyone who is willing to pay the equilibrium price gets the good, and everyone who does not, does not.
That states the matter succinctly, although the authors could have been more precise by writing "willing and able to pay" rather than just "willing to pay." 
I have also applied the economist's reasoning to an analysis of styles of rationing in Canada and in the United States and would be happy to hear what readers make of that. 
Others commenting on last week's post have suggested that privatizing Medicare along the Ryan plan will not lead to rationing, because the private health insurance system can deliver the same quality care more efficiently and more cheaply. They cite the prescription drug plan under Medicare Part D as support for their position. I will take up that proposition in the future.

HEADLINE: A Name for a Contractor, a Wealth Manager, a Meatball Distributor, Perchance a Mall

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

 BODY:
It is a pivotal time for the roundly loathed, half-built, multibillion-dollar mall that sprawls across the New Jersey Meadowlands, with developers hoping that a rechristening, and an injection of $1 billion, will bring the project to life.
No longer will the white whale of a mall be known as Xanadu Meadowlands, which presumably took its first name from Coleridge's ''Kubla Khan,'' or the ancient city in Inner Mongolia, or the 1980 belly-flop of a film starring Olivia Newton-John. Now it is to be American Dream@Meadowlands, a name that arguably manages to be at once patriotic and nondescript. 
With its rechristening, the complex not only sheds what has become the Ishtar of mall names, but it also joins at least 107 New Jersey businesses named ''American Dream,'' or some variation of that, according to state corporate records. Indeed, the Garden State is teeming with American Dream companies of all stripes and may rightly claim some proprietorship of the term, which appears in the first line of the state's unofficial anthem, ''Born to Run.'' (The first line of the song ''Xanadu'' is ''A place where nobody dared to go.'')
New Jersey is home to American Dream custom cycle, limousine and food shops; several American Dream homebuilders and real estate outfits; and, coming full circle, at least one American Dream foreclosure specialist. There are American Dream travel agents, green card services and houseware shops, and a limited liability corporation called American Dreamz, which may or may not be named after the Hugh Grant movie from 2006.
Few of the state's American Dream proprietors said they felt threatened by sharing a name with the behemoth mall.
''I chose the name American Dream because I came to the U.S. from Portugal with one dream -- to get a better life,'' said Ivan Diogo, 28, a subcontractor who started his business, American Dream Mechanical Contractors, one year ago. The anemic economy forced Mr. Diogo to shutter a small storefront and send his two employees home, so his realization of the American dream, he said, is ''halfway true.''
Several American Dream proprietors said their choice of the name was defiantly optimistic.
Mark A. Faccone and a business partner used the name for their wealth management firm in affluent Brick after being told it was folly to strike out on their own. ''We both worked for another firm, and it seemed like we were both drones,'' Mr. Faccone said.
Vincent Brian Savarese, 53, joined other partners to open American Dream Realty in Carneys Point two months ago, after the real estate office he worked at with his father, Enzo, an Italian immigrant, closed because of a drop in business. ''Now more than any time that I can think of, home ownership is a tricky thing,'' Mr. Savarese said, ''but it's still the American dream.''
Not that the name American Dream guarantees success or necessarily brings with it joy. ''Oh great,'' deadpanned Paul Frank, 67, a home inspector from Clinton, after learning about the new name of the mall.
Mr. Frank, who owns the American Dream home inspection company, said he had at one time been barraged with phone calls because of a program for first-time home buyers called American Dream, and so he had to get rid of his 800 number.
While his business has suffered of late, with his home inspections going to 18 a year from 250, he has no plans to change its name. ''That's how people know me,'' Mr. Frank said.
One businessman who brightened at Xanadu's new name is John Wollerman, owner of the New American Dream Corporation in Lodi. It sells Tuscan olive oil, ravioli and meatballs made by Johnny DeCarlo, his son, to restaurants and supermarkets.
Mr. DeCarlo, the professed ''meatball king of New Jersey,'' also runs meatball carts and is hoping to open a meatball kiosk at the mall. Maybe a case of mistaken identity, Mr. Wollerman said, would help his son's venture along.
''If people are calling me thinking I'm the mall, great,'' Mr. Wollerman said. ''Everything opens up a door.''

HEADLINE: Landmarks Are Called a Hardship, Setting Off a Tenant-Landlord Fight

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER

 BODY:
A landmark has an aura of permanence about it. So it is a fair bet most New Yorkers believe that if their building has been declared a landmark, it will remain untouchable, like the Empire State Building or the Statue of Liberty.
But tenants at two six-story walk-ups on the Upper East Side are wondering whether landmark status may be more fragile and fleeting than they had thought. Those buildings along York Avenue in the East 60s, part of a complex of 15 walk-ups built between 1898 and 1915, were designated landmarks in 2006 because they were examples of a Progressive Era effort to improve tenement design for low-wage earners. The tan brick buildings offered snug apartments that overlooked courtyards and let in more air and light than a typical tenement's railroad flat.
But the landlord, the Stahl real estate organization, has applied to the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission for permission to tear the two buildings down. The landlord claims the buildings are losing $1 million a year and cannot return an adequate profit -- defined by the city's administrative code as 6 percent -- if they remain. Allowing construction of a high-rise building, one that would have panoramic views of the East River, would, Stahl says, eliminate that hardship. 
The commission is reviewing the landlord's application and has not scheduled a hearing. But, already, it has gotten a vigorous rebuttal. The tenants of the buildings, at 429 East 64th Street and 430 East 65th Street, most of them elderly or single people or couples on fixed or low incomes, are frightened. They say they can afford to remain on the Upper East Side only because their apartments are rent-controlled or rent-stabilized. The tenants include nurses, artists, a librarian, an exterminator and a firefighter.
''It's upsetting when you live in a place and you don't dare do anything because you don't know how long you're going to be here,'' said Janet Nonamaker, 67, a retired flight attendant who has lived in her building for 33 years but has been holding off on installing a new kitchen floor and doing other renovations because the building might be demolished.
Revoking landmark status is a rare step for the commission. Since it was created in 1965, the commission, which oversees 27,000 landmarks, has received 16 hardship applications, 15 of them requesting demolitions, and has granted 11 requests. It last approved such an application in 2008, allowing St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan to tear down its maritime-themed O'Toole Building to avert bankruptcy. The hospital went bankrupt before it could do so.
The two buildings on York Avenue were declared landmarks over the Stahl organization's objections. Among tenants leading the campaign to ''Stop Stahl'' is Monica McLaughlin, 52, an unemployed lawyer. She has collected and analyzed scores of real estate documents and has warned the commission of the wider impact of granting Stahl its request.
''In this city there would not be a landmarked building safe from the wrecking ball, and the L.P.C. may as well close up shop altogether,'' she wrote to the commission.
Ms. McLaughlin is a spirited daughter of a doorman; she grew up in rural upstate New York and completed college when she was 38 and law school a few years afterward, eventually working as an asbestos litigator before losing her job. She lives with two West Highland terriers, Missy Paulette and Casey Jane.
Ms. McLaughlin and her tenant allies have accused Stahl, owner of the building since 1977, of ''warehousing'' apartments, letting 107 of the 190 apartments lie vacant to ease the way for demolition. They have accused the landlord of padding operating expenses by including in its application $368,000 in legal fees for fighting landmark status and deliberately underestimating potential rents it could collect for all apartments to make a profit.
The application pegs the average rent at $600, when by the tenants' estimate the apartments can fetch several times that amount in their upscale neighborhood opposite Rockefeller University. They say Stahl is exaggerating the buildings' drawbacks by claiming they have inadequate electrical systems and narrow staircases.
They have also chronicled how the landlord, in an effort to stave off the landmark designation, removed many of the buildings' Beaux-Arts-style stone carvings and terra cotta trim and then plastered the exterior with a coral pink stucco that contrasts with the tan brick of the complex's other buildings. The commission eventually based its decision on the layout of the buildings more than on its original adornments.
''He messed the facade up and then said it's not landmarkable because of the facade,'' Ms. McLaughlin said.
Brian Maddox, a consultant to the Stahl organization, acknowledged that Stahl was leaving apartments empty in the hopes of demolishing the buildings or redeveloping the property. Mr. Maddox said the $600 rental estimate was made by real estate professionals and was based largely on the apartments' small size -- an average of 371 square feet. He said if the property was demolished, Stahl would find tenants comparable apartments in the complex's remaining 13 buildings. If not, the company might have to upgrade or combine vacant apartments in the rest of the complex in order to charge higher rents. He denied that legal fees were included in operating expenses.
The organization was founded by Stanley Stahl, who at the time of his death in 1999 was the sole stockholder of the Apple Bank for Savings and held four million square feet of office space and 3,000 apartments. He owned the Ansonia, a landmark apartment house on the Upper West Side, and other landmarks like TriBeCa's Western Union Building; the Chanin Building, on East 42d Street; and the Lunt-Fontanne Theater. Mr. Maddox said Stahl had treated such landmarks respectfully.
The buildings between York Avenue and First Avenue -- known originally as First Avenue Estate -- were put up by City and Suburban Homes Company, whose prominent investors agreed to limit their profit so blue-collar workers could have better housing than was available in tenements of the day; each apartment had a bathroom and each room a window.
The complex was first declared a landmark in 1990, but that year, the city's Board of Estimate -- not too long before going out of business as an elected body -- removed the two buildings on York Avenue from the designation. The rationale was that the board had removed the landmark status of two buildings in a similar-model tenement complex on East 79th Street whose owner wanted to build a luxury tower. But in 1992, the whole 79th Street complex was made a landmark, and tenants between 64th and 65th Streets fought to restore their buildings' landmark status as well, succeeding in 2006.
Tara Kelly, executive director of Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, argues that the entire complex has to be preserved to sustain its integrity.
''The complex is significant as a whole,'' Ms. Kelly said, ''and these two buildings are part of the whole.''

HEADLINE: China Allows Currency to Rise Further Against Dollar

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese currency hit a milestone Friday by rising beyond a level closely watched by analysts -- the strongest since Beijing began allowing the currency, the renminbi, to rise in 2005 and a sign that the authorities might be using the appreciation as a weapon against inflation. 
The dollar fell below 6.50 renminbi to about 6.491. That marks a 5 percent gain for the renminbi since last June, when it traded around 6.827.
The rise in the Chinese currency engineered by Beijing has gone in fits and starts. In 2005, the authorities allowed the renminbi to strengthen modestly after longstanding accusations by governments around the world that China was keeping its currency artificially weak to increase its exports. But in 2008, Beijing took a long pause, once again holding the renminbi steady to steer its giant economy through the global financial crisis. In June, the rise resumed.
The gains since then are small compared with the sharp upward moves staged by the currencies of many other emerging economies. Economic growth and interest rates well above those seen in developed economies have prompted large flows of cash into many emerging nations, pushing currencies like the Malaysian ringgit, the Mexican peso, the Brazilian real and the South African rand sharply higher since last year.
The renminbi's strength comes amid a backdrop of a generally weak dollar against a large number of currencies, as investors worry about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery.
The relatively small rise in the renminbi has not been enough to end occasionally vocal criticism by some U.S. policy makers and business executives, who continue to argue that the renminbi's valuation gives Chinese exporters an unfair advantage over their U.S. counterparts by making Chinese goods inexpensive overseas.
The move Friday past the eye-catching level of 6.50, and a climb of 0.9 percent during April, highlighted that the authorities in Beijing are serious about allowing the renminbi to strengthen -- albeit at a pace that is slow enough in their eyes not to damage the Chinese export sector.
At the same time, by making it cheaper for China to import oil, iron ore and other goods, a rise in the renminbi is one way of combating inflation, which has become an increasingly worrisome and politically sensitive problem in China.
''Clearly, policy makers are increasingly using currency appreciation to combat imported inflation,'' commented Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Credit Agricole in Hong Kong, wrote in a research note.
Most observers believe China will continue with a gradual appreciation rather than an all-out revaluation.
A revaluation would have meaningful disinflationary effect only if it were large enough to outweigh the sharp rises that global commodity prices have staged this year, Mr. Kowalczyk wrote. However, a gain of such magnitude ''would have a devastating impact on Chinese exports and employment, a side effect too negative to be acceptable for policy makers,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China Sales Help Profits At Daimler

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Daimler said Friday that it nearly doubled its profit in the first quarter as sales in China continued to show big gains and the market for heavy trucks recovered. 
The maker of Mercedes cars and Freightliner trucks, based in Stuttgart, said that net profit rose to 1.18 billion, or $1.75 billion, compared to 612 million in the first quarter of 2010. Sales rose 17 percent to 24.7 billion.
The figures were in line with expectations, but shares in the company fell 2 percent as investors registered disappointment that the company seemed to simply be benefiting from an improved global economy.
''I wouldn't say there is anything particular about their products or way of doing business that is the main reason for the improvement,'' said Sascha Heiden, an auto analyst at IHS Global Insight in Frankfurt. ''It's the natural mechanism of volumes bouncing back and purchasing power bouncing back.''
The first quarter result ''confirms our positive outlook for the year 2011,'' Daimler's chief executive Dieter Zetsche said. ''We are on the right track.''
Like rivals BMW and the Audi division of Volkswagen, Daimler's Mercedes car division is profiting from the appetite for luxury cars among Chinese buyers. Unit sales in China rose 82 percent to almost 50,000 vehicles, Daimler said.
Daimler also exemplifies the success of Germany's export economy, which has driven unemployment to a nearly 20-year low of 7.1 percent. Daimler said Friday that it had added almost 2,700 employees in Germany since the end of March 2010, bringing the total inside the country to 164,000.
Car sales also rose modestly in Mercedes' traditional markets, increasing 4 percent in both the United States and Europe.
The same factors helped sports car maker Porsche, also based in Stuttgart, to more double its operating profit in the first quarter to 496 million, as sales rose 10 percent to 2.3 billion, the company said Friday.
Porsche said profit of the holding company that owns its shares was 691 million in the first quarter, after a loss a year earlier. The result included earnings from the company's stake in Volkswagen, with which Porsche is in a complex merger process.
Daimler said that truck sales, which tend to closely track economic growth, rose 27 percent to 89,000 vehicles. Operating profit for the trucks division more than tripled to 415 million. Daimler's commercial vehicle brands include Freightliner in the United States and Mitsubishi Fuso in Japan.
Daimler said it would take charges of 78 million for damages and lost production due to the earthquake and tsunami in Japan and ''will remain watchful.'' It said the charges do not reflect insurance compensation the company might receive.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Anxious Eyes on a River As Flooding Threat Looms

BYLINE: By MALCOLM GAY and JOHN SCHWARTZ; Malcolm Gay reported from Charleston, and John Schwartz from New York.

 BODY:
CHARLESTON, Mo. -- Maj. Gen. Michael J. Walsh of the Army Corps of Engineers is likely to make a lot of people angry over the next few days.
But which group of people is not so clear. It will depend on whether he decides to flood farmland in Missouri in order to save a town in Illinois from the ravages of the rising Mississippi and Ohio Rivers.
If the general gives the word, his team will blow up a two-mile stretch of levee, sending torrents of water across more than 200 square miles of Missouri farmland to take pressure off the levees that protect Cairo, Ill., to the north. 
As tornadoes stormed across the Deep South this week, Missouri officials sued to block the corps from moving forward with the plan to swamp the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. Cairo has about 3,000 people; the 130,000 acres of farmland is home to about 200 residents in 90 homes. On Friday morning, Judge Stephen N. Limbaugh Jr. of Federal District Court in St. Louis ruled that the corps could go forward, if necessary.
General Walsh said he had sympathy for the farmers. ''Many of the people who have lived in the floodway, I've known them for two or three years,'' he said. ''I know what this is going to do, if we open the floodway.''
But, he added, ''when it comes down to a discussion of livelihood versus lives, the decision is a little easier to make.''
Col. Vernie Reichling, the corps commander of the Memphis District and General Walsh's eyes and ears for the northern portion of the Mississippi River and Tributaries project, said, ''We're listening to the river.''
''It's now an art -- based on science, but it's an art,'' Colonel Reichling said.
As the river rises to historic levels, General Walsh, who commands the Mississippi Valley Division of the corps, is consulting with dozens of engineers, meteorologists and other experts on a decision that is complicated by the way the river is riding perilously close to the informal trigger point of 61 feet.
''If it was 68, that would be an easy decision,'' he said. ''If it was 58, I wouldn't have to make the decision.''
If the river recedes rapidly, no action will be necessary. But if it stays near current levels, the risk to Cairo and other communities will remain high, and a decision not to act could leave residents of the economically depressed, largely African-American town feeling that they have been left to the vicissitudes of nature.
Cairo's defenses can hold up against the pressure for only so long, Colonel Reichling said on a drive through the town to inspect the flood defenses.
''These are temporary restraining structures,'' he said. ''They're not meant to permanently contain water.''
On Friday, the river stood at 59 feet, but it is expected to rise to a record 60.5 feet, still below the 61-foot mark, but some of the general's experts are saying it may stay at that level for six or seven days. That creates problems of its own, further weakening the earthen levees and saturating the soil beneath.
The restraining systems have never been under such extreme pressure, Colonel Reichling said.
If General Walsh does order the levee breached, two barges loaded with 265 tons of explosives will make a 30-mile journey upriver from their current mooring in Hickman, Ky.
They will arrive at the Birds Point levee, where the explosives will be loaded into three sets of pipe spanning 11,000 feet buried in the soil. After laying a detonating cord, the corps team will prime them with C-4 explosives before installing the blasting cap and pushing the button -- electronically, and from a safe distance. The operation will take 24 hours to complete.
The floodway is, in effect, a gigantic relief valve. The gap created by the controlled explosion on the west bank of the Mississippi would send water rushing at more than four million gallons per second into a basin bordered several miles to the west by a setback levee and encompassing some 200 square miles of farmland. The water would re-enter the Mississippi at the southern end of the basin by way of two openings that the corps will also blast. Using the floodway should reduce the height of the river above it by several feet.
General Walsh said this was not the most agonizing situation he had been in in his career in the corps. As the commander for the corps' Gulf Region Division in Baghdad, he recalled, he managed construction of buildings in the villages where ''we were always taking incoming fire'' and a children's hospital in Basra when ''thugs and criminals were in control of the city.''
''We lost a number of folks while we were building that facility,'' he said. Often, engineering decisions implicitly involve life-or-death decisions, based on safety tolerances and risk factors. ''Almost every decision has that kind of connotation to it,'' General Walsh said, but the Mississippi choice ''is certainly a little bit more immediate.''
Russ Davis, chief of the Operations Division, said of the floodway: ''Soldiers train to go to war, but hope they never have to. No one wants to do this.''
If General Walsh does order breaching of the levee, the result is likely to seem undramatic to those raised on action movies, said Paul N. Worsey, the director of explosives engineering education at the Missouri University of Science and Technology in Rolla.
''It's not like a nuclear weapon going off,'' Mr. Worsey said. ''It's going to look like a big a big burp, then there's going to be a big lake. It may end up, when it goes, being a very big anticlimax -- apart from all of the water rushing in.''
Even if the General Walsh does not act at Birds Point, the crisis will not be over: the massive bulge of water will move inexorably downstream, threatening points south.
''We won't be out of the woods,'' Colonel Reichling said. ''That water is going to move down to Louisiana, and we're going to have to fight it again.''

HEADLINE: Chevron Profit Rises as Unrest Lifts Oil Prices

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Chevron Corporation said Friday that its first-quarter profit rose 36 percent as economic growth and supply disruptions drove crude prices above $100 a barrel. 
Net income rose to $6.21 billion, or $3.09 a share, from $4.55 billion, or $2.27, a year earlier, Chevron said. Sales rose 25 percent, to $60.3 billion.
Global demand for petroleum-derived fuels rose 2.9 percent during the first quarter, led by growth in China, Brazil and India, according to the International Energy Agency. Oil futures traded in New York climbed 20 percent to average $94.60 a barrel, driven in part by the civil unrest in North Africa and the Middle East that has imperiled crude supplies.
Stock in Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, Calif., rose 63 cents, to $109.44 a share.
Profit from the company's oil and natural gas business increased 27 percent to $5.98 billion as higher commodity prices offset an output decline of less than 1 percent. Chevron said it pumped the equivalent of 2.76 million barrels of crude during the period, down from 2.78 million a year earlier.
Chevron's refineries earned $622 million, more than three times the profit of the first quarter of 2010.

HEADLINE: Not a Political Tool: The United States should lead in providing food aid to North Korea even if South Korea balks

 BODY:
The United Nations' World Food Program is warning that without more international help, six million people in North Korea -- one quarter of the population -- may be at serious risk of malnutrition or starvation. A harsh winter, severe flooding and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease have once again slashed domestic food production, and rising food prices have made imports more costly. 
As it stands now, that help is unlikely to arrive. The United States, traditionally one of the largest donors of food aid to North Korea, has decided to follow the lead of its ally South Korea and refuse any additional help. European donors also are hesitating.
American officials question whether the situation is that dire and say they need to do their own assessment. But it is unclear when or even if they will conduct one. If the United Nations' assessment is anywhere close to the truth, the consequences will be disastrous.
There are many reasons to despise the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, and his henchmen. They live in luxury while ordinary citizens barely subsist. The regime is barreling ahead with a nuclear weapons program and looking for any chance to sell weapons to other dangerous states. Last year 46 South Korean sailors died after the North sank a South Korean warship. Two soldiers and two civilians died when the North shelled a South Korean island.
We certainly understand Seoul's fury. But President Lee Myung-bak's vow that the North will not receive any more food aid until it apologizes will only guarantee more suffering for the North's people. We see no reason at all why President Obama would make the same mistake.
Pyongyang has an undeniable history of diverting some food aid to the military and the elite. But veteran aid workers say a monitoring system agreed to and put into effect by the United States and North Korea in 2008-9 would prevent significant diversion. The administration should insist that the system be part of any contribution.
To a great degree, food shortages are the direct result of the government's disastrous economic policies and there should certainly be frank talks with the North about the need for economic reforms.
Still, standing aside cannot be an option. A famine in the 1990s is believed to have killed nearly one million North Koreans. No matter how much the world despises the regime, that can't be allowed to happen again.

HEADLINE: Home, Sweet Investment

BYLINE: By CARL RICHARDS

 BODY:
Carl Richards is a certified financial planner in Park City, Utah. His sketches are archived here on the Bucks blog and on his personal Web site, BehaviorGap.com.
You often hear people in their 60s, 70s and even 80s say that the house they lived in for 30 years was the best investment they ever made. Given what we recently went through in the housing market that can be hard to believe. But they're probably right; it's just not for the reason you think. 
For the last 120 years, housing prices barely kept pace with inflation. The last 30 years haven't been any better, once you include the ugly numbers from the last five or six years. So how could an asset that barely kept pace with inflation be the best investment someone ever made?
Let's start with how we used to look at houses. After World War II, the United States saw a huge increase in home ownership. From 1940 to 1960 home ownership increased from 43 percent to 62 percent of Americans.
You know these people. For some of you, they were your parents, and for others, they were your grandparents. You went there for Thanksgiving and other holidays. These houses were homes, not investments. Nobody thought about what they were worth every day, month or even decade. You just lived there.
But no more. It's almost gotten to the point where I expect to see a quote for my home on Yahoo Finance every morning. The Web site Zillow has come pretty close to being able to provide that.
A few years ago, investing in real estate, including the house you lived in, became America's favorite spectator sport, with most of us either joining in or wishing we could. If you look again at the chart of home values over the years that I linked to above, it looks just as scary and volatile as the stock market.
But in the past no one knew they were supposed to be scared while they lived in their house. The only time you cared about the real estate market, such as it was, was when you needed to move.
So part of the reason people who lived in the same house for 30 years claim their home was their best investment comes from it probably being the only investment they actually held for 30 years. The power of compound interest, even if the return is just over inflation, is amazing, but only if you actually let it compound.
For comparison, look at stock mutual funds, which are meant to be held for a long time but often are not. According to the research firm Dalbar, the average investor holds on to their mutual fund for just over three years.
Three years versus 30 years may go a long way to explaining why people may say that their home has been their best investment. It's not because real estate has delivered a fantastic return; it's simply because of the decision they made to sit tight in that four-bedroom asset.
So in the end this consideration of the best investment isn't about the relative merits of real estate. It's about behavior. The question to ask yourself, then, is this: 30 years from now, what will be your best investment?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Must Return $271 Million Spent on Hudson Tunnel, U.S. Insists

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The next stop for New Jersey in its debt collection fight with the federal government may be federal court.
On Friday, the Transportation Department flatly rejected the state's arguments for refusing to repay $271 million that was spent on a project, canceled last year, to build a pair of rail tunnels under the Hudson River. The message to Gov. Chris Christie was blunt: Repay now or we will collect the debt the hard way. Plus interest.
In a letter to New Jersey's senators and representatives in Congress, Ray LaHood, the transportation secretary, warned that his department had ''many tools under the Debt Collection Act to recoup the lost federal taxpayer funds, including withholding future state funding from a wide variety of sources.'' But ''in consideration of the current economic challenges burdening New Jersey,'' Mr. LaHood added, he hoped to ''develop a workable payment schedule'' and avoid having to resort to those collection methods. 
Mr. LaHood should not expect to find a check in the mail any time soon. Mr. Christie, who was in Massachusetts on Friday to speak at Harvard University, declared in January that ''we are not paying the money back.''
Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Mr. Christie, said the governor's staff would ''review the decision before determining next steps moving forward.''
One option is to sue the department to try to stop it from seeking to collect, but Mr. Roberts would not say if a lawsuit was being considered.
In the meantime, interest on the debt will pile up quickly. The federal government currently charges interest at a rate of 1 percent a year, which in this case amounts to more than $50,000 a week.
The dispute dates to last fall, when Mr. Christie, a Republican, chose to halt construction on the tunnel project, known as Access to the Region's Core, or the ARC tunnel, which had just begun and was projected to cost $8.7 billion. The federal government had pledged to pay $3 billion of that cost, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had committed $3 billion more.
But Mr. Christie said he had become alarmed by estimates of potential cost overruns. He decided that New Jersey could not cover those excess costs and, over strenuous objections from Mr. LaHood and Senators Frank R. Lautenberg and Robert Menendez, canceled the project.
When federal transportation officials demanded that New Jersey repay money already spent on the project, Mr. Christie hired Patton Boggs, a Washington law firm, to challenge that demand. The lawyers, who reportedly have billed the state and New Jersey Transit about $800,000, argued that the state stopped the project because of unforeseen costs that were beyond its control.
But in his letter, Mr. LaHood said Mr. Christie had affirmed his support for the project a year ago when New Jersey Transit officials knew that the cost of the tunnel could rise as high as $12 billion.
Mr. Lautenberg and Mr. Menendez, both Democrats, issued a joint statement criticizing the approach taken by Patton Boggs.
''We worked hard to get the parties to negotiate a fair resolution of this conflict,'' the senators said. ''However, the state's outside lawyers pursued an all-or-nothing approach, which brings substantial risk to New Jersey taxpayers.''
A federal official involved in the dispute said the state could have offered to repay as little as $1 and the government would have been obligated to negotiate a settlement, a process which could have dragged on for years. All the while, no interest would have accrued on the debt, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak on the record.

HEADLINE: CNN Will Plan a Show Around Erin Burnett, a New Hire From CNBC

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
CNN said Friday that it had hired the anchor Erin Burnett away from CNBC and was planning to develop a daily show for her that would start in the summer.
Ken Jautz, the executive in charge of CNN/U.S., said he had not determined a time slot for Ms. Burnett's show. But the deal to bring her to CNN was a sign of the direction Mr. Jautz, who has been on the job for six months, wants to take the channel. 
He wants to emphasize ''substance and depth'' and make its programs more clearly delineated during the day and night, he said in an interview on Friday. ''We are going to develop a show with her and for her,'' Mr. Jautz said, indicating that she would not be placed into any existing program, like ''American Morning'' or ''CNN Newsroom,'' which runs from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays with various anchors throughout the day. He would not rule out any time slot. ''I'm going to keep my options open,'' he said.Ms. Burnett's move, which was first reported on Wednesday, represents a shift for her from niche business news to general news anchoring and reporting. As one of the most prominent weekday anchors on CNBC, she currently co-anchors two morning hours and anchors one afternoon hour.
She made no secret of her interest in broadening her work beyond business news. Through an expanded deal with CNBC and NBC three years ago, she was able to substitute as a host on the ''Today'' show and also turned up regularly on ''Morning Joe'' on MSNBC. ''I had a lot of opportunities that made me realize, 'Hey, I like doing more than markets,''' she said in an interview.
Ms. Burnett, 34, had once been talked about as a future candidate for one of the coveted host chairs on ''Today.'' Asked if she had been offered a new contract that would have included a bigger role on that show, she said NBC had presented her ''with some really exciting opportunities'' but said she did not know if she was allowed to comment further.
CNBC did not specify on Friday how the channel would replace Ms. Burnett, whom it hired in 2005. ''We wish Erin the best and thank her for all of her quality contributions, of which there have been many,'' a CNBC spokesman said after CNN's announcement.
Reflecting her interest in breaking out of pure business news, Ms. Burnett spoke fondly about her reporting for CNBC in countries like Nigeria, India and Iran. She spent more than a week in Cairo during the recent protests against the government of Hosni Mubarak. Among attributes of CNN that appealed to her, she said, was its ''incredible global platform in covering news.''
Along with her anchor role, Ms. Burnett will be the channel's chief business and economics correspondent. ''We see her role as being broader,'' Mr. Jautz said, than that of another CNN anchor, Ali Velshi, who is currently its chief business correspondent but may be getting groomed for a new position with CNN.
Mr. Velshi had been anchoring CNN from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. Eastern, but he has lately been on a tryout of sorts on ''American Morning,'' the channel's program from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., which is undergoing a reinvention. There has been speculation inside CNN that Ms. Burnett could slide into Mr. Velshi's time slot if he were to be named a permanent anchor on ''American Morning.''
Another time slot that has been speculated about for Ms. Burnett is 7 p.m. weekdays, when ''John King, USA'' is televised. The show, a politically oriented program, has had low ratings since its debut about a year ago.
Ms. Burnett said she did not yet have a sense of what time slot would be best. Sounding a bit like Piers Morgan, CNN's competitive 9 p.m. host who talks about wanting to beat his higher-rated rivals on MSNBC and Fox, she said, ''I really want to do something that's going to be exciting and is going to be No. 1.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: F.D.I.C. Closes 5 Banks, Pushing the Total for the Year to 39

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators shut down banks in Florida, Georgia and Michigan on Friday, a total of five closures that lifted the number of bank failures this year to 39. 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation seized First National Bank of Central Florida, based in Winter Park, with $352 million in assets, and Cortez Community Bank of Brooksville, Fla., with $70.9 million in assets.
The agency also took over First Choice Community Bank of Dallas, Ga., with $308.5 million in assets; Park Avenue Bank, based in Valdosta, Ga., with $953.3 million in assets; and Community Central Bank in Mount Clemens, Mich., with $476.3 million in assets.
The Miami-based Premier American Bank agreed to assume the assets and deposits of First National Bank of Central Florida and Cortez Community Bank. Bank of the Ozarks, based in Little Rock, Ark., is acquiring the assets and deposits of First Choice Community Bank and Park Avenue Bank. Talmer Bank & Trust, based in Troy, Mich., agreed to assume the assets and deposits of Community Central Bank.
In addition, the F.D.I.C. and Premier American Bank agreed to share losses on $270 million of First National Bank of Central Florida's loans and other assets, and on $51.3 million of Cortez Community Bank's assets.
The agency and Bank of the Ozarks are sharing losses on $260.7 million of First Choice Community Bank's assets and $514.1 million of Park Avenue Bank's assets. Talmer Bank & Trust is sharing with the F.D.I.C. $362.4 million of Community Central Bank's assets.
The failure of First National Bank of Central Florida is expected to cost the deposit insurance fund $42.9 million. The failure of Cortez Community Bank is expected to cost $18.6 million; that of First Choice Community Bank $92.4 million; Park Avenue Bank, $306.1 million; and Community Central Bank, $183.2 million.
Florida and Georgia have been the hardest-hit states for bank failures. Twenty-nine banks were shuttered in Florida last year and 16 in Georgia. Counting the shutdowns on Friday, four Florida banks have been closed this year, and 10 in Georgia.
California and Illinois also have had large numbers of bank failures.
In 2010, authorities seized 157 banks that succumbed to mounting soured loans and the hobbled economy. It was the most in a year since the savings-and-loan crisis two decades ago.
The F.D.I.C. has said that 2010 most likely would be the peak for bank failures.

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending Rises, But Inflation Picks Up, too

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Consumers increased spending for a ninth consecutive month in March as they stretched to cover higher costs for food and gasoline, with inflation posting its biggest year-on-year gain in 10 months. 
Despite the rising cost of living, Americans grew a bit more optimistic about the economy this month and even lowered their expectations for inflation over the medium to long term, another report showed Friday.
Consumer spending, which drives 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.6 percent last month after advancing 0.9 percent in February, the Commerce Department said. But prices rose 0.4 percent month on month, leaving spending up just 0.2 percent after adjusting for inflation.
While commodity prices have reduced purchasing power, consumers entered the second quarter with a slightly upbeat outlook.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 69.8, from 67.5 in March. The survey's one-year inflation expectation was unchanged at 4.6 percent, but the five-to-10-year inflation outlook slipped to 2.9 percent, from 3.2 percent in March.
A third report showed factory activity in the Midwest slowed, although it remained at a strong level. The data did little to shake economists' convictions that growth would pick up in the current quarter.
Economists said tepid demand in the first quarter had left businesses with less of a need to rebuild inventories.
''The need for new orders and production to beef up inventories is greatly reduced and as a consequence, we are seeing the factory sector slow down somewhat,'' said Richard DeKaser, an economist at the Parthenon Group.
''Manufacturing is coming off a sprint earlier this year and still moving ahead at a healthy clip.''
The spending report showed consumer prices up 1.8 percent from a year ago -- the largest 12-month gain since last May.
An index of core prices, which strips out food and energy costs, rose just 0.1 percent from February, keeping its year-on-year gain at 0.9 percent.
A separate report from the Labor Department showed wages grew at a 0.4 percent rate in the first quarter, and were up only 1.6 percent from a year ago.

HEADLINE: In Florida, G.O.P. Help For Unions

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- When State Senator John Thrasher introduced a bill to weaken the political clout of Florida's public employee unions, he expected that it would pass fairly easily, not least because Republicans held 28 of the Senate's 40 seats.
But now it looks as if the bill could falter before the legislative session ends next week. Unions representing teachers, firefighters, the police and other public employees say they have persuaded nearly half of the Senate's Republicans to oppose the bill by reminding them that in Florida, far more than in most states, organized labor has supported Republicans. 
''We have traditionally been a Republican-based organization,'' said James Preston, president of the Florida Fraternal Order of Police. ''How much more conservative can you get than the police officers? Who wants to go against the cops and firefighters on these matters?''
Still, the unions' success is surprising, especially since Republican lawmakers in traditionally labor-friendly states like Wisconsin and Ohio have passed far tougher antiunion legislation this year. In Florida, just one in 20 of workers in the state belongs to a union.
By some counts, 12 of the 28 Republican senators are against the latest version of Mr. Thrasher's bill, which would require public employee unions to get each member's permission each year before they could use that person's dues for political purposes. Senate Democrats are unified in opposition to the bill. Republican and business leaders -- noting that Florida's state employees contribute nothing toward their pensions -- have praised Mr. Thrasher's bill because it would reduce unions' leverage over health coverage and pensions.
''These are government unions that are negotiating oftentimes against the taxpayers,'' said Mark Wilson, president of the Florida Chamber of Commerce. ''It's not fair that the taxpayer-funded payroll system is collecting union dues that are used politically against the taxpayer.''
But Senator Miguel Diaz de la Portilla, a Republican representing Miami, said the bill was too punitive. ''I don't think it's necessary legislation,'' he said. ''It doesn't do anything to create jobs. It creates a lot of discord unnecessarily.''
He said the fact that unions in Florida were weak had forced them to be bipartisan. Using Wisconsin as an example, he said, ''You just don't have the animus between union and antiunion here that you have in some other places.''
Indeed, some of the bill's Republican opponents have enjoyed labor's campaign support and worked with unions on numerous issues.
Mr. Thrasher's bill originally had two main provisions. In addition to requiring members' permission for using dues money for politics, the legislation would have barred the state or any community from deducting union dues from workers' paychecks and forwarding that money to unions.
Union lobbyists repeatedly said the bill would cripple the payroll deductions that fuel labor's political efforts while continuing to allow similar deductions at 360 organizations and private companies, including insurers, that spend money on politics.
Unions also said they were being scapegoated for Florida's budget problems. They argued that the recession and Wall Street, not union-negotiated pay and benefits, caused Florida's $3.6 billion deficit.
Those arguments resonated with lawmakers.
Rene Garcia, a Republican senator who represents Hialeah, said he saw little need for the bill because Florida's public employees were already not required to join the unions that represent them or to pay dues. ''I don't like this bill because it's not fair when you single out one group,'' he said.
Mr. Thrasher, former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, saw that he did not have the votes for his original legislation even though the House had already passed a similar bill. So he dropped the provision eliminating the dues check-off.
Mr. Thrasher did not respond to interview requests. But Senator Don Gaetz, a Republican from Destin, said the bill was revised to make clear that it did not intend to cripple unions.
''There's no intent to stop unions from using funds for other very legitimate purposes,'' he said. ''The issue is, should the taxpayers of Florida be collecting money from public employees to be used by a union for direct partisan purposes? And the answer to that is no.''
Unions continue to fight the watered-down bill. ''It could make unions in Florida a toothless tiger in politics,'' said Rich Templin, chief lobbyist for the state A.F.L.-C.I.O.
In a sign that the bill is in trouble, Governor Rick Scott, a Republican, personally lobbied four Republican senators on Wednesday to back it, according to Mr. Diaz de la Portilla.
Gary Rainey, president of the Florida Professional Firefighters, said there was not enough Senate support to pass the bill in an up-or-down vote. But he feared that Republican leaders would secure passage by attaching it to another bill.
''It's been a continuous battle shoring up support,'' he said. ''It's not over until the fat lady sings.''

HEADLINE: Market Ends the Week With Momentum

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Strong corporate earnings, especially in the energy sector, helped lift major stock indexes to three-year highs on Friday.
The market's three main indexes have been climbing steadily in recent weeks as quarterly results trickled out and proved better than expected in many cases.
While the one-day gains on Friday were minimal, they were enough to build on past advances and to push the broader market and the Dow to their best monthly performances this year. 
The dollar, on the other hand, declined against its index of six currencies to a three-year low, said Brian Dolan, the chief currency strategist at Forex.com.
The euro was at $1.4839 on Friday, up from $1.4821 on Thursday.
''It is weak across the board,'' said Mr. Dolan of the dollar. ''U.S. interest rates are low and going to stay low, and other central banks are tightening. There is very little on the fundamental horizon to alter that downtrend.''
But corporate results have surpassed many forecasts.
About 300 of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index have reported quarterly results so far, and nearly 80 percent have said sales and operating earnings were higher in the first quarter than they were in the quarter a year ago, according to a survey compiled by Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at Standard & Poor's.
Russell T. Price, the senior economist for Ameriprise Financial, said the first quarter had suffered some economic and financial shocks from the disaster in Japan and the higher oil prices fueled by turmoil in the Middle East and North Africa.
But he said quarterly results were ''coming out so much better than expected.'' He added, ''It is a pretty good indication that corporate America is able to deal with the headwinds.''
Some companies benefited from the higher oil prices. Energy shares in S.& P. were up more than 1 percent on Friday.
Exxon Mobil released results on Thursday that reflected an increase in higher oil prices in the first quarter, reporting a 69 percent rise in net income to $10.7 billion, or $2.14 a share. Its shares rose less than 1 percent to $87.98.
Occidental Petroleum rose 8.71 percent to $114.29 after it reported on Thursday that profit rose to $1.55 billion, beating forecasts.
Industrial shares were also up.
Caterpillar, the heavy equipment maker, climbed more than 2.4 percent to $115.41 after its first-quarter income of $1.23 billion a share topped Wall Street's expectations.
The Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company was 12.04 percent higher at $18.15 after reporting a profit that was four times greater than forecast.
The markets were also partly lifted this week by the Federal Reserve statement on Wednesday that it would continue to stimulate growth with low interest rates.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 47.23 points, or 0.37 percent, at 12,810.54, a nearly 4 percent rise in the month and its best close since May 2008. Eighteen of the 30 components rose.
The S.& P. was 0.23 percent, or 3.13 points higher, at 1,363.61, in its highest close since June 5, 2008. It rose 2.85 percent in April, its best monthly advance this year.
The Nasdaq was 1.01 points higher at 2,873.54, weighed down by Microsoft, which reported that its third-quarter profit was up 31 percent, but that revenue from the division that includes the Windows operating system fell 4 percent.
Microsoft was down by 2.96 percent at $25.92. Research in Motion, the maker of the BlackBerry, was down by about 14 percent at $48.65 after it lowered its forecast for the current quarter.
The market has also been assessing the latest indicators of growth and spending this week. The government reported on Thursday that the economy grew at a rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter. Consumer spending increased 0.6 percent in March.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 7/32, to 102 26/32, and the yield fell to 3.29 percent from 3.31 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Introducing The Things Of Spring

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Springtime Progress Report: Early this year, we learned that Utah was considering a bill to name a Browning pistol its official state firearm. Meanwhile in Washington, Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey was pushing for a bill that would make it more difficult to sell guns to people on the terror watch list. I am excited to report that one of these pieces of legislation finally has been passed into law.
Yes! Utah now has an official state gun. It beat out Arizona, which this week bestowed its honor on the Colt Single-Action Army pistol. 
Lautenberg's bill, meanwhile, has gone nowhere whatsoever. It would require that gun purchases by people on the terror watch list be vetted by the attorney general's office to make sure that arming the individual in question would not pose a danger to homeland security. Opponents point out that the terror watch list is not always reliable, and the bill might therefore force innocent Americans to go through an entire additional step while purchasing armaments and explosives.
''It's taking a little bit of a back seat,'' the senator conceded. ''But we're on it.'' Like all advocates of sensible gun regulation, he has, by necessity, developed an incredibly optimistic outlook.
Speaking of the sunny side, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence is happy to report that so far this year, no state has passed a law prohibiting colleges from banning guns on campus. This is pretty notable, since failure to require that institutions of higher learning be gun-friendly is the only thing that stands between some states and a perfect 100 percent rating from the National Rifle Association. ''It's failed 51 straight times in 21 states,'' said Brian Malte of the Brady Campaign.
Actually, it did pass in Arizona recently, although it was vetoed by Gov. Jan Brewer. We have had cause to make fun of Governor Brewer in the past, sometimes for matters as trivial as making up stories about illegal immigrants leaving piles of severed heads in the desert. However, this woman has had a heck of a lot of crazy legislation to plow through. Besides the ''campus carry'' bill, she nixed a ''birther'' bill aimed at knocking President Obama off the next state presidential ballot. So, really, even though Brewer did sign the bill making the Colt pistol Arizona's state gun, you cannot say she had a bad April.
The Colt bill, which had originally failed during the Arizona Legislature's rush to adjournment, was resuscitated and passed in the wee small hours of the morning just before everybody left town. You'd have thought this would be a hard sell, what with the memory of the Tucson massacre so fresh, not to mention the fact that, as a lawmaker of Navajo descent pointed out, the Colt's role in winning the West has somewhat less pleasant connotations to Arizona's American Indian population.
However, in the end, the majority conceded to the logic of people like Senator Steve Smith, one of the sponsors. ''One would argue the white men themselves were instrumental weapons of mass destruction against the Native Americans. Should we not honor any white people?'' he demanded.
What with all this excitement, the lawmakers did not have enough time to make a miniscule change in state law that would have allowed 20,000 residents to get extended unemployment benefits, which would have been paid for entirely by federal funds. The state has a 9.5 percent unemployment rate.
But, you know, they had the official state gun thing to work out. ''It wasn't their priority,'' said the House minority whip, Anna Tovar.
Besides deliberately ignoring the long-term unemployed and caving in to lobbying by the gunmakers, I'm sorry to say that Arizona also gave the whole state thing-naming tradition a bad name.
I have always been a big fan of official state rocks and birds and flowers, in part because selecting them really does tend to distract legislatures from other more alarming activity. Also, the nominations usually come from groups of schoolchildren, who then get to watch democracy in action as the contenders for state fern or state song go head to head in a battle down to the wire. Many years ago, I was privileged to watch a fight over the official state mammal of Connecticut, in which the whale beat out the deer, to the edification of all homeowners who have never once woken up to discover that overnight, a whale had eaten their tulips.
But it's pretty creepy to imagine a bunch of third graders debating the merits of potential state guns. There are plenty of other routes to go here. I believe New York is working on a state dog. Neither Arizona or Utah has a state dog, although I was impressed to note that Utah has both an official state vegetable (Spanish sweet onion) and an official state historic vegetable (sugar beet).
Opportunities abound. If you want to name something, states, go for a beagle.

HEADLINE: Soft Drink Industry Fights Proposed Food Stamp Ban

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR; Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- To Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, it seemed like a sensible way to attack a major public health problem. To the soft drink industry, giant food companies, makers of snacks and candy, supermarkets, and antihunger groups, it seemed like an attack at the grocery checkout counter.
The mayor wants to reduce obesity and diabetes by banning the use of food stamps to buy ''sugar-sweetened beverages'' in New York City. 
Food and beverage lobbyists see the mayor's plan as a well-intentioned but misguided and paternalistic effort. They say it would create a logistical bottleneck at checkout counters and stigmatize poor people using food stamps.
They also fear that restrictions on soft drinks would set a precedent for the government to distinguish between good and bad foods and to ban the use of food stamps for other products -- an issue sure to come up next year in the Congressional debate on a new farm bill.
''Once you start going into grocery carts, deciding what people can or cannot buy, where do you stop?'' asked Kevin W. Keane, senior vice president of the American Beverage Association, whose members include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.
New York officials estimate that $75 million to $135 million in food stamp benefits are spent on sugar-sweetened beverages in the city each year. Such beverages, they say, are the single largest contributor to the obesity epidemic.
''This initiative will give New York families more money to spend on foods and drinks that provide real nourishment,'' Mr. Bloomberg said in seeking federal approval. City officials noted that federal policy already bans the sale of soft drinks in school lunch programs across the country.
The mayor's proposal would go further by banning the use of food stamps to buy carbonated and noncarbonated beverages that are sweetened with sugar or high-fructose corn syrup and have more than 10 calories per eight-ounce serving.
Food stamp benefits are paid for entirely by the federal government, and the city is seeking permission from the Agriculture Department to test its proposal in a two-year project. Because the proposal would define ''food'' more narrowly than federal law and regulations, food industry groups have unleashed a barrage against it.
President Obama, whose position on the New York plan is unclear, is in an awkward situation. The Agriculture Department, historically averse to restricting the use of food stamps, has said, ''There are no bad foods, only bad diets.'' The department rejected a somewhat similar proposal from Minnesota in 2004.
But Mr. Obama has set a goal ''to solve the problem of childhood obesity within a generation,'' and his wife, Michelle, is waging a high-profile campaign to promote healthy eating. The Web site of Mrs. Obama's childhood obesity initiative (www.letsmove.gov) even urges Americans to ''drink less soda or sugar-sweetened drinks.''
Opponents say that many factors, besides soft drinks, contribute to obesity. Moreover, they say, imposing restrictions on food stamps would require retailers to reprogram computers and embarrass some customers at the checkout counter.
While the American Beverage Association has led the opposition, the fight demonstrates how various parts of the food industry have united to thwart the mayor's proposal. Beverage industry lobbyists have worked with the Snack Food Association, the National Confectioners Association, which represents candy companies, the Food Marketing Institute, which represents 26,000 retail food stores, as well as antihunger groups like the Food Research and Action Center and Feeding America.
Eighteen members of the Congressional Black Caucus recently urged the Obama administration to reject New York's proposal. The plan is unfair to food stamp recipients because it treats them differently from other customers, they said in a letter to Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack.
While Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are among the largest contributors to the nonpartisan Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, a research and education institute, caucus members say their positions are not influenced by such contributions.
The number of food stamp recipients nationwide soared as the economy slumped. More than 44 million people -- one in seven Americans -- receive aid through the program, now known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.
Some public health groups and academics support the city's proposal. Prof. Kelly D. Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale, said the New York project was ''a test worth doing.''
''Through the SNAP program,'' Mr. Brownell said, ''the government spends hundreds of millions of dollars a year buying beverages that have been linked to risks for obesity and diabetes. These conditions cost the government and taxpayers billions of dollars a year in costs paid by Medicaid and Medicare.''
Some of the big industry groups have signed up lobbying firms. The Duberstein Group, led by Kenneth M. Duberstein, a chief of staff to President Ronald Reagan, reported that it had received $100,000 in the first quarter of this year to lobby for the Grocery Manufacturers Association on various issues, including proposals to restrict the use of food stamps.
Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research and Action Center, is leading efforts to assemble a loose coalition of food industry lobbyists and antihunger groups opposed to restrictions on the use of food stamps. Participants in the coalition said that another Washington lobbyist, Michael K. Torrey, had helped coordinate their efforts.
Mr. Torrey refused to discuss his role in those efforts. However, James A. McCarthy, president of the Snack Food Association, whose members include Kraft and Frito-Lay, a unit of PepsiCo, confirmed that Mr. Torrey was ''under contract with us.''
In his latest lobbying report, for the first quarter of the year, Mr. Torrey said he had received $30,000 from the association to lobby Congress and the administration on issues including ''the preservation of choice'' in the food stamp program.
Jean Daniel, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department, said the agency was actively reviewing New York's proposal. ''We have a lot of questions,'' Ms. Daniel said. ''We have been going back and forth with the state on the questions.''
While some food companies openly oppose the New York proposal, others declined to comment and referred questions to antihunger or industry groups.
Susan Davison, director of corporate affairs at Kraft Foods, whose products include Kool-Aid and Oreo cookies, referred questions to the Food Research and Action Center. In an e-mail, Kirstie Foster, director of corporate public relations at General Mills, referred questions about the SNAP program to the Grocery Manufacturers Association.
And Brian Kennedy, a spokesman for the association, referred questions to two other trade groups, the Food Marketing Institute and the National Grocers Association, which oppose New York's proposal.

HEADLINE: Silliness and Sleight of Hand

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
President Obama buckled.
On Wednesday, he released his long-form birth certificate, but not without chiding the media and his detractors for their ''silliness'' in forcing the issue.
No sooner had he released it than Donald Quixote was off to his next windmill: the president's college grades.
Donald Trump is still playing to suspicions of President Obama. And it's no longer theoretical. It's theological. For the detractors, truth is no longer dependent on proof because it's rooted in faith: faith that American exceptionalism was never truly meant to cover hyphenated Americans; faith in 400 years of cemented assumptions about the character and capacity of the American Negro; and faith that if the president doesn't hew to those assumptions then he must be alien by both birth and faith. 
This is how the moneyed interests -- of whom Trump is one -- want it. That is how sleight of hand works: distract and deceive. They need this distraction now more than ever because the right's flimsy fiscal argument -- that if we allow fat cats to gorge, crumbs will surely fall -- is losing traction.
It's losing traction with voters as the Supreme Court continues its crusade to put corporate interests above those of citizens. Just Wednesday, it ruled that there is a way for businesses to keep consumers claiming fraud from banding together in a single class-action lawsuit.
It's losing traction among workers. Gallup reported this week that a majority of Americans worry that they won't have enough money in retirement. And that worry is well founded. According to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's annual Retirement Confidence Survey released last month, 56 percent of American workers said they have less than $25,000 in retirement savings and investments. Twenty-nine percent of those said they have less than $1,000. At the same time, the average Wall Street cash bonus in 2010 was nearly $130,000, and the Republican budget proposed by Representative Paul Ryan seeks to dismantle Medicare and lower taxes on the wealthy.
It's losing traction among young people as it was reported last week that the unemployment rate for workers ages 16 to 24 reached a record high last year, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Meanwhile, last summer, student loan debt exceeded total credit card debt for the first time, and the Republican budget seeks to slash Pell grants.
It's losing traction with families as the national average price of a gallon of gas is nearing $4, while oil companies are reaping record profits while taking billions of dollars in government subsidies.
(There's something immoral about giving handouts to entrenched corporate interests with armies of lobbyists while seeking to cut those to hungry children, struggling families and frail seniors.)
It all loses traction as more Americans begin to see the far right for what it truly is: a gang of bandits willing to sacrifice the poor and working classes to further extend the American aristocracy -- shadowy figures who creep through the night, shaking every sock for every nickel and scraping their silver spoons across the bottom of every pot.
In fact, Gallup reported on Thursday that unfavorable views of the Tea Party, which was cheered and championed by billionaires and business interests, had jumped to 47 percent this month, a new high, while last week it reported that approval of Congress among Republicans and independents had dropped to a depressing 15 percent.
So the right needs to backfill its shaky fiscal reasoning with political segregationist rhetoric -- amplifying a separation of the ''us'' from the ''other.''
State Senator Jake Knotts of South Carolina last year called President Obama -- along with the state's governor Nikki Haley, who is Indian-American and a Republican -- a disparaging slur. When pressured to resign, he refused, proclaiming that: ''If all of us rednecks leave the Republican Party, the party would have one hell of a void.'' Do tell.
This is not to say that all Republicans are tolerant of this behavior. Far from it. But the party has taken the strategic position that in some cases its politically advantageous to allow demagogues and xenophobes, sectarians and homophobes to not only see the party as a sanctuary but as a place to rise to its top.
In the last several months, Republican state lawmakers and party officials have said the most reprehensible things about Hispanics, gays and blacks.
State Representative John Yates of Georgia compared the state's threat from illegal immigrants to the threat from Hitler in World War II and suggested that border agents should be allowed to ''shoot to kill.'' State Representative Curry Todd of Tennessee compared pregnant illegal immigrants to multiplying rats.
State Representative Larry Brown of North Carolina suggested cutting off financing used to treat people with H.I.V. and AIDS because they are ''living in perverted lifestyles.'' Brown also drew criticism in October for an e-mail he sent to fellow Republicans in which he used disparaging terms about gays.
And David Bartholomew had to resign as the Virginia Beach Republican Party chairman after forwarding an e-mail that joked about someone taking his ''dog'' to the welfare office and saying: ''My Dog is black, unemployed, lazy, can't speak English'' and has no clue ''who his Daddy is.''
In 1965, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. described how the strategy of separating people with common financial interests by agitating their racial differences was used against the populist movement at the turn of the century, explaining that ''the Southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow.''
He continued that Jim Crow was ''a psychological bird that told him that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man.'' He called this ''their last outpost of psychological oblivion.''
But the right, with a new boost of energy from Trump, is reaching for new frontiers. The language and methodology are different, but the goal is the same: to deny, invalidate and subjugate, to distract from real issues with false divisions.
Trump is helping the right shape new weapons from old hatreds, forming shivs from shackles, all the while patting himself on the back and promoting his brand.
But his point of pride is the right's mark of shame.

HEADLINE: 'Christian Economics' Meets the Antiunion Movement

BYLINE: By MARK OPPENHEIMER. 
markoppenheimer.com; twitter/markopp1

 BODY:
Gary North was nearly impossible to track down. He did not return multiple e-mails, and when finally reached by phone, he refused to talk and hung up.
But if you know where to look, he is everywhere.
Mr. North, a onetime aide to Representative Ron Paul of Texas, a possible 2012 Republican presidential candidate, is the leading proponent of ''Christian economics,'' which applies biblical principles to economic issues and the free market.
Largely unknown to the broader public, Mr. North is an influential figure on the American far right. He has written dozens of books, blogs prolifically and is on the curriculum of Christian home-schoolers across America. 
He may even have turned up among the antiunion protesters in Madison, Wis., this year.
Not literally, of course (and who would have recognized him if he had been there?). But Christian conservatism and free-market conservatism meet in Mr. North's writings. A small but vigorous part of the conservative movement has absorbed his view that the Bible is opposed to organized labor, and especially to organized public employees.
''Not only do Reconstructionists believe that public employees should not have the right to organize, they believe that almost all of them should not be public employees,'' writes Julie Ingersoll, of the University of North Florida, in the Web magazine Religion Dispatches. ''Most of the tasks performed by those protesting the Wisconsin state budget would, in the biblical economics of North,'' be privatized.
These ''Reconstructionists'' are believers in Christian Reconstructionism, the philosophy of R. J. Rushdoony, who died in 2001. According to Reconstructionism, a Christian theocracy under Old Testament law is the best form of government, and a radically libertarian one. Biblical law, they believe, presupposes total government decentralization, with the family and church providing order. Until that day comes, Reconstructionists believe the rights to home-school and to worship freely at least provide the barest conditions of liberty.
Mr. North, who is Mr. Rushdoony's son-in-law but was not on speaking terms with him from 1981 until Mr. Rushdoony's death, focuses on how that biblical libertarianism applies to economics. He concluded that the Bible forbids any welfare programs, is opposed to all inflation, and requires a gold-coin standard for money.
''God has cursed the earth,'' Mr. North writes, alluding to the Book of Genesis in his 1973 book ''Introduction to Christian Economics.'' ''This is the starting point for all economic analysis. The earth no longer gives up her fruits automatically. Man must sweat to eat.'' Mr. North writes that no form of government assistance ''will escape the ethical limits'' of the Apostle Paul's dictum, in II Thessalonians, that ''if any would not work, neither should he eat.''
And evidence that God would prefer gold money to paper can be found throughout the Old Testament, according to Mr. North. There are more than 350 references to gold in Strong's famous Bible concordance, he writes. Gold is used in worship, godly wisdom is compared to gold and the Hebrew prophets used the debasement of metals as a metaphor for immorality.
Home-schoolers can download Mr. North's economics textbook free from his Web site. And his thinking may have influenced Representative Paul, who briefly employed Mr. North as a speechwriter, working on monetary policy, in 1976.
Michael J. McVicar, who teaches at Ohio State and wrote a doctoral dissertation on Mr. Rushdoony, said Mr. North discovered Mr. Rushdoony's writing as a young man in Southern California, shortly after he became, along with his parents, an evangelical Christian.
''He corresponded with Rushdoony and made this his livelihood: to generate some synthesis between biblical law and libertarian economics,'' Mr. McVicar said. ''Eventually Rushdoony took him under his wing and became a sort of surrogate father for North, who married one of Rushdoony's daughters.''
The two men's ''spectacular break,'' as Mr. McVicar calls it, split Reconstructionism into two camps. The break was partly over the kind of theological minutiae that would impress even a rabbinical scholar. In fact, one issue might pique the interest of real rabbinical scholars.
''It was about North's interpretation of, of all things, Passover and the Israelites' marking the doorposts with the blood of the lamb,'' Mr. McVicar said. ''North made this argument, that because of the doorpost's structure, that this was an indication of hymenal blood from the marriage bed, and tied it into what Rushdoony called this 'fertility cult' mentality. And Rushdoony took a much more common-sense approach to the blood.
''The subtext is, it's a father-son spat,'' Mr. McVicar concluded.
The deeper one looks into the obsessions of Mr. North -- who was born in 1942 and who as of 2007 lived in Horn Lake, Miss. -- the harder it is to spot his influence in Wisconsin. The main themes of the Wisconsin budget battles were union influence, the distribution of wealth and the public fisc; Mr. North, by contrast, is associated with his own brand of far-right Presbyterianism, gun-owners' rights, home-schooling and the gold standard for money.
Mr. McVicar believes that Professor Ingersoll's attempted connection between Christian economics and the rallies in Madison is a bit tenuous. ''Her insight has to be in my mind so heavily qualified as to make it almost nothing,'' he said. But he concedes that it ''has the most basic essence of truth,'' given how widely Mr. North's teachings have been disseminated on the Christian right.
Professor Ingersoll concedes it is difficult to prove direct connections between Mr. North's writings and Wisconsin antiunion conservatism. On the other hand, Mr. North might like to think he has influenced the Wisconsin debate, and he has written in vociferous support of Gov. Scott Walker.
And, as Professor Ingersoll cautions, influence does not always announce itself:
''I like to say, 'How many Christians know who is Augustine is, and how he influenced them?' ''

HEADLINE: Afghanistan War Report Cites Progress By Troops

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Tangible progress has been made in expanding security across Afghanistan, the Pentagon reported on Friday, saying that successes on the battlefield over the past several months could be attributed to the 30,000 additional troops sent to the war by President Obama.
But the optimistic tone of the report was tempered by assessments from senior officials in Kabul and Washington that the Taliban and other insurgent groups were expected to attempt spectacular counterattacks, perhaps in the near future. 
Fighting across Afghanistan usually increases each year with the spring thaw, and Pentagon and military officials say they expect insurgent leaders to make a major effort soon to prove that their loss of territory to Mr. Obama's troop increase could be reversed this year.
A senior Pentagon official agreed that the latest update's tone was more optimistic, even if cautiously so, than that of previous reports, which since 2009 have described the security situation in Afghanistan as deteriorating. Congress requires the progress reports twice a year.
American, allied and Afghan forces have halted the insurgency's momentum and have achieved ''tangible progress in some really key areas,'' the Pentagon official said.
Echoing a view often expressed by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the top commander in Afghanistan, the official warned that the assessment clearly noted that the advances were fragile and reversible.
''It does show progress,'' said the official, who briefed reporters under ground rules imposed by the Pentagon that precluded identifying him by name. ''It also points out that we do have a resilient enemy,'' the official added.
There remain significant shortages of foreign trainers, hampering the development of Afghan security forces, the official noted. And progress in economic development and governance has not kept pace with advances on the battlefield. In addition, corruption across all levels of government puts the military's gains at risk.
''There is still a lot to do,'' the official said. He agreed with military and intelligence officers who said that the public should ''expect spectacular attacks'' by the insurgency.
The Taliban recently scored both a tactical and a propaganda victory with a major prison break of insurgent fighters. In anticipation of an increasing pace of attacks and bombings, the official contended that individual acts of insurgent violence would not be enough to derail the allied and Afghan campaign.
Noting advances made by allied and Afghan security forces, in particular in the insurgent heartland of southern Afghanistan, the official said that ''the pushback of the Taliban out of these key areas in the last year is really a strategic defeat for the Taliban.''
''How they respond, whether it's attacks there, attacks elsewhere, I don't know,'' the official said. ''But given that strategic setback that they've suffered, they're going to try and send messages to the population in other ways that they're going to be able to come back. And that's going to be a big challenge for the Afghan forces, for us, as those efforts are made.''
The report on progress and stability in Afghanistan again cited the harmful effects of the safe havens that insurgent fighters maintain across the border in Pakistan, allowing them to rest, plan and train before moving back into Afghanistan to mount attacks.
The report was released as General Petraeus was finalizing his proposals for how quickly to start withdrawing American forces from Afghanistan in July, as ordered by the president.

HEADLINE: Hundreds of Thousands Are Without Power, and Many Without Homes

BYLINE: By CAMPBELL ROBERTSON and KIM SEVERSON; Campbell Robertson reported from Tuscaloosa, and Kim Severson from Atlanta. Kevin Sack and Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Tuscaloosa.

 BODY:
TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- On Friday, as President Obama came to this partly ruined city to witness the destruction wrought by this week's monstrous storms, the full scope of the damage was becoming more apparent.
The death toll, including those who were killed by storms earlier in the week in Arkansas, reached 333. On Friday evening, Alabama emergency officials announced that the state's death toll had reached 232.
Power remained out for hundreds of thousands throughout the South, rendering gas stations, grocery stores and banks useless. Fifteen hundred people were staying in more than 65 Red Cross shelters, a fraction of those who were left homeless but an indication of the numbers who are now destitute. 
So far in Alabama, 654 families have been displaced from public or government-assisted housing units, according to an initial count by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The Red Cross, with an eye toward the mental health issues that will surely develop in the hard days and weeks ahead, has dispatched hundreds of volunteers trained to offer psychological first aid.
Mr. Obama, who visited Tuscaloosa with his wife, Michelle, gave a sense of the scale of the disaster after a ride through Alberta, a neighborhood that was turned into a jagged wasteland.
''I've never seen devastation like this,'' he said.
But, echoing the volunteers who have come in such high numbers that they are being turned away in some areas, Mr. Obama turned the focus toward the work ahead.
''We can't bring those who have been lost back,'' he said. ''But the property damage, which is obviously extensive, that's something that we can do something about.''
The White House announced on Friday afternoon that five cabinet members, including the secretaries of agriculture, housing and homeland security, would be traveling to Alabama and Mississippi on Sunday.
Mr. Obama declared a major disaster in Alabama on Thursday night, an action that makes federal financing available for individuals, businesses and state and local governments.
This federal money is mainly intended to cover uninsured losses, and can help individuals obtain some rebuilding assistance and cities replace public buildings. Insurance claims are already growing exponentially, and could approach $1 billion, said Ragan Ingram, chief of staff at the Alabama Department of Insurance.
Meanwhile, emergency workers in the hardest-hit states of Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee were toiling on urgent needs, some of them almost cruel in their complexity.
''Now we're getting a handle on exactly what we are facing,'' said Mayor Walt Maddox of Tuscaloosa, ''the nightmarish truth that this is an utter disaster.''
The tornado damaged two water tanks in Tuscaloosa, necessitating a boil-water advisory in much of the city -- including parts of it that do not have electricity. The emergency operations centers in three of the affected counties have no power; in two of those there is no telephone service either. The countywide 911 system in Walker County is also down, according to the Alabama Emergency Management Agency. About 1,000 workers were trying to restore electricity to nearly 260,000 customers of Alabama Power.
The Tennessee Valley Authority's electricity production system, which sells to seven states, lost more than 200 towers and other structures to the storm and left nearly 700,000 customers without power across several states. By the afternoon, power was again running through high-voltage lines that stretch across 21 of the damaged towers, but 561,000 customers were still without electricity. It will likely not be restored until next week, and the company is facing weeks of work and millions in repair costs.
''This is a historic outage,'' said Scott Brooks, a spokesman.
It is too early to calculate the storm's economic impact, with some employers, like auto plants, temporarily closed and some small businesses blown away altogether. But one indication of the scale of destruction, as well as the complicated challenges of the response, is Alabama's $5 billion poultry industry.
The industry, which is mostly located in the northern counties that were hit hardest, processes 20 million broiler chickens a week. At least 714 poultry houses -- each of which can hold up to 30,000 chickens -- have been damaged or destroyed.
Millions more chickens might be without water for extended periods and were seen as likely to die. Those in damaged facilities will have to be destroyed and disposed of according to state law, which allows for burying or burning carcasses.
That alone will be a challenge, said John McMillan, the state agriculture commissioner.
''Nobody's got an incinerator big enough to take care of 20,000 or 30,000 of them at one time, and that's what we will have in many, many cases,'' Mr. McMillan said.
In Tuscaloosa, officials said on Friday that the police had received 454 calls since the tornado struck from residents looking for missing people. Officials cautioned not to read too much into that number, but it did suggest that there may still be grim discoveries to be made.
Early in the morning two teams from the Tuscaloosa Fire Department set out with ''human remains detection'' dogs to scour areas of the city that were hit hardest: the housing projects at Rosedale Court and the largely poor neighborhood of Alberta, both of which were flattened by the enormous tornado that rolled northeastward through town.
They were search and rescue teams but held few illusions about what they were looking for -- the dogs that specialize in finding survivors were not the ones the city sought.
The team in Alberta waited patiently as a white Labrador retriever named Jody from North Mississippi Search and Rescue sniffed around the giant piles of debris. She indicated interest, as the term of art puts it, in three places, and a worker began using an excavator to lift up fallen trees, walls and mounds of jumbled debris.
For hours, searchers did not find anything. But given the thoroughness of the devastation, it seemed inevitable that the team would find at least one body. And indeed, at around 5:30 p.m., in another part of Alberta, they did.

HEADLINE: A Community College in Florida Works to Attract the Poor and the Presidential

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
MIAMI -- In any graduation season, Yale, Harvard, West Point and the like inevitably make the list of powerhouse commencement ceremonies that attract a revolving door of American presidents in cap and gown.
Yet a community college in Miami with no trace of ivy and a policy of accepting just about everyone, even the hard luck cases, has managed to lure a trifecta of commanders in chief to its urban campus.
At Miami Dade College on Friday evening, President Obama delivered the commencement address, joining a roster that includes Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Over the years, Jimmy Carter, the elder President Bush and Gerald R. Ford have stopped in for round-table chats as have an assortment of first ladies, foreign presidents and cabinet members. 
So how is it that an open-admission college that embraces academically risky students carries such cachet?
''We call it a dream factory,'' said Eduardo J. Padron, the college's president since 1995. ''We give people who ordinarily wouldn't have the opportunity a second chance.''
The college's demographics make for political catnip. Presidents and other members of the nation's elite want to align themselves with an institution that has had an amazing run of success stories among its Hispanic and black students. ''If we want to win the future,'' said Hannah M. August, a White House spokeswoman, ''we need to outeducate our global competitors, and schools like Miami Dade are helping us lead the way.''
With an enrollment of 170,000, Miami Dade is the country's largest college (not including online universities). Ninety percent of its students are minorities, and it graduates more black and Hispanic students than any other college. This is no small accomplishment in light of the country's stubbornly low college attendance and graduation rates among minorities.
Take a Google tour of Miami notables and an impressive list crops up of graduates and former students of Miami Dade College (or Dade County Junior College, as it was known when it opened in 1960): members of Congress (Representatives Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and John L. Mica, both Florida Republicans and House committee leaders), mayors, actors (Andy Garcia and Sylvester Stallone), music magnates (Emilio Estefan), baseball players, a former president of Panama and an assortment of successful architects, lawyers, bank presidents, hospital directors and business owners.
''I think if it weren't for Miami Dade, I would be doing something very different right now, working in a gas station or something,'' said Cesar L. Alvarez, the executive chairman of the law firm Greenberg Traurig and a 1967 graduate who credited the college for inspiring him to achieve. ''I didn't have money to go anywhere else, and I seriously doubt anyone else would have taken me.''
The college's home state, an electoral prize, is irresistible for any politician. But many attribute its allure for presidents to Dr. Padron, a personable and low-key leader who takes pride in Miami Dade's community college soul. Dr. Padron has elevated the school's status and nurtured his political relationships. Mr. Obama selected him to head the President's Advisory Commission on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans. He has held similar posts under past presidents.
Like many in Miami, Dr. Padron is an alumnus. ''He was his own case study,'' Mr. Alvarez said.
Dr. Padron attended the college in the 1960s, fresh from Cuba, with only a smattering of English and no chance of attending any other college. He excelled, eventually working his way to a doctorate in economics at the University of Florida. He rebuffed a lucrative job with DuPont, choosing instead to pay a social debt to his community. He started working at the college and has stayed for 40 years.
His philosophy is simple. Rather than encourage professors to polish their credentials by publishing papers, Dr. Padron urges them to be passionate about teaching and committed to helping students in need. Many of the students struggled to graduate from high school and pay tuition. Some take 10 years to graduate because they are working their way through school. Others charge through in two years under an honors program and transfer to top-tier universities.
Miami Dade also focuses on training students for real-world jobs; it graduates more nurses, for example, than any other college.
''Our students, a majority, come to us unprepared,'' said Dr. Padron, who said Miami public schools, with some exceptions, often fail to properly educate the city's children. ''It takes effort and money to get them to a level they can compete. If we say, 'You are not prepared. We won't admit you,' thousands and thousands would not be able to come to college. The cycle of poverty would continue. That's why this is so crucial.''
That was true of Mr. Estefan, a Miami institution who was just another broke Cuban refugee with no option but Miami Dade. He squeezed in courses at night between his day job as an office boy at the Bacardi Corporation and an evening job as an accordion player at an Italian restaurant. Mr. Estefan, now a world-renowned music producer, credits the college for giving him a foundation for what it takes to run a business.
When he aspired to jump into the music industry, people told him he was too poor, too foreign, too old. ''Then at Miami Dade, one professor said to me, 'In this country, you can do anything.' ''

HEADLINE: Gas Cost Spurs Fight Over End Of a Tax Break

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; David Kocieniewski contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Congress returns next week to a flaring brawl over oil industry profits and tax breaks, with both parties hoping to capitalize on growing public ire at high gasoline prices.
President Obama touched off the latest flurry with a letter to Congressional leaders last week calling for the repeal of $4 billion a year in tax incentives for domestic oil and gas production, saying the industry was doing very well, thank you, and needed no help from the government. Republicans responded that the president's proposal would only raise the cost of production and the price of gasoline, which now tops $4 a gallon in many parts of the country.
Both parties are planning legislative maneuvers this week to try to caricature their opponents as either in the pockets of the oil companies or hostile to domestic energy production. 
The debate may generate a fair amount of noise that provides one side or the other with a temporary political advantage but is unlikely in the end to have an appreciable impact on gasoline prices.
''Every time Americans have to shell out $60 or $80 to fill their tanks, they mutter under their breaths about government and it puts pressure on Congress and the White House to do something,'' said Byron L. Dorgan, the former Democratic senator from North Dakota who is now co-chairman of an energy project at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington. ''But it's just howling at the moon. The basic laws of supply and demand haven't changed.''
House Speaker John Boehner unwittingly gave the Democrats a political opening to pile on the oil companies by saying in an interview with ABC News last week that oil companies should ''pay their fair share in taxes'' and that Congress ought to reconsider some of the tax incentives they enjoy. He has since walked away from those remarks and said that raising any taxes would choke off the economic recovery and lead to higher prices of gasoline and other goods.
His comments came as lawmakers from both parties were home on recess, hearing a torrent of constituent complaints about the high cost of gasoline at the same time major oil companies were reporting near-record quarterly profits. Exxon Mobil, the world's largest oil company, said it earned $10.7 billion in the first three months of the year, and other companies reported similarly robust earnings.
Mr. Obama seized on the opportunity to try to deflect some of the heat he has been feeling as gas prices have steadily climbed. He noted wryly at a political fund-raiser last weekend that his poll numbers tend to go up and down with pump prices, even as he admitted he had no ''silver bullet'' to bring those prices down in the short term. But he found ammunition in the tax breaks the oil industry has enjoyed for decades, portraying the industry as undeserving of them at a time when government needs all the revenue it can get.
''As we work together to reduce our deficits,'' Mr. Obama said in a letter to Congressional leaders last week, ''we simply can't afford these wasteful subsidies.'' Mr. Obama says the money saved should be used to finance more research into clean energy alternatives -- a proposal he has made in his last two budget requests that has largely been ignored.
''The odds are low that the tax repeal goes through as a stand-alone measure, but you might see it as part of a broader deal,'' said Michael A. Levi, an energy and environment specialist at the Council on Foreign Relations. He said it was in Mr. Obama's interest to keep the issue alive both to align Republicans with the unpopular oil companies and to use as leverage as new budget negotiations begin.
Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, said he would press for a vote as early as next week on repealing the tax subsidies. Democrats hope to paint Republicans who vote against the plan as tools of the industry.
''Now is not the time to stand idly by while large oil and gas companies get billions of dollars in tax breaks,'' said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the finance committee. ''Now is the time to take concrete steps toward cleaner, more affordable, domestically produced energy.''
The measure could well pass in the Democratic Senate, although some Democrats from oil-producing states, like Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Begich of Alaska, are likely to oppose it.
But it has little chance of even coming to a vote in the Republican-run House, where Speaker Boehner is orchestrating a fresh chorus of ''drill, baby, drill'' with a series of votes on bills to allow new oil and gas exploration in the Gulf of Mexico and off the coast of Virginia.
''Our goal is to expand the supply of American energy to lower gas prices and create jobs,'' said Michael Steel, spokesman for Mr. Boehner. ''Raising taxes would have the opposite effect.''
Neither the Senate tax measure nor the House drilling bills is likely to become law because of the fierce partisan calculus of the current Congress. But some Republicans, including Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the party's leader on budget matters, have left open the door for rethinking a range of government tax breaks as part of an agreement on the federal budget and deficit ceiling.
Some conservatives oppose energy subsidies of all sorts -- including those for ethanol, wind, nuclear and solar power -- and would be willing to see them all repealed as part of a reform of the business tax code.
Oil industry tax breaks -- some of them dating back a century -- have been debated for years but have survived every elimination attempt. According to a breakdown by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, oil companies receive about $4 billion a year in federal subsidies and can avail themselves of tax breaks at virtually every stage of the prospecting and drilling process.
One lingering provision from the Tariff Act of 1913 -- enacted to encourage exploration at a time when drilling often led to dry holes -- allows many small and midsize oil companies to claim deductions for tapped oil fields far beyond the amount the companies actually paid for them.
Another subsidy, devised by the State Department in the 1950s, allows U.S.-based oil companies to reclassify the royalties they are charged by foreign governments as taxes -- which can be deducted dollar-for-dollar from their domestic tax bill. That provision alone will cost the federal government $8.2 billion over the next decade, according to the Treasury department.
