HEADLINE: Brighton Beach, N.J.

BYLINE: By AMANDA M. FAIRBANKS

 BODY:
IN scene after scene in ''Two Lovers,'' the new movie starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Joaquin Phoenix as a star-crossed couple, the Brooklyn neighborhood of Brighton Beach is on lush display. The camera lingers affectionately on Brighton Cleaners on Coney Island Avenue, on Cafe Restaurant Volna, which sits opposite the Boardwalk, and on the Boardwalk itself, the moody setting of some of the movie's most poignant moments. 
But the dingy six-story apartment house that is home to two of the main characters and frequently visited by the third can be found not in this heavily Russian neighborhood, but across the river in Jersey City.
Paradoxically, this is because Brighton Beach has, in a sense, become a victim of its own good fortune. Gleaming new condominium buildings hug the shore. And as local real estate prices have risen -- at least until the recession -- so too has the occupancy rate of older buildings.
This made it impossible for the filmmakers to find an apartment house that was six to eight stories tall, built in the 1920s and spacious enough to accommodate large families. The building also had to be sufficiently unoccupied.
The filmmakers also required a U-shaped structure whose configuration allowed the characters played by Ms. Paltrow, Mr. Phoenix and Vinessa Shaw, the third member of the love triangle, to carry on their romance in the building's bedrooms and courtyard and on its roof.
As recently as a decade ago, a building meeting these criteria would have been easy to find in Brighton Beach. But the neighborhood's subsequent growth made it impossible, and the filmmakers ended up in Jersey City, at 131 Kensington Avenue.
With its narrow hallways and cramped bedrooms, this building offered the seemingly authentic Brighton Beach interiors that establish the texture of ''Two Lovers,'' and it was here that most of the interior scenes were shot.
Still, unlike many neighborhoods whose gentrification is their undoing, Brighton Beach has retained much of its original character. This is why the streets were so appealing to James Gray, the film's director. Mr. Gray fervently believes in capturing the texture and authenticity of the neighborhoods in which his stories are set, an approach used in his lavishly praised first film, 1994's ''Little Odessa.''
Mr. Gray, whose grandparents settled near Brighton Beach after emigrating from Russia in 1924, said of the neighborhood: ''It hasn't changed. If anything, it's become more Russian.''
But as the credits to ''Two Lovers'' roll, Jersey City is thanked in bold, white letters, along with the residents of 131 Kensington Avenue. Brighton Beach is not mentioned at all.

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: It Can't Last Forever

BYLINE: By ALAN S. BLINDER. 
ALAN S. BLINDER, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve

 BODY:
HERE'S the hard truth: Nobody knows when this recession will end. Economic forecasting is a dark art, and predicting when recessions begin and end is its weakest link. That said, my best guess is that growth will return in the fourth quarter of this year. Why? 
First, recessions don't last forever. If the economy continues to slide through the third quarter, as I anticipate it will, this will be the longest American recession since World War II. Housing must hit bottom at some point. For several years now, declining expenditures on homebuilding have subtracted roughly a percentage point from gross domestic product growth. The change from minus 1 percent to (at least) zero will add a full point to growth. Auto sales are also not likely to keep falling at recent rates. Second, Washington's large economic stimulus should add more than 5 percent to real gross domestic product over two years.
Third, the price of oil plummeted from a peak of around $145 a barrel last summer to around $40 a barrel today. Since the $145 price was fleeting, let's call the ''true'' decline from $100 to $40, which means the bill Americans pay for imported oil fell by about $300 billion dollars a year.
But here's the rub. My forecast assumes that no other (big) shoes will drop. Sad to say, shoes have been dropping like rain.

HEADLINE: Slow Economy, Faster Traffic

BYLINE: By JOHN R. QUAIN

 BODY:
APPARENTLY, the dark cloud of the economy has a silver lining: less traffic congestion.
A study released last week by Inrix, a supplier of live and historic traffic information for navigation devices and radio stations, shows that compared with 2007 there was a 30 percent decline in traffic congestion across major metropolitan areas of the United States last year. Inrix based its second annual report, called the National Traffic Scorecard, on an analysis of nearly 50,000 miles of primary roads, culled from information it collects on more than 800,000 miles of highways. 
The National Traffic Scorecard cites two main causes for the drop in traffic: volatile fuel prices and the economic crisis. However, the company notes that congestion was basically the same during the first half of the year, when gas prices were high (and the financial situation seemed fine), compared with the second half of the year when the economy experienced a precipitous slowdown and gas prices were low. So one might surmise that when people have to drive, they are going to drive no matter what the price of gas is. On the other hand, when you don't have a job, then you don't have to commute.
Illustrating how the economic collapse has affected traffic, the report notes that Detroit, where the jobless rate climbed well into the double digits last year, experienced the second-largest reduction in congestion nationwide. In Riverside, Calif., where foreclosures ranked high last year, drivers experienced the biggest drop in traffic congestion.
The report notes that 99 of the 100 most-populated cities had a decrease in traffic congestion in 2008 compared with 2007. The lone city bucking the trend? Baton Rouge, La., with a 6 percent increase in congestion. (Maybe things are looking up in Baton Rouge.)
So what are the top (or rather, worst) cities when it comes to traffic congestion?
1. Los Angeles
2. New York
3. Chicago
4. Dallas
5. Washington
New Yorkers, for all their griping, are still second when it comes to enduring bumper-to-bumper traffic. Yet, according to Inrix, the Big Apple still has bragging rights when it comes to claiming the nation's worst bottleneck: the dreaded westbound stretch of the Cross Bronx Expressway.
There are many good news/bad news aspects to consider from the report. For example, less traffic means fewer carbon emissions. On the other hand, less traffic also means fewer goods are being shipped on the road and fewer people are going to shopping malls.
But exactly what are people doing with all the time they are saving by not sitting in traffic? Watching television, it would seem. According to the latest Nielsen Company report, also released last week, Americans watched more television than ever, a whopping 151 hours a month, during the last three months of 2008. That was up from 146 hours during the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Forced Down the Job Ladder, From Executive Pay to Hourly Wage

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
TEMPE, Ariz. -- Mark Cooper started his work day on a recent morning cleaning the door handles of an office building with a rag, vigorously shaking out a rug at a back entrance and pushing a dust mop down a long hallway.
Nine months ago he lost his job as the security manager for the western United States for a Fortune 500 company, overseeing a budget of $1.2 million and earning about $70,000 a year. Now he is grateful for the $12 an hour he makes in what is known in unemployment circles as a ''survival job'' at a friend's janitorial services company. But that does not make the work any easier.
''You're fighting despair, discouragement, depression every day,'' Mr. Cooper said.
Working five days a week, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Mr. Cooper is not counted by traditional measures as among the recession's casualties at this point. But his tumble down the economic ladder is among the more disquieting and often hidden aspects of the downturn. 
It is not clear how many professionals like Mr. Cooper have taken on these types of lower-paying jobs, which are themselves in short supply. Many are doing their best to hold out as long as possible on unemployment benefits and savings while still looking for work in their fields.
About 1.7 million people, however, were working part-time in January because they could not find full-time work, a 40 percent jump from December 2007, when the recession began, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
And experts agree that as the economic downturn continues and as more people begin to exhaust their jobless benefits and other options, the situation Mr. Cooper is in will inevitably become more common.
Interviews with more than two dozen laid-off professionals across the country, including architects, former sales managers and executives who have taken on lower-paying, stop-gap jobs to help make ends meet, found that they were working for places like U.P.S., a Verizon Wireless call center and a liquor store. For many of the workers, the psychological adjustment was just as difficult as the financial one, with their sense of identity and self-worth upended.
''It has been like peeling back the layers of a bad onion,'' said Ame Arlt, 53, who recently accepted a position as a customer-service representative at an online insurance-leads referral service in Franklin, Tenn., after 20 years of working in executive jobs. ''With every layer you peel back, you discover something else about yourself. You have to make an adjustment.''
Some people had exhausted their jobless benefits, or were ineligible; others said it was impossible for them to live on their unemployment checks alone, or said it was a matter of pride, or sanity, that drove them to find a job, any job.
In just one illustration of the demand for low-wage work, a spokesman for U.P.S. said the company saw the number of applicants this last holiday season for jobs sorting and delivering packages almost triple to 1.4 million from the 500,000 it normally receives.
When Ms. Arlt applied for the job, she sent in a stripped-down resume that hid her 20-year career at national media companies, during which she ascended to vice president of brand development at the On Command Video Corporation and was making $165,000 a year. She decided in 2001 to start her own business, opening an equestrian store and then founding a magazine devoted to the sport. But with the economy slowing, she was forced to shutter both businesses by June of last year.
After applying for more than 100 jobs, mostly director-level and above in marketing and branding, and getting just two interviews, Ms. Arlt said she realized last fall that she had to do something to ''close the monthly financial hemorrhage.''
Her new job at HometownQuotes pays $10 to $15 an hour and has mostly entailed data entry. But even though she has parted ways with some friends because she is no longer in their social stratum, Ms. Arlt said she was glad she was no longer sitting at home, ''thinking, 'Who have I not heard from today?' ''
Her new paycheck covers her mortgage but not her other living expenses. Recently, she cashed out what was left of her retirement portfolio, about $17,000.
''It has been the hardest thing in my life,'' she said. ''It has been harder than my divorce from my husband. It has really been even worse than the death of my mother.''
Nearly all of those interviewed said they considered their situations temporary and planned to resume their careers where they left off once the economy improves. But there are people like John Eller, 51, of Lee's Summit, Mo., who offer a glimpse of how difficult it can be to bounce back.
Mr. Eller had been a senior director at Sprint, earning as much as $150,000 a year and overseeing 7,000 employees at 13 call centers, before being laid off in 2002 amid the economic contraction after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
A year later, he found another job, at roughly half the pay, managing a call center in New Jersey. After he lost that job two years later in a downsizing, Mr. Eller found himself out of work for another year before landing a contract position running two call centers in Kansas and Illinois, earning close to six figures.
But after that ended a year later, he was unable to find work for several months. In July 2007, he took what he thought would be a temporary job for $10 an hour as a baker in a grocery store. He was laid off again last October.
Mr. Eller quickly landed a new survival job, working as a supervisor on the overnight shift for a contractor processing immigration applications for the federal government at a salary of about $34,000 a year. But with eight children and a wife to support, Mr. Eller said he was still ''below poverty level.'' The family has not been able to make mortgage payments in five months and has been on the brink of foreclosure.
''I'm still scratching and clawing and trying to work my way back,'' he said.
In Mr. Cooper's case, relying on unemployment checks was never a serious consideration. The maximum benefit that jobless people can collect in Arizona is $240 a week, among the lowest in the country -- and much less than is required to cover the mortgage on the comfortable four-bedroom home in Glendale that he and his wife, Maggie Macias-Cooper, share.
Mrs. Macias-Cooper, who works as a personal trainer in a gym built in what used to be the couple's three-car garage, has seen her client base shrink to 10 from about 50 over the last year.
In addition to giving Mr. Cooper a job as a janitor, his friend agreed to pay for the couple's benefits through Cobra. Maintaining health care coverage was paramount for the family because Mrs. Macias-Cooper recently had breast cancer.
Some unemployed professionals said they decided not to seek even part-time work because it might interfere with their job searches. But Mr. Cooper rises every day at 4 a.m. and, after a time of prayer, devotes two hours to his job hunt on the computer. He prints out a detailed call list of prospective employers to take with him, squeezing in phone conversations during breaks throughout the day from his pickup truck, which he calls his ''office.''
''There were times I broke down,'' Mr. Cooper said. ''I broke down thinking, 'This is what I've become.' ''
But Mrs. Macias-Cooper, who admitted that she was initially embarrassed about her husband's new job, says she is now grateful.
''There is no shame,'' said Mrs. Macias-Cooper, who grew teary during an interview at their home. ''I am very proud of my husband that he will go to any lengths, do whatever it takes, to keep his family afloat, if it means mopping floors, cleaning urinals.''

HEADLINE: Chavez Has a Spat With an Industry

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) -- In a spat over prices, President Hugo Chavez on Saturday told the army to temporarily take control of all rice processing plants in Venezuela. 
It was his toughest move against industry since a referendum victory this month.
''I have ordered the immediate intervention in all those sectors of agro-industry, intervention by the revolutionary government,'' Mr. Chavez said during a speech to mark deadly riots over high prices in Venezuela 20 years ago.
Mr. Chavez accuses the companies of overcharging -- refusing to produce rice at prices set by the government.
In February Mr. Chavez won a referendum vote allowing him to run for re-election indefinitely. He often radicalizes his policies after electoral victories, and he has nationalized significant parts of the Venezuelan economy in recent years.
Among the possible targets of the move are factories owned by the American company Cargill.

HEADLINE: The Cost Of War

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
Strike up the John Philip Sousa and throw confetti from the windows. The troops will be coming home from Iraq, President Obama announced on Friday, and if the mood was not quite as giddy as it was during a few of those triumphant marches down Broadway, there was at least the hint of a similar hope that an end of the war could help set the stage for a new era of prosperity and opportunity.
President Obama's soaring speech on Friday announcing the drawdown and eventual pullout of troops from Iraq, framed by martial music and the cheering of an audience of Marines when he gave the timetable, could not help but be seen partly in an economic frame of reference: The war has cost an estimated $860 billion; Mr. Obama, as a candidate last year, repeatedly criticized such spending overseas during a downturn; and he had just unveiled his 10-year budget plan the day before.
The Iraq war has been criticized on many fronts, including whether it has really made the world safer for the United States. But with the economy in crisis, some of the sharpest doubts being expressed about it concern whether the money it siphoned from the Treasury helped set the terms for that crisis. 
At the same time, history suggests that anticipation of an end to the war might help lift the mood of consumers and investors whose fears now deepen the economic problem.
Perhaps that is why on Friday, it was more than tempting to dredge up old images of kisses in Times Square in 1945 or Germans tearing down the Berlin Wall -- and the long surges of prosperity that soon enough followed those euphoric moments, after the ends of World War II and the cold war.
But hold that parade. There are serious and possibly crippling problems with the idea that ending this war could help the cause of prosperity in any clear way. The first and most troublesome is that the continuing cost of the war is exquisitely sensitive to the precise number of troops in theater at a given time, and President Obama has said that he will remain attuned to the notoriously changeable conditions in Iraq as he carries out his plan.
Savings in Iraq will also be dampened by Afghanistan, where the plan calls for a more modest troop increase, but where the primitive transportation system can make logistics more expensive. Even if many of the Iraq war's costs simply vanished, analysts say those savings would be too small and come too late to jolt the economy out of the crisis, though they could reduce the deficit long term, allowing a recovery to take firmer hold.
''There are a lot of red flags, basically,'' said Ryan Alexander, president of the nonpartisan group Taxpayers for Common Sense, who like hundreds of other budget experts in Washington was sifting through the administration's figures late last week. ''Even in the context of the art of budgeting,'' Ms. Alexander said dryly, ''we have concerns that this is overoptimistic.''
The president's defense budget does seem to get high marks across the political spectrum for its transparency in accounting for the true cost of the war; President Bush was often criticized for tucking war expenses into various line items that were hard to add up consistently. As Bob Work, a vice president at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, put it, ''People can say this budget is wrong, but it is very upfront.''
The cost of overseas conflicts, mainly in Iraq and Afghanistan, follows a fairly simple progression in the president's budget plan: $144 billion in fiscal year 2009, $130 billion in 2010, and -- in what the administration concedes are ''placeholder estimates'' -- of $50 billion for 2011 and beyond.
Even though Mr. Obama pledged in his speech to end all combat operations in Iraq by August 2010 and have all American troops out by the end of 2011, the fairly modest dropoff in cost in the first two years is unsurprising, said Winslow Wheeler of the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group often critical of military spending; after all, the United States will be carrying out a corresponding increase in Afghanistan.
Beyond that, Mr. Wheeler said, the neat projections may not work out if events cause the American military to undertake more operations than expected or to keep extra troops in Iraq. The budget estimates ''are a perfectly reasonable stab at it, but who knows?'' he said.
Studies by two research arms of Congress reveal how much the cost depends on the timing for withdrawal. In October, the Congressional Research Service estimated that in 2006 (the latest available figures), it cost $390,000 a year to sustain each American trooper overseas. Clearly, delaying withdrawals would quickly run the tab up.
That report was followed in January by one from the Congressional Budget Office estimating how much the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts would cost from 2010 through 2019 under two assumptions. In one, the number of troops deployed in the two countries draws down fairly quickly, to about 30,000 by 2011. In the other, levels drop to 75,000 by 2013. Both cases represent a huge reduction from the roughly 180,000 troops there now. But the difference in the cost is breathtaking: the office estimates that Congress would have to appropriate $388 billion for the case of a quick withdrawal and more than double, $867 billion, for the slower one.
Because of the huge range of possible costs, and because the logistics of withdrawal are complicated and expensive, ''the basic elements of that estimate are still unresolved,'' said John M. Spratt Jr., a South Carolina Democrat who is the House Budget Committee chairman and a House Armed Services Committee member.
''I have a sneaking suspicion that the near-term costs are going to outweigh the near-term savings,'' said Mr. Spratt, in remarks on Friday at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington.
Beyond all those numbers, the assertion that a war's end has had a direct economic effect in lifting the United States out of its fiscal doldrums in the past becomes weaker the more it is analyzed, said Robert Higgs, a senior fellow in political economy at the Independent Institute in Oakland, Calif., and the author of ''Depression, War and Cold War'' (2006). An economic blooming, Mr. Higgs said, often is due as much to an outburst of confidence and optimism with the end of hostilities as to any particular element of industrial or economic rearrangement.
For example, part of the revival after World War II, Mr. Higgs said, can be attributed to a change in the psychology of private investors; their distrust of New Deal policies began to melt as President Roosevelt drew on wealthy businessmen to run his war effort, and then President Truman signaled that he was warmer to free-market policies than the administration of the late 1930s had been.
''It's more complicated than the war got us out of the Depression, the way most people think it did,'' Mr. Higgs said.
Simple confidence was again a factor in the economic expansion in the decade after the end of the cold war, said Paul Poast, a political scientist and author of ''The Economics of War'' (2006). Technological contributions to the economy like the Internet, which was developed by cold war researchers, certainly helped the expansion, Mr. Poast said. But something less definable -- an overall sense that history had taken a turn for the better -- was at least as powerful, he said.
''When you take away the threat of nuclear annihilation that helps things,'' Mr. Poast said.
Which brings us back to that parade. President Obama may find it hard to keep the withdrawal to a prescribed timetable, and even if he can, the savings may be a drop in the bucket economically. But if he keeps the bands playing and strikes the right note in his speeches, he just may have a chance to persuade Americans that the end of a long war means better times are on the way.
History shows that if he persuades enough people, those times could actually happen. Send the marching band up Broadway.

HEADLINE: Ban on Spring Breakers? Not This Year.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
SPRING break is back. After years of shunning the traditional college crowd in favor of a more affluent, tamer clientele, hotels and resort destinations are once again rolling out the welcome mat for party-hearty students. 
 The Sheraton on Grand Bahama Island, which had stopped taking student groups for the last couple of years, is now working with StudentCity.com, an online student travel agency, and accepting student groups for four-night stays in March for the agency's Bahamas Party Cruise package priced at $589, including taxes and fees.
 The Pro Family Spring Break Coalition of Panama City Beach, Fla., which in 2007 put out a press release about its efforts to ''fight back against college spring break,'' has disbanded, though the businesses that made up the group still actively market to families. For the second year in a row the city has teamed up with mtvU, MTV's college network, with two weeks of live performances and undulating student crowds from March 8 to 21. 
 ''We've realized that we need to encourage college students to come but make sure we're not excluding families,'' said Dan Rowe, president of the Panama City Beach Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 Even Daytona Beach, Fla., which continues to market to families rather than students, acknowledged that their business would be welcome. ''We're going to try and hold out,'' said Tangela Boyd, a spokeswoman for the Daytona Beach Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''Of course,'' she quickly added, ''if students came we're not going to turn them away.''
 The change of heart is a significant reversal for many of these beach destinations, which have been trying to shed their wild-child past as spring break meccas by courting families and hipsters with a new message and upscale developments. But the tough economy is forcing tourism-dependent areas to come up with new ways to attract visitors. And as the luxury market slumps, corporations cancel conventions and families tighten wallets, student travel is showing a certain resilience. 
 ''The student market is always going to be there,'' said Jacqueline Lewis, managing director of StudentCity.com, which reports ''robust'' bookings for spring break this year. After working hard at school and saving up, she said, ''kids are going to go away.'' 
 This year, many are opting for shorter trips -- five nights instead of seven -- or weeklong trips departing on off-peak travel dates, like Mondays, to keep the trip affordable, she said. Traditional spring break locales like the Bahamas, Florida, and South Padre Island, Tex., had been leading the list toward the end of last year, when early bookers were facing pricey flights. But more recently, destinations like Jamaica, Cancun and the Dominican Republic are getting a boost as flight and hotel costs drop. 
 Fares for spring break travel from now through April 5 are down more than 15 percent compared with 2008, reaching roughly the 2007 level, according to Farecast.com, which tracks airfares. Nationally, the average airfare for a spring break trip -- departing on a Saturday and returning on a Sunday -- is $308, down $60 from last year. Average rates at upscale hotels in popular domestic locations are also down, to about $202 a night, or roughly 15 percent less than last year's prices. 
 For the college crowd willing to bunk four or more to a room, the savings can be even greater. STA Travel, which caters to students, is offering seven-night hotel deals as low as $199 a person with four people to a room in South Padre Island and three-night packages from Chicago to South Beach from $301 a person, based on double occupancy. 
 Travelers who want to avoid the spring break crowd might consider Acapulco, which has dropped off the party circuit this year. Bookings are down about 20 percent from last year's, partly because of relatively high flight costs, according to StudentCity.com. By contrast, bookings are up about 10 percent to Cancun and 20 percent to Jamaica.
 An influx of students could help struggling tourism regions like Florida, where annual visitor numbers dropped for the first time in seven years to about 82.5 million in 2008, 2.3 percent less than 2007, according to Visit Florida, the state's tourism marketing company. Student bookings to Panama City Beach are up by more than 20 percent, according to StudentCity.com. 
 BUT even if they are courting the college crowd, few hotels and resort destinations are eager to promote that fact. When contacted for comment on the new partnership with StudentCity.com, a spokesman for Sheraton Grand Bahama Island Our Lucaya responded in an e-mail message, ''We do not provide comments to media as per company policy, even positive news.'' And Fort Lauderdale, which has moved away from its past as the spring break capital, with luxury hotels edging out wet-T-shirt concert venues, is sticking to its new slogan of ''beach chic'' and promoting itself mostly to couples and families with young children. ''It is no longer the kind of place that college spring break activities really fits,'' said Nicki Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''We spent the past 20 years rebuilding, reinventing, recreating. We're not interested in looking back.''
 Countering the local government's strategy, however, is a small but growing contingent in the beach community working to keep spring break alive. Don C. Meyer, a marketing consultant for local businesses, has railed against Fort Lauderdale's move to stifle spring break. Starting in October in each of the past several years, he has sent e-mail messages and faxes to more than 300 college and university newspapers each week to encourage students to come back to Fort Lauderdale. He compiles a list of spring break accommodations, restaurants and resources on his Web site, www.springbreakftlauderdale.com, and offers a spring break hotline for students. This year he expects even more businesses to quietly open their doors to the student crowd. ''They don't like to say it,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''but now, they'll be happy to take anything.'' 
 In Panama City Beach, family-oriented establishments echoed that statement. ''It's not my niche,'' said Mike Bennett, a partner in the Towne of Seahaven, a resort development with more than 500 vacation rentals that caters to families, ''but as a business owner that thrives during spring break, in this economy especially, you want to welcome every person.''

 Re ''The Dangers of Cap and Trade'' (Everybody's Business, Feb. 22), in which Ben Stein favored a carbon tax over a cap-and-trade system: 
 The trouble with levying a tax is that we are then dependent on the government to continue that tax over the years and adjust it according to the need to trim emissions in the real world. The beauty of cap-and-trade is this: once the acceptable cap has been decided, all the government has to do is certify yearly the measurements of carbon emissions, compare them with the cap, and issue the carbon credits. The market will do the rest.
 The entire world needs to get on board with such a system. It is a more robust solution to our greenhouse gas problem than a tax levied by sometimes fickle governments. 
 Stephen Eittreim
 Palo Alto, Calif., Feb. 23
 To the Editor:
 Ben Stein's smart suggestion of a carbon tax would work if America provided its communities with decent mass transit.
 Last year, we saw how demand for bus and rail service soared in response to sky-high gasoline prices. Installing new rail tracks would take years, but by building new buses -- whether electric or hybrid versions or others that run on compressed natural gas -- we could quickly provide jobs for an army of unemployed auto workers. And others who are now unemployed could drive and maintain these vehicles.
 Wouldn't subsidizing such a program make more sense than throwing billions of dollars at automakers to build cars no one will buy?

HEADLINE: A Slowdown That May Slow Us Down

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: Atlanta 

 BODY:
-- Recessions have a way of upending the established order of things. For decades, Americans have worked longer hours, with fewer vacations, than people in most other industrialized countries. Now, suddenly, those who have managed to avoid unemployment are being asked to work less. 
 Among employers trying to stave off layoffs, ''furlough'' is the buzzword. State and local governments, universities, architectural firms and concrete factories are begging workers, or in many cases forcing them, to take unpaid time off. President Obama has praised ''the selflessness of workers who would rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job.'' In California, 235,000 state workers are taking off two days a month. In Atlanta, City Hall is now closed on Fridays. In January, 6.9 million Americans were working part time ''because of slack work or business conditions,'' more than double the number two years before, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
 Yet if these times were less freighted with economic anxiety, might not many workers starved for personal time jump at the deal Atlanta's nearly 5,000 employees have been given? They work one hour longer Monday through Thursday, and then they get a three-day weekend, reducing their work time, and pay, by 10 percent. Time is, after all, a form of wealth -- but this country of workaholics accustomed to unbridled consumption has generally chosen money over time. Furloughs might work as a kind of recalibration -- a market correction, if you will -- of that age-old imbalance. Those who can afford them might actually come to like them. 
 Of course, for those already struggling to get by, furloughs can be a rude shock, pushing workers to look for a second job when jobs are scarce. 
 In New York's Suffolk County, only 115 of 10,500 employees availed themselves of a voluntary furlough program in the first half of 2008 -- enough to pay for five jobs, said Steve Levy, the county executive. 
 Any acquired taste for such ''free'' time may not last when the economy picks up again, but there's always a chance. Duriya Farooqui, the director of performance management for the City of Atlanta, said the arrangement was one that she herself had sought in her job hunt. ''I suspect that there's a whole cohort of working parents that would opt for this scenario even in a completely balanced and functioning economy,'' said Ms. Farooqui, part of a two-income family with two small children.
 John de Graaf, the executive director of Take Back Your Time, an organization based in Seattle that advocates reducing overwork and ''time famine,'' says he hopes shortened hours will stick. ''It may not ultimately be a sacrifice,'' he said. ''It may be exactly what they need to do to be happier and healthier.'' He said he would prefer an increase in paid vacation and parental leave, of course, but to his thinking, involuntary pay cuts are a good solution to shrinking budgets if they save jobs. 
 Setting aside, for a moment, acute financial worries, furloughs might also help answer larger questions underlying the economic crisis: What will America look like when it is over? Will we resume being a nation of spenders instead of savers? Will we be content with smaller houses and fewer things? Weren't we working too much, anyway? 
 ''Hopefully something about this recession might help us to begin to think about what the important things in life are,'' Mr. de Graaf said. 
 Already some workers have reacted to the furloughs with more stoicism than bitterness. 
 While a single mother in Sacramento complained that the state furloughs would force her to give up smoking, her only luxury, furloughed employees around the country have said that they see small sacrifices as necessary to prevent larger ones. Another California employee was using the time off to watch her daughter ride horseback.
 There is a counterargument, though. Critics who support the idea of shorter workweeks in theory say a recession is not the time to force them on workers. Stagnant wages, said Thea Lee, policy director for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., have already made time off unaffordable. ''Normally you would expect that as society gets wealthier, their wages rise; and as their wages rise, people work less,'' Ms. Lee said. ''Since we've ruptured that connection between wages and productivity growth, people have no choice but to work more to maintain their standard of living, and even that hasn't been enough.'' 
 In an ideal world, said Juliet Schor, an economist at Boston College and the author of books on labor, leisure and consumerism, shorter working hours would be voluntary, and workers would be compensated for any increased productivity. But even forced furloughs could provide more time for family, community, learning and volunteering, unless people must scramble to fill the time with a second job. Smaller paychecks, she said, would ''dampen down the competitive consumption that's associated with the high-hours economy,'' leading to a sustainable way of life. 
 Employers, too, may find collateral benefits to furloughs. Studies show that reducing work hours can increase productivity per hour. Atlanta has recorded fewer sick days, and work crews have saved time because they set up and break down four times a week instead of five, said David Edwards, a policy adviser to Mayor Shirley Franklin.
 Such results have precedents. During the Great Depression, Kellogg's instituted a 30-hour workweek that was so popular vestiges of it lasted until the mid-1980s. Within two years, productivity had reached 40-hour levels, said Benjamin Hunnicutt, a professor of leisure studies at the University of Iowa and the author of ''Kellogg's Six-Hour Day.'' Morale improved, and 85 percent of workers liked the change despite the lower pay, he said.
 Other studies have shown that vacation, leisure time and shorter hours reduce stress and physical ailments like heart disease -- though those ills can pile up again if you can't pay the mortgage or the car mechanic.
 Given the potential benefits in productivity and morale, why don't American companies embrace shorter hours? One major reason is health care, a per-worker expense, said William A. Niskanen, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. ''So much of the compensation these days is health care, and that's independent of how long you work, so the cost per hour goes up.'' 
 Another reason may be cultural. ''In the 19th century, leisure was seen to be the place where we would realize our humanity, where we would come into our own,'' Professor Hunnicutt said. ''Now, leisure is suspect. It becomes suspect after the Great Depression, after the Second World War,'' as companies positioned work, not family, as the center of life. Shorter workweeks, he added, were viewed as feminine, and extra leisure time was viewed as a woman's domain. ''I found a strong gender bias in Battle Creek,'' he said of the town in Michigan where Kellogg's is headquartered. ''Men began to identify strongly with 'full-time' work -- this is what real men do, and if you don't center your life on the job, you can't lay claim to your masculinity. Women held on to an older concept of organized labor, that work was a means to an end.''
 Unions and liberal economists have often focused their efforts on paid, not unpaid time off, to bring the United States in line with other Western countries. To that end, Dean Baker, the co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, has proposed a stimulus measure that would give companies two years of tax credits for offering more vacation, sick leave, maternity leave or personal time, of up to 10 percent of their normal work year, or $2,500. 
 Without such incentives, however, workers are still torn between wanting their pay and liking their time, said Gayla Dodson, another Atlanta employee, who manages solid-waste crews. ''It's sad and it's hard,'' she said, ''but in another sense it's bringing people together. My family, we spend more time together, my friends, we spend more time together.'' Without money for nightclubs or dinners out, she said, ''you can't be as busy because you don't have as much luxury.''

HEADLINE: Previous Singing Experience Limited to the Shower? Here, Not a Problem

BYLINE: By LILY KOPPEL

 BODY:
A director would be hard pressed to assemble a more eclectic cast of New Yorkers than those warming up their voices around the grand piano at Nola Studios on West 54th Street near Broadway. A ''Chorus Line'' revival? Tryouts for ''American Idol''? Not quite.
 They have gathered together from the five boroughs and paid $485 for a workshop to become the stars they always dreamed of being and to discover the Ethel Merman within. 
 After four nighttime rehearsals, 15 stars were born. Well, that's a stretch, but nevertheless, some of them had never sung a note outside a shower curtain, and now they found themselves performing the other night at the Triad on West 72nd Street. They entered the stage and warmed to the spotlight, easing into their numbers with breezy patter.
 It is easy to imagine the lyrical names of the cast spelled out in bright lights: Kara Blossom, Iris Lasson, Laura Slutsky. When they sang ''Let's Do It'' by Cole Porter, their opening ensemble number, one woman mimed a pagoda over her coiffed red hair to the line ''Folks in Siam do it.'' 
 ''It's time to get your act together,'' encourages Linda Amiel Burns, the director of the workshop, which, she says, teaches ''everything you need to be a well-rounded, confident performer on the stage and in life.'' The workshop, which Ms. Burns calls the Singing Experience, culminates with a live performance at the Triad, and the most recent show was titled ''Let's Fall in Love.'' 
 In the face of economic forecasts of doom and gloom, Ms. Burns, who is also the president of the New York Sheet Music Society, maintains that singing, with all the breathing and letting go of ''baggage,'' ''relieves depression.'' She calls her classes the ''chutzpah'' workshop. 
 It has overtones of ''Waiting for Guffman,'' a 1996 film that parodies a small-town theater production. Each workshop participant chooses a song to sing at the end. 
 ''The important thing is to pick a song that you have a personal connection to,'' said Ms. Burns, who began the workshop 32 years ago after a divorce left her with two children to support. 
 ''You sing out anger, love, your problems,'' she said. ''People often come when they are in crisis, when they have lost their jobs or are ready for a change.'' Looking around during a rehearsal, she reminded her students: ''You picked the song because it means something about your life. You are really expressing who you are.'' 
 When show time arrived, the cast huddled together in a backstage dressing room the size of an ocean liner cabin. The heat was going full blast as they put finishing touches on their makeup and costumes. Friends and family showered the performers with flowers and sent messages backstage (''May I be your Stage-Door Johnny?'').
 Introduced to the audience as the Blonde Venus, Carol Shedlin, a retired book buyer for a Canadian bookstore chain who was born during the Depression, said she was fulfilling a lifelong dream of being a cabaret singer. She once wrote a poem about how she lived her ''life in black in white and in a minor key'' until she hit the hot spot of the spotlight. (''I was conceived, my mother said, while Gershwin played above their bed,'' she wrote.)
 The cast members are especially supportive of one another. ''I love to see a young talented person sing old songs -- it's so refreshing,'' Ms. Shedlin told Shannon Kerner, 28, who is Ms. Burns's daughter-in-law and part of a Brooklyn band called Shanimal, and who was taking the workshop to expand her repertoire. Others in the group compared Ms. Kerner, who sang ''I Can't Give You Anything but Love,'' to Janis Joplin. 
 Before each singer belts out a number, another cast member delivers what Ms. Burns calls the ''fantasy intro,'' like, ''this next performer just finished the Vegas circuit'' or ''she was a star of Folies Bergere.'' 
 Bill Dyszel, 54, who really did sing with the New York City Opera for 14 years (and now writes computer books for the Dummies series), warmed up the audience with a joke: ''Knock Knock.'' ''Who's there?'' ''Sam and Janet!'' ''Sam and Janet who?'' ''Sam and Janet evening, you will meet a stranger ...'' as he launched into the song from ''South Pacific.''
 Ivan Farkas, 66, a computer programmer, has taken Ms. Burns's workshop 117 times over the past 18 years. ''I was a different person,'' he said of his life ''before.'' ''I called up Linda, and said: 'I want to be on the stage, but I have problems. I'm shy, I'm falling apart, I'm not a spring chicken anymore, and nobody pays attention to me.' '' 
 He sang ''Mr. Cellophane'' from ''Chicago'' and unzipped his jacket to reveal a spangled tuxedo with sequins spelling out ''Ivan Le Terrible'' on the back. He spun around on rhinestone-studded four-inch platform shoes and hammed it up with a tongue-in-cheek ''Razzle Dazzle,'' another song from the musical. The audience erupted in cheers. 
 Phil Georges, 45, who spends his days stocking the shelves at a Costco in Long Island City, Queens, did his best to channel his inner Elton John as he sang ''Something About the Way You Look Tonight.''

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: Tumbling Dice

BYLINE: By MARCELLE CHAUVET and KEVIN A. HASSETT

 BODY:
RECESSIONS end, and this one will, too. But the sad truth is, the probability of leaving a recession once you are in one is about the same each month -- about 8 percent. It is as if God rolls two dice each month, and the recession ends when he rolls a 10. 
 We are without question in a deep recession. According to a model developed by one of us that draws on past recession experience and has proved quite useful, the chance that we will be in recession in March is 92 percent, in April 85 percent, and so on. 
 Many of the key indicators look similar to what we've seen before. The decline in employment is above average for past recessions, but smaller than in the downturns of 1960-61 and 1981-82. Industrial production and manufacturing and trade sales have also slowed more than average, but not nearly as much as during the 1973-75 recession, when they declined by 14 percent. And the drop in personal income has been below the average of previous recessions, and even trended up in the last quarter of 2008. So the history books give us cause for hope.
 The good news is that the odds of this recession lasting into the fourth quarter of 2009 are below 50 percent. But the dice will be thrown each month, and we could get lucky and be out earlier -- or unlucky and be stuck in the doldrums. 
 -- MARCELLE CHAUVET, an associate professor of economics at the University of California at Riverside, and KEVIN A. HASSETT, the director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute

BYLINE: By ELSA DIXLER

 BODY:
A PERSON OF INTEREST, by Susan Choi. (Penguin, $15.) Like Choi's ''American Woman,'' a Pulitzer finalist in 2004, this beautifully written novel is loosely based on events -- this time, the case of Wen Ho Lee, who was accused in 1999 of stealing secrets from Los Alamos National Laboratory. Choi's protagonist, known only as Lee, is a colleague of a computer science professor who is killed by a mail bomb. Lee, a stiff, cranky alcoholic, isolated in the aftermath of a disastrous second marriage, gradually becomes a ''person of interest'' in the murder investigation. Lee ''reflects on his life at a level of depth we might expect to find in one of George Eliot's vicarages,'' our reviewer, Francine Prose, said. 
 SWIMMING IN A SEA OF DEATH: A Son's Memoir, by David Rieff. (Simon & Schuster, $14.) When Susan Sontag, who had twice survived cancer, received a diagnosis of an untreatable form of leukemia, she was convinced she could beat it again, undergoing a bone marrow transplant that predictably failed. In this intelligent, tasteful yet disordered memoir, her son, David Rieff, wrestled with a terrible dilemma, as described in the Book Review by Katie Roiphe: ''Should he act according to what he felt his mother wanted . . . nurturing false hopes and offering comforting lies? Or should he follow the dictates of her rigorous . . . work, and tell her the truth?'' 
 THE SILVER SWAN, by Benjamin Black. (Picador, $14.) ''Crime fiction is a good way of addressing the question of evil,'' John Banville believes, and that is what he does in this elegantly written sequel to the elegantly written ''Christine Falls.'' Like its predecessor, ''The Silver Swan'' bears Banville's pen name, Benjamin Black. It, too, is set in a dark, repressive 1950s Dublin, and its protagonist is still Quirke, a brooding, ethical pathologist. 
 THE AGE OF AMERICAN UNREASON, by Susan Jacoby. (Vintage, $15.95.) Analyzing the ''ignorance, anti-rationalism and anti-intellectualism'' of modern American culture, Jacoby rounds up suspects usual (television, video games and the Internet on the one hand, fundamentalism on the other) and unusual (the New Left's attack on universities in the 1960s). Interestingly, she also singles out local control of schools and the lack of national educational standards. 
 THE TEN-CENT PLAGUE: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America, by David Hajdu. (Picador, $16.) The '50s were a ''bad time to be weird,'' one artist said, and what Hajdu calls the great comic-book scare was one proof. Fears of juvenile delinquency and licentiousness culminated in censorship boards, arrests of newsdealers and Senate hearings. Hajdu writes about the men and women who wrote and drew the comic books with affection and concern for the many careers that were destroyed. 
 THE FLOWERS, by Dagoberto Gilb. (Grove, $14.) In this verbally inventive novel -- narrated in run-on sentences, Spanish phrases and street slang -- Gilb's Holden Caulfieldesque protagonist, growing up in Los Angeles at the time of the 1992 riots, learns ''how to be a man.'' 
 A FAREWELL TO ALMS: A Brief Economic History of the World, by Gregory Clark. (Princeton University, $18.95.) Why do some societies and not others have a culture that promotes economic growth? Clark, an economic historian, argues that the answer is the ''survival of the richest.'' Examining births, deaths, income and wealth in England between 1250 and 1800, he finds that richer people married earlier and had more children than poorer people, so that the qualities that had allowed these people to succeed -- frugality, a capacity for hard work -- increased within the population. 
 THE RED LEATHER DIARY: Reclaiming a Life Through the Pages of a Lost Journal, by Lily Koppel. (Harper Perennial, $14.99.) This 75-year-old diary, which Koppel found wrapped in a Zabar's bag in the basement of her building, was written by a teenage resident in the 1930s. It offers a glimpse of a bygone era in Manhattan -- all the lovelier because Koppel was able to track down the writer, now a glamorous-looking Connecticut resident in her 90s. 
 GARDENS OF WATER, by Alan Drew. (Random House, $14.) Drew's first novel records the shocks that reverberate through the lives of two families, one Turkish, one American, living in Istanbul in the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake. 
 THE THING ABOUT LIFE IS THAT ONE DAY YOU'LL BE DEAD, by David Shields. (Vintage, $14.95.) ''He's strong and he's weak and I love him and I hate him and I want him to live forever and I want him to die tomorrow,'' Shields writes about his vital, interesting, maddening 97-year-old father in this meditation on mortality. 
 THE MEANING OF SUNGLASSES: And a Guide to Almost All Things Fashionable, by Hadley Freeman. (Penguin, $15.) This ''uproarious dictionary of style (or what passes for it),'' as Liesl Schillinger described it in The Times, ''gives refreshing proof that 'fashion sense' does not have to be an oxymoron.''

LENGTH: 1430 words

HEADLINE: Northern Zone, South-of-the-Border Flavor

BYLINE: By GREGORY BEYER

 BODY:
APARTMENT shoppers often react reflexively to the mention of the name Inwood: too far away, they say. 
 That was the initial reaction of Constance Parten and her partner, Merryn Johns, when a friend mentioned the area to them last year. Ms. Parten, a native Texan who works as a producer for CNBC.com, and Ms. Johns, the editor of LOTL, an Australian magazine geared toward lesbians, were renting at 96th Street and Lexington Avenue. 
 But further investigation revealed that Inwood would satisfy their desire for both a Manhattan home and a connection to the outdoors. Inwood lays claim to some of the borough's only remaining natural forest and salt marsh. 
 ''You feel a sense of history that you don't necessarily find elsewhere in Manhattan,'' said Ms. Parten, 40. 
 Last July, she and Ms. Johns, 43, closed on a one-bedroom one-bath co-op in Park Terrace Gardens, a five-building complex with a roof deck, private gardens and free Internet access. They paid several thousand less than the $350,000 list price. 
 Their apartment is about three blocks from the No. 1 train, and the same distance in the other direction to the 196-acre Inwood Hill Park. Ms. Parten says she can hear crickets chirping in the summer, and she has not yet been woken by a siren. 
 Still, Inwood has its noisier pockets. One stretch in particular, along Dyckman Street close to the Hudson River, is a popular destination for people to relax and blast music from their cars, said Ebenezer Smith, the district manager of Community Board 12. Complaints last summer led the police to increase their attention to the area, he said.
 Hispanic residents make up 74 percent of Inwood's people, according to census data; the area is known for its Dominican enclave. Puerto Ricans, Mexicans, and natives and descendants of other countries also contribute to a Latin culture that is everywhere in evidence, from the music playing in food stores to the plantains, queso blanco and other products on their shelves. 
 ''Dominicans are good people,'' said Raul Martinez, who was born in the Bronx but is of Puerto Rican descent. A former corrections officer who is unemployed, Mr. Martinez, 54, followed his daughter and her Dominican husband here after they chose it as the place to raise their family. ''We all get along,'' he said. ''I spend my time enjoying the people, hanging out with them.''
 Though there were those who demurred, a number of residents described the neighborhood as a hidden gem -- as if an area with more than 41,000 residents could be kept secret.
 Rob Kleinbardt, a broker for New Heights Realty and a longtime Inwood resident, summed it up this way: ''As more and more people have come up here, it's always somewhat amusing to me that people say that Inwood is being 'discovered.' I've been hearing that since 1980. It's always being discovered by a new crop of people.''
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND 
 Inwood, the northernmost neighborhood on the island of Manhattan, is bordered by Washington Heights to the south at Dyckman Street, the Hudson River to the west, and the Harlem River to the north and east. 
 From the sidewalk, it is possible to look up and down long avenues lined with six-story buildings of variously colored brick facades, some dating to the Art Deco period. 
 One recent afternoon, four middle-aged men stood on the sidewalk on Post Avenue, a residential stretch east of Broadway, trying to best one another at tossing quarters as close as possible to a certain line in the concrete. Julio Aponte, a retired plumber, who lives around the corner, looked on. ''We pass the time doing whatever,'' he said, approvingly, as several people passed him and called out, ''Julio!''
 Although there are a few condominiums, most properties for sale are co-ops. There are also a few free-standing houses along Park Terrace West and 217th Street. The vast majority of residents -- 94 percent -- rent their homes, according to census data. 
 The Dyckman Houses, a City Housing Authority development with seven 14-story buildings, is bounded by Dyckman Avenue, 204th Street, Nagle Avenue and 10th Avenue.
 Dominican restaurants, bodegas and beauty parlors line 10th Avenue beneath the green elevated rails of the No. 1 train, as well as the main commercial stretches of Broadway, 207th Street and Dyckman Street, where they mingle with banks and clothing stores. 
 Mr. Smith estimated that on weekends half of the people who browse these businesses come from other neighborhoods, seeking Inwood's distinctive Dominican flavor.
 The Dominican presence is concentrated east of Broadway, Mr. Smith said, but the more affluent area to the west is also home to many Irish, Inwood's once dominant demographic. 
 In contrast to the greenery of Inwood's western section, its eastern waterfront is more industrial. A huge yellow-brick building on Ninth Avenue at 215th Street, once an incinerator, is a garage for city garbage trucks and street sweepers. A block north, city buses retire to the Kingsbridge Bus Depot.
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY 
 The rental market is propitious for tenants right now; similarly, in co-op buildings, prices have dropped and the pace of sales has slowed. 
 One-bedrooms range from about $290,000 to $330,000. Two-bedrooms are priced from about $350,000 into the $400,000s. Apartments with special features, Mr. Kleinbardt said, like a new kitchen, might not stay on the market long. ''But the small one-bedroom in the back of the building with no view, which might have sold quickly a few years ago, is sitting a little longer and selling for less than it would have a year ago.''
 Apartments tend to remain on the market for three to six months, a month or so longer than they would have last year, brokers say. 
 Rentals are more plentiful east of Broadway. Andrew Shell, the owner of the A .N. Shell Realty Group, said, ''Right now some of them are offering you not one but two months' free rent.'' One-bedroom rentals near Inwood Hill Park start around $1,100, two-bedrooms around $1,500, Mr. Shell said, adding that east of Broadway, rents generally decrease about 25 percent. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 Elementary schools include Public School 98 Shorac Kappock, on West 212th Street near 10th Avenue, for prekindergarten through Grade 4. It enrolls 618 students, 97 percent Hispanic. Last year, 45 percent of fourth-graders met state standards in English and 74 percent in math, versus 61 and 80 citywide.
 Among area middle schools is Junior High School 52 Inwood, on Academy Street near Broadway, for Grades 5 through 8. Last year, 32 percent of eighth-graders met state standards in English and 45 percent in math, versus 43 and 60 citywide.
 Many older students attend Gregorio Luperon High School for Science and Mathematics, on 165th Street at Amsterdam Avenue. Its student body is mostly Hispanic; it is geared toward recent arrivals in the United States. SAT averages last year were 326 in reading, 349 in math and 307 in writing, versus 438, 460, and 433 citywide.
 WHAT TO DO 
 Inwood's western portion is occupied by the vast Inwood Hill Park. In addition to athletic fields and playgrounds, it has kayak and canoe launch sites along the Hudson River and early morning ''watches'' for bald eagles. The nearby Inwood Canoe Club has a free kayaking program on Sundays in the summer. And each summer the Inwood Shakespeare Festival is held in the park.
 The much smaller Isham Park sits adjacent to Inwood Hill Park atop a steep hill. Offering green space and long views down the avenues, it was in the 19th century the home of William B. Isham, a leather merchant. 
 Restaurants have sprung up in the last two or three years near Inwood HillPark, like the Park Terrace Bistro, on Broadway near Isham Street, and the Indian Road Cafe and Market, at 218th Street, which has weekly live music, trivia night and a knitting group.
 A restaurant row seems to be developing on Dyckman between Seaman and Payson Avenues. An increasingly lively stretch, it has generated noise complaints from residents.
 THE COMMUTE 
 The A train stops at Dyckman and 207th Streets, for a 30-minute trip to 42nd Street, and the elevated No. 1 train stops at Dyckman Street and Nagle Avenue, and 207th and 215th Streets at 10th Avenue. The 100, 7, and 20 buses travel along Broadway, and the 12 runs along Isham and 207th Streets.
 THE HISTORY 
 Inwood Hill Park is one of several sites historically associated with Peter Minuit's purchase of Manhattan from the Lenape Indians. While Inwood is the northernmost area on Manhattan Island, the northernmost in the borough itself is Marble Hill.

HEADLINE: Boomers in a Post-Boom Economy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: Generationb@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TORY JOHNSON, the owner of Women for Hire, has been running job fairs in 10 of America's largest cities for the last decade, and during that time she has never had more than 2,000 people come to the events. Last Tuesday, at a little after 3 p.m., after the last person had checked in at her latest job fair at the Sheraton Manhattan, she showed me the counter she uses to keep track of attendance: 5,103.
 ''Never,'' she said, shaking her head. ''Nothing ever like this before.'' Many of the women and men (she opened the event to men for the first time) had waited over two hours on the sidewalk in 20 degree temperature for the chance to mill through a ballroom, push to the front of a line at one of the 40 employer booths, hand a rep a resume, maybe get a minute of face time and collect a business card or two.
 ''Very humbling,'' said Pat Gericke, 61, of Manhattan who has had a successful interior design business for 20 years that suddenly went dead last fall. ''I never thought I'd be at one of these.'' 
 ''First job fair,'' said Joe Palmieri, 54, of East Hanover, N.J., an I.T. supervisor for Novartis pharmaceuticals for 29 years before being laid off recently. ''This is all new for me and my family. I have to keep a positive attitude, stand on my own two feet, otherwise you fall to the bottom.''
 Greg Kramer, 53, a buyer for Video USA for 15 years before being laid off Nov. 12, woke at 3 a.m. in suburban Massapequa, was on a 5 a.m. train, and at 7:25 was one of the first of the 650 who had paid $20 (the main job fair is free) to attend the early bird seminar, ''Coffee With Tory.'' ''I don't mind being here so early,'' he said from his fourth-row seat. ''I'm going through my notes to see who I want to meet with.''
 Nancy McCollum, 53, an I.T. supervisor laid off in October from an insurance firm, had driven from Hartford. Like many, she signed up for the early seminar because that would admit her with the first wave of 1,000 when the job fair started at 10. She was struck by all the people like her -- well-dressed, middle-aged white-collar workers, carrying briefcases with resumes and business cards. ''It could be discouraging,'' she said, ''but I have to remind myself, all I need is one job.''
 That's all a lot of boomers need these days. The unemployment rate for adults age 55 and older was 5.2 percent in January 2009, the highest since July 1992; 1.7 million adults 55 and older were unemployed, almost twice as many as in November 2007.
 When Ms. Johnson started organizing job fairs in 1999, the majority attending were recent college grads and a lot were looking for advice on how to climb the corporate ladder, ask for a raise, start a business. Now, she said, the majority are baby boomers or older and they just want to work again. She usually gets 1,000 to 1,500 at a fair. This time, she knew what she was in for when those who paid the $20 preregistration fee for the early seminar quadrupled from the usual 150. 
 Ms. Johnson, who is also a weekly contributor to ''Good Morning America,'' makes her main income from the employers who pay for booths. They're getting harder to find -- a few years ago, she had 60 at a fair. She said the 40 companies this time had 1,000 jobs to offer, including positions at New York University Medical Center, Thomson Reuters and Girl Scouts of the USA. How many of the companies actually had the good-paying full-time salaried jobs that many boomers had lost was hard to gauge. Insurance companies like Prudential and New York Life were mainly offering sales jobs paying commission; Enterprise rental car listed over 70 jobs, but most were summer internships.
 People knew this -- the information was posted on Ms. Johnson's Web site -- and still, they came. To get in, you had to wear business clothes and have a prepared resume. In eight hours, I saw just one person, a man in jeans, turned away.
 What surprised and moved me most, was the civility of those waiting. I'd come to write about this because of an image in my head: that black and white Depression photo of men in neckties waiting in an enormous line for a chance to work. I thought I'd see the 2009 version and did. Midmorning, the line started on Seventh Avenue at 53rd Street, ran east to Sixth Avenue, south to 52nd Street, then doubled back to the Sheraton at 53rd near Seventh. 
 Taxi drivers lowered their windows, asking what the line was for. Told a ''job fair,'' they rolled their eyes as if to say: Is this what we've come to? 
 A few fairgoers, like Jacqueline Chester, 45, gave up. ''It doesn't make sense to stand in line with thousands to be seen by a handful of people,'' she said after she'd spent a half hour waiting and was still a block away. ''I'm heading to another career fair on 32nd Street.''
 But most just waited, with patience and dignity, moving from sidewalk line, to lobby line, to second-floor registration line, to third-floor-almost-there line and finally to the promised land, the actual job fair, where crowds seven deep waited in front of the Kelly temporary services booth.
 Part of the credit for the orderliness goes to Ms. Johnson, who hired extra security and ran as efficient a job fair as one could for 5,103 people trying to access a ballroom with a capacity of 1,000. Even if most didn't get jobs, she offered useful services -- like free resume critiques by 26 experts at 13 tables.
 But it is mostly a tribute to the 5,103, and I don't know if that's generational -- all those middle-aged people who've learned self-control from decades in the workplace -- or the wealth of America, which still provides some buffer from public rage and despair; or a continued faith in our economic system and our country.
 Certainly, there is much to be miserable and angry about. First Joan Renaudo, 47, got breast cancer, and then, on Dec. 31, she lost her job as a hedge-fund comptroller. Carolyn Davis, an executive assistant at UBS for 13 years, was laid off in October. ''Finding a new job at 59?'' she said. ''I've had one 10-minute interview in Midtown, Jan. 10, that's it. I met with four recruiters three weeks ago and none had anything.''
 But Ms. Renaudo added: ''Getting over breast cancer taught me how to manage that feeling of helplessness. You're angry, you're anxious, you're afraid, but then you have a better day and it goes away.'' And Ms. Davis, who woke at 4 a.m. to catch a 6:20 express bus from Brooklyn, said, ''I came today because I hope it will give me hope.''
 Maria Hunsicker, (''No age, just say I'm a boomer,'') who was with a bank for 24 years before being laid off as a vice president, was waiting with three friends she met last fall at an outplacement center in Stamford, Conn. -- Sue Rahaim, 55, Mona Seid, (''No age'') and Max Mina, 54.
 They weren't complaining about the crowds. ''We went to one not long ago,'' Ms. Hunsicker said. ''The room was filled and people were out the door.''
 They weren't complaining about rising so early to wait so long. ''I felt like I was going to work again,'' said Ms. Mina, who was with XL Capital 20 years before being laid off in September. ''It gives you direction.''
 They weren't complaining about the cold. ''I'm just thankful it's not snowy and icy,'' Ms. Mina said.
 They just wanted what those men in neckties in that black and white photo from the 1930s wanted: jobs, decent jobs.

HEADLINE: Voter Sentiment Dips for Artificial Turf

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: LARCHMONT, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 THE celebration last October inaugurating Larchmont's first artificial turf athletic field, and the renovation of surrounding Flint Park, was the culmination of years of work by local politicians, athletic groups and individual volunteers.
 It also was a disappointment for some of the park's neighbors, who preferred the grass and trees that the turf field replaced, said Marnie Foster-Marks, representative to the Village Board for the Flint Park Neighborhood Association.
 The Alexander Alma field in Flint Park, which cost $750,000, was paid for with private donations and a county grant, so taxpayer approval was not needed. But in communities around the region, proposals for artificial turf fields have created tensions between athletic boosters and neighbors who oppose the fields, opposition that is generally based on their cost and possible health and environmental effects. 
 In the last year, when voters in the region have had the chance to weigh in on financing artificial turf, they have overwhelmingly said no. That is a turnaround from earlier years this decade, when hundreds of cities, towns and school districts around the region installed synthetic turf to replace grass fields. Artificial turf fields are more durable than grass fields, dry more quickly and require less maintenance.
 While health concerns involving lead from the turf are frequently raised, money is often the deciding issue, officials involved with the votes said.
 On Feb. 8, a $38 million school bond referendum for infrastructure repairs, including three artificial turf fields, failed in Mamaroneck, N.Y., by 80 votes out of 4,440. 
 ''The forces that came together were the bad economy, and the opposition to the synthetic turf put it over the top,'' said Linnet Tse, school board president for the Mamaroneck district. ''A number of people said it was just not the time, that it was not essential.'' The group that opposed the bond for environmental concerns was relatively small, she said.
 In December, voters in another part of Westchester County, Irvington, rejected their school district's $6 million field renovation bond proposal, which included an artificial turf field, 1,358 to 387. 
 ''I think the overwhelming reason that the bond issue for the fields did not pass was the overall economy combined with the very high tax burden in Irvington,'' said Tanya Hunt, president of the school board. ''But health issues did affect the vote.'' 
 Also in December, the Borough of New Providence, N.J., rejected a resolution for park improvements that included an artificial turf field.
 Earlier in 2008, the Pelham Union Free School District and the Hendrick Hudson School District, both in Westchester, passed bond issues for school infrastructure work, but simultaneous votes for artificial turf fields failed.
 While the economic downturn has soured taxpayers on paying for the fields, recent reports that the fields trap heat and leach lead have given voters other reasons to reject new fields, even though there has been no conclusive evidence to date of health problems.
 Last year more than a dozen artificial turf fields in New York and New Jersey were closed by schools because of high lead levels, above what the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers safe for soil, and state agencies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut began studies of the environmental and health effects of the turf. 
 Currently all three states permit the installation of artificial turf, and a federal commission endorses it. Artificial turf fields are made with a porous carpet of plastic grass-shaped blades on top of a cushioned playing surface that is usually made from pulverized recycled tires, called rubber crumb.
 After New Jersey officials discovered high lead levels at three fields last year, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a public health alert in June that certain types of old or weathered artificial turf fields contained high levels of lead; the alert noted concerns about lead exposure for children 6 and under. 
 The source of the lead was a pigment in the artificial blades of grass, New Jersey officials said. 
 ''We got a notice from the New Jersey Department of Education in April last year alerting us that there might be lead on our turf fields,'' said Jan A. Furman, superintendent of the Northern Valley Regional High School District in Bergen County. The district found high lead levels at its two high schools, in Demarest and in Old Tappan. The installer, FieldTurf Tarkett of Montreal, removed the fields in December and will replace them in the next few months.
 NORTHERN VALLEY wanted to stay with artificial turf because of its durability, Dr. Furman said. The school board was comfortable signing off on turf again because of a July report from the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission that said synthetic turf fields were safe to install and play on, Dr. Furman said.
 The replacement fields at Northern Valley will have a new, stiffer version of the artificial grass with rubber crumb infill.
 Rubber crumb infill has been a concern of environmentalists because dust from the infill, critics say, may release chemicals that could harm athletes. Infill will be tested, along with other components of artificial turf, in studies by the states of New York and Connecticut. 
 New products to replace rubber crumb infill are expected on the market soon, said Russell A. Davidson, president of K G & D architects and engineers in Mount Kisco, who advised Irvington on its turf proposal. Some manufacturers are testing rubber-coated sand and organic shell material, he said.
 In Westchester, the Katonah-Lewisboro district is considering installing artificial turf fields using a new form of infill material instead of rubber crumb. 
 Local lawmakers are also wrestling with health concerns raised about artificial turf. 
 Assemblyman John E. Rooney, Republican of Bergen County, N.J., cited health concerns when he introduced a bill last March calling for a moratorium on installing artificial turf that is still in the proposal stage. A similar bill in New York asking for a moratorium, sponsored by Assemblyman Steven C. Englebright, a Democrat from Long Island, was tabled last summer.
 In Connecticut, United States Representative Rosa L. DeLauro, a Democrat from New Haven, has asked the Environmental Protection Agency to study the health effects of artificial turf.
 While the debate continues, communities like Irvington are having difficulty coping with what officials say are inadequate fields. 
 Chronic drainage problems and overuse of the high school's two fields make finding practice time harder for the school's seven soccer and football teams. 
 ''We need to spend some money on the fields or we won't have anybody playing on them,'' said Ms. Hunt, the school board president. ''There are holes to be filled, we will have to do some reseeding, and the drainage systems have to be fixed. We might have to consider cutting back on some of our teams.''

HEADLINE: Buckling Under the Malaise of Detroit

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Westfield 

 BODY:
 TWO cars were left in the three-car showroom of Larry Friedman's Chevy dealership, and one of them wasn't for sale -- his baby-blue 1954 Bel Air with the dice hanging from the rearview mirror, a pristine memory of breezier times in the auto trade. The salesmen's desks sat empty, and a half-full box beside one held giveaway calendars advertising a business about to close for good after more than 80 years.
 The end came quickly here at New Norris Chevrolet, an echo in New Jersey of a collapse in Detroit. In December, Norris sold 12 cars, half its previous monthly average, and when the numbers weren't any better by the end of January, Mr. Friedman couldn't see a way to make them work anymore. He called his employees -- many of whom had been hired by his late father, Mitch -- into the showroom one morning a few weeks ago to tell them that Thursday, Feb. 26, would be the last day. 
 ''I choked up a little bit,'' said Mr. Friedman, 42, who started working at Norris as a boy and took over after his father's death in 2005. The license plate on his Bel Air looked ahead to his potential successors, ''3 Boys,'' referring to his sons. Two of them will wear Norris jerseys this season on a T-ball team he had already signed on to sponsor. ''Unfortunately, the plan was always to pass it on to the next generation one day, and have them work here.''
 Dealerships are known within the auto business as stores, and Mr. Friedman's Chevy store was among the smaller ones, a Main Street grocer by comparison with the wide-aisle supermarkets out on the highway. 
 As the end loomed, Norris's shelves were sagging under the weight of unsold goods, the one-acre lot parked tight with 60 of the thousands of vehicles that are crowding stores all over America and dragging down dealers who once ranked among the most visible merchants in their communities -- the faces on the cable TV ads, the names on the backs of youth-sports jerseys, the easy touches for every local charity.
 ''Since the beginning of the year, I've probably seen four or five dealers go out of business in exactly the same way,'' said Jim Appleton, president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automotive Retailers, whose membership has dropped from 650 to less than 600 in the last two years. ''And I expect we'll lose as much as another 10 percent this year.''
 Norris started selling Chevys in the 1920s at the busy corner of Central and North Avenues in this prosperous railroad suburb. The bright neon sign that crowned its Spanish-mission-style roof was a local landmark for decades, and the showroom held 11 vehicles, big enough to display just about every new model Chevy unveiled each year. Mitch Friedman had started in the business as a car salesman, and then worked for Ford: ''Closing down stores,'' his son said, liquidating the small dealerships that once dotted city neighborhoods, but that faded as the population shifted to the suburbs. He finally got a Ford dealership of his own, far from home in Queens, and then, with a partner, bought a Chevy store in South Orange. He and his partner bought Norris in 1981, and he soon put his son to work.
 ''I remember Larry coming in on his moped from high school and working in the parts department,'' said Rich Byers, an automotive technician who started in 1982 at Norris, a job that fit him so well he has driven 26 miles to it each workday from his home in Randolph. His spent about half of his last day in the six-lift garage on a 100,000-mile service job on a Chevy Suburban. ''Everybody here was brokenhearted. I've had three elderly women whose cars I've taken care of come in crying.''
 Mitch Friedman moved the store several blocks up North Avenue in 1994 to the site of a defunct Pontiac dealership, and leased the original location to a real estate business. Larry Friedman worked his way through every department after graduating from Upsala College in 1990. ''It was on a Friday, and my father said, 'Now that you've graduated I want to see what you can do -- go out on your own,' '' Mr. Friedman said. But one of Norris's service advisers had a stroke that weekend. ''So that Monday he said, 'It's over, get back to work.' ''
 Larry Friedman moved in 2001 from service to the sales floor, where he sometimes parked a vintage Chevy, like his Bel Air, that triggered warm recollections from customers about first cars, summer nights and the glory days of General Motors. Norris sold about 325 new cars, and 100 used, in a good year. But last year was not a good year: Gas prices spiked; interest rates on leases soared; credit dried up, for buyers and dealers both; uncertainty about G.M.'s future made buyers wary. And then Detroit started asking for more money: higher interest rates on the inventory dealers held; more charges on cars that sat unsold.
 ''The economics of the business changed overnight,'' said Jim Appleton, who has watched many New Jersey dealerships struggle to finance their operations. ''They're essentially collateral damage in the credit crunch.''
 Mr. Friedman's desk looks across the showroom floor and past his Bel Air toward a wall of photos he will soon have to box up and take home, among them one of his father shaking hands with Mickey Mantle at a benefit for the American Cancer Society. Most of the employees have found new jobs, but Mr. Friedman isn't sure yet where he'll land, although he expects to be selling cars somewhere, for someone else.
 ''I think he would have been realistic, and I think he would have done it a lot earlier,'' he said when considering what his father would have decided if faced with the same crunch. ''I've been coming here every single day for so long, it's going to be weird that first day that I don't have to come in to work.''
 A few customers continued drifting in through the last week, but Mr. Friedman had already decided what the last car he sold would be: a 2009 gray Impala, to his mother, a final piece of Norris that will linger in the family after the doors close, like the name on the backs of his sons' T-ball shirts. 
 ''I guess those will be antiques,'' he said of the shirts he will watch all spring long, the Norris name receding into the distance as his sons circle the bases.

HEADLINE: In a Historical House, an Auction of Lincoln Memorabilia

BYLINE: By NICOLE NEROULIAS

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
 THERE has never been a better time to be a Lincoln lover. Between his 200th birthday celebration a few weeks ago and the comparisons to America's current president, historians and collectors have their hands full keeping up with the booming interest in Abraham Lincoln.
 ''It's been a major year for Lincoln in terms of scholarship and collecting and exhibitions and television documentaries,'' said Harold Holzer, a Rye resident and co-chairman of the United States Lincoln Bicentennial Commission.Yet it is mere coincidence that Cohasco, an auction house in Yonkers dealing in Americana, had 19 lots of Lincolniana in its winter auction last week, said Robert Snyder, vice president of the company. By a further twist of fate, the company's building has ties to the Lincoln era: the basement was a prison for Confederate officers, and an office was rented by an aspiring Lincoln assassin, William H. Roberts, also known as Joseph Snevel, according to Mr. Snyder's continuing research. 
 ''It just worked out that way,'' Mr. Snyder said of the Lincoln collectibles auctioned off Wednesday, part of a catalog of more than 500 items ranging from the Colonial to World War II era.
 Of the Lincolniana, which included one of the last known photographs taken of the president at the White House, the most highly valued were three bronze lamps, originally lighted by whale oil, at $40,000 to $70,000 for all three. They had belonged to the family of his wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, and had illuminated the couple's wedding in 1842.
 Those lamps had sold for less than $2,500 in 1981, as part of Dorothy Meserve Kunhardt's estate. Through her father's lifelong research into the period and through her friendship with a descendant of Mary Todd Lincoln's family -- from whom she bought the lamps in 1957 -- Ms. Kunhardt amassed one of the greatest collections of Lincolniana in her lifetime, experts say.
 ''My grandmother kept the lamps on the mantle over the fireplace; they were part of the family mythology,'' said her grandson Philip B. Kunhardt III, an author and film producer who lives in northern Westchester. ''If I had lots of extra money, I would buy them back myself, because they have a lot of sentimental value.''
 He and his brother Peter, co-authors with Peter W. Kunhardt Jr. of ''Looking for Lincoln: The Making of an American Icon'' (Knopf, 2008), are moving the family's remaining collection of more than 50,000 photographs and documents to public display at the library at Purchase College this spring.
 These kinds of collections have contributed to the skyrocketing prices of Lincoln artifacts, because so few are available for sale anymore, said Wayne C. Temple, chief deputy director of the Illinois State Archives and author of eight books on Lincoln. ''Many of these things eventually get into a museum or a historical society, and then they're not up for auction,'' he said. ''It's rather rare when important artifacts are in private hands and do come up for sale.''
 One of the Cohasco auction items, a letter dated April 26, 1865, from the mayor of Springfield, Ill., calling for work to stop for the arrival of the president's body for burial -- valued at $7,500 to $10,000 -- is the subject of some of Mr. Temple's recent research.
 In contrast to Mr. Snyder's description of the letter as an order to stand by for the body's arrival, Mr. Temple interprets it as an order to stop preparations in Oak Ridge Cemetery because the city remained determined to bury him in a downtown monument instead, against his widow's wishes.
 ''The local people in Springfield had already erected a temporary tomb on the Mather property, which is now the site of our Capitol Building,'' said Mr. Temple, who recently finished an article about the conflict. ''The letter is saying, 'We're pretty sure we're going to win with Mary and she's going to relent and let us bury him on the Mather lot.' But Mary told them they would either bury him in Oak Ridge or she would take him back to Washington, D.C.''
 At the close of Cohasco's auction Wednesday night, the lamps sold for $30,250, the letter sold for $8,250 and the photograph -- valued at $110 to $135 -- sold for $1,320.
 If the economy were better, such artifacts would have sold for even more, said Daniel Weinberg, owner of the Abraham Lincoln Book Shop in Chicago, who has dealt in Lincolniana for almost 40 years.
 ''The interest is quite heavy, but we're not seeing a big wave of commercialism, because people can't afford to scratch that particular itch right now,'' he said. ''But over all, Lincolniana and other historical documents are still good long-term investments.''

THE CRAFTY CHICA
 Kathy Cano-Murillo -- better known to fans as the Crafty Chica -- has gradually expanded her audience for years, making objects with a glittery Latino aesthetic and offering instructions and tips to those who want to do the same. Her most recent venture is the creation of a line of branded craft supplies and packaged projects, and it is finding its way into mass retail. In a way, this is a natural transition: first, Martha Stewart told us what to do, then she sold the branded material we needed to do it. But this may be less a story of someone with a niche following going mainstream than an example of the evolution of the do-it-yourself business in general. 
 In 1990, Cano-Murillo and her husband, Patrick Murillo, began collaborating on paintings and other items, using what she calls a Mexican Pop Art style: bright colors, skulls, saints and campy-vintage imagery. While they had some success, they also had trouble turning it into a sustainable business, and Cano-Murillo, who lives in Phoenix, took a part-time job in the production department of The Arizona Republic newspaper. She became a news clerk and later an entertainment writer. She resisted an assignment to do an ''arts and crafts'' column for the paper until she discovered the Web site Getcrafty.com, where a new and more youthful version of the D.I.Y. idea was taking shape; that was 1999. By the following year she wasn't simply writing about the craft scene; she was part of it, starting her own CraftyChica.com site. 
 Cano-Murillo, who in conversation projects astonishing positivity, calls her entrepreneurial style ''enthusiastic desperation.'' This translates to a range of tactics to convert creativity into a business: selling handmade jewelry and various arty objects; publishing several how-to books (her latest, ''Crafty Chica's Guide to Artful Sewing,'' is just out); and even offering a Crafty Chica cruise-ship package. Her product line -- including Crafty Chica Glitter, Mojito Papers for use in scrapbooking or decoupage projects and the Love Shrine Workshop-in-a-Box -- first appeared on the shelves of Michaels, the big-box craft-supplies chain, and a variety of independent shops last year. But the aesthetic of Crafty Chica and of much of the Web craft generation seems in some ways an odd fit for traditional craft retail. Cano-Murillo recalls searching a trade show for examples of ''cool, Latino-centric'' craft products just a few years ago and finding nothing more than jalapeno stickers and the like. (''Ooh, ole,'' she says dryly.) But at the most recent Craft and Hobby Association convention and trade show in January, that decidedly mainstream organization made the ''indie craft'' movement a main focus, choosing Cano-Murillo as a success-story special guest on the subject. (Another featured guest was Jenny Hart, whose Sublime Stitching embroidery designs run more toward tattoo art than, say, floral patterns.) 
 Anecdotal reports have suggested that the business of crafting may not be suffering quite so much as the rest of the retail landscape in the current recession. But whatever the state of the economy, the Craft and Hobby Association is largely focused on expanding the sales of its mass-oriented member companies. (Alt-craft aside, the show also included a preview of craft products from, of all people, Paris Hilton.) And it's fair to say that some indie crafters are skeptical about the attention. CraftyPod, an influential blog and podcast, noted with exasperation that the material at the show described new-wave crafters in the context of ''the hippie generation.'' Cano-Murillo is perhaps uniquely situated to bridge this craft gap. She's widely known in the indie world and has built her own contact list of a few hundred indie stores. But last year she quit her newspaper job to work for Duncan Enterprises, maker of well-known craft products like Aleene's Original Tacky Glue, and that move made it possible to approach big chains like Michaels and Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft. (She still writes her syndicated craft column.)
 What Cano-Murillo seems to get is that if the mainstream D.I.Y. business considers the growing indie craft scene as a way to expand its market, then any given indie crafter can seize that attention to do the same thing. For her the point isn't to become another Martha Stewart -- it's more the opposite of that. ''Martha has always been an inspiration to me, in a weird way, because I cannot do her type of crafts, no matter how hard I try,'' Cano-Murillo says. ''So my thing has been embracing that I can't do it -- and celebrating my own style.'' And now, it happens, she can do so in a mainstream retail setting.

HEADLINE: With Force, Mexican Drug Cartels Get Their Way

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico 

 BODY:
Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz is supposed to be the one to hire and fire the police chief in this gritty border city that is at the center of Mexico's drug war. It turns out, though, that real life in Ciudad Juarez does not follow the municipal code.
 It was drug traffickers who decided that Chief Roberto Orduna Cruz, a retired army major who had been on the job since May, should go. To make clear their insistence, they vowed to kill a police officer every 48 hours until he resigned. 
 They first killed Mr. Orduna's deputy, Operations Director Sacramento Perez Serrano, together with three of his men. Then another police officer and a prison guard turned up dead. As the body count grew, Mr. Orduna eventually did as the traffickers had demanded, resigning his post on Feb. 20 and fleeing the city.
 Replacing Mr. Orduna will also fall outside the mayor's purview, although this time the criminals will not have a say. With Ciudad Juarez and the surrounding state of Chihuahua under siege by heavily armed drug lords, the federal government last week ordered the deployment of 5,000 soldiers to take over the Juarez Police Department. With the embattled mayor's full support, the country's defense secretary will pick the next chief.
 Chihuahua, which already has about 2,500 soldiers and federal police on patrol, had almost half the 6,000 drug-related killings in all of Mexico in 2008 and is on pace for an even bloodier 2009. Juarez's strategic location at the busy El Paso border crossing and its large population of local drug users have prompted a fierce battle among rival cartels for control of the city.
 ''Day after day, there are so many horrible things taking place there,'' said Howard Campbell, an anthropologist at the University of Texas at El Paso who studies Mexico's drug war. ''The cartels are trying to control everything.''
 Nothing is surprising in Chihuahua anymore. Gunmen recently shot at one of three cars in Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza's motorcade, killing a bodyguard and wounding two agents. The drug cartels routinely collect taxes from business owners, shooting those who refuse to pay up. As for the Juarez mayor, who has made cleaning up the notoriously corrupt police department his focal point, the cartel recently threatened to decapitate him and his family unless he backed off.
 The handwritten threat that it issued went further than that. Like many people in Juarez, Mayor Reyes has homes on both sides of the border, splitting his time between El Paso and Juarez. The note threatening him made it clear that the assassins going after him would have no qualms about crossing into the United States to finish off the mayor and his family.
 ''We took the threat seriously,'' said Chris Mears, a spokesman for the El Paso Police Department. ''I'm not going to tell you what actions were taken, but we've taken actions.''
 In an interview in his wood-paneled office overlooking the United States, Mr. Reyes, 46, whose father was mayor in the early 1980s, said he was not going to allow criminals to run the city, despite the inroads they are making. He said he initially opposed his police chief's decision to resign because he did not want the outlaws to feel empowered. He acceded only as a life-saving gesture, he said.
 ''I'm not going to give in,'' he vowed in an interview, welcoming the arrival of soldiers so that the traffickers will feel the heat even more.
 Right now, the Juarez police are no match for the outlaws. Last year, the senior uniformed officer was killed, one of 45 local police officers killed since January 2007, and a former police chief pleaded guilty to charges of smuggling a ton of marijuana from Juarez to El Paso. Mr. Orduna, who lived at the police station to avoid being killed, had replaced another chief who fled to El Paso after receiving threats last year. If the army had not come in, the mayor would no doubt have had a difficult time finding somebody to head the department.
 Introducing a nationwide police recruitment campaign, the mayor has raised salaries and benefits enough that he is attracting new recruits to replace the many officers being fired for their links to organized crime.
 ''I know the dangers and I accept them,'' said Jose Martin Jauregui Lopez, one of the 289 cadets now being trained at Juarez's police academy. ''There are a lot of people afraid for me: my mom, my relatives. But this is what I want to do.''
 As a sign to the traffickers that he was not running from them, Mr. Reyes appeared Friday to be like any other mayor, giving a speech at the opening of a shopping center, signing a memorandum of understanding with a developer, reassuring residents that he would keep loiterers from gathering in front of their homes. 
 But the bodyguards holding assault rifles who clung close to him made it clear that Juarez remained a city under siege.
 ''There's no square inch of the city that has been untouched by the violence,'' said Lucinda Vargas, an economist who works by day to remake the city as executive director of Juarez Strategic Plan, but retreats to El Paso at night. ''There's a lot of evidence that Juarez, in a micro sense, is becoming a failed state. But I still think we haven't failed yet and that we could still rescue ourselves.''

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Horses Keep Rescuers Busy

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: MANORVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 MONA T. KANCIPER scanned the pastures that ring her blue and white barn, now at close to capacity and crammed with four-legged creatures temporarily, and in some instances permanently, residing here for lack of anywhere else to go. As the hard-driving president of New York Horse Rescue, a nonprofit organization that had its origins in the rehabilitation of racetrack castoffs but now copes with all breeds in all manner of predicaments, she is more interested in rescuing horses than whispering to them. But, like most horse-lovers, she occasionally does that as well.
 By chance, she met the liquid brown eye of a previously homeless, malnourished and unwanted Irish thoroughbred named Maple, plucked from a backyard shed on Long Island. His ribs poked out like bicycle spokes and his attitude verged on sour when she took him in. Hunger and loneliness had taken a toll. Trust issues? He had those, too. 
 ''This is definitely a very bad time to be a horse,'' Ms. Kanciper said, confirming the negative development -- driven by panicky, cash-short owners and an unforgiving economy -- that has uprooted Maple and an as-yet-unknown number of his species. Reports of a surge in abandoned or neglected horses; of overcrowded rescue, auction and retirement facilities; and of unwanted equines being fattened in feedlots before being shipped to slaughter in Mexico and in Canada have prompted the Unwanted Horse Coalition, an offshoot of the American Horse Council, to undertake a national survey about the problem. 
 According to Dr. Tom Lenz, a veterinarian who is the chairman of the coalition, although the elimination of domestic slaughterhouses has reduced the total number of horses killed, 100,000 to 150,000 are still exported for slaughter each year. ''So we know they're unwanted,'' he said. ''America needs a wake-up call about this issue. The general population has this love affair with the horse without realizing the costs and complications of owning horses in this economy.'' 
 The expense of euthanizing horses that are sick, lame, old or dangerous is creating an ill-timed rise in ''irresponsible owners,'' Dr. Lenz said, and a new class of unwanted -- and in some cases discarded -- beasts. He finds logic in California's proactive, if grim, response to the problem: It has established low-cost equine euthanasia centers. 
 Results of the national survey on unwanted horses are scheduled for release next month. But those in the rescue business, like Ms. Kanciper, 46, who worked in Manhattan as a commercial real estate appraiser before transforming her Long Island farm into a horse haven in 1998, already have the living data occupying their barns and straining their financial resources. When donations, adoption fees and her twice-yearly fund-raisers fall short of covering the rescue operation's annual expenses of $150,000 to $200,000, Ms. Kanciper supplements the budget from her own pocket. She and others running rescue organizations say that the economy has left fewer people willing, or able, to help.
 ''Nobody's adopting these horses; it's been kind of a record winter in that regard,'' said Patty Wahlers, who operates the Humane Organization Representing Suffering Horses, a rescue facility on 47 acres in Washington, Conn. Besides the dozens of horses, many of them retired police horses, she sustains on her farm, she supplies a feed-assistance program that is helping five other horses stay with their owners. 
 ''Hopefully the people who genuinely want to keep their horses are getting smarter about spending and learning to conserve, to cut back on shows, lessons, trailering and whatnot,'' she said. 
 Ray of Light FarmThough it is a less dire phenomenon than horses being dumped at auction, there is an unprecedented glut of horses being offered for outright adoption or free lease by owners who suddenly cannot afford the upkeep, which in the New York metropolitan area can range anywhere from $350 a month for rough board (figure on shoveling manure and supplying the feed yourself) to the $2,500 per month (exclusive of lessons, training or other add-ons) charged by top-shelf equestrian boarding facilities. The cost of an adequate supply of hay and grain to feed a thousand-pound horse is $400 a month.
 Art Morano, who owns Stargate Farm, a 70-stall equestrian facility in Allentown, confirms that the recession has left his business suffering. ''We're hanging on by the threads,'' Mr. Morano said. ''Last year at this time I maybe had five empty stalls. Now there's 35.'' 
 Boarders who owned multiple horses, he said, are culling their herds or getting out of ownership altogether. A major blow to his barn came last fall when Frank Hernandez, a trainer who had 22 hunter jumper horses under his direction at Stargate, took a position in Tennessee because the signs were evident that business in New Jersey, where he had worked about 20 years, was trailing off.
 At Twin Lakes Farm in Bronxville, home to 30 lesson horses and 25 private boarders, the riding instructors still give an average of 1,500 lessons each month, but a significant statistic has reversed itself in the past year.
 ''It used to be that 80 percent of the kids took lessons twice a week and 20 percent came once a week, but now it's the exact opposite,'' said Scott Tartar, the owner-manager. ''So we're doing the same amount of lessons, but we're teaching twice as many kids.''
 The barn has also cut back on its horse show excursions. It once sent out 8 to 10 clients and their horses each weekend; now it transports just 5 show participants every other weekend. Sales are basically at a standstill. ''February was always a slow month, but it's gone from slow to closed,'' Mr. Tartar said.
 There is no seller's market for midrange horses either. At Wit's End Farm in Jackson, Yolanda Mazzarisi is asking $30,000 for Oops, $25,000 for Edelweiss, both mixed-breed warmbloods, and $20,000 for Amigo del Diablo, a large pony, but has not received any serious offers.
 ''The economy has reduced our income, which is why we are selling them and probably a fourth horse,'' Ms. Mazzarisi said. ''And we'll definitely have to negotiate our prices the same as anyone out there who's trying to sell anything.''
 In the Hamptons, Christine Barrett-Distefano runs the Amaryllis Farm Equine Rescue, an antislaughter network that since 2005 has rescued 76 horses, many of them elderly or sickly. This winter, she said, the sanctuary has been overwhelmed by returnees and besieged by newcomers surrendered by cost-cutting owners.
 ''Aramis was returned by his adoptive family because the builder dad saw a huge decline in work,'' Ms. Barrett-Distefano said as she began to name a few. ''Star and Trace were adopted to a real estate broker in Lake Placid, and we just sent them money for feed because we don't have room for them here. Arapahoe is a paint pony who was desperate for housing when his owner, a dog-groomer and mother of three, could no longer afford his board bills when the dog-grooming business dropped off.''
 The situation in a nutshell: People lose their jobs or their bonuses. Next they lose their animals. 
 ''Everybody's interpretation of financial hardship is different,'' said Ms. Kanciper, who began adopting washed-up thoroughbreds from local tracks 10 years ago. ''But in an uncertain economy like this, the first thing to go are the so-called luxury items like horses and boats. Except that boats don't have feelings.''
 Horses not only react to pain but also bond with their human handlers, which is why Ms. Kanciper, although not opposed to euthanasia, does not regard it as an answer to the plight of the horses in her care unless they are hobbled by chronic pain or are terminally ill. ''I try not to be a softy -- in my business you really can't if you want to survive -- but it's very hard to euthanize a horse,'' she said. ''You look into those big brown trusting eyes, and. ...'' It's a last resort. 
 Maple, the headstrong 11-year-old gelding whose only sin was being a slowpoke on the track and a financial drag on the Long Island owner who acquired him after his racing career expired, did not shrink from Ms. Kanciper's gaze.
 ''He's ,'' she said. ''He just needs the right rider.'' 
 Offered a carrot, Maple cheerfully accepted it. So did Lunaticonthegrass, a chestnut gelding both younger and mellower than Maple, and Mr. T, a nearly 30-year-old roan quarter horse seized in a neglect case by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Here, these unwanted herd animals live in a full-service facility with ample equine companionship instead of languishing alone in a backyard. They are fed twice a day and ridden regularly by Ms. Kanciper and an assistant to give them a better chance of being deemed adoptable by people wanting pleasure horses, not pasture pets. 
 Compared with some, Maple and Lunatic, the sweet-tempered 4-year-old thoroughbred who, despite his name, lacked the competitive instinct to excel on the turf, have it made. Should nobody else ever want them, Ms. Kanciper guarantees them a forever home for the remainder of their natural lifespan. Or until her hay runs out, which is becoming an unsettling possibility, with too many mouths to feed and -- as a nonprofit dependent on contributions -- not enough money to cover the escalating costs of food and bedding. Hers is a plaint shared by many in the rescue business. 
 ''Donations are down by 75 percent this winter, and adoptions are down by 75 percent as well,'' she said. ''I'm down to my last $1,000 in the hay budget. I've got 10 or 15 horses on my waiting list, and in the last six weeks there's been a tremendous number of people calling me up, begging and crying, and asking me to take their horses because they can't afford to feed them anywhere. The economy is making people desperate. But I can't take in more horses than I can feed. Do that and you defeat your own purpose and risk becoming a rescue case yourself.''
 About 50 horses, including 20 she owns, reside at Ms. Kanciper's two rescue facilities. The main one is the 50-acre farm she owns with her husband, Dr. Judson L. Butler, an equine veterinarian here on Long Island (where the horse population is estimated at 40,000). The second is five miles away at Hart's Cove in East Moriches, a former potato farm that is now home to a gated community that includes eight horses and an upscale condo-and-town house subdivision. Thanks to an open space covenant, Ms. Kanciper leases the barn and pastures for $1 a year. The catch is that the arrangement specifies a maximum of eight horses. Stall space is maxed out until Lunatic or one of his ex-racehorse pals finds a home.
 Last month Ms. Kanciper received a distraught call from Carolyn LeRoy, of Ridge in Suffolk County, who adopted a thoroughbred, Reno, now 8, from her in 2004 but is struggling to pay his feed and maintenance bills. 
 Ms. LeRoy asked Ms. Kanciper if she could take the horse back. Ms. Kanciper, knowing Reno has a good home, asked Ms. LeRoy to try to keep him and volunteered her husband, Dr. Butler, to handle any medical emergencies. ''It took the pressure off,'' said Ms. LeRoy, who also has a 32-year-old horse she has owned for three decades. ''I'd rather die than give my old guy away. And if Reno left, it would break the old guy's heart. I'm in a bad place with this.'' 
 Ms. LeRoy's husband has since persuaded her to hang onto the horses she loves and cut corners elsewhere in their budget for as long as necessary; not having to worry about any horse-size emergency veterinary bills has made that option possible. But most owners cannot count on a Dr. Butler to help them navigate financial and medical setbacks. 
 There are some happy endings. Five abused horses seized last year by the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have all been adopted; 15 rescued horses, many of them bound for slaughter, now live in style at the Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard; and Whinny the Blue, an arthritic paint pony taken in by Ms. Kanciper, found a home last month as a pasture companion in Mattituck. 
 Her departure freed up one spot; predictably, the organization made room for two, Royal Congaree and Baby Suave. Hard to say no to a thoroughbred filly named Baby Suave.

HEADLINE: Table to Farm

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE MUHLKE

 BODY:
It's one thing to visit the farm where your salad was grown. It's another to stand on the killing floor where that evening's braised pork originated. But to interview the Missouri chef Jonathan Justus means starting at the beginning of the dish.
 So after spending the morning with his butter maker and chicken and egg suppliers, we skipped to the main course and visited Paradise Locker Meats, a small-production slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant that works with Heritage Foods U.S.A. to supply top restaurants with meat from heirloom breeds. 
 As we parked in the muddy lot, visions of Upton Sinclair and immigration abuses flitted through my formerly vegetarian mind. But Paradise was spotless and calm, save for the man with a band saw bisecting a cow. The only other hints of the previous day's slaughter -- conducted, however oxymoronically, according to humane guidelines -- were a cart brimming with pigs' heads and boxes marked for Chez Panisse, Lupa, Bar Boulud and Fatted Calf. A few of those boxes would have a much shorter trip to the plate that day. 
 ''What's being served at Momofuku and Spotted Pig is what I'm serving,'' he said of Justus Drugstore: A Restaurant, located 11 miles away in Smithville. ''I'm just here at the source.'' 
 Paradise had five employees in 2003, including the owner, Mario Fantasma, his wife and his son. Today they employ 25, with plans to expand to meet demand. The plant, it turns out, has created more than jobs in the community. ''One of the reasons we decided we could do a restaurant is because of what Mario's doing here,'' said Justus, an intense, articulate man who mentions his O.C.D. personality and low self-esteem in fast-paced rotation, making him seem much younger than his 43 years. When his mother and sister approached him about opening a restaurant in the family drugstore -- ''the anti-plan,'' as he saw it -- the first thing that he looked at was agri-infrastructure. Fortunately, in the decades since he last lived back home, between stints as a bike messenger and butcher in San Francisco and a cook in the South of France, the farm had moved closer to the table. Now he could realize his goal to connect the region's tables to its farms. ''This is a big piece of the puzzle,'' he said of Paradise. ''It allows me to do a nose-to-tail menu.''
 Fantasma beamed as Justus launched into a lecture on the genius of Paradise's four-rib-bone country cut, which he serves both braised and smoked in one dish, topped with bacon-powder-flecked apple chantilly and tag-teamed with a corn flan, bacon-studded cabbage and apple sticks. 
 ''This guy kills me,'' Fantasma said, elbowing Justus. ''He scares me.''
 When he opened the restaurant two years ago, Justus probably scared many of his 5,000 neighbors, and not just because he's a Democrat. Missouri is more about barbecue than ginger-brined pork with apple foam. Living out their 15-year dream of opening a restaurant, he and his wife, Camille Eklof, transformed his family's 1950s drugstore into a bit of the big city, albeit on ''a microbudget.'' The old soda fountain became the bar, where a local botanist and an environmental scientist were set to work concocting bitters, vermouth and infused liquors. 
 Locals can now drop by for a Manhattan made with date-infused bourbon and a bar snack of turkey fries (a k a testicles) with a morel-cream sauce. Instead of making the 20-minute drive to Kansas City for rib tips, they now stick around for Akaushi brisket from Paradise braised in homemade root-beer. (Justus uses the G.P.S. on his iPhone to forage for sassafras and other native plants.) Or maybe freshwater striper bass rendered baroque with egg-white gratin, persimmon paint, maple-sherry-ginger foam and caramel-mint dust.
 Justus said the food is his version of Midwestern country cooking, ''created in a vacuum.'' Pride, and economic necessity, dictate that many things be made from scratch, like charcuterie, bacon and ham; bread is baked by Eklof, who waits on tables and works as the general manager; fish and meat are butchered in-house. Justus is always bargaining with purveyors for ''off cuts'' of meat. ''All our cuts are off cuts,'' he said with a laugh.
 They live by their food politics, but Justus and Eklof don't proselytize at the table. They let the menu do the talking: on the cover, a quote from Thomas Keller stating that good food takes time lets diners know they won't make the 8 o'clock movie; the back lists 25 local purveyors, intended to open people's eyes to the links a restaurant can have to its area -- links that Justus wants to weave into an infrastructure for farmers, breeders, aquaculturists and food artisans that could eventually slow development as farmers reclaim land to meet demand from revolutionary restaurants like his. 
 While it took the couple a while to come around to coming home, Smithville seems to suit their goals. Justus recalled Eklof's urging him to consider it: ''She said: 'Look, we can live in San Francisco forever, and we're never going to change anyone's mind because we're going to be in our insular community. If we ever want to make any change, we've got to be the monkey wrench from the inside.' ''
 From the outside, the change is evident. Mark Ladner, the executive chef at Del Posto in New York, dined at Justus Drugstore last summer as part of Heritage Foods' pork tour of the area. He was impressed with the ''funky, positive'' feel, both on the menu and in the dining room. ''It felt like they were doing something important,'' he said.
 The satisfaction of building a community around food has been rewarding spiritually, if not yet financially. ''This restaurant is completely and totally built on philosophy,'' Justus said. ''Cause it sure as [expletive] isn't about money. It can't be.'' They live off of Eklof's tips and are saving to be able to provide health insurance for their 16 employees -- part of their plan to redefine what a restaurant can be.
 ''I hope what we're doing is a forefront of a trend,'' he said, looking out of the window they built onto Main Street. ''I feel like, if we can do this here -- really! -- why can't this be done anywhere?'' 
 Recipe: Grilled Pork Porterhouse With an Apple-Maple-Ginger Sauce
 For the brine:
 1/4cup maple syrup
 5tablespoons kosher salt
 3tablespoons peeled, sliced ginger
 3tablespoons crushed garlic
 1sprig fresh sage
 3/4cup onion slices, cut into 1/4 -inch rings
 5bay leaves
 2teaspoons peppercorns
 6 1 1/4-inch-thick pork loin chops (also known as pork porterhouses), preferably Berkshire organic (see note)
 For the infused oil:
 1tablespoon coriander seeds
 1bay leaf
 1tablespoon peppercorns
 2tablespoons minced shallot
 1teaspoon minced fresh thyme
 1teaspoon minced fresh rosemary
 1/2 cup vegetable oil
 For the sauce:
 2tablespoons butter 
 1/4cup minced shallot
 1tablespoon minced garlic
 2cups apple juice
 1/2 cup chicken stock
 3star anise
 2tablespoons minced ginger
 1/2cup maple syrup
 1/2vanilla bean, seeds scraped
 1tablespoon agar (see note)
 Salt and freshly ground black pepper.
 1.Twenty-four hours before cooking, stir all of the brine ingredients except the pork into 1 quart of water in a large pot and bring to a boil. Let cool to room temperature. Submerge the pork chops in the brine, cover and refrigerate.
 2.The next morning, prepare the infused oil: grind the coriander, bay leaf and peppercorns in a spice mill or a clean coffee grinder and combine with the remaining ingredients in a medium bowl. Let sit at room temperature.
 3.Make the sauce: In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium-low heat. Add the shallots and saute until caramelized, about 4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute. Add the apple juice, chicken stock, star anise and ginger. Bring to a boil, lower the heat and simmer until reduced by one-quarter. Add the maple syrup, vanilla pod and seeds and agar and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat. Discard the star anise and vanilla pod. Puree the mixture in a blender or food processor, then pass through a fine-mesh sieve into a pan. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
 4.Prepare a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high heat. Rinse the meat and pat dry with paper towels. Brush the chops with the infused oil, then sprinkle lightly with salt. Grill to medium doneness, or until the internal temperature reads 135 to 140 degrees on a thermometer and the middle is light pink, about 6 minutes per side. Let sit for 5 minutes before serving. Drizzle with warm sauce and serve. Serves 6. Adapted from Jonathan Justus and Jeffrey Scott at Justus Drugstore.
 Note: Berkshire organic pork is available to order through heritagefoodsusa.com. Agar is available at most health-food stores.
 Recipe: Grilled Pork Porterhouse With an Apple-Maple-Ginger Sauce
 For the date-infused bourbon:
 15 dates
 1 750-ml bottle bourbon 
 For the brandied cherries (optional):
 1 pound dark, sweet cherries (preferably fresh, but frozen is okay)
 2 tablespoons sugar
 2 teaspoons lemon juice
 1 small cinnamon stick
 3 1/2 tablespoons brandy
 For the cocktail:
 1 orange
 2 brandied or maraschino cherries
 3 dashes Angostura bitters
 2 1/2 ounces (5 tablespoons) date-infused bourbon.
 1. Infuse the bourbon: in a jar fitted with a lid, combine the dates and bourbon. Cover tightly and store in a dark place for 2 to 4 weeks. (The longer it sits, the sweeter it becomes.) Strain, then pour through a coffee filter for clarity. Store in a sealed bottle or jar until ready to use.
 2. Make the brandied cherries (optional): wash and pit the cherries. In a medium saucepan, combine the sugar, 2 1/2 tablespoons water, lemon juice and cinnamon stick. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, add the cherries and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, discard the cinnamon stick and stir in the brandy. Cool. Store in a sealed jar and refrigerate until ready to use.
 3. To make one cocktail: Leaving the peel on, cut the orange in half lengthwise, then cut a 1/4-inch-thick slice. Cut the slice in half horizontally. Combine the orange slice half, one cherry and the bitters in a tumbler and crush with a muddler or the back of a wooden spoon. Add a few cubes of ice and the bourbon and stir. Top with the remaining cherry. Serves 1. Adapted from Jay Beavers and Chris Conatser (of Justus Drugstore, a restaurant).

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: Stop the Bailouts

BYLINE: By WILLIAM POOLE

 BODY:
THE fundamental causes of this recession, unique in the experience of the United States, were mortgage defaults and the consequent insolvency of major financial firms. These insolvencies, and especially fear of them, damaged normal credit mechanisms. 
 The self-correcting nature of markets will ultimately prevail. We should not underestimate the power of monetary policy; with the sharp increase in the nation's money stock starting in September, monetary policy is now extraordinarily expansionary. I believe, though without great confidence, that the recession will end in the second half of this year. 
 Federal policy is damaging the economy's prospects. It fails to provide the needed tax incentives for investment in factories and equipment, incentives that were central to efforts to revive the economy during the Kennedy-Johnson era and under Ronald Reagan. But government spending can't lead the way to sustained recovery, because its stimulating effect will be offset by anticipated higher taxes and the need to finance the deficit. 
 Heavy-handed federal intervention into the management of companies from banks to auto makers will also delay recovery. And misguided efforts to help distressed homeowners by permitting courts to rewrite the terms of mortgages will cause banks to limit mortgage lending, which will prevent housing from contributing to the recovery. 
 The unrelenting anger across the country over bailouts of corporations and households that made unwise and even irresponsible financial decisions is influencing federal policy. Punitive measures, like forcing companies receiving federal dollars to cancel employee events, will increase uncertainty over where the government will strike next in its effort to deflect public outrage. Instead of more bailouts, we need a clear and consistent path to fundamental reform of our financial system.

HEADLINE: Taking Innovation Beyond The 'Aha'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
IN the world of technology, inventors are hailed as heroes. Yet it is more subtle forms of innovation that typically determine the impact of a technology in the marketplace and on society. Clever engineering, smart business models and favorable economics are the key ingredients of widespread adoption and commercial success.
 History abounds with evidence. For years, much of what was known as ''Yankee ingenuity'' was, in fact, the American ability to pursue commercial applications of British inventions, from the Bessemer steel process to the jet engine. Even in computing, which we regard as made-in-America technology, the first stored-program computer, simple programming language and reusable code were pioneered in Britain. 
 But, of course, computer technology and the industry really flowered in the United States. That happened in no small part because the federal government nurtured the market with heavy investment, mainly by the Defense Department, and by choosing standards, like the Cobol programming language.
 Today, Washington is about to embark on another ambitious government-guided effort to jump-start a market -- in electronic health records. The program provides a textbook look at the economic and engineering challenges of technology adoption.
 In its economic recovery package, the Obama administration plans to spend $19 billion to accelerate the use of computerized medical records in doctors' offices. Medical experts agree that electronic patient records, when used wisely, can help curb costs and improve care. 
 The proof is seen in large medical groups, with hundreds or thousands of physicians. They sift, sort and analyze the data from digital records, for example, to better manage the health of patients with costly, chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. These larger groups have the scale to invest in information technology, and they are often insurers as well as providers, so they benefit directly from the cost savings.
 Yet these large groups are the exceptions in American health care. Three-fourths of the nation's doctors practice in small offices, with 10 doctors or fewer. For most of them, an investment in digital health records looks like a cost for which they are not reimbursed. 
 It is scarcely surprising, then, that only about 17 percent of the nation's physicians are using computerized patient records, according to a government-sponsored survey published last year in The New England Journal of Medicine.
 ''This is really not a technology problem,'' observed Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''It's a matter of incentives and market failure.''
 That market failure is a principal target of the Obama administration's plan. A main feature of the legislation calls for incentive payments of more than $40,000 spread over a few years for a physician who buys and uses electronic health records. But the technology is just a tool, one that needs to be used properly to improve health care.
 So the legislation states that physicians will be paid only for the ''meaningful use'' of digital records. The government has not yet defined that term precisely. While the long-term goal is better health for patients, that can take years to measure. Consequently, many health experts predict that the meaningful use will be a requirement to collect and report measurements that can be closely correlated with improved health. Examples would be data for blood glucose, cholesterol and blood pressure levels for diabetes patients.
 The legislation, health experts say, seems thoughtfully put together, but the obstacles to success will be daunting. ''What's underappreciated is the implementation challenge,'' said Dr. Blackford Middleton, chairman of the Center for Information Technology Leadership, a research arm of Partners Healthcare in Boston.
 A crucial bridge to success, according to experts, will be how local organizations help doctors in small offices adopt and use electronic records. The new legislation calls for creation of ''regional health I.T. extension centers.'' In a letter to the White House and Congress last month, Dr. Middleton and 50 other experts emphasized the importance of these centers and pointed to the Primary Care Information Project in New York City as a model.
 The New York project's brief history, beginning two years ago with $27 million in financing, offers a glimpse of the challenges of wiring small physician practices. The New York team, headed by Dr. Farzad Mostashari, an assistant commissioner in the city's health department, started by bringing in decision-support experts in medicine to study how doctors work, so the technology would be easier to use. Team members considered writing their own software for simple, Web-based electronic health records, but abandoned that idea once they understood that patient records would have to be tightly linked to billing -- a physician's financial lifeblood. 
 The project's 50-member staff provides centralized technical support and education for doctors and others. ''There's no way small practices can effectively implement electronic health records on their own,'' Dr. Mostashari said. ''This is not the iPhone.''
 The staff worked closely with its software supplier, eClinicalWorks, to tweak and tailor the system. They began rolling out the records a little more than a year ago. They are now used by more than 1,000 physicians, mainly in poorer neighborhoods, whose workplaces include two hospital outpatient clinics, 10 community health centers, 150 small group physician practices and one women's jail, serving a total of one million patients. The rollout is progressing, and the government plan promises to accelerate adoption.
 ''Our experience here is that it's just hard,'' Dr. Mostashari said. ''It's not impossible.''

HEADLINE: In a Job Hunt, A Good Attitude Beats Bad Times

BYLINE: By KEVIN YOUNG. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen. E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I'M patriotic and always wanted to serve my country, war or not. I enlisted in the Marines four years ago, when I was 22, and was based at Camp LeJeune, N.C. Eventually, I would have two tours in Iraq. I officially became a civilian again last month, though I started thinking about job-hunting in October. 
 I had no idea what I wanted to do as a civilian. I was a first lieutenant in the Marines in charge of security at our main camp in Fallujah. In one way, it might have been safer to stay in the service and take advantage of the benefits. I could have received tuition assistance to get my master's degree, and was eligible for a position that would have kept me from being deployed for two years. But I have a lot of interests, and I always planned to join the civilian work force after serving four years. 
 In the chow hall in Iraq, I used to watch the news on TV, so I heard the reports about the economy back home. But I didn't worry too much about my job prospects. I knew that companies were laying people off, yet I believe that there are always opportunities. Some companies are hiring. I was optimistic because I have a strong background. 
 At the Citadel in South Carolina, I was in the honors college. I started as a political science major and switched to physics my sophomore year. I was a member of two honor societies and served as a research fellow for two summers. I was also accepted into Officer Candidate School, and became a company commander in the Marines in two years. Both in college and in the military, I made it a point to acquire leadership skills that would serve me well in a management job. 
 When I got home, I wanted to relax for a while, so I held off on sending out resumes. In October, I registered with a placement firm that finds jobs for people who have been in the military, and in December attended a hiring conference it sponsored. It lined up interviews for me with three companies that were looking for midlevel managers: an insurance company, a security company and a company that sells generators. None offered me a job. 
 I realized that I had only a vague understanding of what any of the positions were, and I'm sure that came through during the interviews. The security job didn't really interest me -- if I had wanted to be in that field I would have stayed in the military. I looked at the lack of job offers as part of a learning process. I figured that I could probably be happy whatever I did, but wondered if I could find a niche that could be my passion. I still had to identify it. 
 I figured that the holidays were a slow time for job hunting, and I was still winding down. Re-entering civilian life was easy, partly because people were so welcoming. 
 Walking in a mall, or eating in a restaurant with friends, I found that strangers would come up to me and ask if I was in the military. I guess they could tell because of my short hair. We'd start talking, and they'd thank me for serving our country. 
 I still wasn't nervous about finding a job because I had some money saved. I started reading books about personal finance, and all of a sudden it clicked: that field was perfect for me. Investing has always been a personal passion of mine, and I thought, why not choose a career as a financial adviser? I could have an impact on people's lives and help them prepare for future recessions. 
 I remembered my own experience with two investment firms I'd rather not name. When I was in college, I visited an adviser at one firm to open an account. The person I spoke to said I had to be kidding -- I would need $200,000. So I studied companies, bought stocks on my own and built a portfolio by myself. 
 A few years later I talked to someone at a different company. He said I was doing a great job investing on my own, and to stick with it. He also sent me a company newsletter every few months that he sent to clients. That told me a lot about his company compared to the first one.
 This past January, I contacted the second financial services company and talked to a few advisers. I told them what I thought a financial adviser did, and they confirmed it. I also asked some advisers around my age who had been there a year about the training program. After a couple of phone interviews with hiring specialists, I met with another adviser for a final interview. I received an offer the second week of February, and I start this month.
 I WOULD tell other job hunters that it's important not to rely on one skill set, and that preparing for interviews is crucial. This time I was able to articulate my reasons for wanting to join this field and this particular company, and I told them how they would benefit by hiring me. So much is about having a positive attitude and trying to stand out. 
 Now it's all on me. I have to pass two exams initially, and then I'll go for training. Who knows where I will be a year from now?

HEADLINE: Smallest State Grapples With Oversize Problems

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH and KATIE ZEZIMA

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I. 

 BODY:
 -- Rhode Island is in the midst of an especially grim economic meltdown, and no one can pinpoint exactly why. 
 The smallest state, it is saddled with some of the nation's biggest problems: the second highest unemployment rate, at 10 percent, according to the latest federal figures; and among the highest foreclosure rates, widest budget gaps and most-vulnerable pension systems. 
 Rhode Island is arguably the most economically hobbled state after Michigan, whose troubles and 10.6 percent unemployment rate are far easier to explain as the auto industry collapses. Now, as Rhode Island contends with a foundering economy and a stagnant, aging population, its leaders are scrambling to determine how to make the state more resilient and put it on a par, finally, with its more prosperous neighbors. 
 In several dozen recent interviews, Rhode Islanders agreed on this much: Their state's smallness has contributed to its problems, but could be its best asset if properly exploited. Saul Kaplan, who until December was executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, called the state's size a ''secret sauce'' that could help businesses develop products or services quickly. 
 But many of those interviewed said that, instead, the smallness has trapped the state in parochialism, insecurity and outdated traditions that block change at every turn. 
 ''The whole political system is based on back scratching and getting things for your friends,'' said Robert Whitcomb, editorial page editor of The Providence Journal. ''That's true for every place, but more so here because of the intimacy -- you keep bumping into people you know.'' 
 As the lyrics of University of Rhode Island's fight song suggest -- ''We're Rhode Island born and we're Rhode Island bred, and when we die we'll be Rhode Island dead'' -- natives of the state, including lawmakers, rarely cast a curious eye outside it, Mr. Whitcomb and others said. 
 ''They focus primarily, if not exclusively, on us and on the here and now,'' said Leonard Lardaro, an economics professor at the university. ''We need to be looking at a lot of other states -- what they do and how we compare.''
 One striking difference is that Rhode Islanders are less educated than much of the country. The state has the lowest high school graduation rate in the Northeast and ranks 38th nationally. Its average private-sector salary in 2007 was $39,827, compared with $55,819 in Massachusetts and $59,174 in Connecticut. 
 Unlike its neighbors, Rhode Island continues to rely heavily on blue-collar and service-industry jobs. Its largest employment sectors are health care, manufacturing and retail, which pay $27,000 to $46,000 a year on average. 
 ''In that way, we look more like a rust belt state than Connecticut or Massachusetts,'' said Laura Hart, a spokeswoman for the State Department of Labor and Training.
 Rhode Islanders also tend to cling to old stereotypes about the state, like its mob culture and corrupt politicians, others said.
 ''A lot of Rhode Islanders overestimate how uniquely bad we are,'' said Scott Wolf, executive director of Grow Smart Rhode Island, a nonprofit group, ''and underestimate how uniquely good we are.''
 Gov. Donald L. Carcieri, a Republican, and the overwhelmingly Democratic General Assembly have often found themselves at loggerheads, with the legislature more focused on supporting social programs and Mr. Carcieri on shrinking government since he took office in 2003. Organized labor remains a powerful force, and the state's unfunded pension liability, $7 billion, is among the worst in the country. 
 Mr. Carcieri has proposed a minimum retirement age of 59 for government workers and eliminating 3 percent annual increases in their pensions. The proposals are part of his plan to close a $357 million gap in this year's budget, one of the largest in the country as a percentage of state spending.
 But several people said Mr. Carcieri should be more focused on the private sector, particularly on creating more high-paying jobs. More than a quarter of Rhode Islanders who earned more than $100,000 in 2006 claimed an out-of-state tax credit, indicating that they might work for companies based elsewhere.
 Mr. Carcieri does want to change the tax structure, which is generally considered uncompetitive with those of neighboring states. State leaders cringed last fall when Jack Welch, the former chairman of General Electric, said on Fox News that Rhode Island's tax structure made it ''the 48th-most-acceptable state for business.''
 In fact, a study last fall by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group in Washington, ranked Rhode Island's business climate the fifth-worst in the nation.
 Notwithstanding its northern neighbor's reputation as ''Taxachusetts,'' Rhode Island's top personal income tax rate is higher, 9.9 percent. The top rate in Massachusetts is about 5.3 percent, and in Connecticut, 5 percent.
 Mr. Carcieri, whose spokeswoman said he was too busy to be interviewed, wants to phase out Rhode Island's corporate tax. The rate, 9 percent, will soon be higher than in Massachusetts, where it is 9.5 percent but will drop to 8.75 next year. Connecticut's rate is 7.5 percent. 
 ''People sell their businesses and leave because the taxes are so punitive,'' said Dan Shedd, president of the Taylor Box Company in Warren, which has laid off more than half its employees since Thanksgiving and faces, he said, ''a nonstop challenge to try to stay relevant.'' 
 As in other New England states, manufacturing used to be the pillar of Rhode Island's economy, but the state has lost jobs to lower-cost Southern states and other countries. Unlike some of its neighbors, however, Rhode Island has not found lucrative replacements.
 Health care is Rhode Island's largest employment sector and one of the few expected to grow in the short term, driven in large part by the state's aging population. About 14 percent of Rhode Island's one million residents are over 65, compared with 12.4 percent nationally.
 Rhode Island Hospital is the state's largest private employer, followed by the CVS drug store chain, which has its headquarters here; Citizens Financial Group; Bank of America; and Brown University.
 A number of people interviewed said the state had focused on recruiting large corporations at the expense of the kind of small businesses that employ most Rhode Islanders. Two major corporations that Rhode Island courted with tax breaks, Bank of America and Fidelity Investments -- which built the largest office complex in the state -- recently announced layoffs. 
 Mr. Wolf, of Grow Smart, said the state should capitalize more on its 11 colleges and universities, including Brown and the Rhode Island School of Design, and give their graduates more incentives to stay.
 ''State government hasn't been aggressive enough about saying to the universities, 'What's your research right now, and how can we make it easier to use it to grow businesses in Rhode Island?' '' he said.
 Mr. Kaplan, who now heads a nonprofit group in Providence that encourages entrepreneurs to exchange ideas, said he saw boundless energy in what he called the ''geek community'' -- young, technology-savvy entrepreneurs who are quietly opening small companies. 
 Jack Templin, a consultant who founded Providence Geeks, a networking group for people in digital media and information technology, said the energetic group could help shape a new economic development model. Over dinner recently, several of its members echoed the view that the state is small enough for individuals to effect change.
 ''I don't think there's a lot of places where you can pick up the phone and talk to the governor or the mayor,'' said Allan Tear, who moved to Providence from Atlanta after making a spreadsheet about the pros and cons of eight cities around the country.
 Many of those interviewed said the innovative spirit that fueled the Industrial Revolution here must return if the state is to bounce back. Perhaps most crucially, many existing companies need to reinvent themselves to survive. Mr. Shedd's company has done just that: it first provided boxes for the state's once-dominant jewelry industry, then for the software industry, and most recently for gift cards.
 He stays, he said, because he loves the state's beauty and its quirkiness, both of which keep drawing people like Marjory Garrison, a 30-year-old consultant to nonprofit groups.
 Ms. Garrison moved to Providence last summer from Brooklyn and became so captivated that she started her own recruitment campaign, plastering neighborhoods in Atlanta, Boston, Brooklyn and Seattle with posters that shout ''Move to Providence!'' 
 ''It has so much going for it, and so much of that is still under the surface in a lot of ways,'' she said. ''I think people here believe that once you crack that open, anything is possible.''

HEADLINE: Is Anybody Buying Art These Days?

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG. 
Eric Konigsberg is a reporter for The New York Times and the author of ''Blood Relation.''

 BODY:
On Monday, Sept. 15, mere hours after Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy in New York City, Sotheby's was throwing open the doors of its London headquarters for the most extravagant sale in the auction house's history. The sale, of 223 new artworks by Damien Hirst, brought in more than $200 million -- nearly 10 times the total receipts of the previous record-holder for a single artist, a 1993 auction of 88 Picassos that reaped around $20 million. It was a level of consumption that, particularly when viewed against the concurrent collapse of the financial-services industry, almost immediately acquired a nostalgic air, the last gasp of the art boom.
 In the audience sat the men of the Mugrabi family -- the patriarch Jose and his sons, Alberto and David -- New York art dealers for whom the evening was not so much a transitional moment as simply another high-stakes day at the office. The Mugrabis own what is believed to be one of the largest and most valuable private collections of art in the world. By their estimate, it includes more than 3,000 works. They have built the collection over the past 25 years, since Jose, an Israeli-born fabric merchant who raised the family in Colombia, moved his wife, Mary, and their two sons to America and got into the art business full time. 
 The core of their collection is a staggering 800 works by Andy Warhol -- ''easily the biggest Warhol collection in the world after ours,'' says Tom Sokolowski, the director of the vast Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh -- and roughly 100 each by Jean-Michel Basquiat, Tom Wesselmann and George Condo. At 69, Jose remains largely interested in artists with connections to the Pop movement. Alberto and David, who are 38 and 37, respectively, have been accompanying their father to auctions since they were teenagers, and in recent years they've been deputized to seek out younger -- or at least living -- artists. It is at their instigation that the family now owns about 150 Hirst pieces. They have also bought and sold numerous significant works by Richard Prince and Jeff Koons.
 The Hirst sale constituted a vast repository of the formerly Young British Artist's themes and tricks, greatest hits reissued with just a note here or there to distinguish them from their predecessors. There were skulls, butterflies, paintings of colored dots that corresponded to pharmaceutical codings and, of course, animal and fish corpses suspended in formaldehyde inside giant glass vitrines. Among these were a tiger shark, a calf with 18-karat-gold horns and hooves, a zebra and a unicorn -- which was actually a foal with a resin horn.
 A number of the tanks were plated with gold and were so heavy that the floors of Sotheby's had to be reinforced to withstand the tonnage. The auction house's printed estimates for the pieces ran from roughly $200,000 for small works to more than $23 million for some of the installations, with the fat part of the bell curve somewhere in the low seven figures.
 The Mugrabis were given seats in the second row and arranged themselves according to family protocol. Alberto, the more outgoing and incautious son, was beside Jose (''He likes to sit next to our dad, and I let him,'' David said). David, dispassionate and analytical, was between his wife, Libbie, and Alberto.
 They were not assigned paddles, because, as David explained, ''the auctioneer knows where to look for us.'' Gazing across the audience himself, though, David barely recognized anybody. ''Except I think I see Bianca Jagger, and I think I saw Russell Simmons.''
 The family was not selling any of its holdings at the auction, but the Mugrabis' fortune is so tied to their pet artists -- like Warhol and Hirst -- that they were rooting for a series of bidding wars. ''We're not looking for bargains here,'' David said. ''Because it's very unwise as invested as we are in Damien to hope the sale doesn't do well. We want to keep the prices up. We'll try to get some things, but we'd like to see other collectors bidding high.''
 For the Mugrabis' preferred artists, the family doesn't merely operate in the art market; it is the market. ''They're so invested, they're like the casino, not the gambler,'' said the gallery owner Francis Naumann, a friend. What threatens them at an auction is not the presence of other aggressive bidders but cautious bidders.
 ''If it's good for Sotheby's and Christie's, it's good for us,'' Alberto said.
 The family admitted to some unease about the front-loaded order in which the pieces were being auctioned. Of the 56 lots on the block the first night of the sale, the two highest-valued by far were coming early. These were the tiger shark (Lot No. 5) and the calf (No. 13). ''I'd rather have, in my opinion, a little more momentum before the formaldehyde,'' David said.
 The first four lots sold quickly, for more than their high estimates. The brothers put in an early bid of $:380,000 (about $685,000 at the time) on a red-and-white butterfly painting they'd been eyeing but gave up long before it was sold (for $:590,000).
 Then came the shark. Alberto started trading text messages with Hirst, who was apparently playing snooker at a pub but eager to receive a play-by-play of the auction. Jose worried a string of black beads with his fingers and chewed gum.
 Bidding began at $:2 million but quickly stalled at $:3.2 million -- below the low end of the house's estimate, which was $:4 million to $:6 million. The auctioneer, Oliver Barker, looked beseechingly at two long tables, which were lined with perhaps three dozen Sotheby's employees, each manning a telephone to field remote bids from collectors across the globe. But none of them proffered a bid. 
 ''Three million three hundred thousand pounds -- want to come in?'' Barker said, repeating the challenge for nearly a full minute. He did not want to let the piece get away so cheaply.
 ''Not good at all,'' Alberto said. Jose stared wordlessly at Barker, then turned his head to look around the room. 
 But before the hammer went down, a remarkable thing happened. Jose sat up and began waving his hand, to get the auctioneer's attention. Then he motioned toward one of the phone attendants, who he could see was still talking to somebody on her line.
 Barker kept on going, and a new bidder came in. There was another lull -- the piece almost sold at $:3.7 million -- but an auction-house staff member on another phone could be heard successfully coaxing her bidder.
 Once the low estimate was reached, a couple of other would-be buyers bid $:4.5 million, $:4.6 million, $:4.7 million and beyond -- in no time, all the way past $:8 million.
 Jose caught the eye of his friend Gabriel Safdie, a Geneva-based curator of private collections who sat nearby, and winked. ''You see?'' Safdie said quietly. ''It was almost dead at 3.2.'' The hammer finally landed at $:8.5 million -- which, once Sotheby's commission and taxes were added in, translated to a $:9.6 million payout, or about $17.2 million. The room broke into applause.
 Alberto received a text message from Hirst and smiled. ''Damien made one of these symbols,'' he said, sticking out his tongue to demonstrate.
 And from there, the auction was a cakewalk -- more than $200 million over the next 24 hours (there was a day session the following afternoon). The Mugrabis bid on a few pieces for which they ended up dropping out early with a swat of a hand or a shrug at the auctioneer. Toward the evening's end, when the brothers decided they didn't want to go home empty-handed, they exchanged a knowing glance, and Alberto kept himself in the running for one of the last pieces long enough to win it -- a small canvas with cigarette butts affixed -- at $:121,250.
 ''A souvenir,'' Alberto said.
 A few minutes earlier, Jose had been talking about the incongruity between the day's financial news and the auction frenzy, and ventured an interpretation: ''When the empires fall -- Roman, Greek -- all that is left is the art.'' 
 THE OVERWHELMING majority of the Mugrabi collection -- of their 3,000 works, all but about 200 at a time -- resides out of public view, in two warehouses they rent, one in Newark and the other near Geneva. Alberto said it was the only practical solution for a collection of its size, particularly with large pieces like the Hirst tank installations. ''Sadly, the whole thing has to be dismantled and drained,'' he said. ''The sharks and the sheep need to be refrigerated.'' 
 As private dealers, the Mugrabis do not own a gallery or represent artists. They buy or sell works in about 100 art auctions annually, nearly one every three days (sometimes, with smaller auctions, they bid via phone). And the rest of the time, they buy and sell through galleries and fellow dealers. 
 ''We're market makers,'' Alberto said. ''You can't have an impact buying one or two pictures per artist. We're not buying art like Ron Lauder -- just to put it on a wall. We want inventory.'' He equated inventory with liquidity: ''It gives you staying power.'' In the commodities sector, the analogue would be making a run on a precious metal -- in order to manipulate the price.
 Over the coming months, the Mugrabis may lose the ability to make that claim. After all, the art market has visibly begun to ebb. Prices -- and interest -- dropped at the November and February auctions in London and New York. At Christie's and Sotheby's big November contemporary sales in New York, nearly one-third of the 138 pieces went unsold. Christie's total receipts of $113.6 million came in at half the low estimate of $227 million. Sotheby's totaled $125 million, falling well short of its low estimate of $202.4 million. Totals for the contemporary artworks sold by Christie's, Sotheby's and Phillips in February were $:43 million, down from $:250 million one year before. The auction houses have been laying off staff, and galleries in Chelsea have been shuttered. Dealers who will be at the Armory Show, which is New York's pre-eminent contemporary art sale and which will take place from March 5 to March 8, have drastically reduced their expectations from what they have come to refer to as ''2007 and 2008 levels.''
 Nobody knows yet what the future business of art will look like, but price escalations on the order of Richard Prince's series of nurse paintings -- $50,000 in 2003, $300,000 in 2005, $1 million in 2006 and $8.4 million in the summer of 2008 -- are most likely not in the picture. (In November 2008, a nurse painting with an estimated value of $5 million to $7 million was bought at auction for $2.9 million.) 
 The Mugrabis, however, insist they will be able to continue doing what they do, regardless of how the ground may have shifted beneath their feet. ''We'll become more like collectors and less like dealers now,'' David said. ''More buying, less selling. It's like Warren Buffett said -- a down market is when you find the bargains. Not that much that is special has come up yet, but when it does, we'll be there.''
 One morning a few weeks ago, Alberto wandered into his father's office in New York as Jose was on the phone with an art dealer in London. In Spanish, Jose was agreeing to purchase a group of five Basquiat paintings for about $9 million and outlining the payment schedule ($5 million upfront, with the remainder to come in half-yearly installments by 2011). 
 ''Yes, yes, buy them all,'' Jose said in English. His assistant came in with cafe con leche on a lacquer tray, and he put his fingers to his lips to signal to her to get his superslim cigarettes ready.
 When Jose hung up, Alberto explained that the week before, they freed up the cash for this purchase by arranging to sell a different Basquiat of theirs, for around $2.5 million, and a Wesselmann painting for $3 million. ''So there's the $5 million,'' Jose said. ''You never know what will come up. I saw photos of the pictures, I talked to the guy for two minutes, I buy them.''
 ''The Basquiat we sold, we had three that were practically the same -- all car crashes,'' David, who had joined them, said. ''We bought this one in '89 for $308,000 and now we sold it for more than $2 million.''
 Before the economic downturn, the Mugrabis said that the value of their collection was approaching a billion dollars. ''If it's two-thirds or three-quarters of what it was, just like everything else, so be it,'' Alberto said in November.
 ''Art will hold its value better than the rest of the things, better than real estate, better than funds,'' Jose claimed, just before the London auctions in February. But now he estimates that works by the ''top tier'' of artists are worth a lot less what they were a year ago. With so much of their money tethered to the market values of a small group of artists, the Mugrabis hardly own a diversified portfolio. If, for whatever reason, they needed to raise a large sum of cash in a hurry, they could find themselves being forced to sell low. 
 The Mugrabis give the impression that, no matter how well they have played the market up to now, their compulsion to buy and sell art is not entirely rational. Back in the early 1990s, when Jose was still making his ascent, he got ''a little overextended'' purchasing art, he said. Asher Edelman, a financier and art dealer who is acquainted with the Mugrabis, said that about five or six years ago, Jose told him over lunch that he was ''nervous'' about being overinvested in art. ''I told him, 'Look, why don't you sell off some of your collection, stop buying, and you can lay low for a few years?' and he said that was a good idea,'' Edelman recalled. ''Then he kept on buying.'' 
 During the November auctions in New York, the Mugrabis put 30 pieces up for sale, and Alberto said that half of them -- including a Basquiat with a high estimate of $2 million -- went unsold. They also bought a Wesselmann painting for nearly $1 million, $300,000 above its high estimate. ''We're addicts,'' Alberto said. ''That's what addicts do.''
 THE WAY THE MUGRABIS built their collection owes a strategic debt to Charles Saatchi, the English advertising man turned art patron. In the 1980s, Saatchi was moved to buy up multiple works by expensive artists. ''Most collectors were satisfied to have, say, one great David Hockney piece, and one great Cy Twombly and so on, but Saatchi was the first to realize there were a dozen great Twomblys, and he could own all of them,'' said Richard Polsky, an art dealer in Northern California and the author of ''I Bought Andy Warhol,'' a book about the contemporary-art market. But Saatchi did this with many artists, and his focus remained on their best works, whereas the Mugrabis are indiscriminate when it comes to their preferred artists. ''They've bought up everything Warhol -- even the stuff that was considered junk,'' Polsky said. ''And a lot of the junk has turned out to be very valuable, too.''
 Their business model today puts the burden of decision-making not on taste but on whether a piece they're considering buying will aid their ability to affect the scarcity of the artist's work. Once, in 2006, Polsky said, he put up for auction a Warhol ''Flowers'' painting in which he owned a stake. ''The estimate was $1 million, but the Sotheby's auctioneer made it clear that the Mugrabis would be in the audience and they would like to see it get $1.5 million,'' he recalled. ''And that was almost exactly what it ended up selling for.'' The Mugrabis didn't purchase the piece. They just bid against the eventual buyer and ratcheted the price upward.
 ''That's a good strategy in a rising market,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, a gallerist who has bought and sold many paintings from and to the Mugrabis over the years. ''In a down market, we'll have to see how it works.'' More art that was until recently considered hard to get will likely come up for sale, making it more difficult for the Mugrabis to create artificial scarcity.
 There were always criticisms of overpaying. At an auction in New York in 1988, Jose paid nearly $4 million for Warhol's ''Twenty Marilyns,'' which consists of a repeated iconic head shot of the actress against an orange background. At the time, it was the record price for a Warhol -- more than twice the estimate -- and Jose hesitated. ''I had to push his hand in the air to make the bid,'' Alberto recalled. ''I was 18 years old. He was upset with me afterward.''
 ''I was upset but I was not upset,'' Jose said. ''People were making fun of me. The guy from the Figaro called to ask me if I knew what I was doing. I told him, 'I felt like I was buying a piece of America.' ''
 Just last year, Jose said, members of the Abu Dhabi royal family offered the Mugrabis ''several hundred million dollars'' for a group of works that included the painting. ''It was a very attractive offer, but we decided not to,'' Jose said. ''As long as I am here, it will be in my home.'' Technically, the brothers added, nearly everything in their collection is for sale. ''If we don't want to sell a picture, we ask like three times what the estimate would be,'' Alberto said. 
 On the circuit they travel, Alberto and David are regarded as princes of art and commerce, but culture was an acquired taste in their household, something they grew into alongside their father. Mary Mugrabi said her husband was at first deeply unmoved by her interest in art. ''I bought him his first picture 30 years ago,'' she recalled. ''He said: 'Why? What is this for? Who cares?' '' Previously, on their honeymoon in Madrid, she took Jose to the Prado. ''He said, 'Who cares?' '' Mary said. But when he became interested, she added, ''he moved so fast, I could not keep up.''
 That began in 1982, when Deitch, who was then an art consultant at Citibank, talked Jose into purchasing a Renoir landscape for $121,000, as an investment. ''He knew my account,'' Jose recalled. ''He started to insist that it is good to buy the Impressionists. I said, 'O.K., buy me anything you want under $100,000.' They insist on sending me the catalogs. Eventually, I begin to pay attention.''
 Jose's parents were Syrian Jews who ran a grocery store in Jerusalem. In 1955, when he was 16, he went alone to Bogota to live and work with relatives. ''The business of my uncle was shmattes,'' he said. He began as an office gofer and did everything from selling cloth to running errands. In 1961, he started his own wholesale fabric business and eventually became an importer.
 ''By the end of the '70s, the business became one of the biggest textile merchants in Colombia,'' he said. ''At the same time, it became very dangerous to live in the country -- a little kidnapping, you have to go with a bodyguard, you have to have an armored car.'' By the time his sons were around 12 and 13, he said: ''It became risky to send them to school. So we go to America.''
 Jose struggled -- first in Miami, then in New York -- to establish his business, which set in motion the decision to throw his time and resources toward his new hobby. ''In Colombia there was no fashion,'' Alberto said. ''My father would go to Italy and bring back last year's fabric and nobody cared -- the women wore dresses for three days in a row. The business model'' -- selling out-of-date fabric -- ''didn't work in America. So then it became art, art, art.''
 In 1987, Jose was at Art Basel, the annual collectors' fair in Switzerland, when he walked by the booth of a German dealer who was selling Warhol paintings. ''I liked the pictures,'' Jose said. ''I told a friend and he said, 'This is late Warhol' -- not so important. I said: 'I don't know what you mean. The paintings impact me.' The feeling I had -- before, it was nothing. Then, at that time, I feel something.''
 Jose bought all four paintings in a ''Last Supper'' series for $37,000 each (he estimates that each is worth $4 million to $6 million today), then quickly dismantled his nascent but not-insignificant collection -- by then it included Mark Rothko, Salvador Dali, Yves Klein and Honore Daumier -- to buy Warhols, Basquiats and Wesselmanns (''His three revelations,'' David Mugrabi called them).
 ''He has a good eye, but to say that this is the artwork I am going to put all of my money into, basically overnight -- it took such confidence,'' his friend Gabriel Safdie said. ''He had the belief, the capacity to assimilate, compute all the inputs, purify it, get rid of the fat and keep the caramel. He was buying Basquiat for $8,000 a picture, this man.'' He has since sold Basquiats for as much as $6 million and $8 million.
 In keeping with the janitor-to-fabric-king arc that everybody in the family relishes, Jose loves to talk about the market trajectories of artists he didn't invest in. ''In the 1960s, you could buy Warhol for $3,000, and you could buy Richard Lindner for $30,000,'' he said, chuckling. ''Now a Lindner is worth $200,000.''
 As the economic fortunes of Lindner and Warhol suggest, the art business -- the selling of taste, of authenticity, of goods that can be deemed by turns rare, innovative or irrelevant -- is a squishy industry, even in the best of times. The Mugrabis cannot know how much the market valuation of different works by different artists will rise or fall, or whose work will rebound more quickly, or not at all, after the art market reaches its bottom. Might Damien Hirst turn out to be the Richard Lindner of our times?
 ''I remember Alberto stopped by the museum four or five years ago -- it was the first time he'd ever seen it -- and I was giving him a tour,'' said Sokolowski, of the Warhol Museum. Sokolowski was struck by Alberto's appraisal of a ''Last Supper'' painting. '' 'Oh, that's beautiful,' '' he recalled Alberto saying. '' 'If I were you, I'd put an insurance value of $15 million on that.' I said, 'Oh, Alberto, you can't do that.' But to them, it would become sort of a self-fulfilling science to say everything is worth what you want it to be.''
 THE MUGRABI MEN ARE DARK, economically built and strikingly angular in their features -- especially Alberto, who looks as if he could have emerged from a Picasso canvas (''Les Demoiselles d'Avignon'' period). They operate out of a small office on Park Avenue at 57th Street. There are walls of bookshelves stacked floor to ceiling with artists' monographs and auction catalogs, but the doorway plaque and their e-mail addresses bear the name of Jose's textile business, Fashion Concepts Incorporated. When others in the art world talk about their moves and their taste, it is always under a collective umbrella -- as in ''The Mugrabis don't want it'' or ''That was bought by the Mugrabis.''
 It's rare to see any of the three Mugrabi men without at least one of the other two. They take breakfast together at the Four Seasons Hotel, or lunch at the restaurant in Lever House, the landmark midcentury office tower where Alberto and the building's owner, Aby Rosen, have commissioned and displayed a number of major pieces (including a 2007 Hirst installation for which they paid $10 million). In London, they rendezvous at Aspinall's, Jose's Mayfair gaming club -- though Jose prefers that Alberto play roulette at a different table. ''He only likes his privacy when he's losing money,'' Alberto joked on the night before the Hirst sale, as each of them frittered away thousands of pounds on each spin of the wheel.
 The sons talk about the art world as if it were the only place where any of them was meant to function -- as if other environments were not only too plain but also rigged against newcomers (and art, at least, was rigged for them). It can sound like a vestige of their third-world -- if wealthy -- upbringing. Alberto said that he and David went to somewhat-obscure colleges near Boston -- Bentley and Babson, respectively -- because they were ''the only schools that would take us. We didn't know anybody. We hadn't been in this country that long.''
 David often chides his older brother for not having married yet and for being a bit of a playboy. (David has two young children, lives on Park Avenue and goes to bed early; Alberto has lavish dinner parties at his Gramercy Park apartment and employs full-time household staff.) ''My father is able to pretend not to like a picture as much as he does, in order to get a better price,'' David said one day. Then he pointed at Alberto and said, ''Him?'' David shook his head.
 ''Alberto is much more emotional, and I admire that,'' Jose said later. ''But sometimes you can't buy a picture because you don't have the money. Sometimes we don't have the money, but Alberto still buys.''
 David does credit Alberto for saving him from his former career as a financial broker-dealer. ''I would call Alberto every morning when I got to work,'' David said one day at his parents' Trump Tower apartment. ''I was staring at a computer, and he was going to three-hour lunches, going to look at pictures, going to Paris. It was just much more enjoyable.''
 Jose, who was in the room, smiled at his son. ''Much more,'' he concurred.
 The Mugrabis' approach to art -- to the extent that it supports a specific characterization -- combines a sort of immigrant aesthetic with immigrant entrepreneurship. Jose described the artists they're fondest of as representing the ''true American commercial culture'' (Basquiat, Prince, Koons and even the Englishman Hirst) or ''what America gives to the rest of the world, like Coca-Cola and jeans'' (Warhol). They almost never share their collection with museums or galleries without charging a fee. ''But not much -- like one or two million dollars,'' Alberto said. Last year, when Jose learned that a sculpture by the Cuban duo Los Carpinteros he'd just donated to the Guggenheim was requisitioned to storage, he bought it back. ''From now on, if I make a gift, I tell them, 'You have to expose the art,' '' he said. 
 The sheer volume of the family's collection strikes some people as something that is in opposition to the public good. ''It's not that they don't love art,'' Charlie Finch, a columnist for Artnet.com, said. ''They've just been hogging everything. Come on, let someone else in on the game.'' It is often pointed out by fellow collectors that a number of patrons who own work on the level of the Mugrabis, like Saatchi, Eli Broad and Don and Mera Rubell, have opened museums to show off their art.
 What others see as hoarding, the brothers attribute, at least in part, to their father's wary nature. For years, the sons endured a sort of apprenticeship during which only their father could make decisions. ''Now both of us can buy what we want,'' Alberto said. ''But we talk everything through before we do it.''
 In 1998, Alberto paid around $250,000 for his first Hirst piece, a laboratory cabinet filled with medical supplies. ''My father saw it and said, 'What is this disaster?' '' Alberto said. ''He wanted to chop my head off. I said: 'Don't worry about it. This is great.' He said, 'No, this is not great.' He hated it so much, he made me sell in a year. It's probably worth $3 million now.'' (He gave that figure in August but says it's more like $1 million today.) 
 ''He's always asking us: 'Who's the next Warhol? Who's the next Basquiat?' '' David said. ''But he's skeptical of whatever we bring him.''
 One such artist, George Condo, said his relationship with the family began in the late '90s when a mutual friend brought Alberto to his studio to look at a painting of a jazz-album cover. ''I remember him saying, 'You've got to meet my dad,' '' Condo recalled. ''I think he put a reserve on it, and his father wouldn't let him buy it. But a few years later, they started buying my pieces in depth.''
 Condo considered it a pretty big stamp of commercial approval: ''They're prestigious collectors. To see your own paintings in one of their apartments, hanging next to a beautiful Basquiat -- it feels great.''
 WHEN THE DAMIEN HIRST auction ended, Jose rushed to the pulpit to high-five the auctioneer, then departed for a quiet dinner. David and his wife did the same. That left Alberto heading into the night through Mayfair ''to find Damien and celebrate.'' Alberto returned to his hotel, Claridge's, where Hirst has been living for much of the past year, but was unable to locate him. One of Hirst's assistants appeared in the lobby and informed Alberto that the artist was with his children.
 Alberto took a seat in the hotel lounge, where a party formed around him: Diane von Furstenberg, the fashion photographer Sante d'Orazio, friends of Hirst's who had been with him, playing snooker, when the ''scores'' from the auction came in. There were shout-outs to others who walked by: Ron Wood, Jack Black, Ben Stiller and William F. Ruprecht, the chief executive of Sotheby's, who entered making exaggerated, open-mouthed winks. 
 ''In one hour, 71 million pounds,'' he said.
 ''They said it was Black Monday -- well, not for Damien,'' Tony Shafrazi, a gallerist from New York, said. ''It was magic, it was. It was rainbows. This proves that art is more important than money.''
 ''Damien Hirst should be running Lehman Brothers,'' Alberto said. 
 ''People hear my music and they say, 'Oh, that's your passion,' '' said Antony Genn, a friend of Hirst's who used to be in the band Pulp. ''I say, 'Forget that.' '' Music, Genn said, ''is my life,'' and added, ''Damien Hirst came from nothing, and then, with aplomb, he goes and changes the world.''
 ''Ant! Ant! You'd rather not eat than give up your art,'' Alberto said to Genn. 
 It got late, and Alberto headed upstairs to bed before the entire crowd dispersed. ''Tomorrow, I will get up, and I'm going to Sotheby's for the day sale,'' he said. ''I want to buy a few more Damien pictures.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 22, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on March 1 about the art collectors Jose Mugrabi and his sons, Alberto and David, referred imprecisely to a sculpture of theirs that was at the Guggenheim. It was exhibited by the museum as a ''promised gift,'' but when the Mugrabis chose not to donate it, the museum returned it to them. It was not bought back by the Mugrabis.

HEADLINE: No Application Needed: College Tours

BYLINE: By JANE MARGOLIES

 BODY:
ON a cold Saturday morning in February, Shawn Pelak and David Parent were at the Sterling Memorial Library at Yale University, in New Haven, Conn., soon after the doors opened. But the couple, from Ann Arbor, Mich., wasn't there to hit the books. Ms. Pelak and Mr. Parent were spending the weekend in Hartford, 45 minutes north, and after downloading a walking tour of the Yale campus from the school's Web site, they had gotten in their car for a first-hand look. 
 Pausing in the entrance hall of the library, which was inspired by Gothic cathedrals, they peered up at the leaded-glass windows and vaulted ceiling. ''We're always curious about how other colleges do things,'' said Mr. Parent, a management consultant, who, like his wife, graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ''Whenever we're near a campus, we check it out.'' 
 College students, you've got company. The grassy quads and ivy-covered buildings that attract prospective applicants also make schools of higher education enticing for those with no interest in matriculating. Visitors can partake of world-class art collections and film screenings, not to mention more unusual offerings like the burial sites of Robert E. Lee and his horse, Traveller, on the campus of Washington and Lee University, in Lexington, Va. All this, without the pressure of studying for exams, or anteing up tuition.
 Steve Lake, a pit boss at a casino in Las Vegas, became so enamored of the hallowed academic ambience after visiting Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on his honeymoon to Boston in 1984 that he made touring colleges his hobby. This past October, he said, he dropped in on his 500th campus. ''I try to eat in a cafeteria or go to a bookstore or a game,'' he explained. ''I try to live in the moment.''
 The schools themselves, eager to sweep aside town-gown schisms of the past, say they are happy to play host.
 Stanford University -- whose palmy, sculpture-dotted campus in Palo Alto, Calif., is considered one of the prettiest in the country -- recently redesigned its Web pages, adding a section addressed to ''Tourists and First-time Visitors.'' This summer the school's visitor center will relocate from a ticket office in an auditorium lobby to spacious quarters with nearby parking. ''Tour buses show up with their own guides and disgorge passengers,'' said John Friesman, director of visitor relations, who estimates that 100,000 to 150,000 people come to the campus each year.
 And while Brandeis University, in Waltham, Mass., recently decided to shutter its Rose Art Museum and sell works in its collection to shore up the school's finances, elsewhere college museums -- many of them free and open to the public, as stipulated in their charters -- are fresh from construction projects, mirroring the general museum boom of the last decade.
 The Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design, in Providence, which last year opened its Rafael Moneo-designed Chace Center gallery space, teams up with nearby hotels to offer travel packages in connection with high-profile exhibitions (tickets to a recent Dale Chihuly show were combined with a room at the Providence Biltmore). Hope Alswang, the museum director, said that 75 percent of its visitors were unaffiliated with the college. ''When times are rough, maybe you can't go to the Cape for a week,'' said Ms. Alswang. ''But you might come to town for a museum show and lunch.''
 I decided to test this formula of college campus as inexpensive tourist destination with a quick, culturally edifying trip to New Haven. Long curious about the two fine-art museums at Yale, and having heard that a chic hotel, the Study at Yale, had opened in that same artsy part of the campus, I booked a room, printed out a calendar of events from the school's Web site, and boarded an Amtrak train in New York on a Friday morning; in two hours, I was checking into my Chapel Street digs.
 The Study at Yale -- which plays up the academic connection with old-fashioned spectacles for its logo and a bookmark slipped into the sleeve for the electronic room key -- did not disappoint. The lobby is a mod living room, furnished with clean-lined leather armchairs and a floor-to-ceiling bookcase full of art and architecture books. My seventh-floor room had a marble-floored bath, Tolomeo desk lamp, oak furniture with lightened finish and windows overlooking the slate roofs of the Yale campus.
 An intriguingly titled lecture I'd circled on my events calendar -- ''Extraordinary Tourists,'' about the Transcontinental Excursion of 1912, on offer at Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies -- was, alas, already under way, so I decided to get my bearings on a student-led campus tour departing from the Visitor Center, in a 1767 Federal house on Elm Street across from the New Haven Green.
 Among the 12 other tourgoers also braving the 29-degree temperature that afternoon was Elisabeth Striedinger, a 28-year-old marketing assistant from Vienna and a graduate of the University of Vienna. Ms. Striedinger, who was taking time out from a three-week vacation in New York for the trip to New Haven, said she had seen Yale portrayed on the TV show ''Gilmore Girls.'' (Rory ends up going to school there.) ''Everyone knows about Yale and the Ivy League,'' she said. ''Even in Austria.''
 Our guide, Matt Eisen, a junior majoring in economics and political science, led us to Old Campus, the blocklong yard where Yale's first buildings were constructed of brick in the mid-18th century. We also saw a couple of the school's 12 residential colleges, modeled on those of Oxford and Cambridge universities in England. The neo-Gothic buildings that make up the Yale colleges, Mr. Eisen noted, were constructed in the 1930s with materials that were doctored to look hundreds of years old -- the brick dribbled with acid, the panes for the windows purposefully mismatched, the slate roofs I'd admired from my hotel window composed of shingles whose edges had been methodically chipped before they were tucked into place.
 After my tour I saw real, not ersatz, Gothic at the Yale Center for British Art -- in the form of ''The Thames at Westminster Stairs'' by Claude de Jongh and intricately detailed oil paintings of the interiors of Westminster Abbey and Canterbury Cathedral. The museum's holdings, said to be the most comprehensive collection of British art outside Britain, swing from serene (the misty waterfront in ''Nocturne in Blue and Silver,'' by James McNeill Whistler) to severely buttoned-up (a room full of Elizabethan and Jacobean portraits, with staring eyes) to satirical (William Hogarth's ''Midnight Modern Conversation,'' depicting supposedly respectable middle-class men who have drunk themselves into a stupor). 
 It's all housed in a muscular 1977 building by Louis I. Kahn, who earlier had designed the Yale University Art Gallery, on the other side of Chapel Street. I'd just discovered the center's Library Court -- a triple-height, skylit space replete with comfy sofas from which you can take in monumental sporting scenes by the 18th-century painter George Stubbs -- when the guards began to shoo everyone out.
 Just as the arts have flourished in New Haven over the last decade, so, too, has the culinary scene, and I had my pick of Thai, Turkish and Cuban restaurants, in addition to my hotel's Heirloom dining room with its nouvelle New England cuisine. Instead I headed to Wooster Street, the city's Little Italy, for an authentic New Haven experience. The street is bookended by two pizza joints, Sally's and Pepe's, each with its rabid following -- and long wait times. I joined the line shivering outside Pepe's, the larger and brighter of two, and eventually was rewarded with a sizzling thin-crust pie that had been pulled out of a coal-fired oven on a wooden paddle with a 12-foot handle and unceremoniously plopped onto a paper-lined metal tray that the waitress slid onto my Formica table.
 The Art Gallery, which I got to the next morning, after a peek into the Sterling Memorial Library and the Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, was also hopping. This is the university's all-purpose art museum, with 185,000 objects from ancient times to today. Eighty to 85 percent of the gallery's visitors are members of the general public, according to the press officer. Indeed a grandmother and her toddling granddaughter, and people seemingly of all ages in between, had shown up for ''Picasso and the Allure of Language,'' on the top floor of the Kahn-designed main building, which was constructed in 1953 and now gleams after its recent restoration. (The museum's Gothic-style 1928 Swartwout hall, which has housed its American collection, is currently closed for its own renovation.) 
 The Picasso show explores the effect words had on the artist, and vice versa, pulling together some of his many paintings that incorporate lettering, his portraits of writers (including eight amusing lithographs of a jowly Balzac), and his own jottings (Picasso wrote hundreds of poems and two full-length plays). Some American works have been shoehorned into the third floor of the main building during the current renovation project. Under Kahn's crisply honeycombed concrete ceiling, the dazzling ''Brooklyn Bridge'' canvas by Joseph Stella, with its pointed arches and colorful prisms evoking stained glass, brought Yale's earlier building style to mind.
 Sated with art, and having spent not much more than the cost of my hotel room (both museums are free), I left the building to grab my bags for the return trip to New York. Students from an architectural rendering class were lined up outside the Swartwout building, sketching the Center for British Art just across the street. Megan Boon, a sophomore from Simi Valley in California, scrutinized the center's glass and matte-steel facade, and told me that she often spotted sightseers on campus. ''People are always walking around, taking pictures of the buildings,'' she said. ''It reminds me how lucky I am to be here.''

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
CAROLINE HALL was supposed to sign the contract a month ago guaranteeing a kindergarten spot for her son at an Upper East Side private school. He had already spent two happy years attending its early-childhood program. 
 But Ms. Hall, a corporate counsel, began ducking the school's calls. Where was her deposit toward the $22,000 tuition? The school had an eager waiting list.
 Her son, 4, knew the answer: ''I can't go here next year because Mommy didn't get a big enough bonus.''
 An annual rite is well under way, as families around the country receive their private-school renewal contracts or acceptance letters. In conventional years, grumbling over tuition aside, their outgoing mail would include signed forms and a registration fee. 
 This year's hand-wringing over tuition might be dismissed as the latest hardship for the patrician class, which, like everyone else, can simply educate its young in the public system. But of the more than three million families with at least one child in private school, according to the 2005 census, almost two million of them have a household income of less than $100,000. According to a Department of Education survey, in 2003-4, the median annual tuition of nonsectarian schools was $8,200; for Catholic schools, $3,000.
 So for every family that pays $30,000 and up to attend elite schools in Manhattan, thousands more will pay tuitions closer to $2,700 -- next year's cost for St. Agnes Catholic School in Roeland Park, Kan.
 To many parents who step outside the public system, an independent or parochial school is not a luxury but a near necessity, the school itself a marker of educational values, religious identity, social standing or class aspirations. Whether tuition payments to the country's 29,000 private schools are made easily or with sacrifice, many parents see the writing of those checks as a bedrock definition of doing the best by their children. 
 But this year, even as realistic qualms about employment, savings accounts and tuition increases stay their check-writing hand, parents across the economic spectrum feel guilty about somehow failing their children. Which priorities should shift?
 ''We're finding that people are setting a higher bar for private schools this year,'' said Roxana Reid of Smart City Kids, an admissions consulting firm in New York City. ''In the past, any school would do as long as it was private. But now they're saying, 'Let me take a second and third look at my local public school options.' ''
 How many private-school students will make the switch to public school will not be known for months. In past recessions, enrollments in independent schools remained stable, according to the National Association of Independent Schools, which represents 1,400 institutions with a median first-grade tuition last year of $14,640. But it may be different this year. Smart Tuition, a New York-based firm that handles payments for some 2,000 private schools across the country, said that by mid school year, 7 percent of families had already dropped out, double from last year. And administrators, financial aid counselors and parents themselves say many families have been questioning for the first time their ability to pay for private school -- and what to do if they cannot. 
 Ms. Hall, the lawyer, and her husband, who is an owner of a bar, thought they had those priorities figured out. To afford their son's tuition, the couple eschewed a new car, a nice vacation. ''Elementary school is where you establish a love of learning: you grab 'em or you don't,'' Ms. Hall said. ''So we put our eggs in his education basket.'' 
 But, she said, ''If I lose my job or my husband's bar goes under, I have to have a slush fund. Still, the realization that we can't send him back has been devastating.'' 
 What next? Unknown. 
 Uncertainty about next year dogs schools as well as parents, said Andrew Goldberger, chief executive of Smart Tuition. 
 ''The average parent with a high-interest credit-card bill, a mortgage payment that just increased, decreased revenue and bills piling up will pay the school last,'' he said. ''That's because most people know the local person who runs the school or go to church with that person, and they'll ask to pay it late.'' 
 Marcie Daniels, the bookkeeper at Holy Trinity Regional School, in Deptford Township, N.J., has been fielding more of those calls lately. So far this year, 15 parents at the parish school, ironworkers and insurance executives among them, have lost their jobs. 
 Her son-in-law, a mechanic for a bus company, was laid off that morning. ''My granddaughter won't be coming here for kindergarten next year,'' Mrs. Daniels said. ''I feel horrible.''
 She can't help with next year's $3,450 tuition; she is worried about her job. 
 Catholic parents are scarcely the only ones facing a quandary over religion, education and tuition.
 Jason Ross, a modern Orthodox Jew from Cedarhurst, N.Y., has sent his two children to a school where they learn secular and religious subjects, follow a religious calendar and keep kosher. But Mr. Ross, a pharmaceutical salesman, was laid off earlier this month. He is now thinking about the unthinkable: public school.
 ''I graduated from a yeshiva,'' he said. ''So did my wife. But it would be $28,000 for two kids this year.'' His voice trailed off. ''Sometimes I joke with the kids: 'The bus will come a little later in the morning, you'll be home by two, and you won't have as much homework. It will be good!' '' 
 While many parents choose private schools because that is where they were taught, for others, raised in the public system, private education represents a leap up for their children. A Manhattan psychologist, who, like her husband, is the child of immigrants and attended public schools, thought they could just manage the $35,000 cost and applied to one of the city's most sought-after schools. A few weeks ago, their daughter was accepted for sixth grade.
 ''I've been amazed at my level of indecision,'' said the mother, who requested anonymity so that her patients would not know about her personal life.
 Since September, the family's financial profile has melted. Her husband is self-employed in a construction-related field. Many of her patients are cutting back visits. Their college savings have disappeared. And they have a younger child as well.
 The therapist believed that especially in the tween years, her bright, sensitive daughter would need the attention that this private school offered. And yet.
 ''At 6 a.m. today, I decided I wasn't going to do it,'' said the therapist two days before the $3,400 deposit was due. ''I don't do well when I worry about money, and that's not good for our family as a whole. But at 8:30, we were in an elevator and a mom said: 'I hope you come. It's the best thing for our daughter. It's so rich emotionally.' And I thought, 'Oh, God!' and I started the obsessive reverie again.''
 Later, in an e-mail message, the therapist wrote that the family had decided to, as she put it, ''commit financial suicide.''
 Ms. Reid, the admissions consultant, said that families were re-evaluating the benefit of a private education.
 ''Some are reorganizing their financial lives, thinking that everything must go except for private education,'' she said. ''Others are considering paying tutors instead, to supplement public education.''
 The National Association of Independent Schools administers a financial aid program to 2,400 private schools. Applications for the 2007-8 year rose 4.3 percent from the previous year. But many other schools operate at the margins and have limited ability to reduce tuition for their families.
 Tuition next year at Grace Church School in Manhattan, which gives aid to 19 percent of its 417 students, will be $31,000. The school will give more aid next year: So far, about a dozen more families hit by the economy have asked for help. A few just need some unaccustomed advice about how to put their houses in order -- or on the market, if it's a second or third home. 
 ''We'll say, 'You can't really go to Vail this year and ask for financial aid,' '' said George Davison, the head of Grace Church. ''And they look surprised and say, 'But we already paid for the tickets!' ''
 Sarah B. Adler, the school's director of financial aid, said: ''The hardest thing we've seen is the family that has been O.K. and now all of a sudden has to ask for aid. That's where you have to be the most understanding. They're uncomfortable. They're embarrassed. It's about learning it's not two vacations a year anymore. The middle class in particular is being squeezed.''
 As Ms. Adler well knows. Her family temporarily moved in with her mother on Long Island 18 months ago when city life became prohibitively expensive. Her husband found a job at a private school there, which had allowed the boys to attend virtually tuition-free. But this fall, the family must start paying more. Public school? In which district? She doesn't know yet. 
 Parents are weighing options for September 2009. Some conclude that one child may benefit from private school but not the other. Or that they'll pay for private elementary school and then enter the public system. Or the reverse.
 Ms. Hall, the lawyer who must withdraw her son from his private school, is waiting for results of a lottery that will determine which of six public schools her child may attend. She has considered moving to New Jersey. But even though real estate prices there are down, property taxes are not, and she worries about selling their Manhattan apartment. 
 Recently she attended a contentious meeting about overcrowded public schools in her Upper East Side neighborhood. ''It was filled with people like me, desperate to get their kids educated,'' Ms. Hall said. ''And parents whose primary goal is to keep my kid out of their school.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Great Divide'' (Feb. 22), about tensions between longtime residents and recent South Asian immigrants in Bellerose, Queens: 
 While I was saddened by some of the quotes of Bellerose residents, I was not shocked. As a member of the South Asian community born in the United States and living near Bellerose, I understand that many longtime residents are uneasy with the demographic changes in the area. 
 That said, the stores, hotels and other businesses developed by the South Asian community represent more than ethnic food and foreign costumes. Each storefront, restaurant and vendor is chasing the American Dream sought by generations, no matter their class, creed or color. 
 These businesses reflect the American values of hard work and entrepreneurship. These values should be embraced. These economic times teach us that sink or swim, we are all in this together. Since recession fails to recognize color, why should prosperity be any different?

HEADLINE: Raising a Daughter to Thrive on Her Own, Then Struggling to Do the Same

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
One Saturday morning, in a downstairs room of the Upper East Side brownstone that houses the Rhinelander Children's Center a dozen or so deaf or hard-of-hearing children were engrossed in a spirited round of Red Hands, a game of reflexes that is an occasional feature of the center's weekend program. An argument was being settled with quick, emphatic hand signals.
 Two floors above, in another room, some of the children's mothers, having finished their sign-language tutorial, were discussing the delicate undertaking of raising an autonomous disabled child. One young mother expressed her distress that her deaf son had walked to school by himself after missing the bus. 
 ''He did not want me to walk with him,'' she concluded after a while. ''He wanted to walk by himself.''
 Her concern was met with particular empathy by Deborah Haynes, 59, a 17-year veteran of the meetings. Ms. Haynes's hearing-impaired daughter, Jennifer Thomas, 23, who was once enrolled in the children's program, is now one of its counselors.
 ''Raising a child with a disability is hard,'' Ms. Haynes said softly. ''I was always protecting Jennifer. We became two peas in a pod. As she got older, it almost got harder, because she kind of parted from me. I had to accept that she became independent.''
 Her daughter's budding adulthood had been a mixed blessing in more ways than one. After her daughter turned 21, in June 2006, Ms. Haynes's Medicaid plan changed because she no longer had a dependent, abruptly eliminating coverage of certain expenses. Ms. Haynes, who suffers from gastrointestinal disease and had her lower colon removed in 2003, had to begin paying for roughly $90 a month in medical supplies. For a while, Ms. Haynes managed. But meeting her bills became considerably more difficult after she was laid off from her $640-a-month part-time job at a nursing home in November 2007.
 After Ms. Haynes exhausted her unemployment benefits, she, her daughter and her 94-year-old cousin -- all of whom share a one-bedroom apartment in the Bronx -- had to rely on the daughter's $660 monthly Social Security disability benefits, the mother's $70 monthly pension from a former job and $643 in survivor's benefits. (Her husband, Stanley Haynes, a veteran, died of kidney failure in 1984.) 
 By March 2008, Ms. Haynes had fallen behind on her bills. The Children's Aid Society, which runs the Rhinelander Center and is one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, tapped the fund to pay Ms. Haynes's $196 Con Edison bill and $486 pharmacy bill It also supplied her with $100 in grocery store vouchers and $150 in coupons for clothing.
 After Ms. Haynes wrote a number of letters over many months, Medicaid resumed covering more of her medical supplies last November. Soon after, she began working part time at a nursing home near her apartment.
 Regaining her financial footing in some ways proved easier than coming to terms with her daughter's growing self-sufficiency.
 ''Partly because she was disabled, I built my world around her,'' Ms. Haynes told the group. ''I guess I have to find something for myself now. I guess I have to become independent again.''

HEADLINE: My New Gun

BYLINE: By BATHSHEBA MONK. 
Bathsheba Monk is the author of ''Now You See It . . . Stories From Cokesville, Pa.''

 BODY:
Back in late September, when my bank stocks began to tank -- slowly, then all at once, as Hemingway described going broke -- another wall in my life began to crack, as rumors of break-ins rattled my peaceful neighborhood in Allentown, Pa. The first indication that something was going on was the Crime Watch sign that suddenly appeared on the utility pole a block from my house. 
 To see what was happening, my husband and I attended a neighborhood-watch meeting in October at the nearby Christian and Missionary Alliance Church, where people suggested that crime was moving into our beautiful old neighborhood because the police were putting the squeeze on criminal activity downtown. A former city councilwoman sobbed as she told us how her home was broken into while she slept. An elderly man described how thieves ransacked his house in broad daylight. Some people were roving around different areas, stripping cars, the police liaison there told us, but evidently our stretched department could spare only three squad cars for the whole West End. We left feeling as if we'd have to batten down the hatches while the police tried to make it so uncomfortable for the drug gangs downtown that they'd move on. We signed up to be informed of future meetings and took the card of a local locksmith. 
 We live in a big old house with an open back porch and a three-tiered yard with trees. A year ago, I loved the fact that we were so open, that neighborhood kids and animals could play and hide here. But after that meeting, I began to see access points, places where we were vulnerable. ''We have five doors,'' I told my husband. ''And the windows are a joke. The cat knows how to open them.''
 Meanwhile, the financial news kept getting bleaker. A lawyer friend's real estate and bankruptcy practice morphed into a plain bankruptcy practice. I'd always heard that crime increases when the economy goes down, and I found myself thinking of some of my grandparents' stories about the Great Depression: people breaking the law out of desperation. 
 A friend told us to consider buying a gun to protect ourselves. The idea didn't thrill me. I'd fired an M-16 when I was in the Army years ago, could take it apart and put it back together in the dark, and my experience with firearms, and what they're meant to do, made me wary. 
 Still, I couldn't get the idea out of my head, and a few weeks later I called my friend Jimmy, a gun enthusiast, and asked him to take me along to a firing range ''just to see.'' He brought two handguns, each in a locked metal box, and showed me how to use them. The noise in the indoor range was frightening, even though I was wearing the same ear protectors as construction workers using jackhammers. But more unnerving were the other shooters. The man in the adjacent booth had set his target at 15 feet and was firing with a coolness and precision that chilled me. Two punk-styled boys put up their own targets, life-size blowups of a man and a woman. It was like going to get your driver's license and taking a good look at the people you were going to share the road with.
 ''You might as well get used to a .38,'' Jimmy said. ''A .22 is lighter, but you can't really stop anything with it. You want to make a nice big hole.''
 A few weeks ago, my husband went away on business, and after two sleepless nights starting every time the old steam radiators knocked, I finally decided I wanted protection. 
 Jimmy took me to the Army-Navy Store on Grape Street. It was 11 o'clock on Sunday morning, and 15 normal-looking -- I was relieved to see -- people were leaning on the gun counter at the back of the store. Jimmy explained the differences between the Glocks, semiautomatics with magazines, and the Smith & Wesson revolvers with six bullet chambers. The clerk told us a lot of handguns were out of stock; arms sales around the country have been increasing in inverse proportion to the collapsing economy and in response to the unsubstantiated buzz that the new administration is going to tighten gun control. 
 ''You want a revolver, to start,'' Jimmy said. I pointed to a dull pink Charter Arms revolver with a two-inch barrel: the Pink Lady. It looked like a toy. Jimmy laughed. ''You don't want a pink gun.'' 
 I watched the woman at the counter next to me test the feel of several Glocks while the young girl with her thumbed an electronic game. Then finally I picked out a Smith & Wesson .357 Magnum, ''the gun I started with,'' the clerk said. I handed him my driver's license and filled out the paperwork. He left us to run my license number through a criminal-records system called QuickCheck. Two minutes later I was qualified and, between gun and ammo, $762 poorer. The revolver I bought has a black handle and a four-inch stainless-steel barrel. There's nothing pink about it.

HEADLINE: Pumping Life Into a Performance Scene

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD 

 BODY:
 ''TO me,'' said Miles Marek on a sedate morning just before the new year, ''There is nothing more depressing than a dark theater.'' And so he is on a mission.
 As producing director and a founder of the Fairfield Theater Company, Mr. Marek in only a few years has become something of an impresario in Fairfield County, so far turning two underused venues into powerhouse theaters offering more than 150 concerts a year and orchestrating collaborations that have turned this swath of suburbia into an unlikely arts incubator.
 ''Our favorite word here is yes,'' said Mr. Marek, whose StageOne theater in an old industrial and warehouse complex here is in fact dark at this early hour. Mr. Marek sits just beyond its 200-seat arena stage at a folding table set with boxes of fresh muffins and bagels, and ringed by small offices. ''Somebody comes up with a good idea and a way to make it work, we'll do it.'' 
 But doing ''it'' has occurred in fits and starts since F.T.C. hung out its shingle in 2000 as a nonprofit theater-presenting and management organization. Though Mr. Marek's empire, which since November 2007 also has included the 1,400-seat Klein Memorial Auditorium in Bridgeport, has become a prized music stop, only now is it gaining enough stability to return to its theatrical roots. 
 For the first time in more than two years, F.T.C. is planning to present theater at StageOne, though the foundering economy slowed that return and exposed a kink in the company's financial formula, which until now has relied on ticket sales.
 ''It speaks to the whole economics at the moment,'' said Deb Margolin, a theater studies professor at Yale whose one-woman play, ''Oh Yes I Will,'' is expected to be the first theater piece out of the box in coming months. ''It's so much harder to produce theater than produce music.''
 The company's inaugural season in 2001 consisted of three plays performed at the Quick Center at Fairfield University. More than two years of nothing followed while F.T.C. located financing and the space it now occupies -- ideally wedged between Fairfield's prime retail strip and the Metro-North station. 
 The deal Mr. Marek struck with the town, which owns the property, was $1 a year in rent plus $2 for every paid admission, with F.T.C. responsible for renovations -- now totaling more than $650,000. StageOne opened in June 2004 with plays culled from what Mr. Marek felt were some of the best small productions New York had to offer.
 But within months, F.T.C. ran out of money. So Mr. Marek turned to music, which is much less expensive to present. 
 ''If you don't have the money to put on a play, put on something,'' he said. ''Get people in here and keep the place alive. And music allowed us to do that.''
 The acoustics of StageOne, the intimacy of the theater (no seat is more than a couple of dozen feet from the stage), the reasonable prices and the easy access by foot, car or train proved to be a winning combination, even luring audiences from New York. From chamber music to top jazz performers to well-known rockers in scaled-back form, to edgy up-and-comers, the theater has become a must-play on the New York-to-Boston circuit.
 ''What's not to love?'' said Tommy Malone, lead singer of the New Orleans band the Subdudes, which has played at StageOne at least four times and found it especially conducive to unplugged performances. ''It seems like a really grass-roots-movement-like thing,'' he said. 
 The British rocker Graham Parker, who now performs mostly solo and at least partly acoustic concerts, was at StageOne for the third time in January. He is on F.T.C.'s star-studded advisory committee, which also includes the actress Shirley MacLaine and the filmmaker Ang Lee. (Mr. Marek trained as an actor and had a small part in Mr. Lee's film ''The Ice Storm.'')
 ''We need gigs like this,'' Mr. Parker said. ''My audiences are older. They would rather come to a civilized venue than a bar that's like a hog trough.''
 The clientele bears out all of the above. ''I like that it's like this,'' said Jill Sautkulis, 43, pointing to the upscale bar, the lobby decorated with art photography and the subdued atmosphere before a show featuring the Tom Tom Club and Caravan of Thieves. ''You come, it's comfortable, you can get a drink; there's not a bad seat. You feel very close to the performers. It's not a lot of work. I live in Norwalk so it's a lot easier for me than going into the city.''
 Craig Sala, 35, a musician, and his wife Lisa, 28, at StageOne for the first time, had seen the Beach Boys at the Klein. ''The caliber of entertainment they have coming there is great,'' Mr. Sala said. ''It's definitely filling a void. Just the fact that anybody's promoting concerts on this level now is just outstanding. It's just cool that they exist.''
 That sentiment has helped F.T.C. become what is essentially a decentralized performing arts center as well as a community and arts magnet. While music has been the mainstay for the last few years -- with names at the Klein like Bob Weir, B.B. King and Jewel complementing some 500 performances at StageOne -- a number of other organizations have forged partnerships that are broadening F.T.C.'s scope. 
 The theater company now houses the Children's Cabaret Camp, a summer theater program for more than 200 children. Play with Your Food, a popular staged reading and lunch program in Greenwich, Westport and Fairfield, now runs its ticketing through F.T.C. and StageOne hosts the Fairfield lunch. Band Together, a group of local musicians who raise money for charities, holds concerts at StageOne, and a farmers' market is housed in F.T.C.'s warehouse.
 Collaboration is in the works with Fairfield University's Open Visions Forum, a speaker series at the Quick Center, to bring some of its more prominent speakers to the Klein's larger space. F.T.C. has received a grant to begin public access television production and to live-stream concerts. And Mr. Marek is open to managing other venues.
 For the Bridgeport-based band Caravan of Thieves, together less than a year, having a local high-quality theater where they have played more than a half-dozen times helped put them on the map, said James (Fuzz) Sangiovanni, the band leader. ''I think without that place it would have been a harder road,'' he said.
 Since 2004 Fairfield has earned about $65,000 from F.T.C., and the theater has been a boon to area restaurants and shops. ''I had high hopes for a positive impact,'' said First Selectman Ken Flatto. ''But I think it's surpassed everyone's expectation.''
 The immediate future, though, is tricky. In January, slow ticket sales and the loss of two sponsors pushed F.T.C. to delay its return to theater and begin a six-month $500,000 fund-raising campaign. Mr. Marek admitted that he should have emphasized income other than ticket sales earlier. The theater company's employees have agreed to pay cuts and other cost-cutting is planned.
 ''I can't tell you how many times over the last five years we've found ourselves at the same time on the verge of success and on the brink of collapse,'' Mr. Marek said. ''The future belongs to people who get out in front of this -- not for people who wait for the tidal wave to sweep over them.''

HEADLINE: A Season On Point, High and Low

BYLINE: By ALASTAIR MACAULAY

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY BALLET'S 14-week winter season had its share of pleasures, beauties, wonders. Some dancers gave performances that at least matched the achievement of those who created the roles in the 1970s and '80s; some dancers simply made you forget who had danced their roles before. 
 There was, above all, a wide spread of the world's best choreography on display, spanning chronologically from August Bournonville's ''Flower Festival in Genzano'' (1858) to Alexei Ratmansky's ''Concerto DSCH'' (2008) and including 17 of the Balanchine works in which ballet finds its peak. Much of this extensive repertory was in fair to excellent shape; and if you went back to see a ballet a second time, you usually found that the dancing had improved. 
 I have stated my general impression that the company is on the way up since the doldrums it hit between 1991 and 2002. One day I took a friend to a matinee; he had begun to follow the company before me and had followed it more closely during those dim years than I. Was I right that things had improved, I asked? He said simply, ''Ten years ago there was no Teresa Reichlen.'' 
 He may not have meant that Ms. Reichlen -- a soloist who dances only a few prima roles -- is the company's greatest dancer. But he was right to find her exemplary. Her often selfless style and clear, strong technique serve whatever choreography she dances, and she has become wonderfully versatile. Her Jan. 28 debut in the Rondo Alla Zingarese of ''Brahms-Schoenberg Quartet'' -- in a role choreographed by Balanchine for Suzanne Farrell -- was one of the season's special events; she took extravagant Romany choreography that, in lesser hands, can look crudely flamboyant and illumined it musically. There were other dancers -- Sara Mearns and Tiler Peck above all -- who were given more opportunities than Ms. Reichlen this season and seized them beautifully. I cannot here do justice to the gifted male dancers -- from principals down to the apprentice Chase Finlay -- whose zeal illumined many works.
 The season also had its shadows. On Dec. 8 the news came that one of the season's three new ballets, by the choreographer Alexey Miroshnichenko, would not take place for another year (thanks to awkward discussions with Prokofiev's estate over which version of the score ''Chout'' was to be used). On Feb. 5 the company announced that Darci Kistler, its one remaining dancer to have worked with Balanchine, would retire in 2010. On Feb. 20 it announced that because of a fall in box-office revenue (no surprise amid the current economic alarms) and an expected $5.5 million deficit, it was not renewing the contracts of 11 members of its corps de ballet.
 The Miroshnichenko postponement is the sort of cancellation that happens to every ballet company; unfortunately it means that ''Chout'' will occur months after, rather than before, American Ballet Theater's enterprising Prokofiev triple bill in June, which includes the world premiere of Mr. Ratmansky's ballet to an even less well known Prokofiev score, ''On the Dnieper.''
 I wish that I could say Ms. Kistler's retirement would be significant. On paper it's the end of an era. In fact that era ended long since. Ms. Kistler no longer dances any of the roles in which Balanchine or Jerome Robbins coached her. In the last two years she has made a good impression in a single ballet, Balanchine's ''Sonnambula''; that was not in repertory this season. The main glory of her dancing was over by 1992. Some insist that it ended with her first major injury, 10 years earlier. 
 Many dancers older and frailer than Ms. Kistler have still enchanted. But her performances this season were all inconsequential exercises in insipid, vapid, winsome charm, and they were, in the bad sense, weightless. She seems to be the chief reason certain ballets by the ballet master in chief, Peter Martins, who is her husband, were revived this season. ''Papillons'' is froth devoid of serious interest; ''Stabat Mater'' is the most sheerly inept work by Mr. Martins I have ever seen, particularly in its ill fit to the music. These are dim vehicles; they receive dim dancing.
 This is a harsh way to speak of Ms. Kistler in the period of her approaching retirement. I do so because her current style is one no younger dancer should imitate. Alas, it resembles the sweetly pretty way in which a number of the company's female dancers now deliver choreography of consequence. The company has some young principal dancers -- notably Megan Fairchild and Abi Stafford -- who are skilled technicians but seem unable to behave as if their dancing were a matter of adult consequence. Cotton-candy girlishness threatens to congeal even their best work. 
 In January and February you could see both Ms. Fairchild and Ms. Stafford trying to shake this off. Ms. Fairchild relished the bite and daring of ''Coppelia'' and ''Steadfast Tin Soldier''; her speed in ''Divertimento No. 15'' had real juice behind it. Though Ms. Stafford's dancing in ''Concerto Barocco'' did not explain why she is a principal (nothing does; she lacks any authority), she refreshingly showed herself as a real dancer, capable of daring and spontaneity. 
 That adolescent, trivial quality -- not the same as youthfulness, which can be life enhancing -- is too widespread. It grew more pronounced in Ms. Kistler as her technique began to wane in the early 1990s, and it did much to nip the promise of Yvonne Borree in the bud. It also hangs over Sterling Hyltin, whose best dancing has extraordinary radiance and ease, and Maria Kowroski, whose unaffected grandeur and calm lyricism are often phenomenal. You long for these women to be decisive, to take charge (the ballerina's task) and draw the whole theater into the alchemical spell that can occur with the marriage of dance and music. 
 Ms. Hyltin and Ms. Kowroski nonetheless had good seasons. Janie Taylor, though she seems not to have much allegro strength, had a better one: she combined youthfulness and decisiveness marvelously, and her dancing seemed to emanate straight from her imagination. In ''La Valse'' her heroine had a hunger for the dark that brought this ballet's nervous system into new relief; in ''Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze' '' (in the yellow dress) her delicacy and intensity were marvelous and rightly made people ask whether the role had ever looked so good. 
 Wendy Whelan, though greatly flawed as a stylist, has no hint of adolescent uncertainty about her. Her womanly assurance wins many admirers, and I am always sorry that her dancing gives me little pleasure; with the tension throughout her physique, she's like a dynamic soprano who sings every note sharp. 
 The company has tended to pigeonhole too many dancers along the lines established by the ballerinas of Balanchine's last decade: Ms. Borree is cast as if she were Kay Mazzo reborn, Ms. Kowroski along the lines of Allegra Kent and Ms. Farrell; Ms. Fairchild is given the Patricia McBride parts; and so on. It's my memory that as long as Balanchine was interested in a dancer, he kept casting her against the grain: the flashing technician Merrill Ashley was given the mysteries of ''Emeralds''; the romantically grand Ms. Farrell, the intimate ''Duo Concertant''; the sparkling Ms. McBride, the pastel delicacies of ''Sonatine.'' 
 Fortunately this principle has been revived for Ms. Mearns, the company's newest principal. (She joined the corps only in 2004.) She does bravura (''Stars and Stripes''), lovelorn Romantic poignancy (the Vienna Woods scenein ''Vienna Waltzes,'' another ''was this ever better done?'' episode) and the imperious craziness of ''Brahms/Handel'' (Maria Calegari's role). Here she's a giddy girl, there a poised woman. And I like that the company gives major opportunities to her and to the young soloist Ms. Peck, who joined the corps in 2005 and is quite another stylist. 
 Ms. Peck has a superbright allegro technique, but she has also taken on touching Romantic heroines and character roles, and along the way she has acquired an invaluable sense of theater. She takes responsibility for what the audience sees, and she shapes it; and she is learning to take the audience into her world. In Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations'' -- in one of the most exacting of all roles -- she had technique to spare, and her contrast between the role's outgoing attack and its contemplative adagio was glorious. She has the most profound asset of the true ballerina: time. She keeps it, plays with it, suspends it.
 How do the season's ups and downs add up? The news that the 11 corps dancers would lose their jobs arrived on a day when Nilas Martins made one of his infrequent appearances onstage. Mr. Martins, who joined the company in 1986 and became a principal in 1993, danced precisely two roles this season: in the Gold and Silver scene of ''Vienna Waltzes'' (five performances) and a supporting part in ''Davidsbundlertanze'' (three). Both roles were created for his father, Peter Martins, by Balanchine, but there is absolutely nothing that Nilas Martins brings to either role that many other men in the company could not do better. Even in the Victorian attire of either ballet, he is now portly. 
 For these appearances he is earning a salary that could be better spent on more than one of the corps dancers now released. Most of New York City Ballet's artists were fighting the recession all winter; but a few, including some close to the ballet master in chief, were embodying it.

Leah Price is a professor of English at Harvard and the author of ''The Anthology and the Rise of the Novel.''

 BODY:
In a scuffed-up college classroom in Dartmouth, Mass., 14 people page through a short story by T. C. Boyle. They debate the date at which the action is set: when was the Chevy Bel Air released, and what was the drinking age in New York State that year? They question moral responsibility: when the three friends in the Bel Air assault a girl, should peer pressure be blamed for their impulse, or hormones, drink, sin? To which the man at the head of our table rejoins: ''There's a kind of complexity to human experience that isn't always recognized. You try to figure out who's right and who's wrong, but sometimes both are wrong, right?'' 
 Of the 14 people, a dozen are male. One is an English professor, one is a graduate student, two are judges and two are probation officers. The eight othersare convicted criminalswho have been granted probation in exchange for attending, and doing the homework for, six twice-monthly seminars on literature. The class is taught through Changing Lives Through Literature, an alternative sentencing program that allows felons and other offenders to choose between going to jail or joining a book club. At each two-hour meeting, students discuss fiction, memoirs and the occasional poem; authors range from Frederick Douglass to John Steinbeck to Toni Morrison, topics from self-mutilation and family quarrels to the Holocaust and the Montgomery bus boycott. 
 Robert Waxler, a professor of English at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, and the man at the head of the table, founded the reading program in 1991 with Superior Court Judge Robert Kane and Wayne Saint Pierre, a probation officer; since then, it has expanded to eight other states. Led by literature professors, the program has brought thousands of convicts to college campuses even as the withdrawal of Pell grants from prisoners (who were ruled ineligible for federal college financing in 1994) drove a wedge between the two state-funded institutions where young adults do time. Meanwhile, rehabilitative reading has spread from Waxler's original all-male seminar to similar women-only and mixed-sex groups, to one-time experiments like the seminar on ''The Road Not Taken'' to which a Vermont judge last year sentenced 28 young partyers who broke into Robert Frost's old house, leaving a trail of booze and vomit. Picture ''Remembrance of Things Past'' as a literary ankle bracelet that keeps you chained to the desk for months. 
 The terms Waxler uses at the opening session have one foot in literary criticism and another in psychotherapy: ''exploration,'' ''ambiguity,'' ''journeying.'' But new-age gerunds give way to old-fashioned imperatives when the professor hands off to the probation officer: good cop, bad cop. Or rather, ambivalent cop. 
 ''I don't want to be all negative,'' the officer begins, ''but you have to read this book.'' Not as in ''This is a must-read,'' but ''We've had people go to jail for not reading.'' 
 Any schoolchild knows there's nothing new about required reading. But since the Vietnam draft ended, college professors like me have rarely had the obligation, or the opportunity, to hand bad students over to the secular arm. One instructor, Terri Hasseler of Bryant University in Rhode Island, pauses to search for a euphemism before explaining that ''it's a condition of their . . . situation that they have to do the reading.'' 
 Changing Lives Through Literature looks less exotic when you remember how many probation sentences require attendance at 12-step programs. There, too, stories provide a catalyst -- with the difference that in Waxler's program, the narratives belong to fictional characters, not to participants themselves. Here, oversharers are politely cut off; one man whispers the rest of an autobiographical anecdote to the guy next to him, another waits for the break. Yet the professor talks of ''working through,'' and as I listen to the words students use to describe literary characters, it's hard not to hear echoes of time spent in rehab: ''He made some bad choices.'' ''She hadn't figured out a healthy way to deal with the problem.'' ''He hit bottom before he realized that it just wasn't him.'' 
 Oprah's Book Club has taught us all to reduce (or elevate) books to prompts for cathartic discussion of childhood traumas, relationship conflicts and self-esteem deficits. Like Oprah's reading list, the program's canon is dominated by fiction and memoir. But the demographics of the program differ substantially from your average book club, which is disproportionately white and even more disproportionately female and middle-class. Even without uniforms, it's easy to tell who's a student and who's an official. The course depends, however, on suspending those differences. ''The stories serve as a mirror for everyone,'' Waxler told me, ''not just the offenders -- the professors, the probation officers, the judge.'' The average court official is more literate than the average convict, but not necessarily more literary: for the judge, too, classroom discussion can be a revelation. 
 Reading has always provided a lifeline for prisoners, whether for utilitarian purposes or for spiritual searching. (In 2006, when Beard v. Banks upheld a prison's right to deny inmates access to printed matter, religious and legal texts were among those excepted.) A broader literary tradition stretching from medieval English dream visions to Solzhenitsyn's novels situates the most intense and uninterrupted reading in prison. (Waxler points out that ''cell'' can refer to the space in which monks write as easily as to a room in jail.) Traditionally, books have offered virtual escape from physical confinement. In alternative sentencing programs, though, books provide a more literal alternative to incarceration; and the authorities' job is not to censor books, but to supply them. 
 It's easy to dismiss the program as utopian, or worse. Waxler reports being berated by parents paying college tuition for the same classes that felons receive free. If the program works, its economic logic is unassailable: running it costs roughly $500 a head, Waxler says, as opposed to about $30,000 for a year of incarceration. But that's a big if. The most conclusive study, which shows program participants achieving half the recidivism rate of a control group, involved fewer than 100 people. More important, the literacy level needed to participate makes its population a self-selecting one, and even among those students with the skills to participate, many never make it to the final session. On the day I attended, one man missed class because his halfway house had imposed lockdown, another because a new conviction had landed him back in jail. 
 ''Poetry,'' W. H. Auden once wrote, ''makes nothing happen.'' But Waxler insists that ''literature can make a difference'' -- more specifically, that lives are touched by printed art as they can't be by the act of sitting around a table arguing about a movie, a song, a self-help book or one's own childhood. The probation officer begins by telling participants that ''this program isn't a miracle,'' but it works in mysterious ways. Perhaps reading stories allows participants to form narratives (whether conscious or not) about their own past and future. In a study of more traditional 12-step programs, the criminologist Shadd Maruna has argued that recovery from addiction requires the ability to distinguish a ''before''from an ''after.'' Searching for terms to explain the mechanism by which literature ''changes'' readers, participants come up with ''turning points,'' ''epiphanies,'' even ''grace.'' ''When it's working,'' Waxler says, ''this discussion has a kind of magic to it.'' 
 There's nothing surprising about the idea that certain books teach lessons, whether the Bible or ''The Last Lecture.'' Here, though, the medium becomes the message: the act of reading changes -- or, as we used to say, converts -- the reader, even when the texts being read contain no explicit moral injunctions. Like Sunday school pupils, graduates of Changing Lives Through Literature are given a book along with their diploma. It hardly matters that the traditional leatherette Bible is replaced by a sleek black volume from the Library of America.

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Horses

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: MANORVILLE, N.Y. 

 BODY:
 MONA T. KANCIPER scanned the pastures that ring her blue and white barn, now at close to capacity and crammed with four-legged creatures temporarily, and in some instances permanently, residing here for lack of anywhere else to go. As the hard-driving president of New York Horse Rescue, a nonprofit organization that had its origins in the rehabilitation of racetrack castoffs but now copes with all breeds in all manner of predicaments, she is more interested in rescuing horses than whispering to them. But, like most horse-lovers, she occasionally does that as well.
 By chance, she met the liquid brown eye of a previously homeless, malnourished and unwanted Irish thoroughbred named Maple, plucked from a backyard shed on Long Island. His ribs poked out like bicycle spokes and his attitude verged on sour when she took him in. Hunger and loneliness had taken a toll. Trust issues? He had those, too. 
 ''This is definitely a very bad time to be a horse,'' Ms. Kanciper said, confirming the negative development -- driven by panicky, cash-short owners and an unforgiving economy -- that has uprooted Maple and an as-yet-unknown number of his species. Reports of a surge in abandoned or neglected horses; of overcrowded rescue, auction and retirement facilities; and of unwanted equines being fattened in feedlots before being shipped to slaughter in Mexico and in Canada have prompted the Unwanted Horse Coalition, an offshoot of the American Horse Council, to undertake a national survey on the problem. 
 According to Dr. Tom Lenz, a veterinarian who is the chairman of the coalition, although the elimination of domestic slaughterhouses has reduced the total number of horses killed, 100,000 to 150,000 are still exported for slaughter each year. ''So we know they're unwanted,'' he said. ''America needs a wake-up call about this issue. The general population has this love affair with the horse without realizing the costs and complications of owning horses in this economy.'' 
 The expense of euthanizing horses that are sick, lame, old or dangerous is creating an ill-timed rise in ''irresponsible owners,'' Dr. Lenz said, and a new class of unwanted -- and in some cases discarded -- beasts. He finds logic in California's proactive, if grim, response to the problem: It has established low-cost equine euthanasia centers. 
 Results of the national survey on unwanted horses are scheduled for release next month. But those in the rescue business, like Ms. Kanciper, 46, who worked in Manhattan as a commercial real estate appraiser before transforming her Long Island farm into a horse haven in 1998, already have the living data occupying their barns and straining their financial resources. When donations, adoption fees and her twice-yearly fund-raisers fall short of covering the rescue operation's annual expenses of $150,000 to $200,000, Ms. Kanciper supplements the budget from her own pocket. She and others running rescue organizations say that the economy has left fewer people willing, or able, to help.
 ''Nobody's adopting these horses; it's been kind of a record winter in that regard,'' said Patty Wahlers, who operates the Humane Organization Representing Suffering Horses, a rescue facility on 47 acres in Washington. Besides the dozens of horses, many of them retired police horses, she sustains on her farm, she supplies a feed-assistance program that is helping five other horses stay with their owners. 
 ''Hopefully the people who genuinely want to keep their horses are getting smarter about spending and learning to conserve, to cut back on shows, lessons, trailering and whatnot,'' she said. 
 At Ray of Light Farm in East Haddam, Bonnie Buongiorne said the faltering economy has caused her to re-evaluate her mission. Since 2004 she focused on finding homes for unwanted foals that are an inevitable byproduct of the manufacture of Premarin, a hormone replacement therapy drug made in Canada using urine from pregnant mares. Now, based on calls she gets from people who say they cannot make a commitment to adopt Premarin foals because they cannot afford to keep the horses they already own, Ms. Buongiorne says she thinks her rescue efforts may need to be redirected closer to home. ''We may have to rethink what we're trying to accomplish and concentrate on helping out the horse owners in our own backyard,'' she said.
 Though it is a less dire phenomenon than horses being dumped at auction, there is an unprecedented glut of horses being offered for outright adoption or free lease by owners who suddenly cannot afford the upkeep, which in the New York metropolitan area can range anywhere from $350 a month for rough board (figure on shoveling manure and supplying the feed yourself) to the $2,500 per month (exclusive of lessons, training or other add-ons) charged by top-shelf equestrian boarding facilities. The cost of an adequate supply of hay and grain to feed a thousand-pound horse is $400 a month.
 Art Morano, who owns Stargate Farm, a 70-stall equestrian facility in Allentown, N.J., confirms that the recession has left his business suffering. ''We're hanging on by the threads,'' Mr. Morano said. ''Last year at this time I maybe had five empty stalls. Now there's 35.'' 
 Boarders who owned multiple horses, he said, are culling their herds or getting out of ownership altogether. A major blow to his barn came last fall when Frank Hernandez, a trainer who had 22 hunter jumper horses under his direction at Stargate, took a position in Tennessee because the signs were evident that business in New Jersey, where he had worked about 20 years, was trailing off.
 At Twin Lakes Farm in Bronxville, N.Y., home to 30 lesson horses and 25 private boarders, the riding instructors still give an average of 1,500 lessons each month, but a significant statistic has reversed itself in the past year.
 ''It used to be that 80 percent of the kids took lessons twice a week and 20 percent came once a week, but now it's the exact opposite,'' said Scott Tartar, the owner-manager. ''So we're doing the same amount of lessons, but we're teaching twice as many kids.''
 The barn has also cut back on its horse show excursions. It once sent out 8 to 10 clients and their horses each weekend; now it transports just 5 show participants every other weekend. Sales are basically at a standstill. ''February was always a slow month, but it's gone from slow to closed,'' Mr. Tartar said.
 There is no seller's market for midrange horses either. At Wit's End Farm in Jackson, N.J., Yolanda Mazzarisi is asking $30,000 for Oops, $25,000 for Edelweiss, both mixed-breed warmbloods, and $20,000 for Amigo del Diablo, a large pony, but has not received any serious offers.
 ''The economy has reduced our income, which is why we are selling them and probably a fourth horse,'' Ms. Mazzarisi said. ''And we'll definitely have to negotiate our prices the same as anyone out there who's trying to sell anything.''
 In the Hamptons, Christine Barrett-Distefano runs the Amaryllis Farm Equine Rescue, an antislaughter network that since 2005 has rescued 76 horses, many of them elderly or sickly. This winter, she said, the sanctuary has been overwhelmed by returnees and besieged by newcomers surrendered by cost-cutting owners.
 ''Aramis was returned by his adoptive family because the builder dad saw a huge decline in work,'' Ms. Barrett-Distefano said as she began to name a few. ''Star and Trace were adopted to a real estate broker in Lake Placid, and we just sent them money for feed because we don't have room for them here. Arapahoe is a paint pony who was desperate for housing whenhis owner, a dog-groomer and mother of three, could no longer afford his board bills when the dog-grooming business dropped off.''
 The situation in a nutshell: People lose their jobs or their bonuses. Next they lose their animals. 
 ''Everybody's interpretation of financial hardship is different,'' said Ms. Kanciper, who began adopting washed-up thoroughbreds from local tracks 10 years ago. ''But in an uncertain economy like this, the first thing to go are the so-called luxury items like horses and boats. Except that boats don't have feelings.''
 Horses not only react to pain but also bond with their human handlers, which is why Ms. Kanciper, although not opposed to euthanasia, does not regard it as an answer to the plight of the horses in her care unless they are hobbled by chronic pain or are terminally ill. ''I try not to be a softy -- in my business you really can't if you want to survive -- but it's very hard to euthanize a horse,'' she said. ''You look into those big brown trusting eyes, and. ...'' It's a last resort. 
 Maple, the headstrong 11-year-old gelding whose only sin was being a slowpoke on the track and a financial drag on the Long Island owner who acquired him after his racing career expired, did not shrink from Ms. Kanciper's gaze. ''When you want to be an adoption facility, not a euthanasia facility, sometimes you have to make hard choices about the horses you agree to take in,'' she said. 
 And Maple? ''He's adoptable,'' she said. ''He just needs the right rider.'' 
 Offered a carrot, Maple cheerfully accepted it. So did Lunaticonthegrass, a chestnut gelding both younger and mellower than Maple, and Mr. T, a nearly 30-year-old roan quarter horse seized in a neglect case by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Here, these unwanted herd animals live in a full-service facility with ample equine companionship instead of languishing alone in a backyard. They are fed twice a day and ridden regularly by Ms. Kanciper and an assistant to give them a better chance of being deemed adoptable by people wanting pleasure horses, not pasture pets. 
 Compared with some, Maple and Lunatic, the sweet-tempered 4-year-old thoroughbred who, despite his name, lacked the competitive instinct to excel on the turf, have it made. Should nobody else ever want them, Ms. Kanciper guarantees them a forever home for the remainder of their natural lifespan. Or until her hay runs out, which is becoming an unsettling possibility, with too many mouths to feed and -- as a nonprofit dependent on contributions -- not enough money to cover the escalating costs of food and bedding. Hers is a plaint shared by many in the rescue business. 
 ''Donations are down by 75 percent this winter, and adoptions are down by 75 percent as well,'' she said. ''I'm down to my last $1,000 in the hay budget. I've got 10 or 15 horses on my waiting list, and in the last six weeks there's been a tremendous number of people calling me up, begging and crying, and asking me to take their horses because they can't afford to feed them anywhere. The economy is making people desperate. But I can't take in more horses than I can feed. Do that and you defeat your own purpose and risk becoming a rescue case yourself.''
 About 50 horses, including 20 she owns, reside at Ms. Kanciper's two rescue facilities. The main one is the 50-acre farm she owns with her husband, Dr. Judson L. Butler, an equine veterinarian here on Long Island (where the horse population is estimated at 40,000). The second is five miles away at Hart's Cove in East Moriches, a former potato farm that is now home to a gated community that includes eight horses and an upscale condo-and-town house subdivision. Thanks to an open space covenant, Ms. Kanciper leases the barn and pastures for $1 a year. The catch is that the arrangement specifies a maximum of eight horses. Stall space is maxed out until Lunatic or one of his ex-racehorse pals finds a home.
 Last month Ms. Kanciper received a distraught call from Carolyn LeRoy, of Ridge in Suffolk County, who adopted a thoroughbred, Reno, now 8, from her in 2004 but is struggling to pay his feed and maintenance bills. 
 Ms. LeRoy asked Ms. Kanciper if she could take the horse back. Ms. Kanciper, knowing Reno has a good home, asked Ms. LeRoy to try and keep him and volunteered her husband, Dr. Butler, to handle any medical emergencies. ''It took the pressure off,'' said Ms. LeRoy, who also has a 32-year-old horse she has owned for three decades. ''I'd rather die than give my old guy away. And if Reno left, it would break the old guy's heart. I'm in a bad place with this.'' 
 Ms. LeRoy's husband has since persuaded her to hang onto the horses she loves and cut corners elsewhere in their budget for as long as necessary; not having to worry about any horse-size emergency veterinary bills has made that option possible. But most owners cannot count on a Dr. Butler to help them navigate financial and medical setbacks. 
 There are some happy endings. Five abused horses seized last year by the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have all been adopted; 15 rescued horses, many of them bound for slaughter, now live in style at the Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard; and Whinny the Blue, an arthritic paint pony taken in by Ms. Kanciper, found a home last month as a pasture companion in Mattituck. 
 Her departure freed up one spot; predictably, the organization made room for two, Royal Congaree and Baby Suave. Hard to say no to a thoroughbred filly named Baby Suave.

HEADLINE: Property Owners Lash Double-Digit Tax Increase

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: WEST NEW YORK 

 BODY:
 FIST and voice both raised, Carole Rodriguez, 64, joined hundreds of outraged residents in front of City Hall on a recent Friday afternoon to protest a 27 percent property tax increase.
 ''It's immigrants and working people who make this city what it is, that's why we love it,'' said Ms. Rodriguez, who saw the taxes on her small, one-bedroom condominium jump $1,200 a year. ''We're being priced out.''
 City officials say the tax increase is the only way to plug a more than $15 million budget shortfall in this working-class town of around 46,000 with a nearly $70 million annual budget just across the Hudson River from Manhattan. 
 State officials say that West New York is the most exaggerated example of how towns throughout the state are coping with declining revenues as the national recession trickles down to Town Hall. ''The bottom line is you've got an economic crisis that is having a horrendous impact on our local government's ability to maintain its present tax base,'' said William G. Dressel Jr., executive director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities. ''And a state government that has been reducing the property tax relief funding at a time when it's needed most by citizens and taxpayers to offset the most regressive tax in the nation, which is New Jersey's property tax.''
 Robert Corrales, a spokesman for the governor's office, said that the administration is reviewing the federal stimulus package that President Obama signed, but that it is not yet sure if or how it would affect aid to cities and towns. Chris Hoene, director of policy and research for the National League of Cities, said the stimulus money would go toward specific municipal government programs, like transportation or helping people stay in their homes, which could indirectly ''shift the burden'' away from property taxes. 
 He added that in New Jersey, as well as several other predominantly northeastern states, the property tax is the primary source of municipal revenue, as opposed to the sales or income tax. 
 ''It's the lack of other options that forces this scenario,'' he said. 
 West New York will lay off 100 municipal employees, around a quarter of its work force, including police and fire personnel, officials said. 
 Joseph McConnell, the business administrator for West New York, said the city incurred millions in debt from rolling bills over year after year, like insurance payments. 
 Last year the city plugged part of the hole with $9 million it raised from selling a municipal parking garage to the Hudson County Improvement Authority, Mr. McConnell said, though the town was still forced to raise property taxes by more than 20 percent. This year the city had no other properties to sell, Mr. McConnell said, and the only option was to raise property taxes again. 
 ''It's like a wave that crashes down on you,'' he said. ''Our backs were against the wall.''
 Raymond Morejon, 52, a florist who has run a shop on 61st Street since 1981, said that the tax raises threaten to put him out of business, as he has had to borrow money to pay the increase. He has attended several of the town's antitax rallies and circulated petitions calling for the mayor to step down.
 ''This was the wrong time and the wrong amount,'' he said. ''It's like, overboard.''
 The national recession, which has led to declining home sales and decreased revenues for towns and cities, may not be the biggest player in West New York's current budget drama. Mayor Silverio A. Vega, known as Sal, blamed the town's former chief financial officer, Darren Maloney, for the budget shortfall. Mr. Vega said Mr. Maloney kept the municipality's commissioners in the dark about the town's mounting debts. 
 ''After suspending our C.F.O. in August we saw the magnitude of the problem,'' Mr. Vega said. ''While he was there it was hard to understand how he kept the finances of the town.''
 Mr. Maloney could not be reached for comment. 
 Many angry city residents don't believe the mayor's claim that the budget could have been so far off balance without his knowledge.
 ''He can't blame one person, he's the mayor of the town, he's supposed to oversee everybody,'' said Ana Pereira, 41, who owns a restaurant called Ana's Kitchen and also circulated a petition calling for Mr. Vega to resign. 
 Felix E. Roque, a doctor who said he planned to run against Mr. Vega in the 2011 election and has recently been giving fiery speeches to crowds of hundreds opposing the tax increase, said many residents are now forced to choose between their taxes and their basic necessities. 
 ''A lot of people are sleeping in the cold or eating one meal a day,'' he said. ''This is killing us.''
 Statewide it is too soon to know how many towns will be hit with a large property tax increase, said Joseph V. Doria Jr., commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs.
 ''Many municipalities are still in the process of introducing their budget,'' he said. 
 Along the Hudson River, on what is commonly referred to as New Jersey's Gold Coast, residents in Hoboken are feeling the sting of a 47 percent property tax hike, enacted because the state sent in a supervisor to manage the city's finances after the city council failed to pass a budget.
 ''When the budget is adopted for 2009 and 2010 you're going to see a substantial leveling off of our tax levy,'' said David Roberts, the departing mayor.
 Officials in West New York also said that property taxes should level off next year and in the future increase only from 2 percent to 3 percent annually just to keep pace with inflation. Their words have offered little solace to home and business owners grappling with how to make ends meet after this year's raise. 
 ''This is impossible, I haven't paid my utilities, I haven't paid anything,'' said Claire Lima, 55, an out-of-work homeowner who said that after the increase, her property taxes jumped to $3,000.

HEADLINE: The Quad Eustachy Gives Back A $25,000 Bonus

BYLINE: By JOHN TEMPLE

 BODY:
Larry Eustachy is in his fifth season at Southern Mississippi, and the Golden Eagles (14-14, 4-10 Conference USA) are struggling. 
 So, what has Eustachy done?
 On Friday, he said he was giving a $25,000 bonus back to Southern Mississippi, partly because of the economic downturn and partly because he had not done a good job. 
 ''Until I can turn around the program, I have told the administration that I do not want a contract extension and I will donate part of my compensation package back to Southern Miss to help during these difficult economic times,'' said Eustachy, who is best known for being fired from Iowa State in 2003 after photographs surfaced showing him drinking with college-age women. 
 Southern Mississippi Athletic Director Richard Giannini accepted Eustachy's offer. Eustachy has a base salary of $380,000; the $25,000 bonus is a separate part of a compensation package based on incentives and ticket sales. JOHN TEMPLE

 BODY:
THE real estate market in Manhattan has become so unnerving to buyers that some are forfeiting six-figure deposits rather than close on deals they have made. 
 At 304 Spring Street, a sleek condominium building in SoHo with stunning Hudson River views, the buyer for the duplex penthouse recently decided he would not go through with the deal and walked away from a $780,000 deposit.
 At 1120 Park Avenue, a classic prewar co-op filled with multimillion-dollar apartments, it appears that a buyer forfeited a deposit of as much as $1.1 million. 
 Real estate agents representing buyers of at least three other multimillion-dollar properties also report clients who knowingly left deposits of more than $1 million or hundreds of thousands of dollars on the table.
 In each case, the buyers had signed their contracts before the financial meltdown last fall, but decided in recent months that because values in the luxury real estate market have dropped 20 to 40 percent, it no longer made sense to go through with their deals.
 Sam Chandan, the president of Real Estate Economics, a research company in New York, said the fact that people were forfeiting such large deposits was ''indicative of the degree of uncertainty in the market.''
 Given how difficult it has become in recent months to get a mortgage, he said, even buyers at the high end may be concerned about getting financing to complete their deals.
 And because the volume of sales has dropped to a trickle in the luxury market, ''there are so few comps that it's hard to even know what a property is worth,'' he said, referring to comparable-sales data. ''That uncertainty undermines people's sense of what the actual value might be, so they're taking actions designed to limit their exposure.''
 In some cases, agents say, buyers who signed contracts before the market started to fall have managed to renegotiate the sales prices to reflect the current market more accurately. 
 Frederick W. Peters, the president of Warburg Realty, said his agency had had two multimillion-dollar deals in which buyers had forfeited six-figure deposits. ''In both cases,'' he explained, ''the buyers felt that any renegotiation wasn't going to satisfy them and they preferred to remove themselves from the market for a while.''
 Their decisions, he added, were ''driven by the fact it's a new world and they were not sure what they wanted to do with their resources in the face of that.'' When they re-enter the market, Mr. Peters said, they will very likely be able to buy similar properties at prices low enough ''that they will still have saved money, even after walking away from their deposits.''
 Other walk-away buyers, though, have not given up on the current market and are already searching for other properties to buy. 
 Penny Toepfer-Guttman, an agent at Brown Harris Stevens, represented someone who gave up more than $1 million in a deposit on an apartment in a new development in Manhattan. She said her client had decided that the original apartment was too unusual a space and that he was now looking for something more conventional. 
 The first unit, she said, had a huge amount of outdoor space, and because it was priced above $10 million, ''he would have been paying more per square foot than anyone else in the neighborhood.'' The developer, whom Ms. Toepfer-Guttman would not name, refused to renegotiate the price, so the buyer walked. 
 Ms. Toepfer-Guttman, who has been an agent for 17 years, said, ''I have never seen numbers like this being left in deposits; this is new territory.''
 At 304 Spring Street last August, a buyer went into contract on a three-bedroom three-bath penthouse with three terraces, for $7.8 million. But when the market ground to a near-standstill in October, the buyer, a professional basketball player, backed out of the deal and gave up his deposit, said Richard Orenstein, an executive vice president at Halstead Property.
 The penthouse, which first went on the market in October 2007 at $9.25 million, has since been appraised at $6.5 million, and its owner has decided to offer the property in a sealed-bid auction-like process in March, with a starting bid of $4.995 million.
 Mr. Orenstein says the owner decided on this process because he plans to move soon to Italy with his wife and baby. ''This is a seller -- and it's rare -- who is really being realistic,'' he said. ''He feels this is the best way to get the best offer for the apartment quickly and to close the deal.''
 The starting bid has been set below the appraised value to generate interest. ''Somebody is going to get a very good deal on this,'' Mr. Orenstein said. ''If someone wants value, they're not going to get better than this in downtown Manhattan.''

HEADLINE: Barbie at 50: Unwrinkled and None the Wiser

BYLINE: By MARY JO MURPHY

 BODY:
Can't we just forget for a moment that I once skewered sequins and stuck the loaded pins through your tiny plastic earlobes into your tiny empty head? We both turn 50 this month, Barbie, and I propose we celebrate a half-century of shared history. You can wear the earrings (my ears aren't pierced, for some reason). I'll blow out the candles (you remember what happened last time you got too close to flames).
 Those '60s and '70s were heady decades for a girl growing up, weren't they, Barbie? So much social upheaval and role changing -- it was enough to make your head spin. (I know you can. Stop it.) 
 I trace your eerie equanimity in the face of it all straight back to 1959, the year of our birth. Alaska joined the union just weeks before we arrived; Hawaii a few months after. It was the year a federal court in New York lifted the postmaster general's ban on using the mails to distribute ''Lady Chatterley's Lover.'' The year Fidel Castro took over Cuba and ''The Sound of Music'' opened on Broadway. It was pretty clear from the start that you were more in tune with the kind of gal who, like Maria, would sew killer outfits out of loud curtains in a pinch, because come the revolution -- any revolution -- you really had no idea what to wear. 
 Even in 1959, changes were afoot for women in the world. Mary Leakey was unearthing the skull of the ''nutcracker man'' in Olduvai Gorge. Evelyn Wood was sharing her speed-reading tricks. Elizabeth Ann Seton was headed for sainthood. There were gains: the Saudi monarch decided to allow education for girls. And there were setbacks: the Swiss voted to reject a constitutional amendment to allow women to vote and run for office; the British made it illegal for prostitutes to loiter, so women took to walking dogs to avoid getting arrested for looking the part. That last bit of 1959 lore might have interested you, modeled as you were after Lilli, a German pornographic toy who spent a lot of time loitering and come-hithering on the car dashboards of the German men she was marketed to. ''A Teutonic fantasy,'' M. G. Lord called her in her biography ''Forever Barbie.''
 But you ignored it all. 
 This pattern developed throughout the '60s, with the assassinations, the marches, the war; and the '70s, with Gloria Steinem and Patty Hearst and finally Maggie Thatcher, by which time we'd at last reached our majority. You simply didn't do funerals or riots, sit-ins or bra-burnings or kidnappings. When Nixon went to China, you went to Malibu. If a happening had no glove-and-handbag ensemble, it didn't exist for you. You were neither pro-choice nor pro-life, you were pro-Barbie. 
 How did you do it, B? How could you stay cool as a curvy cucumber while the rest of us cold-war babies were crouched head-down under our school desks for air-raid drills?
 And yet, there were those quirky exceptions, when you either anticipated the times or acknowledged their rougher edges. Astronaut Barbie appeared in 1965, four years before the moon landing. Did Sally Ride have a Barbie? She would have been 13 then. And Desert Storm Barbie appeared right after the first Gulf war, Pentagon-approved. Perhaps you remembered that Saddam Hussein also burst on the scene back in '59, when at 22 he joined a failed coup against the Iraqi leader who, coincidentally, had given Iraq its first female cabinet minister. 
 My mother found my case of your clothes in her basement the other day, Barbie. Among the semi-surviving garments was a glamorous calf-length cobalt blue coat she had knitted. Had she snipped a bit of her own mink stole, a gift from her mother, to make the collar? She didn't remember. Perhaps it's time we donated all that vintage gear to Recession Barbie. Mother has moved on to knitting socks for my husband. (You never did wear the wedding dress. Was I wrong to make you bunk with Gumby?) 
 Happy Birthday, Barbie. Now stay well away from the flames.

HEADLINE: In Towns of Many Means, Feeling the Budgetary Pain

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

DATELINE: Greenwich 

 BODY:
 OVER the course of 35 years, Ennio De Vita worked his way up in Greenwich town government from engineering technician to manager of field operations. Last month, when he showed up for work at Town Hall, as he had done for much of his adult life, Mr. De Vita was escorted from his office after learning that he had lost his job.
 Mr. De Vita was one of 38 municipal employees laid off, and town officials warn that more spending reductions -- possibly including more layoffs -- are necessary for the town to make up a $31 million budget shortfall caused by declining revenues. In just the last few weeks, they have ordered several managers to turn in their town-owned cars, and they have created concern over plans to outsource the town's longtime home health care aide service.
 As cities and towns across the state wrestle with budget shortfalls stemming from the recession, municipal workers are losing jobs in places as large as Bridgeport, with a population of about 138,000, and as small as New Canaan, with about 19,000 residents. The Greenwich layoffs are its first in memory, town officials said. 
 ''A lot of towns are being pressured to submit pretty much a zero increase in taxes,'' said James J. Jaskot, deputy finance director of Cheshire and president of the Government Finance Officers Association of Connecticut. ''As far as layoffs go, I think you're going to see a lot,'' he said.
 Municipal officials blame a variety of factors for the revenue shortfalls, including declining home sales, a decrease in state revenues for cities and towns and the national recession. Greenwich, like many towns in Connecticut, relies heavily on revenues from its conveyance tax, which is paid when real estate changes hands. With home sales falling, Greenwich is facing a $5 million gap in the budget for the current fiscal year, and for town leaders, the choice has come down to cutting jobs or raising taxes more than the usual 2 to 4 percent per year, something officials said they did not want to consider.
 That $5 million gap, in addition to projected shortfalls in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, brings the total shortfall to the expected $31 million, town officials said.
 Last fall, with signs that revenues were declining, the town froze all job vacancies and ordered a 10 percent reduction in expenditures other than salaries. But when they learned that the decline in revenues from the conveyance taxes, building permit fees and interest income would total $8 million to $10 million this year, town officials decided to take more drastic measures. And after making the cuts last month, now First Selectman Peter Tesei has said that Greenwich may have to cut an additional 31 positions before this fiscal year ends if negotiations with the town's unions over a proposed wage freeze and possible voluntary retirement incentives fail. 
 Until recently, a job with the town of Greenwich meant job security. ''Most people who work for any municipality assume stability, but this economy is not like anything we have seen in 50, 70 or 80 years,'' said John Crary, Greenwich town administrator.
 The elimination of the jobs -- 19 full-time and 19 part-time -- ''will not affect services in a meaningful way,'' Mr. Crary said. 
 Layoffs are a last resort, he said. ''There is also a belief in a lot of people's minds that this is a longtime problem and we need to get smaller,'' he said.
 Mr. De Vita said that when he was escorted from his office the day of his layoff, Feb. 12, he was unable to say goodbye to coworkers. Because he had driven to work in his town-owned car, he needed a ride home from a colleague and had to make an appointment the next day so that he could listen to his phone messages.
 ''It's easy to lay off people, but hard to do it with class,'' said Mr. De Vita, 74, who won an Award of Excellence from the town in 2002 and earned close to $90,000 a year as manager of field operations. 
 Lynn Mason, business manager for Laborers International Union of North America Local 136, said she wasn't surprised that there were layoffs, ''but I was surprised by the way they were handled,'' she said. ''There was no compassion for the employees. Ennio was never offered a chance to retire. He gave his life to this town, and he deserved better,'' she said. 
 Greenwich now has 2,400 employees, with about 1,400 of those in the school district. The school board might eliminate 22 1/2 positions, Mr. Crary said
 The state budget deficit for the current fiscal year, as much as $1.3 billion by some estimates, is the big unknown for municipalities that rely on state aid to pay for certain programs. State officials say they have not yet determined how much of Connecticut's estimated $2.8 billion over three years in federal stimulus money will be going to cities and towns. But those funds are meant for infrastructure work, like highways and waterways. ''It will not affect city operating budgets that much,'' said Richard Moccia, mayor of Norwalk.
 Norwalk, already facing the possible loss of 30 city positions in the 2009-10 budget, just learned it will lose $525,000 in state aid, said Thomas Hamilton, director of finance. Revenue from interest income, real estate conveyance taxes, building permits and clerk recording fees is $2 million short, and he predicted that figure would stretch to $3.2 million next year. 
 Norwalk officials have proposed voluntary retirement incentives. ''We are trying to work compassionately and with understanding,'' Mayor Moccia said. ''I think our layoffs will be minimal.''
 The intent is to reduce job cuts as well as ''bumping,'' whereby senior employees can bump someone with less seniority out of a job. Bumping can cause departments to lose key people in key positions, Mr. Hamilton said. ''It's a pretty disruptive process,'' he said.
 The targeted positions would include an assistant library director, a highways supervisor and a fire inspector. He said that the only other layoffs he knew of were in the 1990s and were spread out over several years. 
 In Bridgeport, which has a $20 million deficit, layoffs started last year, and the town clerk and city clerk have reduced public office hours so that their smaller staffs have time to process mounting paperwork. In the zoning department, two computer operators lost their jobs, one because her position was eliminated, the other from bumping. ''The challenge for me is to keep the department operating in such a manner that the public doesn't feel we're shortchanging them on our service,'' said Dennis Buckley, head of zoning enforcement. In New Haven, Mayor John DeStefano Jr. has said that without $10 million in concessions from workers, nearly 241 positions will be cut, as many as 166 of them full time.
 New Canaan, which like Greenwich is one of the state's wealthiest communities, is not immune either. Cheryl Jones, human resource director, said the town laid off four nonunion workers, is leaving five openings vacant and has offered a couple of public works employees a voluntary retirement package to try to close the growing budget gap of just over $1 million. She anticipates next year's finances will be worse, ''but it's hard to know until we see who's paying what,'' she said, referring to property tax payments due July 1. 
 Will there be more layoffs? ''I sincerely hope not, but the picture changes every week,'' she said. 
 A delicate balancing act is occurring from one end of the state to the other. ''Loss of services will be on the table in just about every community,'' Mr. Jaskot said. ''They will have to weigh that against layoffs.''

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: Beware the False Dawn

BYLINE: By STEPHEN S. ROACH

 BODY:
IT would be premature to declare an end to America's recession at the first sign of a resumption of growth. After the unusually steep declines in the economy late last year and early this year, a statistical rebound in the second half of 2009 would hardly be shocking. It could be driven by the gyrations of the inventory cycle. Or it might reflect the first digs of the stimulus package's ''shovel-ready'' projects. 
 But any such whiffs of growth are likely to herald a false dawn, because the consumer remains in terrible shape. American families have lived beyond their means for more than a decade by borrowing against their over-valued homes. With both the housing and the credit bubbles having burst, their stock portfolios down and their jobs threatened, consumers have been shocked into a new frugality. They are likely to be restrained for years to come. The consumption share of gross domestic product is still 71 percent -- down from a peak of 72 percent but well above the 67 percent that prevailed from 1975 to 2000.
 This points to an unusually anemic upturn, at best -- not strong enough to keep the unemployment rate from rising to near 10 percent over the next year and a half. Since it's hard to call that a recovery, it looks to me as if this recession won't end until late 2010 or early 2011.

HEADLINE: Hard Times for Horses

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

DATELINE: MANORVILLE 

 BODY:
 MONA T. KANCIPER scanned the pastures that ring her blue and white barn, now at close to capacity and crammed with four-legged creatures temporarily, and in some instances permanently, residing here for lack of anywhere else to go. As the hard-driving president of New York Horse Rescue, a nonprofit organization that had its origins in the rehabilitation of racetrack castoffs but now copes with all breeds in all manner of predicaments, she is more interested in rescuing horses than whispering to them. But, like most horse-lovers, she occasionally does that as well.
 By chance, she met the liquid brown eye of a previously homeless, malnourished and unwanted Irish thoroughbred named Maple, plucked from a backyard shed on Long Island. His ribs poked out like bicycle spokes and his attitude verged on sour when she took him in. Hunger and loneliness had taken a toll. Trust issues? He had those, too. 
 ''This is definitely a very bad time to be a horse,'' Ms. Kanciper said, confirming the negative development -- driven by panicky, cash-strapped owners and an unforgiving economy -- that has uprooted Maple and an as-yet-unknown number of his species. Reports of a surge in abandoned or neglected horses; of overcrowded rescue, auction and retirement facilities; and of unwanted equines being fattened in feedlots before being shipped to slaughter in Mexico and in Canada have prompted the Unwanted Horse Coalition, an offshoot of the American Horse Council, to undertake a national survey on the problem. 
 According to Dr. Tom Lenz, a veterinarian who is the chairman of the coalition, although the elimination of domestic slaughterhouses has reduced the total number of horses killed, 100,000 to 150,000 are still exported for slaughter each year. ''So we know they're unwanted,'' he said. ''America needs a wake-up call about this issue. The general population has this love affair with the horse without realizing the costs and complications of owning horses in this economy.'' 
 The expense of euthanizing horses that are sick, lame, old or dangerous is creating an ill-timed rise in ''irresponsible owners,'' Dr. Lenz said, and a new class of unwanted -- and in some cases discarded -- beasts. He finds logic in California's proactive, if grim, response to the problem: It has established low-cost equine euthanasia centers. 
 Results of the national survey on abandoned horses are scheduled for release next month. But those in the rescue business, like Ms. Kanciper, 46, who worked in Manhattan as a commercial real estate appraiser before transforming her Long Island farm into a horse haven in 1998, already have the living data occupying their barns and straining their financial resources. When donations, adoption fees and her twice-yearly fund-raisers fall short of covering the rescue operation's annual expenses of $150,000 to $200,000, Ms. Kanciper supplements the budget from her own pocket. She and others running rescue organizations say that the economy has left fewer people willing, or able, to help.
 ''Nobody's adopting these horses; it's been kind of a record winter in that regard,'' said Patty Wahlers, who operates the Humane Organization Representing Suffering Horses, a rescue facility on 47 acres in Washington, Conn. Besides the dozens of horses, many of them retired police horses, she sustains on her farm, she supplies a feed-assistance program that is helping five other horses stay with their owners. 
 ''Hopefully the people who genuinely want to keep their horses are getting smarter about spending and learning to conserve, to cut back on shows, lessons, trailering and whatnot,'' she said. 
 At Ray of Light Farm in East Haddam, Conn., Bonnie Buongiorne said the faltering economy has caused her to re-evaluate her mission. Since 2004 she focused on finding homes for unwanted foals that are an inevitable byproduct of the manufacture of Premarin, a hormone replacement therapy drug made in Canada using urine from pregnant mares. Now, based on calls she gets from people who say they cannot make a commitment to adopt Premarin foals because they cannot afford to keep the horses they already own, Ms. Buongiorne says she thinks her rescue efforts may need to be redirected closer to home. ''We may have to rethink what we're trying to accomplish and concentrate on helping out the horse owners in our own backyard,'' she said.
 Though it is a less dire phenomenon than horses being dumped at auction, there is an unprecedented glut of horses being offered for outright adoption or free lease by owners who suddenly cannot afford the upkeep, which in the New York metropolitan area can range anywhere from $350 a month for rough board (figure on shoveling manure and supplying the feed yourself) to the $2,500 per month (exclusive of lessons, training or other add-ons) charged by top-shelf equestrian boarding facilities. The cost of an adequate supply of hay and grain to feed a thousand-pound horse is $400 a month.
 Art Morano, who owns Stargate Farm, a 70-stall equestrian facility in Allentown, N.J., confirms that the recession has left his business suffering. ''We're hanging on by the threads,'' Mr. Morano said. ''Last year at this time I maybe had five empty stalls. Now there's 35.'' 
 Boarders who owned multiple horses, he said, are culling their herds or getting out of ownership altogether. A major blow to his barn came last fall when Frank Hernandez, a trainer who had 22 hunter jumper horses under his direction at Stargate, took a position in Tennessee because the signs were evident that business in New Jersey, where he had worked about 20 years, was trailing off.
 At Twin Lakes Farm in Bronxville, home to 30 lesson horses and 25 private boarders, the riding instructors still give an average of 1,500 lessons each month, but a significant statistic has reversed itself in the past year.
 ''It used to be that 80 percent of the kids took lessons twice a week and 20 percent came once a week, but now it's the exact opposite,'' said Scott Tartar, the owner-manager. ''So we're doing the same amount of lessons, but we're teaching twice as many kids.''
 The barn has also cut back on its horse show excursions. It once sent out 8 to 10 clients and their horses each weekend; now it transports just 5 show participants every other weekend. Sales are basically at a standstill. ''February was always a slow month, but it's gone from slow to closed,'' Mr. Tartar said.
 There is no seller's market for midrange horses either. At Wit's End Farm in Jackson, N.J., Yolanda Mazzarisi is asking $30,000 for Oops, $25,000 for Edelweiss, both mixed-breed warmbloods, and $20,000 for Amigo del Diablo, a large pony, but has not received any serious offers.
 ''The economy has reduced our income, which is why we are selling them and probably a fourth horse,'' Ms. Mazzarisi said. ''And we'll definitely have to negotiate our prices the same as anyone out there who's trying to sell anything.''
 In the Hamptons, Christine Barrett-Distefano runs the Amaryllis Farm Equine Rescue, an antislaughter network that since 2005 has rescued 76 horses, many of them elderly or sickly. This winter, she said, the sanctuary has been overwhelmed by returnees and besieged by newcomers surrendered by cost-cutting owners.
 ''Aramis was returned by his adoptive family because the builder dad saw a huge decline in work,'' Ms. Barrett-Distefano said as she began to name a few. ''Star and Trace were adopted to a real estate broker in Lake Placid, and we just sent them money for feed because we don't have room for them here. Arapahoe is a paint pony who was desperate for housing when his owner, a dog-groomer and mother of three, could no longer afford his board bills when the dog-grooming business dropped off.''
 The situation in a nutshell: People lose their jobs or their bonuses. Next they lose their animals. 
 ''Everybody's interpretation of financial hardship is different,'' said Ms. Kanciper, who began adopting washed-up thoroughbreds from local tracks 10 years ago. ''But in an uncertain economy like this, the first thing to go are the so-called luxury items like horses and boats. Except that boats don't have feelings.''
 Horses not only react to pain but also bond with their human handlers, which is why Ms. Kanciper, although not opposed to euthanasia, does not regard it as an answer to the plight of the horses in her care unless they are hobbled by chronic pain or are terminally ill. ''I try not to be a softy -- in my business you really can't if you want to survive -- but it's very hard to euthanize a horse,'' she said. ''You look into those big brown trusting eyes, and. ...'' It's a last resort. 
 Maple, the headstrong 11-year-old gelding whose only sin was being a slowpoke on the track and a financial drag on the Long Island owner who acquired him after his racing career expired, did not shrink from Ms. Kanciper's gaze. ''When you want to be an adoption facility, not a euthanasia facility, sometimes you have to make hard choices about the horses you agree to take in,'' she said. 
 And Maple? ''He's adoptable,'' she said. ''He just needs the right rider.'' 
 Offered a carrot, Maple cheerfully accepted it. So did Lunaticonthegrass, a chestnut gelding both younger and mellower than Maple, and Mr. T, a nearly 30-year-old roan quarter horse seized in a neglect case by the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Here, these unwanted herd animals live in a full-service facility with ample equine companionship instead of languishing alone in a backyard. They are fed twice a day and ridden regularly by Ms. Kanciper and an assistant to give them a better chance of being deemed adoptable by people wanting pleasure horses, not pasture pets. 
 Compared with some, Maple and Lunatic, the sweet-tempered 4-year-old thoroughbred who, despite his name, lacked the competitive instinct to excel on the turf, have it made. Should nobody else ever want them, Ms. Kanciper guarantees them a forever home for the remainder of their natural lifespan. Or until her hay runs out, which is becoming an unsettling possibility, with too many mouths to feed and -- as a nonprofit dependent on contributions -- not enough money to cover the escalating costs of food and bedding. Hers is a plaint shared by many in the rescue business. 
 ''Donations are down by 75 percent this winter, and adoptions are down by 75 percent as well,'' she said. ''I'm down to my last $1,000 in the hay budget. I've got 10 or 15 horses on my waiting list, and in the last six weeks there's been a tremendous number of people calling me up, begging and crying, and asking me to take their horses because they can't afford to feed them anywhere. The economy is making people desperate. But I can't take in more horses than I can feed. Do that and you defeat your own purpose and risk becoming a rescue case yourself.''
 Around 50 horses, including 20 she owns, reside at Ms. Kanciper's two rescue facilities. The main one is the 50-acre farm she owns with her husband, Dr. Judson L. Butler, an equine veterinarian here on Long Island (where the horse population is estimated at 40,000). The second is five miles away at Hart's Cove in East Moriches, a former potato farm that is now home to a gated community that includes eight horses and an upscale condo-and-town house subdivision. Thanks to an open space covenant, Ms. Kanciper leases the barn and pastures for $1 a year. The catch is that the arrangement specifies a maximum of eight horses. Stall space is maxed out until Lunatic or one of his ex-racehorse pals finds a home.
 Last month Ms. Kanciper received a distraught call from Carolyn LeRoy, of Ridge in Suffolk County, who adopted a thoroughbred, Reno, now 8, from her in 2004 but is struggling to pay his feed and maintenance bills. 
 Ms. LeRoy asked Ms. Kanciper if she could take the horse back. Ms. Kanciper, knowing Reno has a good home, asked Ms. LeRoy to try and keep him and volunteered her husband, Dr. Butler, to handle any medical emergencies. ''It took the pressure off,'' said Ms. LeRoy, who also has a 32-year-old horse she has owned for three decades. ''I'd rather die than give my old guy away. And if Reno left, it would break the old guy's heart. I'm in a bad place with this.'' 
 Ms. LeRoy's husband has since persuaded her to hang onto the horses she loves and cut corners elsewhere in their budget for as long as necessary; not having to worry about any horse-size emergency veterinary bills has made that option possible. But most owners cannot count on a Dr. Butler to help them navigate financial and medical setbacks. 
 There are some happy endings. Five abused horses seized last year by the Suffolk County Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals have all been adopted; 15 rescued horses, many of them bound for slaughter, now live in style at the Baiting Hollow Farm Vineyard; and Whinny the Blue, an arthritic paint pony taken in by Ms. Kanciper, found a home last month as a pasture companion in Mattituck. 
 Her departure freed up one spot; predictably, the organization made room for two, Royal Congaree and Baby Suave. Hard to say no to a thoroughbred filly named Baby Suave.

HEADLINE: George Mason University, Among First With an Emirates Branch, Is Pulling Out

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In 2005, George Mason became one of the first American universities to open a branch campus in the United Arab Emirates -- but in May, it will become the first to close its campus there, never having graduated a single student. 
 ''Our partners there changed their policy three months ago with regard to the amount of subsidy they were willing to provide,'' said Peter N. Stearns, the university's provost. ''They did not tell me directly, 'We're getting hit, you have to understand our situation,' but given the timing, I think it's fair to say this was about the economy.'' 
 George Mason has struggled since it opened its branch in Ras al Khaymah, an emirate with neither the dazzle of Dubai nor the oil wealth of Abu Dhabi. 
 It never attracted many students, with about 120 in degree programs and 60 in its English-language program. None of the faculty members came from the home campus, there was constant turnover in the leadership, and the branch had not completed the lengthy process of gaining local accreditation. 
 In recent years, many American universities have been drawn to the Persian Gulf by lucrative deals in which a local entity -- in this case, a government-supported foundation -- provides all of the infrastructure and financial support, and the American university oversees the academic program. 
 New York University is setting up shop in Abu Dhabi, Michigan State in Dubai. Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Georgetown, Northwestern, Texas A&M and Virginia Commonwealth all have programs in Qatar.
 And recently, Bryn Mawr has been in discussions about starting a women's college in Abu Dhabi, although college officials did not answer repeated requests for comment about the status of the discussions.
 But the George Mason experience highlights some of the difficulties overseas branches face. 
 To maintain their credibility, they must admit students by the same standards overseas as at their home campus. But finding students with excellent English skills, SAT scores comparable to their American counterparts and college-ready academic preparation is not easy. 
 ''You cannot give an American degree if you don't maintain your standards, so in that sense we were doing exactly the right thing,'' Dr. Stearns said. ''But it is a real recruitment barrier. Education leaders in the emirates themselves acknowledge that the preparation is not at the same level.'' 
 There is also the question of academic control. The vice president running the branch campus reported to Dr. Stearns, as United States accreditation requires. But the job has recently been held by an interim leader, and the local backers did not want to pay to hire a new vice president, seeking instead a leader who would report to them. 
 Dr. Stearns said he hoped the Ras al Khaymah students, mostly expatriates from South Asia and other Middle Eastern countries, would transfer and attend George Mason in Virginia, where he said they would get a discount on out-of-state tuition. But, he said, there is no guarantee that they can get visas. 
 And because of the lack of local accreditation, the students' would have limited ability to transfer within the United Arab Emirates.
 Despite its experience in the gulf region, Dr. Stearns said, George Mason remained interested in overseas campuses and was discussing possibilities in other parts of the world.

HEADLINE: As Hard Times Return, Will the Bad Old Days of Crime Come Back as Well?

BYLINE: By AL BAKER; Colin Moynihan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With each crack of gunfire, with each new homicide, the trajectory of public safety in New York City is being measured.
 Headline: A 15-year-old boy in the Bronx is shot on Monday in a dispute over graffiti. Headline: A 21-year-old woman is shot dead on Wednesday on a street in East New York, Brooklyn, a neighborhood once known as the ''dead zone.'' Headline: A 53-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl are fatally shot on Thursday night inside an apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. 
 If a shrinking economy, soaring jobless claims and a troubled financial sector are not angst-producing enough, the threat of increased crime is leading many conversations toward a nagging and persistent question: Will the bad old days of record numbers of murders and ubiquitous street muggings be far behind? 
 ''If you're nervous, some noise can make you jump,'' said Dennis C. Smith, a professor at the Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service at New York University, who has studied the New York City Police Department's strategies to reduce crime. ''And I think we are understandably very, very nervous.''
 Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, for his part, said he has heard this all before.
 He said similar worries were being voiced as he took over in 2002 for a second stint as the city's top police official: Things were headed in the wrong direction, the economy was devastated after Sept. 11, 2001, and there were predictions that crime would increase.
 Instead, overall crime has dropped nearly 30 percent in the last seven years, he said, and in 2007 the lowest number of killings was recorded since the city started keeping what it considers reliable records, about four decades ago. 
 ''There's a lot of predictions that crime is going to go up as a result of the economic crisis,'' Mr. Kelly said on Friday during a news conference to announce an arrest in the fatal beating of an Ecuadorean immigrant in December.
 ''The fact of the matter is that hasn't happened,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''The fact is we're down 14 percent, and we're down in every category across the city.'' 
 ''We've met these challenges before,'' he added.
 Criminologists warn that it can be misleading to analyze crime data for short periods of time and say that clusters of murders can occur during periods of overall crime decreases.
 Still, after the first two months of 2009, Paul J. Browne, the department's chief spokesman, said that murders in the city are down slightly. As of Feb. 25, there were 55 homicides in the city, Mr. Browne said, compared with 66 in the same period a year go, a 17 percent decrease. 
 Despite a recent surge in violence, crime in East New York, which is part of the 75th Precinct, is mirroring the citywide trend: It is down 14 percent. 
 ''It is flat in every category,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''It is actually flat, as far as homicides are concerned. It is down as far as shootings are concerned.''
 But crime statistics and people's feelings about public safety ''are not perfectly correlated,'' Professor Smith said.
 ''People have had this longtime misconception that crime came down in New York City because the economy improved, and I have been telling people that it is just the reverse -- the economy improved after crime went down,'' Professor Smith said. ''Hotel occupancy went up after crime went down. Airport arrivals went up after crime went down. Employment went up after crime went down.''
 Thomas A. Reppetto, a police historian and a retired commander in the Chicago Police Department, said a city becoming less safe because of a sputtering economy was not something that would occur quickly. Even if stores were going out of business and being boarded up, reversing the revitalization of certain neighborhoods, it would not happen ''overnight.''
 A key issue is whether the city, facing a multibillion-dollar budget deficit, would be able to sustain the Police Department's size or be able to provide money for hiring or overtime costs. Mr. Kelly said he would like to have more officers, and expressed hope that the federal stimulus package would contain grant money for new hires. 
 Mr. Reppetto said he believed crime would continue declining this year. ''For 2009, if the police receive some additional things because of federal money, and if they continue to carry out the strategies they have carried out, you will not see a significant rise in crime; indeed, it will probably go down,'' he said. ''But if there is going to be a prolonged depression, recession, then we have to think about other scenarios.''
 Mr. Reppetto said predictions about ''the fall of the Big Apple'' were made in 1990, when homicides hit their peak at 2,245, and, ''murder gangs with machine guns'' roamed the streets.
 ''I got calls galore,'' Mr. Reppetto said. ''Is this the end of New York? Is New York finished? The BBC wanted to know what was going on.''
 In Bedford-Stuyvesant, outside 117 Van Buren Street, where two people were killed late Thursday, residents said it was hard to tell if they were at the threshold of a new era of lawlessness. But they spoke of their anger over crime and those responsible. 
 ''The kids around here don't feel like they have any other choice,'' said Renee Taylor, 21, who works as a security guard. ''There's definitely more robberies lately. That's getting popular now. People will knock right on the door with a gun. You can tell them some sob story about being broke, but they're just going to get mad at you.''
 A friend, Jessica Paige, 21, offered a simple theory about why people turn to crime: ''It's a money thing.''

HEADLINE: Despite the Recession, Neediest Cases Fund Collects Nearly $7 Million

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
After an article about her appeared as part of the 97th annual New York Times Neediest Cases Fund campaign, Margaret Callahan, 64, who on occasion relies on a food pantry run by Catholic Charities Brooklyn and Queens, received $375 in checks and $100 in groceries from four donors.
 Another person featured in the campaign, Fernando Kabigting, 69, an artist who had a debilitating stroke and then taught himself to paint with his left hand, received $300 from a fellow artist who had also suffered a stroke.
 Joann Ritter, 52, and her three children lost all their belongings and furniture when a mix-up with the city's Housing Stability Plus program resulted in their rent not being paid, prompting their landlord to move their possessions onto the curb outside their apartment. One reader sent Ms. Ritter $1,000. Another sent $500. Yet another bought her a bedroom set, dressers for her children and clothes for the family.
 ''It put our life back together again,'' Ms. Ritter said. 
 The donations to Ms. Callahan, Mr. Kabigting and Ms. Ritter were a small portion of a much larger sum raised during the latest campaign: $6,964,031 from 10,838 donors, according to The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund.
 That was a 9 percent drop from last year, in which 11,340 donors gave $7.64 million. To ensure that the seven social service agencies supported by the fund receive the same amount as last year, and to alleviate rising hunger and other urgent needs, the board of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has announced the creation of a $3.8 million Emergency Safety Net Initiative.
 One grant, for $680,000, will go to the seven organizations to make up the shortfall. Grants for the remaining $3.1 million will go to other agencies in the metropolitan area that feed the hungry, employ disconnected teenagers, provide legal services to the poor and support caregivers of traumatized veterans. Funds for the Emergency Safety Net Initiative will come from the Neediest Cases Fund endowment, which now totals $29.3 million.
 ''We watched the recession worsen by watching contributions day by day,'' said Jack Rosenthal, president of the Times Company Foundation. ''For two months, they stayed level or even a little ahead of last year. In the final month, they steadily declined, just as hunger and other needs increased. Now, by supplying funds from the Neediest endowment, we aim to raise the level of support for people in distress.''
 From Nov. 9 until Feb. 6, articles in The Times and on its Web site encouraged readers to donate by mail or online at NYCharities.org. Donations were accepted through Feb. 10. 
 Though there was a 4 percent drop in total donors and a 5 percent drop in the amount given online this year, the number of donors giving online continued to rise, by 8 percent.
 A portion of this online giving includes part of an annual drive conducted by young analysts from eight Wall Street firms. In January, several analysts from Goldman Sachs and Citigroup also delivered an envelope full of cash, checks and change to the offices of the Times Company Foundation. In all, the drive raised $140,706, of which $122,872 came from Goldman Sachs.
 ''Last year was a very, very different year,'' said Ruben Salinas, a risk specialist at Goldman Sachs, referring to the amount raised by analysts in the previous drive, $189,260. ''Everyone was doing well. That we came at all close this year speaks to our commitment to the fund.''
 Anticipating a challenging fund-raising year, Mr. Salinas and his colleagues reached out earlier and more persistently to the firm's first-year analysts, ultimately involving more than 130 volunteers -- more than double the roughly 60 who were recruited the previous year.
 Volunteers held a Nintendo Wii tournament in which, for an entrance fee, participants competed in bowling, tennis and boxing matches. They also arranged for employees to buy casual-dress days and conducted a ''Biggest Loser'' competition, in which, also for a fee, analysts vied to lose the most weight. ''I won't say we all lost weight, but we all signed up,'' Mr. Salinas said.
 The Neediest Cases Fund also received donations from a number of trusts and estates. Contributions of $100,000 or more from trusts and estates are invested in the Neediest Cases endowment.
 Last year, $1 million from the endowment went to help families affected by the subprime mortgage crisis. The Subprime Neediest Cases Fund -- which the Children's Aid Society administered on behalf of all seven participating agencies -- has come to the aid of 60 families, helping 23 homeowners and 23 tenants to relocate after foreclosure or eviction, and saving 14 homes from foreclosure.
 Qiana Haywood, 29, and her grandmother, Doris Canales, 73, are one such family. When an article about them ran in November, they had not yet heard whether their bank would accept a modification of their mortgage -- the Subprime Neediest Cases Fund paid the modification fee -- that would lower their monthly payments to an amount they could afford. Less than two months later, word came that their bank had forgiven their second mortgage and cut their interest rate, allowing them to keep their home.
 While many homes were saved by the Subprime Neediest Cases Fund, which continues through 2009, one was kept intact by a donor. The day an article about her appeared, Tracy Young, 37, died of colon cancer. Ms. Young's greatest concern had been that her two sons -- Jamal Perry, 16, and Andre Steinberg, 19 -- stay in the family's apartment. The rent is subsidized by Section 8, leaving the boys responsible for $192 a month. After reading the article, a donor offered to pay the boys' rent for a year.
 The campaign also changed lives in ways transcending a dollar amount.
 Patrice Mbekeli, 35, who had won political asylum after fleeing repression in his native Cameroon, could not find work, despite a degree in mathematics and computer science. Soon after an article about him appeared, Mr. Mbekeli was offered a position as a maintenance man at an apartment complex in Odessa, Tex. He is there now, sharing an apartment with another employee and making steady contributions to a savings account, with the intention of bringing his wife and four children to join him before the end of the year.
 ''My hope to make my dreams come true is more powerful than ever,'' Mr. Mbekeli said in a telephone interview. ''And I see that when my family will be here, we will be happy here together.''
 THE NEW YORK TIMES NEEDIEST CASES FUND 2008-9
 The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund invests contributions of $100,000 or more from trusts and estates in an endowment. The income, recently more than $1 million a year, goes to the next year's campaign. These are the trusts and estates that donated to the fund during this year's campaign.

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: Rule of Four

BYLINE: By CARMEN M. REINHART

 BODY:
WHEN our economic woes began, analysts took some solace that the longest American recession since World War II lasted 16 months, and that on average our recessions lasted less than a year. But as this contraction continues into its 15th month, we have been forced to look to more severe precedents. 
 Counting the months of decline, however, is a narrow gauge of distress. A better metric is the length of time it takes the economy to recover to the level of per capita income at its prior peak. 
 After the most severe banking crises around the world in the postwar period, the economy has taken an average of four years to return to its previous peak in personal income. After the Depression, it took the United States 10 years. 
 No doubt, the new stimulus package left much to be desired. But it was not a design flaw that the stimulus plan extends over several years, because the period during which the economy will remain below its earlier high-water mark will be protracted and efforts to speed recovery will prove welcome.

 BODY:
Louisiana Tech began playing women's basketball in 1974, putting money and ambition into the sport when few colleges did. Winning became consistent and flamboyant. The first coach, a legendary recruiter named Sonja Hogg, drove a white Cadillac and wore a white fur coat, which matched hair as white and frosted as a vanilla ice cream cone.
 The Lady Techsters won a national championship in the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1981 and took the inaugural N.C.A.A.-sponsored title in 1982. Another title came in 1988. For a quarter century, only two teams never failed to qualify for the women's N.C.A.A tournament: Louisiana Tech and Tennessee.
 But parity has spread in women's basketball, spurred by the gender-equity mandate known as Title IX. And a seismic change in the money-sharing arrangement of college sports has occurred over the last decade as Louisiana Tech's influence began to wane. 
 Facing the prospect of missing the N.C.A.A. tournament for a third consecutive year, Tech fired its women's coach in early February. Still sensitive here is another dispute -- the messy departure in 2000 of the former Tech star and longtime assistant Kim Mulkey, who later guided Baylor to a national championship.
 The days when Louisiana Tech and other midmajors can be regular title contenders are probably gone under the current structure of college sports. The last of the Lady Techsters' 10 N.C.A.A. Final Four appearances came in 1999; a year earlier, the Bowl Championship Series was formed, and money and power became concentrated in the hands of six major football conferences. 
 Big-time football programs from the Southeastern, Big 12, Big East, Atlantic Coast, Pacific-10 and Big Ten Conferences committed to what Tennessee, Connecticut and Stanford were doing: dominating women's basketball. With deep pockets, they could pay extravagant coaching salaries; draw top recruits with chartered flights for game travel and posh arenas, locker rooms and practice facilities; and offer expanded academic support and tutoring systems.
 Pat Summitt of Tennessee, Geno Auriemma of Connecticut, Mulkey of Baylor and Gail Goestenkors of Texas each make $1 million a season in coaching salary -- which equals Louisiana Tech's entire budget for women's basketball.
 As conferences realigned, often radically in desperate pursuit of football income, Tech was thrown into far-flung alliances and left without natural rivalries based on proximity. 
 For eight years, the Lady Techsters have played in the Western Athletic Conference, whose nearest opponent, New Mexico State, is more than 900 miles away. On Tuesday, a trip home from Hawaii required three flights and a bus ride totaling 13 hours. Travel can be exhausting, disruptive to class attendance and obstinately expensive during a recession when Louisiana universities are facing budget cuts from 20 percent to 30 percent.
 ''Once big schools started investing in women's sports, I think smaller institutions were doomed,'' said Donna Lopiano, a former executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation and athletic director for women's sports at the University of Texas. ''It's an arms race; those big-time programs are where athletes want to go.''
 In the Associated Press top 25 poll, only two women's teams -- Xavier and South Dakota State -- are not aligned with B.C.S. conferences. The last midmajor to reach the women's Final Four was Southwest Missouri State (now called Missouri State) in 2001. The last to win was Louisiana Tech, two decades ago.
 Old Dominion, which won national women's titles in 1979, 1980 and 1985, reached a regional final in 2002 and a regional semifinal in 2008. Marist has also made some midmajor noise in recent seasons. But these teams have become the exception, not the rule. Louisiana Tech is no longer dominant even in its home state, having been overtaken by Louisiana State, which won B.C.S. football titles in 2003 and 2008 and has participated in the last four women's Final Fours.
 Meanwhile, Tech's average home attendance, 2,096, has slipped by more than 50 percent from the team's heyday. And the conference does not have a television contract for women's basketball; only one Tech game has been televised this season, which is a hindrance to recruiting.
 ''The two most important questions you are asked in recruiting are, 'How many games do you have on TV?' and 'How do you travel?' '' said Wendy Larry, the coach at Old Dominion.
 Under Teresa Weatherspoon, a former star point guard here who is the interim coach, the Lady Techsters (17-11) have five consecutive victories. Still, Tech's only real chance at making the 2009 N.C.A.A. tournament is to win the conference tournament and gain an automatic bid. (The WAC is considered too weak to receive an at-large berth.) Even if the Lady Techsters do make the 64-team field, they will be regarded as nostalgic bracket fillers.
 That may be a sour truth for fans to digest, but university officials said they had adjusted their aspirations to conform to financial realities. Success is defined as winning the conference, ranking among the nation's top 25 teams, making the N.C.A.A. tournament and hoping for the occasional magical mystery tour.
 ''I don't think that's unrealistic, and you don't have to pay the coach a million dollars to get that,'' said Derek Dooley, Louisiana Tech's athletic director and football coach.
 The Lady Techsters have been in transition since Leon Barmore, a Hall of Fame coach, retired after 20 years in 2002 with a winning percentage of .869 (576-87), the highest among men's and women's college coaches. Barmore had been willing to step aside in 2000 for Mulkey, who had spent 19 years at Louisiana Tech as a point guard and assistant with an outsize personality. She asked for a five-year contract, a common deal, but the university president, Daniel D. Reneau, balked at a guaranteed fifth year.
 In her 2007 autobiography, ''Won't Back Down,'' Mulkey described an emotional confrontation, saying she got on her knees at a meeting, tears in her eyes, and begged Reneau for a fifth year, trying to show the passion she had for her alma mater but feeling humiliated instead.
 Reneau, she wrote, seemed ''cold,'' determined to show ''that he was the one in control.''
 ''How could he not appreciate the loyalty I had shown there?'' Mulkey wrote. ''Three different times I had turned down higher-paying jobs to stay at Louisiana Tech. Give the girl what she wants!''
 Many fans consider Mulkey the only coach who could have sustained Louisiana Tech as a national power, given her longtime affiliation with the team, her coaching skill and the forcefulness of her personality. But she left for Baylor and won the 2005 national title, reinforcing the widespread feeling that Tech had erred in letting her go.
 ''I think that was definitely a mistake,'' said F. Jay Taylor, a retired Louisiana Tech president who started the women's basketball program. In Mulkey's autobiography, Barmore, now an assistant at Baylor, said: ''It was an absolute shame that we couldn't keep Kim. Who suffered? Louisiana Tech suffered. The fans suffered. It hurt our program.''
 Privately, though, some believe that Mulkey grew apprehensive about replacing a Hall of Famer like Barmore and went to Baylor because it offered not only a higher salary, but also lower expectations. And although Mulkey is well liked here, some supporters of Reneau said that her operatic style had grown wearisome.
 Reneau said he offered Mulkey contract terms similar to that of other Tech coaches, adding, ''I have no regrets whatsoever.''
 The firing of Coach Chris Long on Feb. 9, despite a 71-44 overall record in his fourth season, also drew criticism from another former Tech coach, Kurt Budke, now at Oklahoma State. On a teleconference with reporters, Budke accused Tech officials of having ''unrealistic expectations.''
 Weatherspoon has no previous college coaching experience, but she is ebullient and unafraid to predict what few will -- that Louisiana Tech will regain its prominence.
 Recently, the women's locker room was improved and a new home court was installed after a $350,000 donation from Karl Malone, an alumnus. A big-screen scoreboard is on the wish list. Eventually, university officials may explore joining another league, like Conference USA, which would offer more cost-effective travel and familiar rivalries.
 ''We want to get back to that point where we are competing at that ultimate level with the UConns, the Tennessees,'' Weatherspoon said. ''We do it by recruiting the best of the best. I love for people to think what we won't do. I guarantee, we will be back. Those that don't believe, it will be eye-popping.''

HEADLINE: Tranche

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
In the 1949 movie ''Battleground'' -- one of the best films of World War II that made stars out of a half-dozen male actors -- a memorable interlude between the scenes of mayhem around Bastogne took place in a French country house. A beautiful young French woman was serving food to a couple of hungry, lonely American G.I.'s. In her movie debut, the actress Denise Darcel pressed a large loaf of bread to her tight-fitting sweater, held up a large kitchen knife and proceeded to slowly saw off pieces toward her bosom, in the local manner. The camera panned to the face of a soldier played by Van Johnson, whose eyes and hands registered concern for the safety of the young woman and the treasure with which she was endowed.
 That may have been America's first experience with the dramatization of a tranche. The French word means ''slice; a cutting; the division into portions.'' 
 A tranche de vie, ''slice of life,'' is a literary representation of ordinary existence. The French verb trancher means ''to cut,'' and the English noun trench is ''a long cut in the ground,'' historically protecting a military position.
 We are now etymologically prepared to deal with the hot word in the lexicon of this year's unprecedented budget stimulus: tranche, which some Washington stimulati pronounce to rhyme with ''root and branch'' or ''meanwhile, back at the ranch.''
 ''We are looking for assurances,'' said Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, before the second phase of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, was passed, ''about how this new tranche of TARP funding will be used.'' That government funding, derided by populist critics as the ''bank bailout,'' was sliced into two installments of 350 bills each. 
 Bill, as used in the previous sentence, is the insider's breezy new word for ''a thousand million''; it should not be confused with either the economic stimulus bill or the name of the president before last. I predict that in a few months trill will be the flip new word for ''a thousand bills'' -- the equivalent of ''a thousand thousand millions.'' (It should not be confused with the earlier sense of an opera diva's trill as ''the alternation of musical tones a diatonic second apart.'')
 As to tranche warfare, it is obviously a play on ''trench warfare'' and is likely to be applied to over-the-top fights about installments of bailouts or repayments of debt. An early usage is in the Asset Securitization Report of March 10, 2008, in its headline ''Tranche Warfare Boosts U.S. CDO Activity.'' This initialese refers to collateralized debt obligations in which different types of debt and credit risk were bundled and sold to the unwary by the unthinking. Investopedia notes that ''these different types of debt are often referred to as 'tranches' or 'slices.' '' I have found the best mnemonic to fix these arcane initials in memory is not to envisage the slashed salary check of my banker but to think about that scene of delicious danger with Denise Darcel.
 GUIDE DIPLOMATIQUE
 Because we're dealing today with a French term that has pervaded budget coverage, it is apropos that we survey the French terms now being studied by the entourage of our new secretary of state. (A propos -- French for ''to the point or purpose'' -- is similar to the English ''appropriate,'' a favorite term of political finesse.) For help in the semantics of Gallicisms, I turned to Prof. Tom Bishop, director of the Center for French Civilization and Culture at New York University, but the political reading of current usage is my own.
 Regime, with or without ''change,'' means ''government; administration,'' but has acquired a connotation of rule, hoped to be temporary, by a nefarious bunch of autocrats, oligarchs or kleptocrats.
 Detente is ''a relaxation or unbending'' rooted in tendre, ''to stretch,'' and was used in diplomacy to promote a lessening of tensions; it is now too closely associated with the Nixon-Kissinger era for use in a time of fresh change. Demarche, however -- a ''step'' or diplomatic initiative -- is a word likely to be embraced in a new administration, especially since the once-voguish initiative has had such a long run.
 Rapprochement, found in a letter to Thomas Jefferson, has a nice meaning of ''a bringing together'' for a beginning or resumption of harmonious relations. There may be a connection with ''approach,'' of which we can expect many unless interrupted by a . . .
 Force majeure, which is an unexpected and overwhelming happening. It is a term rooted in French commercial law and is now found in phrases as varied as an ''act of God'' or an ''act of terrorism.''
 Cordon sanitaire, originally a quarantine barrier, then a series of buffer states surrounding a threatening power, is seen by today's Putinists as a NATO plot to enlist Georgia and Ukraine in squeezing Russia, which Hillaplomacy may seek to overcome with an . . . 
 Entente cordiale, a ''friendly understanding'' not encumbered by treaty complications, but which requires constant tending by world-traveling summiteers: ''See your ententist twice a year.''
 Lese-majeste began in French as a crime of treason, but has been Anglicized to mean an offense to the rights of the common people or an outrage to the dignity of their representatives, as in a tinpot dictator's keeping a secretary of state cooling heels in a Syrian waiting room.
 Diplomat, like diploma, originated in the Greek for ''folded document, a passport'' and was taken up by the French diplomatique as ''one dealing in the documents of international affairs.'' A diplomat adept at strategy-speak is elevated to the unofficial rank of diplomatist. And so ends this second tranche of today's communique.

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be over?: Our Great Recession

BYLINE: By NIALL FERGUSON

 BODY:
THIS recession, which began in December 2007, has already lasted longer than the average postwar recession. If it turns out to be as bad as the most protracted of the postwar downturns, we will touch bottom next month. 
 But my strong suspicion is that we are now in something more like a Great Recession. It won't produce as steep a fall in American output as the Depression did, but it may prove to be as prolonged.
 The depression that began in August 1929 did not hit its nadir until 43 months later. The one that started in October 1873 was shallower but lasted 65 months. If the economy were to keep shrinking for that long, we wouldn't start coming out of this until after May 2013.
 Is that possible? This is a crisis of excessive debt, the end of the Age of Leverage. It will take longer than a few more months to resolve bank and household insolvency, especially with asset prices continuing to fall so rapidly. Even with zero interest rates and huge deficits, Japan suffered a ''lost decade'' in the 1990s -- and that was when the rest of the world was doing well. This recession is taking place as the rest of the world is doing even worse than the United States. The collapse of trade as measured by East Asian export data is petrifying.
 So far in this recession, remember, we have had only two consecutive quarters of declining gross domestic product. At the moment, I find it quite easy to imagine two consecutive years of contraction. And I don't rule out two more lean years after that.

HEADLINE: Outside Atlanta, A Utopia Rises

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
EACH morning, as the breakfast dishes are cleared, Nick Melvin escapes the kitchen at the Inn at Serenbe, where he is the executive chef, and drives five minutes down a country road to a sumptuous 25-acre organic farm. There he examines the collards and the mache, the sunchoke and the carrots, and decides what looks best for that night's table and next week's menu at the Farmhouse, Serenbe's acclaimed restaurant. 
 Since opening in Palmetto, Ga., in June 2006, the Farmhouse has become a Southeastern showcase for the country's growing farm-to-table movement, winning accolades for food that is both innovative and authentic. The same ethos, it would seem, infuses just about everything in Serenbe, a utopian experiment in New Urbanism being molded out of red Georgia clay, about 30 miles southwest of downtown Atlanta. 
 In just a few years, this idyllic community -- which aspires to be something of a Sonoma for the New South (though without the wine) -- has become a destination for Atlantans in search of a day trip with the kids or a getaway without them. My wife, Dina, and I recently took the latter course, and quickly discovered a refuge that washed away the stresses of city living within minutes of arrival, after an hour's drive through Atlanta's ever-worsening traffic. Despite only word-of-mouth advertising, it is increasingly attracting visitors from afar, some on extended layovers at nearby Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport.
 Serenbe defies easy description, and is perhaps best understood through the story of its creation. In 1991, Steve and Marie Nygren, an Atlanta couple with deep roots in the city's culinary life, took their three daughters for a ride in the country. The trip was prompted by the advertisement of a farm for sale, and the family ended up buying the 60-acre parcel, with its 1905 farmhouse and rolling terrain, as a weekend home.
 Three years later, Mr. Nygren sold his stake in Peasant Restaurant Group, which had helped introduce Atlanta to fine dining in the 1970s with restaurants like Pleasant Peasant and City Grill, and he moved his family to the farm. His wife, whose mother had owned Mary Mac's Tea Room, one of Atlanta's most beloved Southern eateries, christened the place Serenbe, because it was such a serene place to be.
 Within two years, the Nygrens had converted the farmhouse into a bed-and-breakfast, and begun a series of additions and improvements. The barn became a guesthouse, and several tin-roofed cottages were restored into romantic hideaways. There are now 19 guest rooms in different configurations.
 They planted a garden thick with tomatoes and zucchini, and dug a pair of swimming pools, along with a fishing pond. They populated the property with llamas and donkeys and rabbits and goats, and added a croquet lawn, an open-air pavilion for weddings, miles of hiking trails and a labyrinth made of stones cleared from the organic fields.
 ''We invited people to come and simply unfold and relax,'' Mr. Nygren said in a recent interview at the Farmhouse, over a Sunday lunch of peppery buttermilk fried chicken, served with Creole stewed tomatoes and creamed greens. ''Just being in nature was enough.''
 In 2000, while jogging, Mr. Nygren noticed bulldozers on adjacent farmland and promptly panicked that Atlanta's sprawl was about to consume his solitude. He quickly purchased 900 acres adjacent to the farm and, feeling it was inevitable that land so close to the city would be developed, determined to set an example.
 He did so only after banding together with neighboring landowners to push through zoning changes aimed at limiting development to self-contained clusters, surrounded by wilderness. Under the plan, 80 percent of the 40,000-acre Chattahoochee Hill Country region must be preserved as green space. 
 In the last five years, Serenbe's first two high-density hamlets have risen, shaped like omegas to flow with the undulations of the land and constructed according to stringent environmental and conservation standards. They have a Main Street feel, with Arts and Crafts cottages sharing the winding lanes with loft-style town houses and sleek modern boxes. Front porches supplant front lawns, and the sidewalks are dotted with fanciful lampposts that seem to have been designed in Whoville.
 One hamlet, Selborne, is devoted to the visual and culinary arts and features two galleries, a gourmet grocer, a bike rental, a salon and several boutiques. A bakeshop, the Blue-Eyed Daisy, serves as the village gathering spot, luring visitors with red-velvet cupcakes. The other hamlet, known as Grange, has an agricultural theme and includes the stables and organic farm. A third neighborhood is being planned, with a focus on health and healing, though the economy has slowed the progress.
 The community sponsors frequent weekend festivals, farmers' markets and other events, including an annual November fundraiser for Les Dames d'Escoffier International, the women's culinary group, that attracts foodies from across the region to sample the area's best chefs. 
 Last August, Hilary White, who had been the longtime executive chef at 103 West, an Atlanta mainstay, opened the Hil on the Hill in the heart of the village, giving diners a second option for cooking that originates at Serenbe Organic Farms. Like Mr. Melvin, Ms. White makes daily pilgrimages to hand-pick produce for dishes like chicken pot pie and pork ribs with okra stew, and to leaf through seed catalogs with the farm manager, Paige Witherington. When we visited for dinner, she stopped by the table to shave fresh fennel onto my wife's citrus salad.
 Dining at one of the Farmhouse's 10 or so tables is an almost worshipful experience. Soft string music sets the mood, and guests await the next course in cheerful whispers. Our outstanding prix fixe meal, which came with wines paired to each course, started with charred lamb carpaccio and a melt-in-your-mouth gnocchi made with spinach and shrimp, followed by entrees of molasses-lacquered short ribs served over creamed grits and wild Georgia shrimp surrounded by braised fennel, celery, pearl onions and artichokes.
 Our breakfast the next morning -- with Mr. Nygren pouring the coffee -- was equally memorable: perfectly scrambled eggs with an oniony maple-pear sausage and stone-ground organic grits. 
 The spacious rooms at the Inn at Serenbe, in the main house or the cottages, are simple and fresh, with cushiony beds that insist that you sleep. The Nygrens serve an afternoon tea, and guests are invited to help feed the animals on Saturday mornings, to gather around a lakeside bonfire on Saturday nights, and to take a hay ride on Sunday mornings.
 We were not there on a weekend, and found we did not need the distractions. We walked the farm and took pictures with the pigs. We explored the village in fascination at what the Nygrens had built. We watched five consecutive episodes from the ''Mad Men'' DVD we had packed. We slept and ate extremely well. Ignoring the occasional plane overhead, we bathed in the solitude. And in reconnecting to the land, even for just two days, we found that we connected to ourselves and to each other.

 BODY:
My best friend and her boyfriend temporarily moved into my house. I have plenty of room, and I'm happy to help them through a tough financial period. But my friend constantly nags her boyfriend to quit smoking, and to the best of her knowledge, he has. Yet I've come home several times to find him smoking outdoors. He acts as if he's doing nothing wrong -- then rushes to mask the odor, brushing his teeth, gargling with mouthwash or showering. Should I tell my friend? A.K., Canton, Ohio
 Hang on a mentholated minute. Haven't the Relapser-in-Chief and Michelle moved into the White House already? 
 It's great to look out for your friend, but what about our poor economy? If all the ''secret'' smokers, tokers, tipplers and whore-mongers were unmasked before their significant others, our nation's red-light industries would collapse. And their bailout would make the price of YSL doodads at Christie's look like chump change.
 I'd keep your mouth shut. Your friend probably knows that her Marlboro Man is still smoking. Otherwise, she wouldn't keep nagging him. 
 Even if she doesn't know, I'd be careful about weighing in, because your mother was right: people hate a tattletale. And while we can make a strong case for the cigarettes harming the boyfriend, it's harder to see how his hidden smoke rings hurt your friend enough for you to insert yourself in their relationship.
 Now, if you simply can't hold back, consider speaking with the boyfriend first. Let him know you plan to spill it, unless he really quits -- or pays you $100 a week, depending on which form of blackmail you prefer. 
 Boarding Pass
 At the airport, I've stood in the immigration line and watched as someone pushed a person in a wheelchair to the very front. The person doesn't look disabled, merely overweight or elderly. Since they're sitting down, and look comfortable, is it appropriate for them to cut to the front? And what about their healthy family members, who move up, too?Marc Holzapfel,
 Glen Ridge, N.J.
 Thanks for the diagnosis, Dr. Welby! I'll let the airlines know that you'd like the people in wheelchairs to hoof it.
 The rub is that airlines are required to provide wheelchairs to passengers who request them. They're also required to push them through the airport. And since these requests are numerous, the airlines simply can't afford to have wheelchair attendants waiting in snaking lines -- just so you can go first. 
 As to the wheelchair groupies, have you never seen an episode of VH1's ''Behind the Music''? For every lead guitarist with a sister pitching in, there are 10 more whose families just want a lift to Easy Street. Why would it be any different at the International Terminal? 
 Your best bet is to take a chill pill -- or to pack on 75 pounds (and a white wig) in time for your next jaunt.
 Skiing on Thin Ice
 A man has expressed romantic interest in me through a friend, but I'm not interested. Now, he has invited my friend and me to his ski house for the weekend. Can I go, and play innocent to the fact that he's shown interest in me by proxy? Or will I spend the weekend fending off his attempts to woo me? 
 Sarah, San Francisco
 There are words, my dear, for people who parlay the romantic interests of others into free ski junkets -- and they are not ''double black diamond.''
 By unpacking your apres-ski boots in his guestroom, you are implicitly acknowledging his interest, and signaling that you might have feelings for him as well. You needn't be madly in love to accept his invitation, but you shouldn't be ''clearly not interested,'' either. Romance is hard enough without intentional mixed signals. And you wouldn't want anyone to do that to you, right?
 So no chairlifts, I'm afraid, unless -- and this takes guts -- you call him to accept, and seamlessly work into the conversation that you're: (a) already romantically involved; (b) holding out for Mickey Rourke; or (c) unable to canoodle at high altitudes. Then see if he wiggles out of the weekend.

HEADLINE: When Will the Recession Be Over?: Back Online by 2010

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMIDT

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS hesitate to predict the future for good reason. But when looking at our economic decline, we can all agree on two things: we did not get here overnight and we will not recover tomorrow. There are, however, steps that need to be taken to speed up the process -- getting credit flowing again, taking action to create jobs, repairing our broken infrastructure and increased transparency to ensure we measure the effectiveness of the dollars we spend. And the good news is that Congress and the president are pressing ahead in the knowledge that to stand still is no solution at all. 
 The result, I hope, will be that by the late summer our economy will start to show signs of life, with a slowing rate of economic contraction and small but noticeable upticks in areas like auto sales and real estate. By the end of the year, we may see some growth, with gains in employment to follow a few months later. In early to mid-2010, as banks recover and begin to lend, we should see further progress with consumers taking advantage of the once-in-a-lifetime economic opportunities emerging from this historic collapse. After all, Americans love a bargain.
 Of course, the most important challenges we face are long-term. The stimulus bill, with its commitment to 21st century technologies like expanded broadband, health information systems and clean energy, as well as investment in education, provides a blueprint for that future. 
 Not surprisingly, I also believe that the Internet will be a critical part of our recovery -- an open marketplace where small businesses and start-ups can stand on a level playing field with well-established companies. Marshalling our technological prowess and unleashing our entrepreneurs online (and off) will create sustainable growth over the next decade.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths PRESS, BILLIE KALLICK

 BODY:
PRESS--Billie Kallick, died February 12, 2009, in Washington, DC, of heart failure after a long illness. An educator, Billie Press was an early post-Sputnik visitor to the USSR, accompanying her husband, geophysicist Frank Press (later science adviser to President Jimmy Carter and President of the National Academy of Sciences) during International Geophysical Year 1957-8 to Moscow when such visits were still quite rare. Returning home to Pasadena, CA, she argued successfully for one of the first ''Gifted Child'' programs that became a part of the public response to Sputnik. 
She founded and directed such a program in the Pasadena City Schools 1962-65, which involved training 250 teachers. At the same time that Sputnik was galvanizing a broad response in the US, universal education in the Soviet Union under Khrushchev had been cut from 10 years to 8, with only 10% going on to higher education. Billie appreciated the irony of this, publishing an article quoting her interview with a high Soviet official, ''It is bad policy to educate so many people beyond the stations they will occupy in life.'' Of course Billie didn't agree with this one bit! Obtaining her doctorate in 1968, she went on to found the HomeBased Early Childhood Education program in the Cambridge, MA, public schools, a kind of ''each one teach one'' in which economically disadvantaged mothers themselves became trained and employed as home visitors to other disadvantaged families, bringing books and educational materials into the homes of toddlers. She later taught at Salem State College and Lesley College, and was, in Washington, DC, a specialist in HEW's Bureau of Elementary and Secondary Education (1978-79). Born October 15, 1925, in St. Louis, MO, Billie grew up in Brooklyn, NY, the daughter of New York Times compositor and proofreader William Kallick and Mary Enders Kallick. Attending Samuel J. Tilden High School, she qualified for a full scholarship to NYU, where she graduated in 1946, marrying Frank Press (her highschool sweetheart) the same month. She is survived by her husband, her children William Press of Austin, TX, and Paula Press of Chapel Hill, NC, 2 grandchildren and 2 greatgrandchildren.

HEADLINE: With Deadly Persistence, Mexican Drug Cartels Get Their Way

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico 

 BODY:
Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz is supposed to be the one to hire and fire the police chief in this gritty border city that is at the center of Mexico's drug war. It turns out, though, that real life in Ciudad Juarez does not follow the municipal code.
 It was drug traffickers who decided that Chief Roberto Orduna Cruz, a retired army major who had been on the job since May, should go. To make clear their insistence, they vowed to kill a police officer every 48 hours until he resigned. 
They first killed Mr. Orduna's deputy, Operations Director Sacramento Perez Serrano, together with three of his men. Then another police officer and a prison guard turned up dead. As the body count grew, Mr. Orduna eventually did as the traffickers had demanded, resigning his post on Feb. 20 and fleeing the city.
 Replacing Mr. Orduna will also fall outside the mayor's purview, although this time the criminals will not have a say. With Ciudad Juarez and the surrounding state of Chihuahua under siege by heavily armed drug lords, the federal government last week ordered the deployment of 5,000 soldiers to take over the Juarez Police Department. With the embattled mayor's full support, the country's defense secretary will pick the next chief.
 Chihuahua, which already has about 2,500 soldiers and federal police on patrol, had almost half the 6,000 drug-related killings in all of Mexico in 2008 and is on pace for an even bloodier 2009. Juarez's strategic location at the busy El Paso border crossing and its large population of local drug users have prompted a fierce battle among rival cartels for control of the city.
 Nothing is surprising in Chihuahua anymore. Gunmen recently shot at one of three cars in Gov. Jose Reyes Baeza's motorcade, killing a bodyguard and wounding two agents. The drug cartels routinely collect taxes from business owners, shooting those who refuse to pay up. As for the Juarez mayor, who has made cleaning up the notoriously corrupt police department his focal point, the cartel recently threatened to decapitate him and his family unless he backed off.
 The handwritten threat that it issued went further than that. Like many people in Juarez, Mayor Reyes has homes on both sides of the border, splitting his time between El Paso and Juarez. The note threatening him made it clear that the assassins going after him would have no qualms about crossing into the United States to finish off the mayor and his family.
 ''We took the threat seriously,'' said Chris Mears, a spokesman for the El Paso Police Department. ''I'm not going to tell you what actions were taken, but we've taken actions.''
 In an interview in his wood-paneled office overlooking the United States, Mr. Reyes, 46, whose father was mayor in the early 1980s, said he was not going to allow criminals to run the city, despite the inroads they are making. He said he initially opposed his police chief's decision to resign because he did not want the outlaws to feel empowered. He acceded only as a life-saving gesture, he said.
 ''I'm not going to give in,'' he vowed in an interview, welcoming the arrival of soldiers so that the traffickers will feel the heat even more.
 Right now, the Juarez police are no match for the outlaws. Last year, the senior uniformed officer was killed, one of 45 local police officers killed since January 2007, and a former police chief pleaded guilty to charges of smuggling a ton of marijuana from Juarez to El Paso. Mr. Orduna, who lived at the police station to avoid being killed, had replaced another chief who fled to El Paso after receiving threats last year. If the army had not come in, the mayor would no doubt have had a difficult time finding somebody to run the department.
 Introducing a nationwide police recruitment campaign, the mayor has raised salaries and benefits enough that he is attracting new recruits to replace the many officers being fired for their links to organized crime.
 ''I know the dangers and I accept them,'' said Jose Martin Jauregui Lopez, one of the 289 cadets now being trained at Juarez's police academy. ''There are a lot of people afraid for me: my mom, my relatives. But this is what I want to do.''
 As a sign to the traffickers that he was not running from them, Mr. Reyes appeared Friday to be like any other mayor, giving a speech at the opening of a shopping center, signing a memorandum of understanding with a developer, reassuring residents that he would keep loiterers from gathering in front of their homes. 
 But the bodyguards holding assault rifles who clung close to him made it clear that Juarez remained a city under siege.
 ''There's no square inch of the city that has been untouched by the violence,'' said Lucinda Vargas, an economist who works by day to remake the city as executive director of Juarez Strategic Plan, but retreats to El Paso at night. ''There's a lot of evidence that Juarez, in a micro sense, is becoming a failed state. But I still think we haven't failed yet and that we could still rescue ourselves.''

 ''Day after day, there are so many horrible things taking place there,'' said Howard Campbell, an anthropologist at the University of Texas at El Paso who studies Mexico's drug war. ''The cartels are trying to control everything.''

HEADLINE: Aid Critical to Public Preschool Plan

BYLINE: By JOHN MOONEY

DATELINE: Rockaway Borough 

 BODY:
 TRAFFIC was heavy in the playhouse of the preschool class at Lincoln Elementary School here, as 5-year-old Cassi Auten served up plastic carrot soup. 
 Nearby, two girls matched animals in a wood-block zoo, and another group measured out sand at a play table. A few students had donned capes, part of a superhero theme they came up with. 
 ''It is amazing how much learning is happening through their play,'' said the school's principal, Phyllis Alpaugh.
 This Morris County community of 6,000 residents and two schools has been among a growing number of suburban districts in New Jersey expanding into public preschool, seeing the benefits of starting early to teach children learning and social skills. 
 Now, more programs may be on the horizon, under an ambitious -- some say overly ambitious -- plan approved by Gov. Jon S. Corzine and the State Legislature in last year's new school funding formula.
 Modeled after court-required preschools in the state's urban districts, the far-reaching law calls on virtually every district to start providing all-day programs for their low-income 3- and 4-year-olds by the fall.
 For 86 middle- and working-class districts -- from Hackensack to Carteret to Cape May City -- that will mean universal programs available for all their children. Four hundred other districts will have to provide at least some preschool, and will decide whether to extend beyond their low-income students.
 The state would ultimately pay an estimated $350 million to cover the costs for the neediest kids, or up to $12,000 per child. 
 That would raise the total number of needy children served to close to 70,000 by 2014, up from the current 46,700, officials said.
 ''This is really our passion,'' Mr. Corzine said recently of the expansion. ''We want to make sure we have quality programs for all of our kids.''
 But with the current economic downturn, it is up in the air whether the plan can start by the fall deadline. A decision largely hinges on whether the latest federal stimulus package might include money for preschool education.
 Mr. Corzine estimated next year's cost at $50 million to $60 million for the first set of children, something he acknowledged that the state might not be able to afford on its own in the current economic climate. 
 ''There is no way we are dropping away from our long-term commitment,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''But we do need to look at the financial reality of making that happen.''
 Planning to meet that fall deadline is nevertheless under way, and each district has its particular needs and challenges: from wealthy ones with a handful of eligible children to those that may need to serve hundreds more.
 Some have existing programs eager for the help; others cannot even offer full-day kindergarten now because of space or budget limitations. Without an infusion of more aid, many officials are left wondering if this is the best time to start the program, even with the stimulus help. 
 ''It's a nice idea, yes,'' said Richard J. Codey, the State Senate president and a Democrat of Essex County. ''But can we afford it right now? I don't know.''
 Under the plan, the program standards would be as high as any in the nation. 
 Districts would be required either in their own schools or in partnership with private preschools to match the programs mandated in the state's 31 poorest cities under the 1998 Abbott v. Burke rulings. 
 That means free full-day programs for eligible 3- and 4-year-olds, specified curriculums, certified teachers and classes no bigger than 15. 
 ''Abbott has shown us the benefit,'' said Lucille E. Davy, the state education commissioner, citing test score increases in Abbott elementary schools.
 ''We have seen the gains in many of the Abbotts, and clearly preschool is part of it,'' she said.
 Few argue with that or the growing national consensus around preschool, especially for disadvantaged children. 
 The challenges have come in the details, as the state currently reviews district plans and the deadline looms to at least start enrolling children by the fall.
 ''It is an enormous undertaking: expanding the academic preschool requirement from 31 districts to more than 500 within a two-year time frame,'' said Frank Belluscio, a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
 In Morris County, the School District of the Chathams has asked to delay putting the plan into effect for another year. It has only half-day kindergarten now and no space for any preschool, let alone full-day programs, said the schools superintendent, James F. O'Neill.
 With an estimated six children who may qualify, Mr. O'Neill said he had reached out to a few private centers in town, and one might have room but would also have an annual tuition of $16,000. And under the rules, he said, the center would have to change its curriculum, meet new staff and space requirements, and even raise teacher pay to levels comparable to the local public schools.
 ''They have no incentive to change,'' said Mr. O'Neill, who is now looking to a center in nearby Madison.
 ''It's unfortunate to have these concerns,'' he said. ''Everyone agrees preschool is a good thing, and no doubt better prepares kids for school. But there are logistical things to consider.''
 Still, there are other districts, like Piscataway and Montclair, that are ready, with programs that have been in place for years and that are able to absorb new students.
 But under their own budget constraints, the local officials said new students would be added only if the state comes through.
 ''It would be a shame to put it off,'' said Eve Robinson, executive director of the community preschool in Montclair, which now has 225 students and could take another 25. 
 ''Since we started, the trend has really changed around preschool,'' she said. ''There is much greater acceptance. I'd hate to see us go backward.''
 DEEP into the economic downturn, the timing may already be decided.
 Mr. Corzine is not giving up on pushing the plan through by the fall. He said a last resort occupies the White House. President Obama has called preschool a central piece of his domestic agenda and a down payment on his pledge could come in the $787 billion stimulus act. It's just a matter of how much, and state officials and education advocates are now scouring the law to see where money could be applied.
 Ms. Davy, the education commissioner, told school districts in a January memo that the state's mandate would probably move forward this year only if federal help was forthcoming.
 A decision is now expected by mid-March, when Mr. Corzine's next budget is to be presented.
 ''Under any circumstances, however, we will not ask local taxpayers to fund these programs,'' Ms. Davy wrote.
 So far, public preschool education around the country has mostly survived the tough economy, experts say, but it's hard to say for how long.
 ''It's a patchwork,'' said Ellen Frede, co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research and an architect of the Abbott programs. ''There's a definite increase in some and decreases in others. And a whole bunch just holding their breath to see what will happen.'' 
 New Jersey is among 38 states with at least some state-funded preschool programs and has one of the most extensive in serving more than a quarter of all eligible students. The most expansive program is Oklahoma's universal preschool, where more than two-thirds were enrolled in 2007. New Jersey also invests the most money per pupil, at nearly $11,000.
 In Rockaway Borough, officials said Lincoln Elementary would wait things out as it continues its half-day program, started two years ago.
 ''We started with two sections and have three now -- and a waiting list,'' said Mrs. Alpaugh, the principal. 
 As she picked up her daughter Cassi from the preschool program recently, Ateena Auten said she did not doubt its benefits.
 ''Cassi's reading, she's doing math,'' she said. ''She tells me something new every day. I definitely believe it will be so much better for her in kindergarten and first grade. I just wish I could have put her in last year, too.''

HEADLINE: The Ecstasy and the Agony

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA must savor the moment while he can. It may never get better than this. 
 As he stood before Congress on Tuesday night, the new president was armed with new job approval percentages in the 60s. After his speech, the numbers hit the stratosphere: CBS News found that support for his economic plans spiked from 63 percent to 80. Had more viewers hung on for the Republican response from Bobby Jindal, the unintentionally farcical governor of Louisiana, Obama might have aced a near-perfect score.
 His address was riveting because it delivered on the vision he had promised a battered populace during the campaign: Government must step in boldly when free markets run amok and when national crises fester unaddressed for decades. For all the echoes of F.D.R.'s first fireside chat, he also evoked his own memorably adult speech on race. Once again he walked us through a lucid step-by-step mini-lecture on ''how we arrived'' at an impasse that's threatening America's ability to move forward. 
 Obama's race speech may have saved his campaign. His first Congressional address won't rescue the economy. But it brings him to a significant early crossroads in his presidency -- one full of perils as well as great opportunities. To get the full political picture, look beyond Obama's popularity in last week's polls to the two groups of Americans whose approval numbers are in the toilet. There is good news for Obama in these findings, but there's also a stark indication of the unchecked populist rage that could still overrun his ambitious plans. 
 The first group in national disfavor is the G.O.P. In the latest New York Times/CBS News survey, 63 percent said that Congressional Republicans opposed the stimulus package mostly for political reasons; only 17 percent felt that the Republicans should stick with their own policies rather than cooperate with Obama and the Democrats. The second group of national villains is corporate recipients of taxpayer money: only 39 percent approve of a further bailout for banks, and only 22 percent want more money going to Detroit's Big Three.
 The good news for Obama is that he needn't worry about the Republicans. They're committing suicide. The morning-after conservative rationalization of Jindal's flop was that his adenoidal delivery, not his words, did him in, and that media coaching could banish his resemblance to Kenneth the Page of ''30 Rock.'' That's denial. For Jindal no less than Obama, form followed content. 
 The Louisiana governor, alternately smug and jejune, articulated precisely the ideology -- those G.O.P. ''policies'' in the Times/CBS poll -- that Americans reject: the conviction that government is useless and has no role in an emergency. Given that the most mismanaged federal operation in modern memory was inflicted by a Republican White House on Jindal's own state, you'd think he'd change the subject altogether.
 But like all zealots, Jindal is oblivious to how nonzealots see him. Pleading ''principle,'' he has actually turned down some $100 million in stimulus money for Louisiana. And, as he proudly explained on ''Meet the Press'' last weekend, he can't wait to be judged on ''the results'' of his heroic frugality. 
 Good luck with that. He's rejecting aid for a state that ranks fourth in children living below the poverty line and 46th in high school graduation rates, while struggling with a projected budget shortfall of more than $1.7 billion. 
 If you're baffled why the G.O.P. would thrust Jindal into prime time, the answer is desperation. Eager to update its image without changing its antediluvian (or antebellum) substance, the party is trying to lock down its white country-club blowhards. The only other nonwhite face on tap, alas, is the unguided missile Michael Steele, its new national chairman. Steele has of late been busy promising to revive his party with an ''off-the-hook'' hip-hop P.R. campaign, presumably with the perennially tan House leader John Boehner leading the posse.
 At least the G.O.P.'s newfound racial sensitivity saved it from choosing the white Southern governor often bracketed with Jindal as a rising ''star,'' Mark Sanford of South Carolina. That would have been an even bigger fiasco, for Sanford is from the same state as Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the junior high school student who sat in Michelle Obama's box on Tuesday night and whose impassioned letter to Congress was quoted by the president. 
 In her plea, the teenager begged for aid to her substandard rural school. Without basic tools, she poignantly wrote, she and her peers cannot ''prove to the world'' that they too might succeed at becoming ''lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day president.''
 Her school is in Dillon, where the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, grew up. The school's auditorium, now condemned, was the site of Bernanke's high school graduation. Dillon is now so destitute that Bernanke's middle-class childhood home was just auctioned off in a foreclosure sale. Unemployment is at 14.2 percent.
 Governor Sanford's response to such hardship -- his state over all has the nation's third-highest unemployment rate -- was not merely a threat to turn down federal funds but a trip to Washington to actively lobby against the stimulus bill. He accused the three Republican senators who voted for it of sabotaging ''the future of our civilization.'' In his mind the future of civilization has little to do with the future of students like Ty'Sheoma Bethea.
 What such G.O.P. ''stars'' as Sanford and Jindal have in common, besides their callous neo-Hoover ideology, are their phony efforts to portray themselves as populist heroes. Their role model is W., that brush-clearing ''rancher'' by way of Andover, Yale and Harvard. Listening to Jindal talk Tuesday night about his immigrant father's inability to pay for an obstetrician, you'd never guess that at the time his father was an engineer and his mother an L.S.U. doctoral candidate in nuclear physics. Sanford's first political ad in 2002 told of how growing up on his ''family's farm'' taught him ''about hard work and responsibility.'' That ''farm,'' the Charlotte Observer reported, was a historic plantation appraised at $1.5 million in the early 1980s. From that hardscrabble background, he struggled on to an internship at Goldman Sachs.
 G.O.P. pseudopopulism ran riot last week as right-wing troops rallied around their latest Joe the Plumber: Rick Santelli, the ranting CNBC foe of Obama's mortgage rescue program. Ann Coulter proposed a Santelli run for president, and Twitterers organized national ''tea parties'' to fuel his taxpayers' revolt. Even with a boost from NBC, whose networks seized a promotional opening by incessantly recycling the Santelli ''controversy,'' the bonfire fizzled. It did so because -- as last week's pollsalso revealed -- the mortgage bailout, with a 60-plus percent approval rating, is nearly as popular as Obama. 
 The Santelli revolution's flameout was just another confirmation that hard-core Republican radicals are now the G.O.P.'s problem, not the president's. Rahm Emanuel has it right when he says the administration must try bipartisanship, but it doesn't have to succeed. Voters give Obama credit for trying, and he can even claim success with many Republican governors, from Schwarzenegger to Crist. Now he can move on and let his childish adversaries fight among themselves, with Rush Limbaugh as the arbitrating babysitter. (Last week he gave Jindal a thumb's up.)
 But that good news for Obama is countered by the bad. The genuine populist rage in the country -- aimed at greedy C.E.O.'s, not at the busted homeowners mocked as ''losers'' by Santelli -- cannot be ignored or finessed. Though Obama was crystal clear on Tuesday that there can be ''no real recovery unless we clean up the credit crisis,'' it was telling that he got fuzzy when he came to what he might do about it. He waited two days to drop that shoe in his budget: a potential $750 billion in banking ''asset purchases'' on top of the previous $700 billion bailout.
 Therein lies the Catch-22 that could bring the recovery down. As Obama said, we can't move forward without a functioning financial system. But voters of both parties will demand that their congressmen reject another costly rescue of it. Americans still don't understand why many Wall Street malefactors remain in place or why the administration's dithering banking policy lacks the boldness and clarity of Obama's rhetoric. 
 Nor can a further bailout be easily sold by a Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, whose lax oversight of the guilty banks while at the New York Fed remains a subject of journalistic inquiry. In a damning 5,600-word article from Bloomberg last week, he is portrayed as a second banana, a timid protege of the old boys who got us into this disaster. Everyone testifies to Geithner's brilliance, but Jindal, a Rhodes scholar, was similarly hyped. Like the Louisiana governor, the Treasury secretary is a weak public speaker not because he lacks brains or vocal training but because his message doesn't fly.
 Among the highlights of Obama's triumphant speech was his own populist jeremiad about the ''fancy drapes'' and private jets of Wall Street. But talk is not action. Two days later, as ABC News reported, the president of taxpayer- supported Bank of America took a private jet to New York to stonewall Andrew Cuomo's inquest into $3.6 billion of suspect bonuses. 
 Handing more public money to the reckless banks that invented this culture and stuck us with the wreckage is the new third rail of American politics. If Obama doesn't forge a better plan, neither his immense popularity nor even political foes as laughable as Jindal can insulate him from getting burned.

HEADLINE: Right Approach to State Aid

 BODY:
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California acted in the best interest of his state when he announced that he would accept the same federal stimulus aid for the unemployed that some of his fellow Republicans have threatened to reject. 
 The money will allow California to replenish its unemployment fund, which is running on borrowed money. In accordance with stimulus law, the state will also extend desperately needed benefits to low-income workers and others who would otherwise be denied them at a time when jobs are disappearing in record numbers.
 Critics like Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana claim that expanding unemployment programs would require states to raise taxes. This does not hold water. Tax increases are typically triggered when unemployment trusts funds shrink below specified levels -- not when they are filled by a huge infusion of federal cash, as would happen in this case. The more money in the fund, the less likely a tax increase. 
 The stimulus would be especially helpful in the half-dozen states that have been forced to finance their unemployment systems through borrowing. In general, the flood of federal dollars would stoke state economies, putting money in the hands of people who would spend it to feed, clothe and house their families. The healthier the economy, the less likely a tax increase becomes.
 In addition to the $7 billion it spends on benefits for the unemployed, the stimulus sets aside $500 million to help the states with administrative costs. States that have run out of employment money -- and have been borrowing to sustain their programs -- should be welcoming this money with open arms.
 But some Republicans have opposed it on strictly ideological grounds. In addition, states that pay miserly benefits -- limiting them to a relatively small percentage of the jobless -- worry that it will be politically difficult to rescind expansions of the program once the stimulus is exhausted. That is no doubt true. But it is not a valid reason for refusing to expand benefits while the money is available, especially in the poverty-plagued Deep South.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger's decision to embrace the stimulus will put added pressure on those in his party who seem more interested in scoring political points against the Obama administration than in helping unemployed voters in their states. It is only a matter of time before those voters begin demanding a fair share of this fund.

HEADLINE: Three Rocky Roads To a Bank Rescue

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
A NEW bank rescue plan may be more crucial right now than the fiscal stimulus package enacted last month. Yet we don't seem capable of finding a clear path toward cleaning up our major financial institutions. 
 Henry M. Paulson Jr., the former Treasury secretary, changed his plans for the banks several times, and the first outline from his successor, Timothy F. Geithner, was perceived as vague and unhelpful. And while President Obama has picked brilliant economic advisers, and entered office with a relatively cooperative Congress, he may have great difficulty putting a good banking plan into practice.
 It's worth considering why this is likely to be so. 
 The need for action is clear enough. Many banks, including some of the largest, are effectively insolvent or very close to it. If these banks fail outright, some of their creditors will become insolvent as well. But there has been no easy and affordable way to proceed.
 Three basic approaches can be taken:
 THE SHOVEL METHOD The first, essentially, is to shovel money to banks and thus restore them to profitability. There are many paths toward this end, not all of them transparent. The original Paulson plan would have overpaid for bank assets, and one plank of the Geithner approach subsidizes private-sector purchases of bank assets. But no matter how it's done, funneling money has been criticized as unjust to taxpayers -- and could cost trillions to restore solvency.
 Moreover, it's not as though you can scoop the shovel once, after which the subsidy stops. If the government commits to making banks whole again, the banks may become a bottomless financial pit.
 THE CONTROL METHOD The second set of solutions involves taking control of insolvent banks, either by nationalizing them or declaring them bankrupt. In the past, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has used the model of rapidly shuttering failed banks, and it has usually worked. 
 Many analysts cite Swedish bank nationalization, from the early 1990s, as a model, because the Swedes later reprivatized these banks and resumed economic growth.
 But Sweden nationalized only two banks. And the Swedish banks were much smaller and easier to run than the largest United States bank holding companies, which combine a wide range of complex international businesses, commercial paper operations, derivatives trading and counterparty commitments. 
 It is quite possible that the reputation of a nationalized bank would be so impaired that it would incur even greater losses as its web of commercial dealings collapsed. These far-reaching commitments are a reason that the F.D.I.C. model of rapid shutdowns cannot be applied so easily here.
 The most obvious problem with nationalization is the risk of contagion. If the government wipes out equity holders at some banks, why would investors want to put money into healthier but still marginal institutions? A small number of planned nationalizations could thus lead to a much larger number of undesired nationalizations. 
 On top of that, the government doesn't have the expertise to run large bank holding companies like Citigroup. There is the danger that caretaker managers, with bureaucratic incentives, will never return the banks to profitability. And restrictions on executive pay, already enacted into law, will make it hard to hire the necessary talent. 
 In the meantime, there would be increasing pressure to politicize lending decisions -- for instance, by requiring loans to the ailing automobile industry. Talk of taxpayers capturing an ''upside'' is probably unrealistic.
 The plight of the American International Group, the giant insurer, provides a cautionary tale. The government has already effectively nationalized A.I.G., but after a government commitment of $150 billion, the company's losses continue to mount, and there is no simple way to either manage it or split it up. If the government cannot run that bailout very well, how can it run major banks and nurse them back to profitability? 
 Nationalization also puts bank debts on the balance sheet of the government without restoring bank solvency. Once the government takes over, it is hard to reorganize the debts of these companies without damaging the government's own creditworthiness and spreading the insolvency to bank creditors. Yet if the banks are insolvent, paying off the creditors may cost trillions. 
 It's easy to call for ''transparency'' in a banking plan -- as is the ostensible goal behind Mr. Geithner's ''stress tests'' of the big banks. But transparency isn't a simple concept, especially in hard times with poorly functioning asset markets and uncertain valuations.
 For instance, standards for bank solvency depend on whether the government applies a ''mark to market'' standard to bank assets. If the long-run value of a mortgage security exceeds what it would fetch on the open market today, what is the security's ''transparent value,'' and which figure should the government use in deciding whether to shutter or nationalize a bank? 
 There is not always a clear line separating solvent and insolvent banks. In many cases, the government would simply be choosing which banks deserve to survive.
 THE BAND-AID METHOD A third approach to reform is to try to muddle through, with fixes here and there. The hope is that banks return to solvency over a few years, as markets improve. The results, though, are likely to be a lot of limping along, continued extension of credit to weak and ineffective banks, and not much resolution.
 But because we don't have a few trillion dollars to spend on bank recapitalization -- with or without nationalization -- this may be the best that the American political system can do for now.
 The outlook is bleak. Perhaps true and irrevocable insolvency will force the hand of the regulators to act more decisively. In the meantime, the banking system will be very hard to fix.

HEADLINE: Keeping the Faith, Ignoring the History

BYLINE: By SUSAN JACOBY. 
Susan Jacoby is the author of ''The Age of American Unreason.''

 BODY:
NEARLY everyone now takes for granted the wisdom, constitutionality and inevitability of some form of federal financing for community social services run by religious groups. Who anymore can imagine that the United States managed to exist for over 200 years without the government providing any direct aid to faith and its works? 
 It is truly dismaying that amid all the discussion about President Obama's version of faith-based community initiatives, there has been such a widespread reluctance to question the basic assumption that government can spend money on religiously based enterprises without violating the First Amendment. The debate has instead focused on whether proselytizing or religious hiring discrimination should be permitted when church groups take public money. This shows how easy it is to institutionalize a bad idea based on unexamined assumptions about service to a greater good. 
 In 1996, President Bill Clinton started down the slippery slope toward a constitutionally questionable form of faith-based aid when he signed a welfare reform bill that included a ''charitable choice'' provision allowing religious groups to compete for grants. Under President George W. Bush, a separate White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives was established -- a significant expansion of ''charitable choice.'' Mr. Bush, who instituted his faith-based program through executive orders rather than trying to get a bill establishing the office through Congress, quickly put the money to political use. 
 The administration provided large grants for projects favored by the Christian right, like Charles Colson's Prison Fellowship Ministries and Teen Challenge, a drug rehabilitation program that openly pushed religious conversion (even using the phrase ''completed Jews'' to describe teenage converts from Judaism) as a way of overcoming addiction. John J. DiIulio Jr., the first director of Mr. Bush's faith-based office, resigned after only eight months and later complained about the politicization of the program. 
 Throughout Mr. Bush's second term, the Democratic Party's ''religious left'' maintained that the party needed to shed its secular image to attract more religious voters. As far as these Democrats were concerned, the only problem with faith-based programs was that most of the money was going to religious and political conservatives. 
 Enter Barack Obama, who spoke the language of both faith and secularism -- and who promised during the campaign to expand faith-based aid while, at the same time, prohibiting proselytizing and religious hiring discrimination in federally financed programs. Yet earlier this month when the president announced his new faith-based team, headed by a Pentecostal minister, Josh DuBois, Mr. Obama left the Bush orders in place and Mr. DuBois later announced that hiring practices would be vetted by the Justice Department ''case by case.'' 
 Some have tried to justify direct, White House-administered faith-based aid by pointing to long-established practices allowing programs like Medicare and Medicaid to pay for services provided to patients in religiously affiliated hospitals. But for these hospitals, nondiscrimination in both hiring and patient admissions was always a condition of eligibility for any federal money. 
 It is also worth noting that Mr. Obama's compromise has drawn criticism not only from secularists and civil libertarians but from religious conservatives like R. Albert Mohler Jr., president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, who maintains that the unlimited right to proselytize and to hire members of their own faith is essential if churches are not to compromise their mission. As a thoroughgoing secularist, I consider Mr. Mohler much clearer-minded than Democratic faith-based advocates, who wish to believe that devout proselytizers are somehow going to stifle themselves while providing ''secular'' social services. 
 The fact is that many people served by these projects -- including children with absent fathers, addicts and prisoners -- form a captive audience. It cannot be easy to say no to a proselytizer if saying yes means a warm bed in a homeless shelter, extra help for a child or more privileges while serving jail time. Embrace Jesus as your savior and, who knows, you may get early parole. 
 Furthermore, as Mr. Mohler points out, there is also a peril to religious independence from government in these programs. What government gives, government can take away. What happens if hard-pressed African-American churches serving poor communities -- where enthusiasm for faith-based initiatives has always been high and has only intensified during the current economic crisis -- come to rely on government money and the rug is pulled out from under them by a future administration? 
 Those who argue in favor of more religious involvement in government, and vice versa, always claim that the First Amendment does not mandate separation of church and state but simply prohibits state preference for any church. But even by that religion-infused standard, faith-based aid cannot help but favor some religions over others. For instance, nearly all non-Orthodox Jewish groups and liberal ecumenical religious organizations are opposed to government subsidy. How can it not violate the First Amendment to set up a program that even by default favors those groups eager to jump on the federal gravy train?
 The other canker at the heart of faith-based initiatives is the assumption that religiously based programs work better than secular and government efforts. For the faithful, though, the efficacy of these programs is an article of faith, not a conclusion supported by objective evidence. 
 Back in 2003, there was a flurry of excitement surrounding a study that at first glance seemed to suggest that participants in Mr. Colson's prison programs in Texas had been rearrested at much lower rates than other released prisoners. There was just one problem: the study excluded everyone who quit the program in prison -- two-thirds of the starting group. It is as if the Department of Education were to measure the success of public schools by not counting dropouts. This ought to give pause to Mr. Obama, who has spoken so often about restoring evidence and science to public policy-making. 
 President Obama might also take a moment to reread the religious freedom act passed by the Virginia General Assembly in 1786, with strong support from both Baptists and freethinkers. That law, which prohibited tax support for religious teaching in public schools, became the template for the establishment clause of the First Amendment and also helped establish our American tradition of government freedom from religious interference and religious freedom from government interference.
 Yet we are moving blindly ahead with faith-based federal spending as if it were not a radical break with our past. If faith-based initiatives, first institutionalized by the executive fiat of a conservative Republican president, become even more entrenched under a liberal Democratic administration, there will be no going back. In place of the First Amendment, we will have a sacred cash cow.

HEADLINE: Health Insurers, Poised for Round 2

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
GO ahead, take a guess: Which company has developed a 2,000-page strategic plan and gathers its senior executives almost every other working day to talk about how well they are doing? 
 Not General Motors. Not Citigroup. Not A.I.G.
 The answer is Aetna, the Hartford-based company that is one of the nation's largest health insurers. 
 Almost every business in the country is feeling buffeted by the recession. But for health insurance companies, the bleak economy is only part of the problem: the changing of the guard in Washington is an equal if not more dangerous threat. Together, these forces could deal a body blow to a business model that was already teetering. 
 Health plans are losing millions of members who say they can no longer afford their products. Some big employers are becoming increasingly frustrated -- and vocal -- about how much they spend on health benefits. Smaller ones are being crushed by ever-rising health care costs. On top of that, the Republicans who pushed to expand the role of private players in the health care system have largely been replaced by Democrats who want to overhaul it. 
 As the conversation intensifies in Washington about health care reform, no one knows for sure what role the insurance industry will play in a revamped system. 
 President Obama, along with the Democratic majorities in Congress, may simply rewrite the rules, forcing insurers to take all comers as customers, including those who previously would have been rejected because of poor health. The government may sharply cut how much it pays insurers to take care of the elderly. And, in what some people say would be a clear step toward a government-run system, there is even discussion about expanding the Medicare program, now limited to the elderly and the disabled, so that anyone could enroll in it.
 Whatever the path, President Obama has made clear that changes are coming. ''We can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold,'' he said in his address last week to Congress. Later in the week, he outlined a plan to slash billions in payments now going to insurers.
 The insurers are ''as vulnerable politically as they have been in the last 10 to 15 years,'' said Sheryl R. Skolnick, an analyst at CRT Capital Holdings in Stamford, Conn.
 Given the current sentiment, the insurers understand that they won't be able to beat back all efforts at sweeping change, as they did so successfully during the Clinton administration. Instead, they are scrambling to make sure they are not perceived as obstructing the goal of making the country's health care more affordable and accessible. 
 ''We have to transform the system,'' said Ronald A. Williams, Aetna's chairman and chief executive, who has been among the most outspoken in supporting significant changes. ''There's a huge opportunity.'' 
 Stephen J. Hemsley, the chief executive of the UnitedHealth Group, another large insurer, based near Minneapolis, said his company ''was open to reform.''
 ''The issue is around how,'' he said. 
 Insurers, of course, are eager to influence the debate, and the industry trade association offered its own proposals last year. They include some important concessions, including the idea of requiring insurers to cover everyone. The insurers have also been participating in groups discussing what changes are necessary, and have been taking part in closed-door discussions with members of the staff of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, about reaching a consensus on how Congress should proceed. 
 Of course, any drop in the number of uninsured, now 46 million, could translate into more paying customers. Under the stimulus bill signed into law last month, for example, the government provides for significant subsidies to help more people afford to keep employer-based coverage once they lose their jobs. 
 But the industry faces a more profound challenge: to prove to its customers -- and to the government -- that it is more than a middleman between the doctors and hospitals providing the care and those who pay for it.
 ''The health plans are going into a very dangerous time because many of them have destroyed the perception of value they were trying to create,'' Ms. Skolnick said. 
 BEFORE the last year or so, health insurers were thriving. By assembling large networks of hospitals and doctors, the insurers negotiated steep discounts and still offered patients a choice of where to go for care. After flirting with managed care in the early 1990s to reduce costs, the insurers largely abandoned those efforts after patients and doctors complained. Although health care costs have continued to climb faster than inflation, insurers were typically able to pass along the increases to employers or individuals. 
 With the Congressional overhaul of the Medicare program in 2003, the industry won an important source of additional business. Insurers who enrolled the elderly in private health plans were paid about 14 percent more than the government typically spent under traditional Medicare for service that at times was nearly identical. UnitedHealth, for one, seized this opportunity, signing up 1.7 million members in its Medicare Advantage plans.
 But in trying to bring down health care costs, Congress and the White House are likely to stop being so generous. In a television interview in January, Mr. Obama described the industry's participation in Medicare as an example of government programs ''that don't work.''
 ''We are spending a lot of money subsidizing the insurance companies around something called Medicare Advantage, a program that gives them subsidies to accept Medicare recipients, but doesn't necessarily make people on Medicare healthier,'' he said.
 In the budget plan released on Thursday, the president said he would cut payments to health insurers in Medicare Advantage by $175 billion over 10 years, through competitive bidding. The insurance trade association objects, saying the cuts unfairly target people served by the program.
 In reacting to the discussions of reform, the companies have sought the help of lobbyists and others, like former Senator Tom Daschle. UnitedHealth paid Mr. Daschle, whose nomination for health and human services secretary was recently derailed, more than $5,000 for his policy advice. 
 But the industry is also taking a very public role in voicing concern about some of the proposals being floated. In supporting legislation that would prevent the companies from refusing to cover people with existing medical conditions, the insurers have said the government must require everyone to buy insurance, subsidizing the cost for those who cannot afford it. 
 FOR private insurers, the more troubling specter in health care reform is an expansion of the Medicare program to those under 65. The program has lower expenses and generally pays much less for medical care than private insurers, so it would probably translate into a lower-cost plan for consumers. To help lead opposition to the idea, which they say puts them at an unfair disadvantage, insurers have joined with hospitals to argue that Medicare pays too little so that any expansion would significantly hurt providers. 
 But by acknowledging a need for a greater government role, the industry hopes it can persuade the president and Congress that it makes the most sense to work together. ''Whatever we do has to be a public-private partnership,'' said Mr. Williams, the Aetna C.E.O.
 Politics aside, the weak economy has highlighted just how vulnerable insurers are to pricing themselves out of the market. The percentage of people who are commercially insured fell to about 68 percent last year from about 78 percent two decades ago, according to Matthew R. Borsch, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. The numbers do not include the elderly.
 ''The reason really comes down to affordability,'' said Mr. Borsch, who predicts that the number of people who lose or drop their commercial coverage during the economic downturn could approach 10 million. ''It looks like the pace of erosion is really accelerating.'' 
 Both Aetna and UnitedHealth had double-digit declines in earnings last year, but both remain solidly profitable. Aetna earned $1.4 billion, down 24 percent, on sales of $31.6 billion, while UnitedHealth had net earnings of nearly $3 billion, down 36 percent, on revenue of $81.2 billion. 
 Insurers' corporate customers have been increasingly critical of the value of their health coverage. I.B.M., for example, says the industry is not helping to provide care that is more cost-effective in helping their workers live longer and more productive lives. The insurers ''don't have a clue about providing what we really want to buy,'' said Dr. Paul Grundy, the executive at I.B.M. who oversees its health care efforts.
 But the insurers say they are innovating.
 Mr. Hemsley says UnitedHealth has established roots in as many businesses as it can, including some well outside its core health insurance operations, like consulting services to hospitals and doctors. The strategy also involves serving a range of people, whether through Medicaid, Medicare or employers. 
 UnitedHealth ''is built to be an adaptable business model,'' Mr. Hemsley said. As health care evolves, he said, ''the most effective business model is one that evolves with it.''
 The company cannot predict how the environment will look beyond the next three years, he says, so it has tried to grab opportunities as soon as they surface. UnitedHealth does not hesitate to make large acquisitions or enter new markets. Its acquisition last year of Sierra Health Services included Nevada's largest physician group and allows the company to dip its toe in the direct delivery of medical care, an area that insurers have generally shunned. 
 The company's current emphasis is on increasing its presence in Medicaid, where it expects to add roughly 400,000 new members this year. 
 In contrast, Aetna is betting more heavily that employers will continue to play a crucial role, providing coverage for a majority of Americans. Unlike much of the rest of the industry, the company is increasing the number of people enrolled in its commercial health plans, expecting this year to add roughly 1.3 million members, largely through its employer business. 
 Aetna says it believes it will be able to convince skeptical employers and government officials that it can, in fact, oversee a patient's medical care to both save money and improve quality. No longer a company of just underwriters or claims handlers, Aetna has about 20 percent of its work force dedicated to information technology, including systems to flag doctors about potential problems in a patient's care. Another 20 percent are clinicians, including nurses who help coach patients through a difficult illness. 
 ''We're committed to and believe we're making a profound impact on the delivery system,'' said Dr. Lonny Reisman, chief medical officer at the company. 
 Aetna's three-year strategic plan outlines its overall direction, including possible changes in the marketplace, like declining Medicare payments. Senior managers meet 120 times a year to go over their business.
 One strategic goal has been to track all of an employer's medical spending, from prescription drugs to employee use of mental health services. The idea is that the insurer can better manage the care of an employee who has a stroke, for example, if it can be sure to provide counseling for depression and understand what medications the person should be taking. 
 Aetna says it is cautious in choosing to go into new markets. In the case of Medicare, the company says it was careful to enter only those regions where it thought it could still make money even if the government were to significantly cut payments. 
 ''We knew there wasn't going to be a Republican administration forever,'' said Mark T. Bertolini, Aetna's president. 
 HOW well UnitedHealth or Aetna will do if the health care landscape is significantly reshaped is anybody's guess. So far, the insurance industry has proved adept at changing with the times, said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a strategist for Mercer, the consulting firm. ''This has been a very resilient industry that has been able to find many new lines of business,'' he said. 
 But others say insurers face significant long-term competition from an array of players. The country could end up adopting more systems like Kaiser Permanente, a health plan that directly employs doctors and has shown it can often deliver better care for less money. ''What they're terrified of is the Kaisers beating them,'' said Len Nichols, a health economist for the New America Foundation in Washington, which favors a health care overhaul. 
 Other possibilities include doctors forming more alliances to oversee care or hospitals joining forces with physicians -- all to start competing with insurers. 
 ''The world is changing for all of us,'' Mr. Williams said.

HEADLINE: The Pentagon Meets the Real World

 BODY:
Many crucial details are missing from the military budget released last week by the Obama administration. But the initial signs are encouraging. 
 After adjusting for inflation, the basic Pentagon budget will rise by roughly 2 percent to $534 billion, with $130 billion more to pay for the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq (down from this year's expected $141 billion). The administration also plans to accelerate the expansion of the Army and the Marine Corps and increase pay for service members -- both much needed moves. 
 How much the expansion and pay increases will cost will not be known until the full budget is released in April. What is already clear is that to stay within the $534 billion ceiling, the Pentagon will have to finally face the real world and make cuts in expensive and outdated cold-war weapons systems. President Obama and his advisers have a few more weeks to figure out which weapons to cut. But we are ready now with suggestions. 
 We would start by killing off the Air Force's F-22 fighter and the Navy's DDG-1000 stealth destroyer. We would also scale down the Army's Future Combat Systems and hold back the deployment of unproven missile defense systems. Those four steps could save well over $10 billion a year. Billions could be saved by halting construction of unnecessary attack submarines, and dropping the Marines' troubled tilt-rotor Osprey aircraft. 
 Cutting weapons programs takes political courage -- that is why so many have survived so long after their military rationales evaporated. President George W. Bush was not willing to face down industry lobbyists and their carefully cultivated Congressional allies. The F-22 program, backers claim, sustains more than 25,000 jobs in 44 states -- jobs that will be fiercely defended in the current economic environment. But cutting unnecessary programs is essential to help pay for more critical defense needs and more cost-effective economic stimulus.
 We note that Mr. Obama has not yet delivered on his pledge to shift the war accounts from supplemental spending bills into the annual Pentagon budget. That would allow for more careful Congressional vetting. It might be too much to expect after only five weeks in office, but it must be done next year. 
 Over the next few weeks, Defense Secretary Robert Gates must assert authority over the Pentagon bureaucracy and push through the major procurement cuts he has long hinted at. Then he must lay down the law to the individual service chiefs that end-run appeals of these cuts to Congress will not be tolerated.

HEADLINE: The Way We Live Now: Banks of America

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is an economics columnist for The Times and a staff writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Few words conjure the specter of radicalism quite so well as nationalization. Seizing control of large industries -- nationalizing them -- is often among the first acts of a leftist government. Lenin did it, and so did Hugo Chavez. Even the comparatively tame Francois Mitterrand made the nationalization of some banks and heavy industry the centerpiece of his agenda when he became France's president in 1981. He held it out as the alternative to the laissez-faire ideology of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. 
 So it is a bit odd to watch Barack Obama, who aspires to finally end the era of Reaganomics, spend his early weeks in the White House swatting away calls for nationalization from decidedly nonleftist quarters. Lindsey Graham, a Republican senator from South Carolina, recently said that, given the depth of the credit crisis, he wouldn't rule out nationalizing banks. Alan Greenspan went further a few days later. ''I understand that once in a hundred years this is what you do,'' Greenspan, an Ayn Rand disciple before he was a central banker, told The Financial Times. 
 Graham and Greenspan were merely following the lead of various liberal and centrist economists who have been warning of the severity of the financial crisis over the past year. Only the government, their thinking goes, has the ability to remove the dead parts of the financial system so that the rest of it can start functioning again. But Obama and his Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, aren't interested, at least not yet. They want to give the private sector another chance to clean up its own mess. And that has made some people wonder whether it is now the left -- or at least Obama's Democratic Party -- that's too afraid of a little nationalization.
 There are really two different kinds of nationalization. The first draws on a belief that the government can run large enterprises more justly and efficiently than self-interested capitalists can. This is the nationalization of Lenin, Chavez and Mitterrand, and its record is pretty dismal. France's economy staggered through the 1980s, as government-run banks backed political pet projects that didn't work out. 
 The second version of nationalization is the one that today's advocates point to. It is a temporary takeover born out of crisis. Sweden pursued this kind of strategy in the early 1990s to clean up its banking system. Even the United States has nationalized banks on occasion, including IndyMac Bank last year.
 In these cases and others, the government had none of the grand ambitions that Mitterrand-style nationalizers had. The same would clearly be the case with a nationalization of banks today. ''Nobody in their right mind wants the government to be in the banking business any longer than it needs to be,'' said Adam Posen, an economist in Washington and a prominent voice for nationalization. Instead, the federal government would declare a bank insolvent, wipe out its existing shareholders, fire its top executives and inject enough money to keep it functioning. The government could then siphon off the worst assets into a so-called bad bank -- pooling them with toxic assets from other nationalized banks -- and resell the bank's healthy parts to private investors. Once the crisis lifts, some of the toxic assets may even have value. 
 The promise of nationalization is that it, and only it, can break a self-reinforcing cycle in which banks continue to make bad bets in an effort to dig themselves out of a hole. It's frequently said that bankers, paralyzed with fear, have been unwilling to make any new investments. But Posen points out that this isn't quite right. In the months before they collapsed, both Washington Mutual and Lehman Brothers made the financial equivalent of a Hail Mary pass: investments that had little chance of paying off but at least had the potential to put them back in the black. 
 Nationalization ends the game. In particular, it prevents the banks from making Hail Mary investments with bailout money from taxpayers. As Obama himself has suggested in interviews, recent history seems to argue for nationalization. Sweden nationalized and emerged from its crisis relatively quickly. Japan dithered with half measures and suffered through a lost decade. ''The weight of the historical evidence,'' as a Brookings Institution report dryly put it, ''is on the side of the proponents of tough action.'' 
 Obama and his advisers offer several arguments against nationalization. This country has many more banks than Sweden and would have to find many more crisis managers to run them. Our political system is also messier, and the banks could be vulnerable to political meddling. But their best argument is that nationalization would probably cost a whole lot of money. Once a few banks were taken over, shareholders might abandon others, fearing that their stock would also soon be worthless. These banks would then need government support. If Geithner's plan -- to lend banks money, in effect, and let them solve their own problems -- has a chance of working, it would probably be much cheaper.
 The question, obviously, is whether it is too late for such moderation and, if not, whether Obama's economic team will be able to see when it is. His top advisers, including Geithner and Lawrence Summers, have spent much of their careers trying to persuade other Democrats of the virtues of private enterprise. They have pushed the party to grasp the folly of Mitterrand and acknowledge the limits of government. As this crisis has made clear, the private sector has its limits, too. Will the people who have Obama's ear be able to acknowledge those limits when the time comes?

HEADLINE: Franklin Delano Obama

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Most presidents are tacticians, but President Obama is a strategist. His budget suggests that he aspires to be an echo of Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, harnessing his charisma, vision and political capital to transport America to a different place.
 The best measure of that is Mr. Obama's ''down payment'' to move closer to universal health coverage from womb to tomb. That is something that Roosevelt also sought, a lifetime ago. 
 The absurd system of health coverage we now have is a historical accident from World War II. Because of wage controls, employers competed for workers by offering health insurance as a fringe benefit -- and so we're stuck today with a system in which the loss of a job is compounded by the loss of health insurance. 
 Titanic ambitions encounter titanic opposition, and opponents of health reform are already rehearsing the arguments that they successfully used in the past:
 We have the best health care in the world, and you want to create a socialized bureaucracy? You want to wait months for a necessary operation, as in Canada? And you really want higher taxes to pay for this, stifling the economy and undermining our long-term competitiveness?
 So let's examine those arguments.
 It's true that the existing system offers top-line medical care. The top five American hospitals conduct more clinical trials than all the hospitals put together in any other country in the O.E.C.D., the club of industrialized nations.
 Yet over all, it is preposterous to argue that we have the best medical care in the world. Partly because so many Americans fall through the cracks and don't have insurance, life expectancy is higher in most of Europe than in the United States. Even the people of Cyprus live longer than Americans, according to United Nations figures.
 Meanwhile, American children are twice as likely to die by the age of 5 as children in Portugal, Spain or Slovenia. And the World Health Organization found that an American woman's lifetime risk of dying in childbirth is more than three times that of a woman in Greece, Spain or Germany. 
 Meanwhile, Americans spend $6,800 per person to get these second-rate results, about double what is paid in Canada or much of Europe.
 It's true that Canadians and Britons wait longer for non-urgent medical procedures than we do. But we have to wait a bit longer than Germans do. 
 McKinsey Global Institute found that the United States spends about $650 billion more on health care each year than one would expect for a country at its income level. That's $2,100 per American, and it's one gauge of the waste of our existing system.
 Repairing the system is thus not only a moral imperative but also an economic one. American businesses are at a competitive disadvantage when they have to pay for health care and foreign companies don't. Among General Motors' burdens is that it has to pay health costs equivalent to $1,500 for each car it sells.
 Sometimes the financial incentives for aggressive care even lead to excessive treatment. One study found that Medicare patients admitted to high-spending hospitals were up to 6 percent more likely to die than patients admitted to lower-spending hospitals.
 So if our health system is broken, is it really so awful that we increase taxes for the wealthiest Americans to make repairs? In 1980, the top-earning 1 percent of Americans accounted for 8 percent of the total income pie; by 2006, they grabbed nearly 23 percent.
 Think of the way the system treated Michelle Morse, a full-time student at Plymouth State University in New Hampshire. Michelle was found to have colon cancer in 2003, and her physician recommended that she take a leave of absence for chemotherapy.
 But if she took a leave, she would lose her insurance. Michelle stayed in school and underwent her treatments, while campaigning bravely for a law (eventually passed nationally last year) to let students remain on their parents' health insurance while on medical leave from college. The law came too late for her: she died in 2005.
 Would it have made a difference if Michelle had been able to take a leave and focus on treatment? ''We'll never know,'' said her mother, AnnMarie Morse.
 ''It was horrible,'' she said of her dealings with the insurance companies. She said that when one executive told her indignantly that the company had already paid out a lot of money for Michelle, she responded, ''I would give my life for you not to have to pay one cent for my daughter.''
 Not surprisingly, Mrs. Morse fervently hopes that Mr. Obama will be able to move the country toward a national health care system. If he can lead us there, even gradually, he has a chance to join the pantheon of truly great presidents like F.D.R. himself.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Give Bus Riders Some Relief, but at a Cost

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: MANHASSET 

 BODY:
 LINA OLSSON has spent a lot of time waiting at bus stops this year. Back in her native Sweden, she got around by train, bus and bicycle, and she assumed she would do the same when she moved to New York City a year ago to work in Manhasset as a genetics researcher for the North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System. 
 But her bus to the hospital from the Long Island Rail Road station in Great Neck is often late. The ride, which takes 5 to 10 minutes under optimal conditions, can take a half-hour, she said, and service is more unpredictable in the evening.
 ''The buses are always late, so I always miss my train,'' said Dr. Olsson, 30, who is a postdoctoral fellow at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research here. 
 Under a Metropolitan Transportation Authority rescue plan being drafted by Gov. David A. Paterson, getting Ms. Olsson to work on time may become easier for Long Island Bus, which primarily serves Nassau County.
 Mr. Paterson is pushing to have a bill introduced soon in the Legislature that would create a new regional bus system and improve suburban service, his aides said. The two largest suburban bus companies are Long Island Bus, which is operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Bee-Line bus system in Westchester, which is operated by the county.
 An expanded regional bus system would mean more frequent service, longer hours of service and, possibly, additional routes, officials said.
 But the plan, based on a report released in December by a state commission of finance and transportation experts, comes with new taxes and tolls to finance a regional bus system and the authority's operations and capital expenses. The tax and toll proposals are already facing opposition from some local officials and legislators.
 A regional bus authority would provide funding for, and possibly operate, suburban bus systems in the area. It might also provide more service across county lines and the potential for increased buying power.
 ''We need to get better express bus service from the suburbs into New York City,'' said Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the 1970s and early '80s and head of the recent state commission. 
 Fare receipts pay for less than half of suburban bus companies' operating expenses; the rest comes from a patchwork of federal, state and local revenue that varies year to year. 
 ''If the M.T.A. is going to spend this money on expanded regional bus activity, the incentive to Westchester and Nassau is that they are relieved of the operations,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''If you buy a thousand buses, you will pay less than if you buy 50 buses, and there are efficiencies in negotiating labor contracts as well.''
 Westchester County is endorsing Mr. Ravitch's proposal but is not willing to give up control of the Bee-Line system to the regional bus authority, said Lawrence C. Salley, commissioner of the Westchester Department of Transportation.
 ''It is primarily an issue of efficiency,'' he said. ''There are some areas where they bring efficiencies to the table, and some where we do. Theirs are offset by our ability to meet our local needs.''
 On Long Island, the issue of control was decided years ago when, in 1973, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority took over operation of Nassau County's bus system. 
 Despite the differences in management, the Westchester and Nassau bus systems have many similarities. Nassau's fleet is 328 buses; Westchester's is 365. Nassau had 33 million riders last year; Westchester had 32 million.
 The most significant difference between the systems is how they covered their 2008 operating deficits: $85 million for Nassau and $79 million for Westchester. 
 During the past three years, Nassau County has gotten $48 million in assistance from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, while Westchester, Mr. Salley said, has received none. The rest has been covered by the state and county government.
 State aid for the two bus systems was comparable in 2006, but in the last two years Nassau has gotten more than Westchester -- almost $10 million more in 2008. Westchester has had to pick up the difference, according to financial data the companies provided.
 ''The $64 question is, 'Why do Nassau taxpayers pay less?' '' Mr. Salley said.
 One big savings for Nassau taxpayers comes from Metropolitan Transportation Authority subsidies, said Jeremy Soffin, an authority spokesman. It does not give money to Westchester, he said, because the authority does not ''pay operators to run service over which we have no control.''
 In 2008, Nassau contributed $10 million to its bus system, while Westchester taxpayers spent almost $31 million. At the same time, the operating budget was $140 million for Nassau's bus system and $124 million for Westchester's. 
 ''Our fight is not with Nassau,'' Mr. Salley said, ''it is with how transportation is funded in the M.T.A. region.''
 The Ravitch plan would address the counties' chronic problems in financing bus service. It proposes two new sources of revenue: tolls on the East River and Harlem River bridges to Manhattan, which are now free, and a mobility tax of 33 cents on every $100 in salaries and wages that would be levied on all employers, public and private, in the 12 counties the authority serves. For example, a company with a $1 million payroll would pay $3,300 in mobility tax.
 ''Long Island Bus has been underfunded for all of these years from a county and a state perspective,'' said Joseph J. Smith, president of Long Island Bus. ''If our budgets were guaranteed, we could invest in new technology.'' 
 In the current economic climate, however, passage of the Ravitch plan is uncertain.
 Assemblyman David G. McDonough, a Republican from Merrick, is the ranking member of the Assembly's Transportation Committee and an opponent of the plan.
 ''Considering the times we are in right now, that payroll tax is going to hurt small businesses tremendously -- it could be the straw that breaks their back,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''The tolls on the bridges are like the congestion pricing plan, it just makes it more difficult for people.''
 A forum on the Ravitch plan is scheduled for 9 a.m. Friday at Hofstra University's Guthart Cultural Center Theater, sponsored by the university, the Regional Plan Association and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign.
 In Westchester, George S. Latimer, a Democratic assemblyman from the eastern part of the county who is also a member of the Transportation Committee, said he had heard very little about the plan from constituents. He said he did hear his first complaint in mid-February, at a public hearing in Larchmont, from a Mamaroneck School District official who said the mobility tax could be a hardship to the district.
 ''The tax is unpopular, but the question is, are there any other strategies that are more popular?'' Mr. Latimer said. ''The M.T.A. budget is filled with unpopular choices. If there was something easy to do, we would have done it by now.''

HEADLINE: 'Socialism!' Boo, Hiss, Repeat

BYLINE: By MARK LEIBOVICH

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
-- Conservatives might be seeking a spiritual leader, organizing principle and fresh identity, but they at least seem to have settled on a favorite rhetorical ogre: socialism.
 As in, Democrats are intent on forcing socialism on the ''U.S.S.A'' (as the bumper sticker says, under the words ''Comrade Obama'').
 It seems that ''socialist'' has supplanted ''liberal'' as the go-to slur among much of a conservative world confronting a one-two-three punch of bank bailouts, budget blowouts and stimulus bills. Right-leaning bloggers and talk radio hosts are wearing out the brickbat. Senate and House Republicans have been tripping over their podiums to invoke it. The S-bomb has become as surefire a red-meat line at conservative gatherings as ''Clinton'' was in the 1990s and ''Pelosi'' is today. 
 ''Earlier this week, we heard the world's best salesman of socialism address the nation,'' Senator Jim DeMint, Republican of South Carolina, said on Friday, referring, naturally, to a certain socialist in chief. 
 Former Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas decried the creation of ''socialist republics'' in the United States. ''Lenin and Stalin would love this stuff,'' Mr. Huckabee said, speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference here over the weekend, a kind of Woodstock for young conservatives.
 ''Socialism is something new for us to hit Obama over the head with,'' said Joshua Bolin of Augusta, Ga., who founded a Web site, ''Reagan.org,'' which he calls a conservative analog to the liberal MoveOn.org.
 Of course, there is nothing remotely new about ''socialism,'' or the willingness of conservatives to hit the opposition over the head with the term, just as the name callers among the liberals have bludgeoned conservatives as ''fascists,'' ''fundamentalists'' and ''plutocrats'' and whatnot for decades. 
 But the socialist bogey-mantra has made a full-scale return after a long stretch of relative dormancy. 
 The contemporary era of socialist demonizing dates to the general election campaign between Mr. Obama and John McCain. Mr. McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of wanting to ''spread the wealth,'' an offshoot of Mr. Obama's caught-on-tape exchange with an Ohio plumber (i.e. ''Joe the,'' last seen signing copies of his new book at CPAC). 
 ''Socialism'' became a star of subsequent McCain and Palin rallies in the same way that a dead bull is the star of a bullfight -- an object of slings, spears and overall bloodlust.
 The early fiscal activism of President Obama has provided a heap of new fodder for anti-socialists, effectively turning a useful label meant to inspire fear into a we-told-you-so taunt. Last week's blizzard of economic developments -- the administration's new budget, its partial takeover of another major bank -- was fortuitous timing for CPAC, which ran from Thursday to Saturday, giving conservatives an opportunity to give full-throated voice to this re-fashioned refrain. 
 ''The right would use 'socialist' against Franklin Roosevelt all the time in the 1930s,'' said Charles Geisst, a financial historian at Manhattan College in the Bronx. ''To hear him referred to as Comrade Roosevelt during that period was not unusual.'' But while socialism is being invoked repeatedly now, Mr. Geisst said, it is a less potent slam than it once was. 
 Vermont's Bernie Sanders -- an actual real-life, self-identified socialist in the United States Senate -- agrees, saying that ''socialism'' used to carry a ready-made stigma given its association with Soviet-style Communism. 
 But since there are so few Communist regimes left today, and generations have grown up since the end of the cold war, that stigma has been muted.
 Mr. Sanders said he was encouraged that even some conservative critics -- he mentions Newt Gingrich -- seem to be equating Mr. Obama's economic agenda to ''European-style socialism,'' as if to consciously distinguish it from the old Soviet vintage of the term. 
 ''I think this country could use a good debate on what goes on in places like Sweden, Norway and Finland,'' said Mr. Sanders, saying that notions like universal health care, more funding for education and a greater tax burden on the wealthy have accessible models in those countries. 
 Still, when Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana, denounced ''European-style socialism,'' in his speech at the conference on Thursday, the jeers from the crowd did not exactly signal an openness to debate it on the merits. 
 Or for that matter, any eagerness to differentiate the Swedish, Soviet and San Francisco flavors. 
 ''The word is most resonant in places where no one is going to discriminate between the various meanings of the term,'' Mr. Geisst said.
 And one of those places might be CPAC. ''Socialism is a bold color concept for conservatives,'' said one CPAC celebrity, the commentator Bay Buchanan, who had just finished scribbling autographs for a small cluster of young fans. She contrasted the ''bold color'' distinctions with the ''pale pastels'' that conservatives have drawn for too long. 
 Ms. Buchanan said that while ''socialist'' has largely been on hiatus as a put-down in recent years, it was an effective instrument in defeating Bill Clinton's effort to overhaul the country's health-care system in the early 1990s. '' 'Socialized medicine' was a great argument for us,'' she said, noting that the term will surely gain even more of a hold when the Obama administration unveils its own health care proposal, probably sometime this year.
 ''Americans are just genetically opposed to socialism,'' said Matt Kibbe, president of FreedomWorks, a conservative advocacy group headed by Dick Armey, the former House Republican leader. 
 Mr. Kibbe had just finished moderating a CPAC panel in a packed ballroom on Friday morning called ''Bailing Out Big Business: Are We All Socialists Now?'' 
 After four speakers took turns whacking the S-beast, Mr. Kibbe ended the proceeding with a quick survey: 
 ''If anyone here is not a socialist, raise your hand,'' he said, before heading off to a reassuring mass of palms.

HEADLINE: Easing the Way for Bus Riders, at a Cost

BYLINE: By ABBY GRUEN

DATELINE: NEW ROCHELLE 

 BODY:
 MOST evenings around dinnertime, you can spot Valery Johnson waiting for a bus at the new transit hub next to the Metro-North train station here. 
 Dressed in green scrubs, often with her dinner and other clothes in a couple of bags, Ms. Johnson starts the trip near her home in Mount Vernon and then has a 45-minute layover in New Rochelle on her two-hour journey to Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She works the night shift there as a nursing assistant five or six days a week.
 ''In the winter months, the buses don't run as regularly and fall behind schedule, so I'm often waiting outside in the cold,'' said Ms. Johnson, 60.
 Under a Metropolitan Transportation Authority rescue plan being drafted by Gov. David A. Paterson, getting Ms. Johnson to work faster may become easier for the Bee-Line bus system. 
 Mr. Paterson is pushing to have a bill introduced soon in the Legislature that would create a new regional bus system and improve suburban service, his aides said. The two largest suburban bus companies are Long Island Bus, which is operated by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, and the Bee-Line system in Westchester, which is operated by the county.
 An expanded regional bus system would mean more frequent service, longer hours of service and, possibly, additional routes, officials said.
 But the plan, based on a report released in December by a state commission of finance and transportation experts and generally endorsed last week by the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, comes with new taxes and tolls to finance a regional bus system and the authority's operations and capital expenses. The tax and toll proposals are already facing opposition from some local officials and legislators.
 A regional bus authority would provide funding for, and possibly operate, suburban bus systems in the area. It might also provide more service across county lines and the potential for increased buying power.
 ''We need to get better express bus service from the suburbs into New York City,'' said Richard Ravitch, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the 1970s and early '80s and head of the recent state commission. 
 Fare receipts pay for less than half of suburban bus companies' operating expenses; the rest comes from a patchwork of federal, state and local revenue that varies year to year. 
 ''If the M.T.A. is going to spend this money on expanded regional bus activity, the incentive to Westchester and Nassau is that they are relieved of the operations,'' Mr. Ravitch said. ''If you buy a thousand buses, you will pay less than if you buy 50 buses, and there are efficiencies in negotiating labor contracts as well.''
 Westchester County is endorsing Mr. Ravitch's proposal but is not willing to give up control of the Bee-Line system to the regional bus authority, said Lawrence C. Salley, commissioner of the Westchester Department of Transportation.
 ''It is primarily an issue of efficiency,'' he said. ''There are some areas where they bring efficiencies to the table, and some where we do. Theirs are offset by our ability to meet our local needs.''
 On Long Island, the issue of control was decided years ago when, in 1973, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority took over operation of Nassau County's bus system. 
 Despite the differences in management, the Westchester and Nassau bus systems have many similarities. Nassau's fleet is 328 buses; Westchester's is 365. Nassau had 33 million riders last year; Westchester had 32 million.
 The most significant difference between the systems is how they covered their 2008 operating deficits: $85 million for Nassau and $79 million for Westchester. 
 During the past three years, Nassau County has gotten $48 million in assistance from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, while Westchester, Mr. Salley said, has received none. The rest has been covered by the state and county government.
 State aid for the two bus systems was comparable in 2006, but in the last two years Nassau has gotten more than Westchester -- almost $10 million more in 2008. Westchester has had to pick up the difference, according to financial data the companies provided.
 ''The $64 question is, 'Why do Nassau taxpayers pay less?' '' Mr. Salley said.
 One big savings for Nassau taxpayers comes from Metropolitan Transportation Authority subsidies, said Jeremy Soffin, an authority spokesman. It does not give money to Westchester, he said, because the authority does not ''pay operators to run service over which we have no control.''
 In 2008, Nassau contributed $10 million to its bus system, while Westchester taxpayers spent almost $31 million. At the same time, the operating budget was $140 million for Nassau's bus system and $124 million for Westchester's. 
 ''Our fight is not with Nassau,'' Mr. Salley said, ''it is with how transportation is funded in the M.T.A. region.''
 The Ravitch plan would address the counties' chronic problems in financing bus service. It proposes two new sources of revenue: tolls on the East River and Harlem River bridges to Manhattan, which are now free, and a mobility tax of 33 cents on every $100 in salaries and wages that would be levied on all employers, public and private, in the 12 counties the authority serves. For example, a company with a $1 million payroll would pay $3,300 in mobility tax.
 ''Long Island Bus has been underfunded for all of these years from a county and a state perspective,'' said Joseph J. Smith, president of Long Island Bus. ''If our budgets were guaranteed, we could invest in new technology.'' 
 In the current economic climate, however, passage of the Ravitch plan is uncertain.
 Assemblyman David G. McDonough, a Republican from Merrick, in Nassau County, is the ranking member of the Assembly's Transportation Committee and an opponent of the plan.
 ''Considering the times we are in right now, that payroll tax is going to hurt small businesses tremendously -- it could be the straw that breaks their back,'' Mr. McDonough said. ''The tolls on the bridges are like the congestion pricing plan, it just makes it more difficult for people.''
 In Westchester, George S. Latimer, a Democratic assemblyman from the eastern part of the county who is also a member of the Transportation Committee, said he had heard very little about the plan from constituents. He said he did hear his first complaint in mid-February, at a public hearing in Larchmont, from a Mamaroneck School District official who said the mobility tax could be a hardship to the district.
 ''The tax is unpopular, but the question is, are there any other strategies that are more popular?'' Mr. Latimer said. ''The M.T.A. budget is filled with unpopular choices. If there was something easy to do, we would have done it by now.''

HEADLINE: Obama Calls His Budget Sweeping, Needed Change

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama on Saturday described his expansive budget proposal as ''a threat to the status quo in Washington'' and cast himself as a populist crusader willing to do battle with special interests to expand health care, curb pollution and improve education.
 ''I didn't come here to do the same thing we've been doing or to take small steps forward,'' Mr. Obama said in his weekly radio and Internet address. ''I came to provide the sweeping change that this country demanded when it went to the polls in November. That is the change this budget starts to make, and that is the change I'll be fighting for in the weeks ahead.'' 
 The address hinted at the strategy the White House intends to employ to push for the spending plan released last week, a return to a more traditional Democratic approach of positioning the party as fighting against the rich and powerful. In Mr. Obama's telling, he is taking on entrenched interests in the form of banks, insurance companies, large agribusinesses, oil and gas companies and others.
 Beyond the $3.6 trillion budget for the 2010 fiscal year, the president's spending plan outlines an array of ambitious initiatives for the next several years that collectively would transform American society. He wants to extend health coverage to the more than 40 million uninsured, revamp industry so that it stops producing so many emissions that cause climate change, develop alternative energy sources and invest billions of dollars more in education.
 At the same time, he wants to restructure the tax code to shift more of the burden from lower- and middle-income workers to the rich to reverse the widening income gap. And he promised to bring the federal deficit, projected to reach $1.75 trillion this year, under control by 2013.
 The president said his plan already had ''special interests'' gearing up for battle. He said that ''the insurance industry won't like the idea'' that he would force competitive bidding for Medicare coverage, that ''banks and big student lenders won't like the idea'' of ending subsidies for student loans, and that ''oil and gas companies won't like'' the end of certain tax breaks.
 ''The system we have now might work for the powerful and well-connected interests that have run Washington for far too long, but I don't,'' he said. ''I work for the American people.''
 Some of his ideas have attracted criticism across party lines. Republicans deride the overall plan as a ''job killer'' intended to revive class warfare, soak the rich and burden business too much at a time of economic hardship. The plan means ''the era of big government is back,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader.
 In the official Republican response to the president's weekly address, Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina argued that the Obama plan represented out-of-control spending that would drive the nation deeper into debt. 
 ''Unfortunately, Washington is in a state of denial,'' Mr. Burr said. ''Our spending habits haven't gotten better; they've only gotten worse. It seems that every morning you pick up the newspaper, you're reading about another multibillion-dollar government spending plan being proposed or, even worse, passed.''
 Mitt Romney, a former and possibly future Republican presidential candidate, told a conference of conservative activists on Friday that Democrats wanted to expand government too far. ''As they try to pull us in the direction of government-dominated Europe, we're going to have to fight as never before to make sure that America stays America,'' Mr. Romney said.
 Certain provisions in Mr. Obama's plan may strike special interests, but they also affect favored programs for Democrats as well as Republicans.
 Senators Kent Conrad and Byron L. Dorgan, both North Dakota Democrats, for instance, declared opposition to Mr. Obama's proposal to phase out agricultural subsidies for farmers with gross receipts over $500,000.
 Mr. Conrad, the Budget Committee chairman, said some tax increases on high-income workers ''may well not survive'' and expressed concern about the buildup of debt.
 ''I think we ought to go to work and take the good things in this president's budget, especially the first five years where he cuts the deficit in half,'' Mr. Conrad told CNBC. ''But then he kind of gets stuck in the second five years. I think we can do better.''

HEADLINE: Newt. Again.

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Inside the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
FOR CONSERVATIVES, who have traditionally valued their grand theorists more than their campaign consultants, the buildings that house Washington's premier think tanks are like a second set of grand monuments, symbols of a movement built on brash ingenuity. The Cato Institute, headquarters of the nation's libertarian academy, occupies a stunning steel-and-glass tower on Massachusetts Avenue, boasting the kind of light-filled, contemporary opulence you would expect to find in Silicon Valley. The American Enterprise Institute displays a tasteful logo outside its longtime offices on 17th Street, where some 200 employees and 90 scholars confront the issues of the day a few blocks from tony Dupont Circle. And several blocks from the Capitol stands the beast of them all, the almost mythical Heritage Foundation, with its $60 million budget and eight-story complex, complete with housing for 60 interns, two auditoriums and two broadcast studios. Heritage is the Parthenon of the conservative metropolis, the names of its founding donors inscribed on the lobby wall for history to remember. 
 Talk to despairing Republicans in Congress these days, however, and you will hear little reverence for these brainy institutions, which one senior aide recently described to me, acidly, as a bunch of ''moribund blogging societies.'' Twelve years of Republican power in Congress -- along with eight in the White House -- seem to have had the effect of sapping the vitality and antiestablishment moxie from the movement's venerable policy centers, which now spend a fair amount of time holding wonderfully esoteric brown-bag lunches about pharmaceutical prices or the British economy while, just down the street, conservative lawmakers are huddling together for warmth. 
 These days, to hear Republicans tell it, the conservative movement's intellectual and strategic thunderbolts seem to be emanating, instead, from an undistinguished box of a building on K Street, amid the city's famed corridor of lobbyists. In unmarked office suites scattered across separate floors, some 35 employees divide their duties among a consulting group, two insurgent policy centers, a documentary-film production company and a public-relations firm with only one client. That client would be the man who sits atop this emerging center of opposition, the once-defeated revolutionary who, like Che or Tito, is best known by a single name: Newt.
 When most of the nonpolitical world last paid attention to Newt Gingrich, about a decade ago, he was stepping away from public life shrouded in the kind of ignominy that seemed to shadow all the sordid politics of his era. Having delivered House Republicans from decades of suffering in the minority, and having reigned for a brief time as one of the most powerful House speakers since the early part of the 20th century, Gingrich followed the same steep trajectory back down to near irrelevance. Politically, he was badly outflanked by a masterful and more pragmatic Bill Clinton; on a personal level, he was undone by petulance and hypocrisy, whining about his status on Air Force One after a state funeral and carrying on an extramarital affair while impeaching the president for lying about sexual transgressions. He became, in the public mind, a mop-haired caricature, the man depicted on the front page of The Daily News as a crying infant.
 But while the last 12 months or so have been almost unimaginably dismal for the Republican Party, it has been a pretty great year for Newt. Last spring, as gas prices soared, Gingrich expertly employed the combination of an Internet appeal and some cheerleading from Sean Hannity to popularize his new slogan for increased domestic oil production -- ''Drill here, drill now, pay less'' -- and delivered to Congress a petition with more than a million signatures in support of more drilling. That campaign stiffened the resolve of Congressional Republicans, who had proved maddeningly inept at harnessing the tools of modern communication in the way their former leader had; they dug in on the issue and ultimately forced Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats into a rare surrender. (Even John McCain felt the need to change his position on drilling, leading Republicans to turn their entire convention -- ''Drill, baby, drill!'' -- into a pep rally for ExxonMobil.) In September, an emboldened Gingrich goaded influential House Republicans into revolting against Bush's bailout plan for the banks. Gingrich's book ''Real Change'' recently spent 11 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.
 Now, as Republicans on the Hill begin to awaken from a November beating that left them semiconscious, Gingrich finds himself, once again, at the zenith of influence in conservative Washington. It is a fortuitous collision of man and moment. Having ceded the agenda to a Republican president for the past eight years (and having mostly obsessed over White House scandals for much of the decade before that), Republicans now find that they have strikingly little to say that isn't entirely reactive -- or reactionary. ''It was like 'The Matrix,' when Keanu Reeves wakes up and his eyes hurt because he hasn't used them,'' David Winston, a pollster for House Republicans, told me recently, talking about the 2006 election that relegated Republicans to the minority for the first time since 1994. ''We just didn't know how to do ideas anymore.'' Whatever else you think of Gingrich, he has always been considered a prospector in bold and counterintuitive thinking -- floating ideas, throughout his career, that have ranged from giving every poor child a laptop to abolishing the entire concept of adolescence.
 As it happens, Gingrich is also the only guy alive who can actually claim to have led a beleaguered Republican House minority back to power. During the years when Tom DeLay and Karl Rove ruled Washington, conservatives wondered what they had to learn from a has-been who had been forced from power; now they wonder if he might have just a little more magic left under that schoolboy shock of white hair. ''If you said to me that I could only consult with one individual, and my job was to bring the party back, Newt Gingrich would be the guy,'' says Frank Luntz, the pollster who has worked with Gingrich going back to the 1994 Contract With America, the 10-point agenda that Republicans waved around on their way to the majority. ''This guy would be the perfect 'Behind the Music' story, because he was on top, and then he lost it all, and now he's back and bigger than ever. It's perfect.''
 It's also a little strange. Barack Obama ran for president, you'll recall, on the idea that the politics of the '90s -- if not the policies that brought about unbridled prosperity -- could finally be put behind us. But the '90s, it turns out, are not so easily dispatched. Much of Obama's own administration has been culled, perhaps necessarily, from the ranks of those who fought alongside Clinton during those dark years when they and Gingrich's army fought wars of attrition over the budget and impeachment: Rahm Emanuel, Leon Panetta, Hillary Clinton herself. And now here comes their old adversary, back from the political dead, just to make the whole thing seem like some retro reality show -- ''Battle of the Aging Boomers.'' Last time around, of course, Democrats got the best of their encounter with Newt. Republicans have to hope that Gingrich, an avid military historian, has learned a thing or two about how to regroup.
 ON THE NIGHT OF OBAMA'S INAUGURATION, Frank Luntz organized a dinner at the Caucus Room, one of those classic Washington expense-account places, with about 15 Republican congressmen and senators, including some in the leadership. Their ears still rang with the jeers of Obama supporters on the Mall, whose taunts, aimed at George W. Bush as he sat placidly through the proceedings, had ricocheted loudly off the walls of the Capitol -- it was a final indignity on a day that felt something like a funeral. Dinner was well under way by the time Gingrich arrived, but he proceeded to hold forth for hours, rallying the Republican troops who sat rapt in their chairs. Gingrich was fascinated and impressed by Obama's address (''Those could have been our words,'' he told the group), and he advised them to laminate it and keep it close by, so that they could hold the new president to his pragmatic rhetoric. He urged them to go after the nomination of the incoming Treasury secretary, Timothy Geithner, who had been one of the architects of the bailout plan Gingrich found so odious and who was now in trouble over unpaid taxes.
 The next day, at Geithner's confirmation hearing, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Republican in the Senate and one of the dinner guests that night, ripped into Geithner, calling it ''incomprehensible'' that the nominee for Treasury hadn't known whether he had fully paid his income taxes while he was at the International Monetary Fund. At a Republican retreat two weeks later in Virginia, Peter Roskam, an Illinois congressman who also attended the dinner, showed up with laminated copies of excerpts from Obama's inaugural address and handed them out to his colleagues.
 The point of this story isn't that Gingrich is some kind of mind-controlling charlatan -- although if you talk long enough to the small cadre of loyalists who have been with him for the better part of 30 years, you might start to wonder. It's more that Republicans right now are desperately looking for direction from someone, ideally someone who knows how to handle an opposition president with a 65-percent approval rating. Normally this role would fall to a charismatic Congressional boss or to a vaunted strategist with a record of success. At the moment, Republicans have neither. The House leader, John Boehner, is a dealmaker of the 1980s Republican variety -- smoker's voice, sculptured hair, a lobbyist's pinstripe suit. He's a solid guy, the kind you could golf with or put on your board of directors, but nothing about him makes you want to charge toward a machine-gun battery to take a hill. Over on the Senate side, Mitch McConnell, an expert floor tactician, seems about as socially uncomfortable as a man can be and still reach the pinnacle of politics. The closest thing the party has to a grand strategist, Karl Rove, offers most of his wisdom on Fox News, prompting a lot of Republicans who endured his tirades during the Bush years to shudder and change the channel.
 The breach here is plenty wide, and Gingrich is nothing if not politically agile. He has maintained, from his days in Congress, close relationships with colleagues who still serve in the House or who, like Kyl, have now moved on to the Senate. He has forged new alliances with leaders of the next generation as well -- most notably Eric Cantor, the Virginia congressman who is minority whip, just below Boehner in the hierarchy. Then there is the group of senior aides that includes Paula Nowakowski, Boehner's chief of staff, who told me she is barraged almost daily with what she calls Newtgrams -- e-mail messages from Gingrich with lists of policy ideas, questions or advice on how to handle the caucus. 
 Another frequent recipient is Paul Ryan, a young Wisconsin congressman and Gingrich protege known for burrowing into budget issues. Ryan told me he was opening presents with his children on Christmas when his BlackBerry buzzed with a question about the tax code. ''He's a total idea factory,'' Ryan said. ''The man will have 10 ideas in an hour. Six of them will be brilliant, two of them are in the stratosphere and two of them I'll just flat-out disagree with. And then you'll get 10 more ideas in the next hour.''
 A lot of these e-mail messages are deeply wonkish, written in single-sentence paragraphs without punctuation or capital letters. It's almost as if you can see Gingrich twittering away at a Starbucks while doing calculations on a wrinkled napkin. On Thanksgiving Day, for instance, in an e-mail message one recipient shared with me, Gingrich fired off a riff on an idea by Louie Gohmert, a Republican congressman from Texas, who had suggested that, instead of a stimulus bill, the party propose a payroll-tax holiday. ''FICA and personal income tax combined are about $160 billion a month (you might want to check my math),'' Gingrich wrote to a group of Congressional allies. ''So if Pelosi proposes a $700 billion stimulus spending package in January, we could propose a 4-month tax holiday as the alternative.'' In a separate e-mail message to his own aides, he wrote: ''Think of no personal or corporate income tax and no fica tax for a year as a stimulus package. Am I nuts in rome or is the contrast startling.''
 The tax-holiday idea never really went anywhere. Republican leaders in Congress were fixated on a more tactical question: whether the party risked more by opposing Obama outright or by exploring some kind of compromise with him. What they sought from Gingrich wasn't the policy ideas of an unorthodox thinker so much as the strategic insight of the last Republican heavyweight to have mixed it up with a deft Democratic president. 
 A few days after the inauguration, I met Eric Cantor at a bench outside the House chamber, and we walked -- jogged, actually -- across the street to the Rayburn Building, where the Ways and Means Committee was marking up the Democratic stimulus bill. Cantor is just two years younger than Obama, and you can see how he might emerge in the years ahead as the president's generational opposite, in the same way that Gingrich and Bill Clinton often seemed to bring out in each other their long-dormant high school personas. Where Obama sweeps through a room, effortless and aloof, the wiry Cantor emits a kind of nerdy intensity, like an actuary who really loves his work. Cantor says ''frankly'' a lot, usually just before he says something that's highly calibrated.
 I asked Cantor whether Gingrich was giving him useful advice for how to navigate the current moment.
 ''Every day, every day,'' he told me. ''You want specifics?'' 
 I nodded.
 ''Well, generally, he is very quick to see the historic election of President Obama and the potential for his support to last, and what that means for Congress, and how we compare the success of Barack Obama to, frankly, the difficulties that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid are having with the American public right now,'' Cantor said. ''You know, Congressional Democrats are nowhere near where this president is right now in terms of public opinion.'' 
 Cantor listed some of the more extreme liberal forces -- he mentioned Code Pink, the women's antiwar group, and the ''radical environmental movement,'' which were about the most provocative examples he could come up with off the top of his head -- that seemed, in his view, to hold sway among Democrats in Congress but whom Obama, with his centrist outlook, might need to defy. ''If you watch where he's going, since he's been elected he's sort of rejected some of the campaign rhetoric and said we have to deliberate, we have to be thoughtful,'' Cantor went on. ''He understands the burdens of the office and at the same time understands that this is a center-right country. We're closer to that, frankly, than the majority in the House.'' 
 THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I had heard any Republican leader describe this tactical approach, and it struck me as surprising. Like most everyone else, I had assumed that Republicans were confronting a single, difficult question: How do you contrast yourself favorably with a wildly popular new president at a time of great urgency when you yourself are about as popular as acne? (In a poll conducted by the firm Research 2000 last month, Boehner's approval rating hit a new low of 18 percent.) But Cantor was suggesting that Republicans might not need to contrast themselves with Obama at all -- that, in fact, by appearing to share Obama's basically moderate impulse toward policy, they could instead contrast themselves with Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, with an eye toward picking up some seats in 2010. In the weeks after my meeting with Cantor, Congressional Democrats began to discern the outlines of this strategy as well, complaining that Republicans were trying to drive a wedge between them and Obama by appearing to embrace the president while criticizing the ideological rigidity of his party.
 As Gingrich explained it to me back in November, just after the election, what he had been preaching to Cantor and other House Republicans was actually more radical than that. Gingrich, who likes to reduce the world to binary options, saw two basic paths for Obama: either he was going to cater to interest groups and his Congressional wing, or he was going to take a more centrist, more reformist approach to governing. 
 If he chose Door No. 1, then Republicans had to propose a thoughtful, alternate agenda of their own. ''Screaming 'No!' is just not a strategy,'' Gingrich told me. But he said he was betting that Obama would take the second approach -- that he meant what he said about leaving the old doctrines behind and intended to govern in a way that might fundamentally realign American politics. And if that were the case, Gingrich reasoned, not only would it be politically unpalatable to stand in Obama's way, but chances were he would soon face serious fractures within his own party and would need to create a broader coalition of partners to get his initiatives through the Congress.
 In other words, Gingrich wasn't suggesting to Cantor and the others that they should simply pretend to like Obama well enough. He was telling them that if Obama was going to move far enough in their direction, their best play -- and maybe their only play -- was actually to team up with him on legislation if they could.
 ''I already told the House and Senate Republicans, if Obama decides to govern from the center, you have to work with him,'' Gingrich told me. ''He's the president of the United States. If the president of the United States walks in with a rational, moderate proposal which has his left wing up in arms and you don't help him, you look like you're a nihilistic party of reactionary opposition.'' He pointed to the model of Lyndon Johnson and Sam Rayburn, the Democratic tandem in the Senate and House who worked amiably with Dwight Eisenhower and, in so doing, split the Republican Party for years to come. 
 ''I don't actually build oppositions,'' Gingrich told me, as if this business of salvaging a lost party were something he undertook every couple of months. ''I build the next governing majority. I have no interest in being an opposition party.''
 As a first test of this theory of engagement, however, negotiations over Obama's stimulus plan cast doubt on how sincere Republicans were about emulating a Johnson-Rayburn model. At first, Republicans in the House and Senate went out of their way to praise the president, who staked out a negotiating position by including $250 billion worth of tax cuts in his initial proposal. Obama came to the Hill for a 90-minute meeting and seemed apologetic, according to Republicans who participated, for the way the House minority had been shut out of the rule-making process. Cantor led an economic working group in coming up with alternative ideas for the bill -- basically the kind of deep tax cuts the Democrats had already rejected -- and he and Boehner then delivered them to the president. ''I've been with him four times now, and he continues to at least listen,'' Cantor told me during a phone conversation before the vote. Meanwhile, in a speech at the National Press Club, McConnell sounded similarly conciliatory, vowing to ''choose bipartisan solutions over partisan failures every time.'' 
 House Democrats, however, still recalling the way Republicans treated them during their years in the minority, designed their bill as if all the Republicans had just been carted away to Guantanamo Bay. Whatever actual resolve Republicans may have had to work across party lines seemed to dissolve overnight, and they reverted to the more familiar stance of reflexive opposition.
 Despite some grumbling among Democrats on the Hill, Obama's majority didn't fracture, as Gingrich and his minions might have hoped. In the end, House Republican leaders demanded that their members vote unanimously against the bill, and in the Senate, even after the package was trimmed in a concession to centrists from both parties, only the remaining dinosaurs from the party's Northeastern establishment crossed the aisle. Obama himself, sounding markedly less bipartisan, skewered the diminished G.O.P. as a party that did, in fact, reflexively scream no, and Republicans did little to counter the impression; in an ill-advised remark to the National Journal's Hotline, Pete Sessions, the Texas congressman and chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, suggested that insurgent Republicans had a lot to learn from the Taliban. 
 And yet, in fruitlessly trying to obstruct Obama's gargantuan stimulus bill, Republicans had come away with an issue by which to define themselves. It turned out that they actually could stand up to Obama, soaring approval ratings and all, and live to see another vote, and that provided a psychological boost to a minority party that had seemed cowed and confused. Just as important, judging from the polls and media coverage, they had at least managed to introduce a reasonable doubt about the stimulus plan into the jury box of public opinion, a note of skepticism that might linger in the months ahead. Republicans had taken the calculated risk, of course, that if the economy improved, Democrats would throw the vote back at them in the 2010 elections. But at least now, having presented a philosophical alternative, they could run against the bill in 2010 if it turned out only to swell the deficit without creating the jobs that Obama had forecast.
 The night after lodging their protest against the bill on the House floor, Republican congressmen arrived at a retreat in Virginia feeling jubilant for the first time since before the presidential campaign. Waiting for them there was the evening's keynote speaker -- Gingrich, of course. Having seen his engage-and-divide strategy founder almost immediately when it came to the stimulus, Gingrich seemed to have changed his mind about Obama and resorted to his more instinctual, more confrontational cast. No longer did he talk of Obama as the kind of centrist guy you could get your arms around. In the coming days, in fact, he would deride the president's ''left-wing policies'' while at the same time accuse him of ''Nixonian'' abuses of power.
 On this night, Gingrich congratulated his troops on standing united and inspired them with stories about Charles de Gaulle's heroism and George Washington at Valley Forge, as well as the football legends Joe Paterno and Vince Lombardi. Now was the time for Republicans to rediscover their principles, Gingrich told the congressmen. At one point, he likened himself, lightheartedly, to Moses. He'd help them cross the Red Sea once again, Gingrich vowed, but only if they promised, this time, to stay on the other side. 
 BEFORE HE BECAME A CONGRESSMAN, Newt Gingrich, Ph.D., taught history at West Georgia College. Interviewing Gingrich, as I did on three occasions recently, is like stopping by the office of your thesis adviser when your thesis adviser has better things to do with his time. Polite but impatient, Gingrich answers most questions pedagogically, with impromptu seminars on history or social theory. It seems important to him that you know how much he knows -- which, truth be told, is quite a lot.
 There are moments when this routine can verge on the absurd, like something out of a Ricky Gervais sketch. At one point, I asked Gingrich, now a healthful-looking 65, about his sudden exit from Congress in 1998. ''First of all, in the Toynbeean sense, I believe in departure and return,'' he told me.
 ''In the what sense?'' I asked.
 ''Arnold Toynbee,'' he replied matter-of-factly, as if no one would walk into his office without having read ''Lectures on the Industrial Revolution in England.'' ''I believe in the sense that, you know, De Gaulle had to go to Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises for 11 years.''
 ''I'm sorry?''
 ''Departure and return. And someone once said to me, if you don't leave, you can't come back, because you've never left.''
 I was still trying to process this nugget when the slouching Gingrich, now onto a point about steel plants closing, jolted upright. ''The 1913 Girl Scouts manual!'' he said, or at least that's what it sounded like. ''Which I should get a copy of.'' He punched a button on his phone and dialed his assistant.
 ''Yes, sir?'' 
 ''Can you get me about four copies of the 1913 Girl Scouts manual, 'How Girls Can Help Their Country'?'' Gingrich asked. There was a long pause on the other end.
 ''O.K.''
 ''I think it's on Amazon,'' Gingrich said helpfully. He leaned back and proceeded to explain to me that the Girl Scouts manual contained a recommendation that every girl learn to perform two jobs, just in case one of them went away. What we needed, apparently, were more steelworkers who belonged to the Girl Scouts.
 Republicans had been in the minority for 24 years when suburban Atlanta sent the 35-year-old Gingrich to the House of Representatives in 1978, and they had just about accepted that their status there wouldn't change in any of their lifetimes. From the day he arrived and began ascending the levels of leadership, Gingrich was the one guy who woke up every morning determined to reverse the flow of history. ''He was himself the counterculture,'' Frank Luntz says. ''If people had run their own local campaigns up to then, he nationalized them. If people ran simplistically, he made it more complicated. If people ran by telling you why their opponents stunk, he ran by telling you why his side was better. He did the opposite of everything that had been done up to then, because everything up to then had been a disaster.''
 Even now, all these years later, when you ask Republicans from that era what went wrong -- how it was that Gingrich resigned from Congress just four years after finally becoming speaker, having suffered a major defeat at the polls and having seen his approval rating fall to 11 percent -- you get a lot of blank looks and tortured shrugs. It's as if the thing exploded so quickly that no one ever had time to reassemble the parts and figure out where the malfunction was. But whether the igniter was impeachment or the budget shutdown, everyone agrees that it was probably as much an issue of temperament as of circumstance. Gingrich is a historian and a futurist; he's comfortable looking backward or ahead, but he doesn't actually do all that well with the present. Possessed of a chaotic mind that moves from one obsession to the next, Gingrich flailed from objective to objective, while his missteps came to dominate the news.
 Then, too, there was the question of what to do with power. Gingrich has often been prescient in his thinking about social change. In his first book, ''Window of Opportunity,'' published in 1984 with a weird ''Dune'' sort of cover featuring an eagle and a space shuttle, Gingrich wrote of a day when a growing number of Americans would work from their homes rather than commute to offices, using their own personal computers along with ''information-set'' telephones that would transmit vast amounts of data over the phone lines. This was when most of America was just discovering the Commodore 64. (Gingrich also predicted that factories would soon be making alloy metals in space, although he did say that this could happen only if we pursued the right policies, which, clearly, we did not.) And yet, in his machinations to bring his party back to power, Gingrich became preoccupied with process. The Contract With America was mostly a call to reform the institution of Congress; moving beyond it, turning the corner from rebellion to governance, required workable ideas beyond slashing programs and taxes.
 When Gingrich looks back now on the days after his resignation, he sounds genuinely relieved. ''It took me probably five seconds to switch personal assignments,'' he told me recently, ''because my dad was a career soldier, and I'd been through change-of-command ceremonies. I got it.'' (At one point, I asked Gingrich why he hadn't followed his father into the Army. ''I was nearsighted and flat-footed,'' he told me. ''What did your dad think of that?'' I asked. ''That I was nearsighted and flat-footed,'' he replied.) Freed from the constraints of governing, Gingrich turned chiefly to two pursuits: making money, which he did through speeches and television punditry, and exploring ideas, especially in the realm of technology and modernization. The jewels of his small empire on K Street are his two policy centers: the Center for Health Transformation, which is actually a for-profit association of health care providers, and the newer American Solutions, which churns out research on a broader array of issues. 
 Gingrich is all about offering, as he puts it, a ''better value'' for the American customer -- constructive solutions Republicans can take on the road during the next midterm election season and beyond. ''Most Republicans are not entrepreneurial,'' he lamented to me. ''They're corporatists. They like the security and the comfort of a well-thought-out, highly boring boardroom meeting in which they do a PowerPoint once. And it worries them to have ideas, because ideas have edges, and they're not totally formed, and you've got to prove them, and they sound strange because they're new, and if it's new how do you know it's any good, because, after all, it's new and you've never heard it before.''
 At our first meeting in November, Gingrich laid out for me his latest preoccupation, which, surprisingly, had nothing to do with stimulus or banking. ''One of the projects I'm going to launch -- we don't have a name for it yet -- is an air-traffic modernization project,'' Gingrich told me excitedly. ''You can do a space-based air-traffic-control system with half the current number of air-traffic controllers, increase the amount of air traffic in the northeast by 40 percent, allow point-to-point flights without the controllers having to have highways in the sky, and reduce the amount of aviation fuel by 10 percent. So it's better for the environment, better for the economy. You have far fewer delays in New York, and by the way, you cut the number of unionized air-traffic controllers by 7,000.
 ''Our thematic is going to be -- you're going to love this -- that if you have an air-traffic delay that's not caused by weather, take the extra time at the airport and call your two senators and your congressman and demand they pass the modernization act,'' Gingrich enthused. ''Now, notice what I'm doing,'' he said, leaning back and smiling. ''I'm offering you a better value.''
 It sounded like a cool idea, to be sure, as long as you weren't one of those poor air-traffic controllers, who, for whatever reason, have been on the wrong side of Republicans since Reagan fired them in 1981. But it was hard to imagine Republicans outflanking Obama, as we stood on the brink of global panic, by promising a better on-time ratio for Delta. This has long been the chief criticism of Gingrich among those who share his ideological convictions -- that there is a randomness to his brilliance, a lack of prioritization or discipline. Gingrich may be an ''idea factory,'' as Paul Ryan puts it, but it sometimes seems like a factory working on triple shifts without a floor manager or anyone keeping the books. Even Gingrich's modestly bulging waistline, which expands and contracts on some kind of lunar schedule to which only fellow Republicans seem especially attuned, is mentioned as evidence that Gingrich can't focus on any one objective for very long.
 The ideas Gingrich promotes seem to rotate every few weeks, depending on the book he has just torn through or the especially illuminating conversation he has just had, or simply on where his earnest fascination with policy has taken him this morning. One day it's his energy plan, which includes not just drilling offshore and in the oil-shale-packed mountainous West but also the kind of massive investment in solar and wind power and biofuels that Obama and other Democrats favor. On another day it might be his favorite education idea, which entails a plan to reward low-income high-school students who graduate early with a college scholarship equal to the value of the money they're saving the school system. 
 There's not really any unified, easily distillable argument in these and other proposals, no ideology that might be charted on a continuum and labeled accordingly. Rather, the new-model Newt seems to be pursuing a ruthlessly responsive, almost-wikified brand of politics. His goal is to turn the Republicans into what he calls a ''party of the American people'' by linking disparate solutions whose only real relationship to one another is that they demonstrate, in surveys, what he calls ''tripartisan'' appeal -- the broad support of Republicans, Democrats and independents. Gingrich told me he has identified about 100 ideas and positions that command anywhere from 62 percent to 93 percent support among such a cross-section of voters: giving out tax credits for installing alternative heating sources in your home (90 percent); awarding cash prizes to anyone who invents a car that gets 100 miles to the gallon (77 percent); keeping God in the Pledge of Allegiance (88 percent). Gingrich's vision -- much more Clintonian than Reaganite -- is to use targeted initiatives to create a kind of mechanized compatibility with the masses. 
 What must be obvious even to Gingrich is that none of these calculations have much to do with what his acolytes in Congress want from him right now. Rather, what Republicans on the Hill value about Gingrich is that he has something to say about every issue, a parry for every feint, a sense of certainty and plainspokenness in confronting policy issues that most Republicans have either ignored for a decade or reduced to hopelessly leaden detail. Gingrich thinks about ideas strategically, as a way of countering his opponents or wooing new constituencies, and this is something Republicans have failed to do almost from the day he left Capitol Hill. The party's besieged leaders aren't looking to Gingrich to be the architect of some grand new philosophical structure. Rather, they're hoping he can help erect some armaments around the ideological fortress in which they now find themselves trapped, in danger of being completely overrun.
 I SPENT A LOT OF TIME reporting on the world of progressive politics after the 2004 election, and it's hard to miss the nearly perfect symmetry between that Democratic moment and the one Republicans find themselves confronting today. Like Democrats after John Kerry's defeat, Republicans now whine about their failed strategists or their flawed candidate or a media that refuses to expose the obvious deficiency of their opponents. The Democratic establishment in 2005 was under assault from online activists who demanded that the party modernize its message and appeal to voters in all 50 states; now conservative blogs like The Next Right and The New Majority are making the exact same argument daily. Wealthy Democrats got behind a policy group called the Center for American Progress because, they said, the left had no intellectual or rapid response ''infrastructure'' to compete with the likes of Heritage and Cato. It's almost comical, then, to hear senior Republicans complain now that none of their policy groups have the capacity to compete with a liberal behemoth like the Center for American Progress. 
 The conversation dominating Republican politics is how to rebuild. There are no neatly distinct schools of thought in this inchoate debate. In an important sense, though, the argument in Republican circles is the same one that preoccupied Democrats in 2005 -- that is, whether the party's priority should be to retrench ideologically or whether it is more important to fan out in search of a broader message and audience. These aren't really mutually exclusive schools of thought -- most influential Republicans will tell you they need to do both -- but which approach you emphasize says a lot about what kind of Republican Party you would like to emerge from the ruins of Bushism.
 The retrenchers see the Bush era principally as a cautionary tale in forgetting where you came from. In their view, Bush and the Republican Congress proved to be about as grounded in conservative principle, fiscally and internationally, as Jimmy Carter and Tip O'Neill -- spending the nation into debt with patronage projects, going soft on immigration, passing a massive entitlement program for prescription drugs, piling up indictments and mismanaging the military. Republicans lost the public not because their ideology became less relevant or less credible, the retrenchers argue, but because it was twisted in the morass of governing. The only way back, then, is for the party to rededicate itself either to fiscal conservatism or social conservatism or some combination of the two, which means, first and foremost, exposing Obama and Democrats on the Hill for the elitist liberals they really are.
 As a broad generalization, most of those talking the loudest about retrenchment and confrontation are in the activist wing of the party; they're the death-before-taxes conservatives or the picket-abortion-clinics conservatives or the online conservatives who incline, like their liberal counterparts, toward ideological purity. I got a sense of what this kind of combative approach might sound like when I called Grover Norquist, the anti-tax zealot who convenes a weekly meeting of influential Republican operatives. Norquist was fuming that Obama, who had pledged not to raise taxes on anyone but the wealthy, had just signed a children's health care bill that included a tax on cigarettes. 
 ''He's a liar,'' Norquist said of the president. ''He knew he was lying the whole time. Shame on him. He can no longer look us in the eye and say he won the election fair and square.'' This seemed a little strong to me -- it wasn't as if Obama had just dumped nine million stolen votes out of a suitcase onto his desk -- but Norquist was getting himself worked up now. ''Rich people like him can afford an extra 61 cents,'' he went on. ''Poor people can't. And he does not care.'' 
 For those Republicans you might call broadeners, on the other hand, rants against the new president are a losing proposition. More reform-minded than ideological, they look at the Bush debacle as the predictable failure of insular and extremist politics -- a retreat from the ''compassionate conservatism'' that Bush once promised. Conservatism, in their view, does not mean catering to a dwindling base of white and older voters, big business and evangelicals, while younger voters, women, urbanites and minorities recoil from the Republican brand. Much of the energy here is coming from the governors, who as a rule are forced by political reality to take a less divisive approach to governing. Several of them -- including two of McCain's strongest backers last fall, Arnold Schwarzenegger of California and Charlie Crist of Florida -- went as far as to publicly get behind Obama's stimulus, which they badly needed to plug gaping holes in their budgets.
 This intramural disagreement raises basic questions for Republicans about what kind of party they actually want to be in the 21st century. Is the Republican future going to continue to rely on country-club denizens and the rural bloc, or should it aim more for working-class Catholics or recent immigrants? Can a party trying to expand its coalition afford to make fundamentalist religious values a core tenet of its ideology? Or to assault the very idea of government? In many ways, as the most-blogged-about politician since the election, Sarah Palin has become a kaleidoscope through which to view these questions. For many Republicans, the Alaska governor and hockey mom is the new and galvanizing face of conservative America; to others, Palin personifies everything that's wrong with the party, an approach short on intellect and long on cultural resentment.
 Gingrich seems to have decided not to choose sides in this debate. On one hand, he holds himself up as the heir to the more progressive, reformist tradition in of his party, an intellectual provocateur in the model of early progressives like Teddy Roosevelt, Robert La Follette and Hiram Johnson. Twice during our conversations, Gingrich referred me to the chapter in Theodore White's ''Making of the President, 1960'' in which White describes how Roosevelt led the progressives out of the Republican Party, leaving behind a more reactionary, isolationist wing that would dominate the party for most of the next 50 years. To Gingrich, this is the same tension that exists today, and he describes it as a continuing struggle between ideas and ignorance, between one group that always wants to modernize the party and another that's nostalgic for the past. 
 And yet, at the same time, Gingrich pointedly declines to do what Roosevelt and La Follette did, which is to directly confront the Republican orthodoxies of their day. Those reformers demanded their fellow Republicans make a choice between ideas and ignorance. By contrast, Gingrich doesn't really challenge any core ideological precept of the Bush era -- only the strategy of ''base mobilization'' that underlay it. Nor do the last several months of economic calamity seem to have ignited in him any of the populist fervor that energized an earlier generation of progressives. His main remedy for the financial crisis has been to repeal the Sarbanes-Oxley law that Congress passed to step up regulation after the Enron scandal; Gingrich claims such accounting rules as ''mark to market'' are needlessly crippling banks and small businesses. In other words, his prescription for the runaway financial industry is to regulate it less -- a position that hardly sounds like a departure from Bush, let alone progressive or insurrectionary.
 At a moment when the role of religious fundamentalism in the party is a central question for reformers, Gingrich, rather than making any kind of case for a new enlightenment, has in fact gone to great lengths to placate Christian conservatives. The family-values crowd has never completely embraced Newt, probably because he has been married three times, most recently to a former Hill staff member, Callista Bisek. In 2006, though, Gingrich wrote a book called ''Rediscovering God in America'' -- part of a new canon of work he has done reaffirming the role of religion in public life. The following year, he went on radio with the evangelical minister James Dobson to apologize for having been unfaithful to his second wife. (A Baptist since graduate school, Gingrich said he will soon convert to Catholicism, his wife's faith.) 
 Gingrich's defining strength as a speechifier is his ability to read a crowd. He's not a gifted orator like Obama nor especially magnetic like Clinton, but admirers marvel at his capacity to gauge what works and integrate it into his standard routine. In a sense, this is what Gingrich did in the '90s. He saw early on how the culture of scandal was changing politics, and he managed to take down Jim Wright, the reigning Democratic speaker, over a book deal. He heard the public's frustration with the culture of Congress, internalized it and converted it into a 10-point contract and the undoing of the political order. Similarly, the tripartisan Newt is a Republican prototype engineered to succeed in the pragmatic age of Obama.
 ''Newt is very good at popularizing conservative approaches in ways that seem appealing to people,'' John Podesta, President Clinton's last chief of staff and now president of the Center for American Progress, suggested when we talked. ''In a party that's desperate and out of ideas and carries the burden of being identified with Bush, Newt will figure out how to escape that trap by making it seem like he had nothing to do with all that and that he has ideas that are salient to today's political climate.
 ''In fact, I think Bush pursued the macroeconomic policies that Newt pursued in the 1990s,'' Podesta told me. ''Newt's a legitimate reformer, but I don't really think he's in the progressive tradition.''
 IN 1962, TWO YEARS PAST A NARROW presidential defeat, Richard Nixon got walloped in a race for California governor, went downstairs to the ballroom at the Beverly Hilton and put his career out of its misery. (''You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore.'') Nixon then faded into the background and watched from a distance while Barry Goldwater borrowed the keys to the party and crashed it headlong into a wall, leaving twisted wreckage and no one with the stature to fix it. Suddenly Republicans found themselves in need of a serious mind, even one with serious flaws. By 1969, Nixon, who fulfilled no one's concept of glamorous, was unpacking boxes in the Oval Office.
 Newt Gingrich had to wait a little longer for his rehabilitation, but there are parallels between Nixon's journey and his. It may seem inconceivable to those outside the party, the idea of this aging, white-haired holdover from the '90s going up against the incumbent Obama in 2012. And yet, in Republican Washington, the idea is taken quite seriously. ''If you were going to make a list of 10 potential Republican nominees, Newt would be on any list,'' Norquist told me. ''He's probably in most people's Top 5.'' Twice during the course of reporting this article, I sat down in Washington restaurants only to hear the people next to me speculating about Gingrich's prospective 2012 campaign.
 Gingrich exhibited obvious but short-lived interest in a 2008 presidential run, at one point musing that he might run if his supporters could raise $30 million. During a conversation in the back of a Cadillac Escalade in the first week of February, on his way to a speech, Gingrich told me he would have to make a decision about the next election by the early weeks of 2011. He and his wife just finished making a documentary about Reagan, and he said he had been thinking about how Reagan had found his way to the presidency only after he had focused most of his energy on shaping a political movement. 
 Gingrich said he was focused on building his own movement, his party of the American people. ''Now, if in that process I end up helping to shape the ideas and the language and the solutions that for a long period of time define the choices in America, then I've succeeded,'' he said. ''If in that process personal ambition leads to the presidency, that's fine, but it's a secondary achievement, I think.''
 I said I doubted anyone could be elected president if he actually felt that way. 
 ''I think I'm closer to Benjamin Franklin than to George Washington,'' Gingrich told me. ''I'm a contributor to my country and to my times. If it turns out that there's a moment when it makes sense to run, then I'll run. But if I end up never being able to run, then it won't devastate me.''
 Politicians say things like this all the time, albeit without the grand historical references; rarely do they mean it. But I had the sense Gingrich actually might. He never craved retail politics the way his nemesis, Bill Clinton, did. (Such is the oddity of the speaker's job that a person can gain national power and never be elected by voters outside a single district in Georgia.) For Gingrich, it's about the theories and the strategy and the ideas, and for a decade, nobody wanted to hear them. Now Bush is gone, Tom DeLay is staving off jail time, John McCain is playing out the string in the Senate and the leaders of a doleful party look to their last great thinker for some inspiration. For Gingrich, that might well be enough. 
 ''If you'd gone around to the establishment and asked about me in 1999 or 2000, they would have used the word 'was,' '' Gingrich said. ''And now I think they'd use the word 'is.' And, you know, in a decade, that's. . . . '' His voice trailed off, and he glanced down again at the sheaf of papers in his lap. I knew what he was thinking, something about departure and return. 

CORRECTION-DATE: April 19, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A brief article in The Caucus column last Wednesday about Newt Gingrich's conversion to Catholicism referred incorrectly to James Dobson, who had interviewed Mr. Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, on his radio program. Dr. Dobson, the founder of Focus on the Family, is an evangelical Christian leader who has a doctorate in child development; he is not a minister. The error also appeared in an article in The Times Magazine on March 1 about Mr. Gingrich.

HEADLINE: OBAMA'S BACKING INCREASES HOPES FOR CLIMATE PACT

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Andrew C. Revkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Until recently, the idea that the world's most powerful nations might come together to tackle global warming seemed an environmentalist's pipe dream.
 The Kyoto Protocol, signed in 1997, was widely viewed as badly flawed. Many countries that signed the accord lagged far behind their targets in curbing carbon dioxide emissions. The United States refused even to ratify it. And the treaty gave a pass to major emitters in the developing world like China and India.
 But within weeks of taking office, President Obama has radically shifted the global equation, placing the United States at the forefront of the international climate effort and raising hopes that an effective international accord might be possible. Mr. Obama's chief climate negotiator, Todd Stern, said last week that the United States would be involved in the negotiation of a new treaty -- to be signed in Copenhagen in December -- ''in a robust way.''
 That treaty, officials and climate experts involved in the negotiations say, will significantly differ from the agreement of a decade ago, reaching beyond reducing greenhouse gas emissions and including financial mechanisms and making good on longstanding promises to provide money and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with climate change. 
 The perception that the United States is now serious has set off a flurry of diplomacy around the globe. ''The lesson of Kyoto is that if the U.S. isn't taking it seriously there is no reason for anyone else to,'' said Bill McKibben, who runs the environmental organization www.350.org. 
 This week the United Nation's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, will make the rounds in Washington to discuss climate issues. The United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, is organizing a high-level meeting on climate and energy. Teams from Britain and Denmark have visited the White House to discuss climate issues. In China, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton made climate a central focus of her visit and proposed a partnership between the United States and China. And a special envoy from China is coming soon.
 But a global treaty still faces serious challenges in Washington and abroad, and the negotiations will be a test of how far the United States and other nations are prepared to go to address climate change at a moment when economies around the world are unspooling. The global recession itself is expected to result in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as manufacturing and other polluting industries shrink, lessening the pressure on countries to take action. 
 ''The No. 1 thing will be for everyone to see that the U.S. is on an urgent and transformational path to a low carbon economy -- that would have a galvanizing effect,'' said John Ashton, the British foreign secretary's special representative for climate change.
 The Obama administration has said that it will push through federal legislation this year to curb carbon dioxide emissions in the United States -- a promise that Mr. Obama reiterated Tuesday in his speech to Congress.
 The Kyoto Protocol has been a touchstone of the environmental movement. Thirty-seven developed countries, including Japan, Australia and nations in the European Union, ratified the accord, agreeing to reduce or limit the growth of carbon dioxide emissions by specified amounts. President George W. Bush, pressed by the Senate, rejected the accord, because countries like China were not also subject to mandatory emission levels. China and India also refused to ratify the protocol.
 At the tail end of his administration, Mr. Bush made tentative overtures toward China and other countries on climate matters. In 2007, he convened a meeting of countries that were major emitters of greenhouse gases. Later, in bilateral economic talks, China and the United States agreed that they would cooperate on clean technology development and some other climate issues.
 But Kyoto was shaped largely by climate scientists and environment ministers, not the higher-level officials now laying the groundwork. And even many who participated in the earlier accord now say they see it as weak and naive about political and economic realities. Of the countries that signed, more than half are not on track to meet their targets according to 2008 United Nations data, including Germany, Ireland and Canada.
 ''In Kyoto we made a lot of promises to each other, but we hadn't done the domestic politics,'' Mr. Ashton said, ''and that is why Kyoto -- though a valuable step forward -- has ultimately been so fragile.''
 The talks on the new treaty, said Rajendra K. Pachauri, chairman of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ''provides an opportunity to fill this gap that we've seen, and this time perform up to expectations.'' 
 The 1997 protocol was a narrow accord about the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gasses linked to global warming. The new agreement will need to address how those reductions can be achieved in a way that takes account of their effects on energy supplies and economies -- especially at a time of global recession. 
 Negotiating the treaty when countries are under extreme economic stress presents challenges, Mr. de Boer acknowledged. Politicians in Italy and Canada have complained that it will be difficult to clean up industries to meet their Kyoto goals because of the economic downturn. But others say a global industrial recession, in which emissions tend to drop anyway and countries are poised to spend billions to stimulate economies, is the time to craft a global effort to combat global warming. 
 With developing countries like China and India emerging as major carbon dioxide emitters in the past few years, experts said that if the new treaty was to be effective, every nation would have to accept emissions limits. ''If one part of the world acts and the other does not, that doesn't really generate a climate benefit,'' said Mr. de Boer, who is responsible for organizing the December meetings.
 Developed countries would most likely get binding numerical targets, as some did in Kyoto. Developing countries, which were exempt under Kyoto, would probably be given less stringent goals, though it is not clear if these will be longer-term numerical targets or some other mechanism that ties allowable emissions to economic growth. 
 Mr. Obama has said the United States will lead the effort, but over the next months, he will have to show what exactly that means. A good first step, environmentalists say, would be to commit to trying to limit warming to two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial temperatures, an ambitious goal that the European Union has adopted but that the Bush administration steadfastly avoided. It could also pledge to reduce emissions by 50 or 80 percent by 2050.
 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that humans could largely adapt to two degrees of warming, but that a greater temperature increase could cause far more serious consequences, from a dangerous rise in sea levels to mass extinctions.
 Climate experts added that the United States did not need to have in place national legislation to limit greenhouse gasses, a process that could take months, to negotiate in Copenhagen. ''It's not just about analyzing a piece of legislation,'' Mr. Ashton said. ''It's about the feeling you get if you're a leader sitting in Beijing. It's like love; you know it when you feel it.''
 A more complex issue is whether negotiators will retain the system of trading carbon credits that is central to the Kyoto Protocol, a kind of global commodities market for carbon.
 That system allows developed countries that produce more than their allotted share of emissions to balance their emissions budget by investing in projects that curtail emissions elsewhere. Such projects might include the cleaning up of a coal power plant in China, planting trees in Africa or converting pig manure to electricity in the Netherlands. The same cap and trade concept is now used in Europe's emissions. 
 But as the European Union and the countries that signed the Kyoto Protocol have tried such projects over the past few years, problems have emerged. Most notably, it is hard to determine the emissions-reducing value of carbon credit projects, making it easy to game the system. The new treaty, experts say, will also have to broaden Kyoto's focus beyond industrial emissions to activities like airline travel, one of the fastest-growing sources of carbon emissions. In the end, it will also have to include financial mechanisms and technical assistance to help developing countries cope with climate change. 
 ''This is not just about emissions but about creating a massive investment in a new global energy economy'' that includes forests, oceans and the transfer of technology, said Angela Anderson, director of the Pew Environment Group's Global Warming Campaign.
 American negotiators were limited in Kyoto by a Senate resolution saying that the United States would not accept numerical caps unless China did as well. But Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said, ''There has been a sea change in the Senate,'' and he added that he believed that there were enough votes -- Democratic and Republican -- to ratify a strong treaty.
 What is unclear is whether politicians will be willing to commit to large enough changes to have a significant effect on global warming. ''The Bush administration set the bar very low,'' Mr. McKibben said.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on March 1 about the new impetus given a global climate treaty by the Obama administration referred incorrectly to the status of China and India under the 1997 Kyoto protocol. Both countries have ratified the protocol, but as developing countries they are not bound by its limits on greenhouse gas emissions. 

GRAPHIC: CHART: Meeting the Kyoto Challenge: Some Do, Others Don't: The Kyoto Protocol aims to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels to at least 5 percent below 1990 levels.

HEADLINE: Americans Flock to the Movies, Seeking a Silver-Screen Lining

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Hollywood could get used to this recession thing.
 While much of the economy is teetering between bust and bailout, the movie industry has been startled by a box-office surge that has little precedent in the modern era. Suddenly it seems as if everyone is going to the movies, with ticket sales this year up 17.5 percent, to $1.7 billion, according to Media by Numbers, a box-office tracking company.
 And it is not just because ticket prices are higher. Attendance has also jumped, by nearly 16 percent. If that pace continues through the year, it would amount to the biggest box-office surge in at least two decades. 
 Americans, for the moment, just want to hide in a very dark place, said Martin Kaplan, the director of the Norman Lear Center for the study of entertainment and society at the University of Southern California. 
 ''It's not rocket science,'' he said. ''People want to forget their troubles, and they want to be with other people.''
 Helping feed the surge is the mix of movies, which have been more audience-friendly in recent months as the studios have tried to adjust after the lackluster sales of more somber and serious films. 
 As she stood in line at the 18-screen Bridge theater complex here on Thursday to buy weekend tickets for ''Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,'' Angel Hernandez was not thinking much about escaping reality. Instead, Ms. Hernandez, a Los Angeles parking lot attendant and mother of four young girls, was focused on one very specific reality: her wallet. 
 Even with the movie carrying a premium price of $15 because of its 3-D effects -- children's tickets typically run $9 at the Bridge -- Ms. Hernandez saw the experience as a bargain.
 ''Spending hundreds of dollars to take them to Disneyland is ridiculous right now,'' she said. ''For $60 and some candy money I can still be a good mom and give them a little fun.''
 A lot of parents may have been thinking the same thing Friday, as ''Jonas Brothers'' sold out more than 800 theaters, according to MovieTickets.com, and was expected to sell a powerful $25 million or more in tickets. 
 Other movies kept up their blistering sales pace, too, including ''Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail,'' about a gun-toting grandma. Even ''Taken,'' a relatively low-cost thriller starring Liam Neeson, is barreling past the $100 million mark this weekend.
 Historically speaking, the old saw that movies do well in hard times is not precisely true. The last time Hollywood enjoyed a double-digit jump in attendance was 1989, when the unemployment rate was at a comfortable 5.4 percent and the Gothic tone of that year's big hit, ''Batman,'' seemed mostly the stuff of fantasy. That year, the number of moviegoers shot up 16.4 percent, according to Box Office Mojo, a box-office reporting service.
 In 1982, theater attendance jumped 10.1 percent to about 1.18 billion (the top seller was ''E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial'') as unemployment rose sharply past 10 percent. Then admissions fell nearly 12 percent, an unusually sharp drop, in 1985 (the ''Back to the Future'' year), as the economy picked up -- suggesting that theater owners have sometimes found fortunes in times of distress, and distress in good times.
 Academic research on the matter is scant. One often-quoted scholarly study by Michelle Pautz, of Elon University, was published by the journal Issues in Political Economy in 2002. Over all, it said, the portion of the American population that attended movies on a weekly basis dropped from around 65 percent in 1930 to about 10 percent in the 1960s, and pretty much stayed there.
 The film industry appears to have had a hand in its recent good luck. Over the last year or two, studios have released movies that are happier, scarier or just less depressing than what came before. After poor results for a spate of serious dramas built around the Middle East (''The Kingdom,'' ''Lions for Lambs,'' ''Rendition''), Hollywood got back to comedies like ''Paul Blart: Mall Cop,'' a review-proof lark about an overstuffed security guard.
 ''A bunch of movies have come along that don't make you think too much,'' said Marc Abraham, a producer whose next film is a remake of ''The Thing.''
 Certainly exhibitors are looking for a profit lift in the downturn. A new report from Global Media Intelligence on Friday predicted that the fortunes of movie theater operators like Regal Entertainment and Cinemark Holdings would be ''increasingly favorable against a backdrop of highly negative economic news.''
 Cinematic quality has little to do with it. The recent crop of Oscar nominees has fared poorly, for the most part, at the box office. Lighter fare has drawn the crowds.
 ''It would take a very generous person to call these pictures anything other than middle-of-the-road, at best,'' said Roger Smith, the executive editor of Global Media Intelligence.
 The box-office surge started just before Christmas with the comedy ''Marley & Me,'' in which Jennifer Aniston was upstaged by a dog. And it has continued, weekend by weekend, with little sign of let-up, analysts say.
 ''Watchmen,'' a dark superhero film, opens March 6 and is expected to do megawatt business. It is to be followed by ''Monsters vs. Aliens,'' a 3-D behemoth from DreamWorks Animation that analysts expect to have the biggest March opening ever for a nonsequel. 
 Movie theaters are already adding 3 a.m. screenings for ''Watchmen'' next week, and advance sales by online ticket companies like Fandango and MovieTickets.com have been strong.
 ''Fandango is experiencing the best first quarter in its history for ticket sales,'' said Rick Butler, its chief operating officer. ''I see no signs of a drop-off.''

HEADLINE: In Letter, Buffett Accepts Blame and Faults Others

BYLINE: By DAVID SEGAL

 BODY:
The renowned investor Warren E. Buffett chided himself and the business world at large in his annual letter to shareholders of his holding company on Saturday as he sifted through the wreckage of his worst year in four decades.
 Mr. Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, reported a 62 percent drop in net income for 2008 and posted a decline in book value per share for only the second time since he took control in 1965. Shares of the company, which peaked in late 2007 at more than $148,000 apiece, closed Friday at $78,600.
 With characteristic candor, Mr. Buffett, 78, took the blame for some of the declines, stating that he ''did some dumb things,'' lamenting in particular an ill-timed bet on oil and the purchase of shares in two Irish banks, which have fared poorly. But he also needled regulators and an assortment of unnamed chief executives as he predicted that fallout from the credit crisis would leave the stock market a shambles through 2009. 
 The letter, as ever, gives shareholders an overview of Berkshire's annual performance, but it also doubles as a folksy state-of-the-economy address from Mr. Buffett, one of the country's most revered investors.
 In language that was by turns blunt and witty, he decried what he called ''a series of life-threatening problems within many of the world's great financial institutions.'' An inveterate optimist about the American economy, Mr. Buffett also forecast an eventual recovery, asserting that the country has faced even more severe economic travails in the past. 
 ''Without fail,'' he noted, ''we've overcome them.''
 Despite its record losses, Berkshire Hathaway still has about $25 billion of cash on hand and has been buying preferred shares of General Electric and Goldman Sachs, as well as the debt of companies like Harley-Davidson and Tiffany & Company. Mr. Buffett is shopping for bargains while the share prices of most companies are sliding -- his own portfolio included. 
 Shares of many of his top 20 holdings suffered losses last year, among them Coca-Cola, American Express and ConocoPhillips.
 Since the beginning of the recession, Mr. Buffett has taken on a part-time and unofficial role as the United States economy's eminence grise. He also served on President Obama's transition team. In his letter, though, he lambasted the decisions and habits that led to the credit crisis. 
 In reviewing the performance of Clayton Homes, a Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary that sells manufactured homes, he pointed out that its lending arm had managed to keep foreclosure rates to less than 4 percent, even among subprime borrowers, or those with weak credit ratings.
 He contrasted that relative success with the failures of just about everyone else in the same business.
 ''The stupefying losses in mortgage-related securities came in large part because of flawed, history-based models used by salesmen, rating agencies and investors,'' he wrote.
 He went on: ''These parties looked at loss experience over periods when home prices rose only moderately and speculation in houses was negligible. They then made this experience a yardstick for evaluating future losses. They blissfully ignored the fact that house prices had recently skyrocketed, loan practices had deteriorated and many buyers had opted for houses they couldn't afford.''
 Also blissfully ignored, he wrote, were the perils of relying on mathematical models devised without worst-case situations in mind. Too often, he wrote, Americans have been enamored of ''a nerdy-sounding priesthood, using esoteric terms such as beta, gamma, sigma and the like.'' 
 Some skepticism about these models is overdue, he added. ''Our advice: Beware of geeks bearing formulas.''
 Mr. Buffett was just as scathing on the subject of derivatives, which he had likened to weapons of mass destruction long before they started eviscerating the balance sheets of banks around the world.
 In his letter, Mr. Buffett explained that the danger of derivatives was not merely the difficulty in assessing their value; rather, it was the ''web of mutual dependence'' they create among financial institutions. Derivatives contracts keep various parties entangled for years, which, as he vividly explained, can create real hazards once those assets start deteriorating. 
 ''Participants seeking to dodge troubles face the same problem as someone seeking to avoid venereal disease,'' he wrote. ''It's not just whom you sleep with, but also whom they are sleeping with.''
 Mr. Buffett's report was greeted with sighs of relief among some shareholders. ''I'm delighted,'' said Janet Tavakoli, a derivatives expert and author of ''Dear Mr. Buffett,'' about the credit crisis of 2008. 
 ''Of course it was a tough year -- the toughest year of his life. But I was concerned about the impact in operating earnings and I was prepared for much worse.''

HEADLINE: Straight to Fans Over Twitter

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Paparazzi, eat your hearts out: Celebrities are now taking their own candid photos of themselves and putting them on the Web.
While watching the Academy Awards on TV Feb. 22, Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore, above, sent text updates to fans via Twitter. At an Oscar 
party afterward, they also uploaded several grainy photographs, including a blurred image of producer Sean Combs along with the note ''Diddy throws up oscars'' and one of Mr. Kutcher himself clutching an Oscar, accompanied by the text ''Me and penelopes oscar.''
In addition to being a staple for rapid-fire communication among technophiles and a networking tool for tech-savvy companies, Twitter is swiftly being adopted by celebrities who see it as a way to give the public a controlled peephole into their otherwise highly private lives.
For example, in early February, the soul singer Erykah Badu and her partner, Jay Electronica, sent moment by moment updates detailing the birth of their daughter. Last weekend, Shaquille O'Neal clued his Twitter fans to his whereabouts in Arizona. Shortly after, several of them joined the basketball star for a meal at a Phoenix diner, documenting the entire gathering on Twitter and Flickr.
Some industry experts, like Josh Bernoff, an analyst at Forrester Research and a co-author of ''Groundswell: Winning in a World Transformed by Social Technologies,'' think Twitter appeals to celebrities because it offers a relatively low-maintenance way to keep audiences engaged between film debuts and album releases.
Where the infiltration of celebrities on a platform like Twitter gets interesting, he said, is what happens when celebrities sidestep their publicists and begin communicating directly with fans. ''Are we going to find out that Angelina Jolie isn't a good writer?'' Mr. Bernoff mused. JENNA WORTHAM

HEADLINE: Revenge Of The Glut

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Remember the good old days, when we used to talk about the ''subprime crisis'' -- and some even thought that this crisis could be ''contained''? Oh, the nostalgia!
Today we know that subprime lending was only a small fraction of the problem. Even bad home loans in general were only part of what went wrong. We're living in a world of troubled borrowers, ranging from shopping mall developers to European ''miracle'' economies. And new kinds of debt trouble just keep emerging.
How did this global debt crisis happen? Why is it so widespread? The answer, I'd suggest, can be found in a speech Ben Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, gave four years ago. At the time, Mr. Bernanke was trying to be reassuring. But what he said then nonetheless foreshadowed the bust to come. 
The speech, titled ''The Global Saving Glut and the U.S. Current Account Deficit,'' offered a novel explanation for the rapid rise of the U.S. trade deficit in the early 21st century. The causes, argued Mr. Bernanke, lay not in America but in Asia.
In the mid-1990s, he pointed out, the emerging economies of Asia had been major importers of capital, borrowing abroad to finance their development. But after the Asian financial crisis of 1997-98 (which seemed like a big deal at the time but looks trivial compared with what's happening now), these countries began protecting themselves by amassing huge war chests of foreign assets, in effect exporting capital to the rest of the world.
The result was a world awash in cheap money, looking for somewhere to go.
Most of that money went to the United States -- hence our giant trade deficit, because a trade deficit is the flip side of capital inflows. But as Mr. Bernanke correctly pointed out, money surged into other nations as well. In particular, a number of smaller European economies experienced capital inflows that, while much smaller in dollar terms than the flows into the United States, were much larger compared with the size of their economies.
Still, much of the global saving glut did end up in America. Why?
Mr. Bernanke cited ''the depth and sophistication of the country's financial markets (which, among other things, have allowed households easy access to housing wealth).'' Depth, yes. But sophistication? Well, you could say that American bankers, empowered by a quarter-century of deregulatory zeal, led the world in finding sophisticated ways to enrich themselves by hiding risk and fooling investors.
And wide-open, loosely regulated financial systems characterized many of the other recipients of large capital inflows. This may explain the almost eerie correlation between conservative praise two or three years ago and economic disaster today. ''Reforms have made Iceland a Nordic tiger,'' declared a paper from the Cato Institute. ''How Ireland Became the Celtic Tiger'' was the title of one Heritage Foundation article; ''The Estonian Economic Miracle'' was the title of another. All three nations are in deep crisis now.
For a while, the inrush of capital created the illusion of wealth in these countries, just as it did for American homeowners: asset prices were rising, currencies were strong, and everything looked fine. But bubbles always burst sooner or later, and yesterday's miracle economies have become today's basket cases, nations whose assets have evaporated but whose debts remain all too real. And these debts are an especially heavy burden because most of the loans were denominated in other countries' currencies.
Nor is the damage confined to the original borrowers. In America, the housing bubble mainly took place along the coasts, but when the bubble burst, demand for manufactured goods, especially cars, collapsed -- and that has taken a terrible toll on the industrial heartland. Similarly, Europe's bubbles were mainly around the continent's periphery, yet industrial production in Germany -- which never had a financial bubble but is Europe's manufacturing core -- is falling rapidly, thanks to a plunge in exports.
If you want to know where the global crisis came from, then, think of it this way: we're looking at the revenge of the glut.
And the saving glut is still out there. In fact, it's bigger than ever, now that suddenly impoverished consumers have rediscovered the virtues of thrift and the worldwide property boom, which provided an outlet for all those excess savings, has turned into a worldwide bust.
One way to look at the international situation right now is that we're suffering from a global paradox of thrift: around the world, desired saving exceeds the amount businesses are willing to invest. And the result is a global slump that leaves everyone worse off.
So that's how we got into this mess. And we're still looking for the way out.

HEADLINE: Maker of Chips Files for Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Spansion, a maker of flash-memory chips, sought bankruptcy protection on Sunday, becoming the latest chip maker to succumb to falling prices in the memory chip market and a deepening recession. 
 Spansion, which recently said it was exploring a sale of the company, said it planned to use the bankruptcy process to restructure its debt and refocus on its more profitable divisions.
 The company is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. Spansion and four American affiliates filed for protection in federal bankruptcy court in Delaware on Sunday, listing assets of $3.84 billion and debts of almost $2.4 billion.
 Spansion said it planned to refocus on its embedded flash-memory products, intellectual property solutions and parts of the wireless segment.
 Before the bankruptcy filing, Spansion said it had consulted with a group of creditors holding $625 million senior secured floating rate notes due in 2013, and was in talks on a reorganization plan with the consortium that would enable it to emerge more quickly from court protection.
 Flash-memory chips are most commonly used in portable music players and digital cameras, whose sales are slipping as consumers cut back on spending.
 Spansion shares have lost more than 98 percent of their value over the last year as the tech sector's problems deepened, closing on Friday at just 5 cents.

HEADLINE: Well-Regarded Public Colleges Get a Surge of Bargain Hunters

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

DATELINE: NEW PALTZ, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Admissions officers at the State University of New York college campus here are suddenly afraid of getting what they have always wished for: legions of top high-school seniors saying ''yes'' to their fat envelopes.
 Students are already tripled up in many dorm rooms after an unexpectedly large freshman class entered last fall. And despite looming budget cuts from the state, which more tuition-paying students could help offset, officials say they are determined not to diminish the quality of student life by expanding enrollment at their liberal-arts college beyond the current 6,000 undergraduates.
 At SUNY New Paltz, as at many other well-regarded public institutions this spring, admissions calculations carefully measured over many years are being set aside as an unraveling economy is making less expensive state colleges more appealing.
 The application deadline is not until April 1, but officials here conservatively predict 15,500 students competing for 1,100 spots, a 12 percent jump over last year. 
 Similar surges are occurring at public colleges and universities across the country, education experts say. 
 The Connecticut State University System is projecting an 11 percent rise across its four campuses -- the largest one-year increase ever -- with Central Connecticut State up 16 percent by January. At Oregon State University, freshman applications are up 12 percent, and transfer applications more than 31 percent. At the University of Cincinnati, applications are still pouring in, but by early February they were outpacing last year's pool by 10 percent.
 ''The country is in the process of reconsidering the easy accumulation of debt for consumer things, and it may well be that that will be a factor that tilts people toward public institutions because of the cheaper sticker price,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization.
 A poll by the center in December showed that ''people's anxiety about paying for college is almost at an unprecedented high,'' Mr. Callan said.
 ''We're not sure how they will respond, but we're pretty sure they won't respond by deciding not to go,'' he added. ''Middle class families understand that you're going to be consigned to the minimum-wage economy if you don't get some higher education or training.''
 Private colleges, which are more expensive than public institutions, are facing a different problem: worried about losing students, they are trying to find ways to increase financial aid.
 In the SUNY system, the biggest growth is at its eight four-year technology colleges, whose vocational degrees are in demand because of their practicality; they have seen 11 percent more applicants than last year. 
 Tucked next to the snow-carpeted Shawangunk Mountains about 75 miles north of New York City, SUNY New Paltz has become steadily more popular -- and more selective -- over the past decade, with the grade-point average of entering students climbing to 92 from 85 and their SAT scores to 1,160 from 1,100. Named the ''hottest small state school'' in the country by Newsweek magazine and the Kaplan testing company last year, it has a total price tag of $16,000 a year, making it increasingly attractive to middle-class families running for cover in a battered economy.
 Given last year's surprise of 24 percent of accepted students actually enrolling -- a big increase from the 20 or 21 percent in previous years -- the college plans to send 4,500 acceptance letters this year, 1,000 fewer than usual, and keep a longer waiting list.
 ''We have to be very careful moving forward with the size of this freshman class,'' said L. David Eaton, the college's vice president for enrollment management. ''Admissions people have all kinds of formulas they use for predictions: How many historically do we expect to accept our offer and enroll? The prevailing attitude is that all that is up for grabs.''
 But the flood of applications -- made greater by a demographic bubble as the offspring of baby boomers reach college age -- comes as SUNY is facing a $210 million cut in its $1.4 billion annual state appropriation for four-year schools, with New Paltz, whose state share is $63 million, expecting to lose up to $9 million next year.
 ''That's the conundrum,'' said Megan Galbraith, a spokeswoman for SUNY, the nation's largest public university system under a single governing board, with 438,000 students on 64 campuses statewide. ''There's increased demand for what SUNY has to offer in this economy. But with this budget, there will be challenges meeting that demand. Our campuses are increasing class sizes. Services may be diminished. Even in residence halls, you might see more tripling up. It's that type of ripple effect in the quality of the student experience.''
 Over the last decade, enrollment in the SUNY system has grown by 20 percent. But officials at New Paltz do not want to grow, and instead see the swelling applicant pool as a way to further refine its status and student body. In the last five years, the college has winnowed the student-to-faculty ratio to 14 to 1, from 17 to 1; more than two-thirds of courses are taught by full-time faculty members today, compared with 50 percent a decade ago.
 ''I'm not just a number,'' said Alexis Schild, a history major from Staten Island. ''The professors really care about you. They remember your name.''
 Steven G. Poskanzer, president of SUNY New Paltz, wants to keep the momentum going, with plans for a $48 million science building and new residence halls. But he said layoffs were possible.
 ''Eighty-four percent of our budget is people, so when you get cuts of this magnitude, it's difficult to imagine that we end up with the same size work force,'' he said. ''We're going to have to make some very hard choices. But it's better to do fewer things and do them well than to take many things and water them down.''
 Last year's unexpected yield of students who decided to enroll resulted in a freshman class of 1,300, or ''200 over target,'' said Mr. Eaton. (New Paltz also accepts about 800 transfer students each year.) 
 College officials scrambled to make room for the extra students and drafted plans for a new dormitory, but that will not be built until the fall of 2010 at the earliest. While an enrollment spike can translate into more tuition dollars, it can also mean fewer available study carrels in the library, crowded dining halls and faculty advisors who feel stretched thin.
 So the admissions office is playing it safe. With more than 4,000 students already accepted, hundreds of qualified students who previously would have gotten fat envelopes are instead being added to a waiting list.
 ''If you exceed your targets, you can make a lot of money, but it backfires,'' Mr. Eaton said. ''If you bring in a lot of students and it diminishes their experience, then it goes back to what people say when they go home. There's a point beyond which it becomes a problem.''

HEADLINE: Software System's Fans Gather to Talk Code

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
There were people who were proud to call themselves tech geeks and a few who admitted being near-Luddites, and there was at least one person who called herself a radical technologist. They joined book publishers, librarians and computer consultants, some of whom had come from as far as Ireland and Brazil, at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University in Downtown Brooklyn on Saturday for something akin to a happening for the Internet age -- Drupal Camp. 
 Drupal is free software used to run Web sites, and participants at the event said they were drawn there, despite differences in backgrounds and ideologies, by a belief in an almost utopian form of technological cooperation. 
 ''We're throwing out the idea of software as a commodity and replacing it with the idea of labor and participation being valued more than ownership,'' Eric Goldhagen, a software consultant and developer from the East Village and a primary organizer of the event, told the gathering.
 Drupal was developed by Dries Buytaert, a Belgian programmer, and nearly 10 years ago he made the Drupal code public, giving up formal control of his creation and letting people use it without charge with the stipulation that they share modifications and improvements with one another. 
 In keeping with that decentralized spirit, after Mr. Goldhagen's introductory address the participants put the conference schedule to a vote, then scattered to take part in workshops and discussions.
 ''This is a very social event,'' said Cary Gordon, president of a software development company in Los Angeles. ''The users and the developers are one and the same and there's a certain amount of esprit de corps that goes along with that.''
 Dozens of Drupal Camps are held around the world annually, yet Mr. Goldhagen said the first was held in New York in 2006, when Drupal was a relatively obscure system, used mainly by nonprofit organizations and small businesses. 
 Many of those initial users turned to Drupal to avoid licensing fees charged by companies like Microsoft. But other users liked Drupal because they were free to change it themselves by writing new code, or because they were drawn to the sense of community formed when users began to communicate with one another about how to resolve technical snags and how to shape the software's future.
 In recent years Drupal (the name, according to its Web site, is derived from druppel, the Dutch word used to describe a drop of water) has become more popular. Large companies like Sony use it, as do organizations like Human Rights Watch and the Pulitzer Prizes. The federal Web site recovery.gov, a clearinghouse of information on the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, recently signed into law by President Obama, is run on Drupal.
 Chris Ridder, a residential fellow at the Center for the Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, said that there was an ongoing debate about the pros and cons of free and open-source software, but added that such software has recently become more widely used, in part because of its flexibility.
 As might be expected, the conference itself was free. Sponsors donated food and drinks, and instructors volunteered their time.
 So, 50 beginners gathered in Room 204, illuminated only by the glow of laptop screens and a beam from an overhead projector as one of those volunteers, Peter Dowling, 43, of Stamford, Conn., led them though the steps of installing Drupal on their computers. 
 Down the hall, in Room 200, about 20 advanced users listened to David Burns, a consultant from Philadelphia, describe ways to speed up a sluggish Web site. The audience clapped, and Mr. Burns, 27, announced that he could be found later at a nearby bar, the Zombie Hut.
 Some of the participants said that they were motivated to use Drupal mainly by a sense of pragmatism. Others cited principle. 
 The radical technologist, Mallory Knodel, 25, of the Lower East Side, writes code to help further leftist causes. She said Drupal had been helpful for her group, May First/People Link, a network that includes trade unions and political pranksters who oppose globalization.
 And Andy Thornton, 36, a programmer from Astoria, Queens, who works at the United Nations, said the egalitarian nature of Drupal was ''almost the epitome of what the Web promised at the beginning. This is very much a democracy. It doesn't have a top-down authority.''

HEADLINE: Food Aid for New Yorkers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''The Newly Needy Swell Lines at Food Banks'' (front page, Feb. 20): 
 The recession is certainly forcing people to make hard choices. And now two million New York City residents who never before considered taking food assistance are turning to programs like food stamps, food pantries or soup kitchens for the first time in their lives.
 Although the economic stimulus package has temporarily increased food stamp benefits, the real issue is how well equipped state and local governments and the nonprofit sector are in connecting people to the benefits they are entitled to as well as supporting businesses and working people in their communities.
 Without sufficient resources to do the necessary outreach and education work, we will have wasted the opportunity this stimulus provides.

HEADLINE: Ford Bucks Detroit's Trend With 3 New-Car Introductions

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
New-car introductions are becoming increasingly rare as the auto industry suffers through its worst downturn in 25 years.
 The Ford Motor Company is bucking the trend this month, however, gambling that its new Fusion hybrid sedan can interest some of the dwindling number of American consumers still interested in buying a new car. 
 Ford also hopes its Fusion hybrid will help separate the automaker in the public's mind from its crosstown rivals General Motors and Chrysler, which both need more government loans to avoid bankruptcy. Ford has so far refrained from seeking federal aid. 
 ''We are not about waiting for tomorrow and what it's going to bring,'' said James Farley, Ford's global marketing chief. ''It's about what we're doing today to bring out car after car after car.''
 The industry has cut back considerably on new-model introductions -- hardly a surprise considering the 18 percent drop in United States vehicle sales last year.
 Last year, auto makers brought out 17 new models, not including redesigns of existing vehicles, according to data from Ward's Automotive Reports.
 That was about half the annual number of new models the industry turned out just a few years before. Now, with sales plunging to levels comparable to the early 1980s, automakers are delaying or canceling product programs to conserve cash.
 The number of new models that will make a debut in 2009 will probably total fewer than 10, according to product plans revealed by the car companies.
 ''The environment is obviously not good as far as the economy and consumer confidence goes,'' said Joseph Phillippi, principal in the firm Auto Trends Consulting.
 Ford, however, is bringing out three new vehicles this year -- the Fusion, with either a hybrid or conventional engine; the new Taurus sedan and the Transit Connect van.
 Ford will introduce the Fusion Hybrid with an advertising campaign beginning Tuesday night on ''American Idol.''
 With Ford shifting its product lineup to emphasize more fuel-efficient small cars, the Fusion Hybrid is seen within the company as an important vehicle for changing perceptions in the marketplace, even though the cost of gas is below its high of nearly $4 a gallon.
 ''We're known to most people as a trucks and Mustang company,'' said Matt Van Dyke, Ford's American director of marketing communications. ''How do we begin to tell the story that we're in the car business in earnest?''
 The bigger challenge may be drawing consumers into showrooms. ''The question is what people are going to respond to,'' said Mr. Farley. ''And we think it is fuel economy.''
 Both the hybrid and conventionally powered Fusion models are ranked best in fuel economy in their respective segments, according to federal statistics.
 Ads for the hybrid promote not only that it delivers 41 miles a gallon, but that it can travel 700 miles on a single tank of gas.
 While they do not talk about it much publicly, Ford officials also think that every car introduction this year will further separate their company from the troubles enveloping G.M. and Chrysler.
 Ford is tracking how consumers perceive the company because it has not taken government money, but has declined to share that data. 
 The magazine Consumer Reports recently gave Ford's reputation a lift when it recommended more of its models to prospective buyers than vehicles from G.M. or Chrysler.
 G.M. and Chrysler have received $17.4 billion combined in bailout loans, and are asking Washington for an additional $21.6 billion.
 Analysts think the relentless coverage of their loan requests is taking a toll on G.M. and Chrysler -- and consequently helping Ford. 
 ''G.M. and Chrysler are in the media every day, and every story invariably cites the 'B' words -- bankruptcy and bailout,'' Mr. Phillippi said. ''It has to be helping Ford.''

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley's Chinese Land Scandal

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA; Xie Qing contributed research from Shanghai.

DATELINE: SHANGHAI 

 BODY:
Since the height of China's property boom, Morgan Stanley's huge real estate deals here have been the envy of the industry. Then, scandal hit. 
 Last month, with property prices here and elsewhere in free fall, the bank dropped a bombshell: in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it said it had fired an executive in its China real estate division after uncovering evidence that he might have violated the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars American business people from bribing foreign officials. 
 That executive, Garth Peterson, was a star deal maker who had become a powerful figure on the Shanghai investment scene, people knowledgeable about the investigation said. His supervisor, the head of global real estate investing, was placed on administrative leave. 
 In China, which is struggling to deal with corruption and bribery, the revelation is the latest bit of sobering news after a wild real estate boom suddenly went bust late last year, leaving some of the world's biggest financial institutions with potentially huge losses. 
 For Morgan Stanley, which runs one of the world's biggest real estate funds, it is a black mark on an otherwise sterling reputation. People knowledgeable about the case say that Morgan Stanley has sent both United States and Chinese officials documents indicating that Mr. Peterson, the bank's highest-ranking real estate executive in China, may have secured some transactions by offering cash or gifts to Chinese officials. His partners in some deals were Chinese government investment funds.
 The Shanghai Securities Daily, a government-controlled publication, said in an article on Friday that China was investigating a number of Morgan's real estate deals here. These include the company's purchase last year from Agile Property, a large developer, of a 30 percent stake in a Chinese resort development for $775 million.
 Morgan Stanley declined to comment on whether China was investigating alleged bribery by Mr. Peterson or whether the company's deal to acquire a large stake in a project developed by Agile has come under scrutiny. The bank said an internal investigation had concluded that ''questionable activity was isolated to a discrete set of real estate transactions in China.''
 Mr. Peterson, who speaks fluent Chinese, could not be reached for comment over the weekend. His telephone was turned off and Morgan Stanley declined to discuss his situation. 
 As a booming economy sent the country's real estate market soaring during the last five years, more than a dozen major banks and private equity groups rushed in, investing billions of dollars in Chinese property developers and glittering real estate projects.
 Morgan Stanley was a first mover, plowing hundreds of millions of dollars into Chinese real estate projects as early as 2004, when prices began a spectacular three-year ascent. The bank helped feed the real estate boom by helping to take Agile Property public in 2005, raising $460 million. 
 Agile Property, which is based in southern China's Guangdong Province, halted trading in its stock in Hong Kong on Friday, citing volatile trading after the report in the Shanghai Securities Daily. The company called the news report misleading and said it had never been contacted by any government.
 According to Agile's public filings in Hong Kong, from February 2007 to June 6, 2008, Agile paid about $350 million for a vast plot of land in Clearwater Bay, Hainan, where it planned to build villas and luxury hotels.
 On June 27, 2008, a Morgan Stanley affiliate acquired a 30 percent stake in that project from Agile for about $775 million, valuing the project at more than $2.5 billion.
 In a telephone interview on Friday, Zheng Qiyong, a Chinese government official in Hainan, also called the deal proper, saying that Agile was simply short of money and Morgan supplied a big boost. At the time, Agile's earnings had also slumped, and its shares had plunged about 50 percent from their high.
 Last September, Agile said it had booked a profit of about $600 million on the partial sale of the Hainan stake. The company said Friday that because of the Morgan Stanley deal last year, Agile gave shareholders a special dividend of $135 million -- about $78 million of which went to the family that founded Agile. They collectively own about 58 percent of the company's shares.
 Some analysts who cover the company declined to comment publicly on the deal but privately said they were surprised at how much Morgan Stanley had paid for its stake, shortly after Agile bought the land.
 For Morgan Stanley, which has seen the value of many of its China properties plummet in a depressed property market here, the challenge may be in selling properties associated with the investigation.
 The company has not disclosed which properties were involved. But in its statement on Friday, Morgan Stanley said, ''Based on what we know, we have no reason to believe that the value of any of the properties in any of the funds have been materially affected by the activity at issue.''

HEADLINE: U.S. SAID TO OFFER $30 Billion More To Help Insurer

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The federal government agreed Sunday night to provide an additional $30 billion in taxpayer money to the American International Group and loosen the terms of its huge loan to the insurer, which is preparing to report a $62 billion loss on Monday, the biggest quarterly loss in history, people involved in the discussions said.
 The intervention would be the fourth time that the United States has had to step in to help A.I.G., the giant insurer, avert bankruptcy. The government already owns nearly 80 percent of the insurer's holding company as a result of the earlier interventions, which included a $60 billion loan, a $40 billion purchase of preferred shares and $50 billion to soak up the company's toxic assets.
 Federal officials, who worked feverishly over the weekend to complete the restructuring, said they thought they had no choice but to prop up A.I.G., because its business and trading activities are so intricately woven through the world's banking system. 
 But the deal also presents more financial risks to taxpayers at a time when the public and Congress have been sharply questioning the wisdom of risking federal money to bail out private enterprises.
 The government's commitment to A.I.G. far eclipses its rescue of other financial companies, including Citigroup, which has received $50 billion in rescue financing, and Bank of America, with $45 billion.
 Credit rating agencies like Moody's, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's had been preparing to sharply downgrade A.I.G.'s credit ratings on Monday because of the record quarterly loss. That would have forced A.I.G. to default on its debt, threatening to set off shock waves throughout the financial system as banks holding A.I.G. derivatives contracts would probably demand cash collateral and other payments from A.I.G. during a time when it has little to spare.
 The major credit-rating agencies were briefed on the pending deal between A.I.G. and the government, the people involved in the talks said, and they have committed not to downgrade the company's debt as a result.
 Under the deal, the government will commit $30 billion in cash to A.I.G. from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, should the company need it, according to the people involved in the talks. A.I.G. is not expected to draw down the money immediately, but the government's commitment was enough to satisfy the rating agencies.
 Another part of the deal would allow A.I.G. to exchange some of its preferred nonvoting shares, which paid a 10 percent dividend, for new preferred shares that do not require a dividend. That would save A.I.G. $4 billion annually.
 To further ease A.I.G.'s debt burden, some of its other debt to the government would be converted into equity in two of the insurer's subsidiaries in Asia -- American International Assurance and the American Life Insurance Company. 
 Both units are performing well. This would give the government direct ownership in those subsidiaries and provide saleable assets to American taxpayers even if the A.I.G. holding company were to default on its loans.
 The government stake in American International Assurance is likely to be controversial. The unit had been put up for sale recently, without success. That suggests that the government is giving A.I.G. better terms than private investors were willing to give, exposing the government to further accusations that it is providing a handout to A.I.G.
 Also as part of the deal, the government would agree to lower the interest rate on all remaining A.I.G. debt to match the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. That would replace the previous rate, which was three percentage points higher than Libor. That move would save A.I.G. $1 billion in interest payments.
 The loss that A.I.G. is preparing to report on Monday would be the largest ever by any company in a single quarter. Still, of the $62 billion loss being reported, only about $2 billion is a cash loss. The rest is the result of noncash items like write-downs on the value of the company's assets.
 The new cash commitment reached on Sunday represented the fourth time since September that the federal government has taken steps to keep A.I.G. from collapsing. The previous rescues were intended to stabilize A.I.G. and buy it time to restructure. But the rescues were insufficient, in part because A.I.G. has either invested in or insured so many assets that keep losing value as the economy sours.
 In September, the Federal Reserve lent A.I.G. $85 billion when the company suddenly found itself unable to meet a round of cash calls. To secure the emergency loan, A.I.G. issued the Fed warrants for slightly less than 80 percent of the company's shares.
 Officials said at the time that they thought the loan would provide A.I.G. all the cash it could possibly need. The government brought in a seasoned insurance executive, Edward M. Liddy, to sell off some of A.I.G.'s operating units to raise money, since the rescue loan had to be paid back within two years. Mr. Liddy drew up a plan, saying he expected a smaller, well-capitalized version of A.I.G. to remain after the restructuring.
 But in just weeks it became clear that A.I.G.'s problems were so grave the $85 billion would not be enough. It was using up that money alarmingly fast, thus burdening itself with higher than expected debt-servicing costs, because it had to pay the Fed a higher rate of interest on the part of the loan that it drew down.
 In October, the government cut A.I.G. some slack by creating a new $38 billion facility to shore up its securities lending business, and gave the company access to a new commercial paper program, which had a much lower interest rate than the rescue loan.
 But that was not enough either. In mid-November, the government restructured its loans to A.I.G., raising its total commitment to $150 billion. The new arrangement reduced the rescue loan to $60 billion and stretched out its term to five years instead of two. 
 At the same time, it injected $40 billion into A.I.G. in exchange for preferred shares. And it created two special-purpose entities to take the most toxic assets then plaguing A.I.G. out of play.
 Those arrangements kept the government's stake in A.I.G. at just below 80 percent. The government has not wanted to go above 80 percent, because it would then have to consolidate all of A.I.G.'s assets and liabilities into its own finances, putting taxpayers on the hook for the claims of roughly 76 million insurance policyholders around the world.
 While November's restructuring did buy A.I.G. more time, it was not able to sell the operating units that Mr. Liddy put up for sale -- or, when assets were sold, the prices were shockingly low.

HEADLINE: Internet Mirrors Recession's Gloom

BYLINE: By ALEX MINDLIN

 BODY:
Americans' search patterns reflect their narrowing financial straits, according to the marketing research firm comScore. The number of Internet searches incorporating the word ''unemployment'' more than tripled from December 2007 to December 2008. Bankruptcy appeared in more than twice as many searches, and ''coupons'' went from 7.6 million searches to 19.9 million. 
 ''Coupons and discounts are a major 'tell' as far as consumer behavior,'' said Andrew Lipsman, an analyst at comScore. ''Coupon sites grew 33 percent year over year for this January.'' 
 People ages 25 to 34 seem to be searching most heavily for the term ''unemployment,'' relative to the percentage they represent of all searches. But, Mr. Lipsman said, ''No demographic is immune.'' ALEX MINDLIN

HEADLINE: The High Cost of Caring

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 ''In Turnabout, Children Take Caregiver Role'' (front page, Feb. 23) points out the challenges child caregivers face, but it doesn't address the financial struggles that come along with providing this care. 
 The current long-term services and supports system is fragmented, difficult and expensive. It affects not only people and their families, but also government programs, the medical profession and the economy as a whole. It is simply unaffordable to care. 
 What our country needs is a broad-based national insurance trust whose premiums provide cash benefits to pay for these expenses. When we are well, we would pay premiums like we do for car or health insurance. When we need help, we could use the benefit to hire an aide, pay a family member to help us or order groceries to be delivered. 
 Similar ''cash and counseling'' Medicaid demonstration programs are working well in 12 states. Based on sound financial principles, this approach would give more choice and control over our lives. We must make it affordable to care.

HEADLINE: A Leap to the White House, After Mixed Results

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
In February 2004, the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr., mapped out his vision for the borough before a crowd of supporters, using the kind of wonkish attention to detail and inspirational language that comes naturally to an urban planner and son of a Pentecostal preacher.
 In his State of the Borough Address, Mr. Carrion said the best social program was a job, and he started a campaign that would help residents find jobs through a new Web site, www.bronxatwork.com. 
 He said crime had decreased significantly, and he boasted his efforts in shutting so-called hot-sheet motels that rent rooms by the hour. He said any plans for a new Yankee Stadium should include a hotel and convention center, a Metro-North Railroad station and a high school for sports-related careers. And he described initiatives and commissions he had created to assist small businesses, the disabled and a host of others.
 Five years later, the jobs Web site has been marred by technical problems and is currently down, and the borough's unemployment rate, at 9.6 percent in December, is the highest in the city and second-highest in the state. Last year, the Bronx, the second-smallest borough by population, had the city's second-highest number of homicides, and there is no shortage of motels charging $50 for a few hours' stay. 
 When the new Yankee Stadium opens in April, a Metro-North station is set to open soon after, but there will be no hotel, no convention center and no high school. And while Mr. Carrion's pro-development approach helped create new housing and new jobs, the results of many of his initiatives and commissions are mixed, with some achieving their goals, some still in the planning stages and others fading away.
 That is, in large part, the record Mr. Carrion, 47, will carry with him to Washington, where he starts Monday as director of the White House Office of Urban Affairs, a new office created to focus federal investment in urban areas. Job creation, housing and ensuring that federal money for urban America is effectively spent will be among his primary concerns.
 It is a major leap for Mr. Carrion, who will go from the largely ceremonial position of borough president to coordinating national urban policy and who, 12 years ago, was district manager of a local community board. A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Carrion was unavailable to comment for this article.
 Assessing Mr. Carrion's readiness to make that jump depends on whether his tenure as borough president is seen as a hard-fought success in an office with limited power or a failed opportunity to turn around a borough that, while no longer a symbol of urban blight, continues to struggle with crime, poverty, homelessness and deaths from AIDS.
 To his supporters, Mr. Carrion had a positive impact in his seven years as borough president. 
 They say he became one of the city's leading Hispanic officials, winning enough support to plan a run for mayor in 2009 and distancing himself from the rough-and-tumble politics in the Bronx, where an internal power struggle has bitterly divided the Democratic Party organization. And they praised him for accelerating the borough's economic revival.
 Since 2002, when Mr. Carrion began the first of two terms, more than $4 billion in private and public financing has created 39,000 housing units in the Bronx and more than $8 billion more has been invested in major retail developments and the new Yankee Stadium, the borough president's office said. His plans to build the borough's first Children's Museum are progressing.
 ''In the end, I believe Adolfo will be credited most for rebranding the Bronx,'' said Eldin L. Villafane, a close friend and a former aide. ''He became the ubersalesman of the borough. He made the Bronx an attractive place to invest and do business in.''
 To his critics, Mr. Carrion's vision was unremarkable and his record of accomplishments a matter of debate. They argue that he often sacrificed community concerns to please business interests and failed to follow through on many of his ideas. 
 Mr. Carrion's promise in 2003 to build ice skating rinks at three Bronx parks fizzled, though a temporary rink is planned as part of the Yankee Stadium redevelopment. His Office of Faith Based Initiatives has been largely inactive after the death of its director. And his plans in 2006 to start a Bronx Sports Commission and a health insurance co-operative for small businesses remain works in progress.
 ''You have to look at the whole picture, and the whole picture to me is clouded because when push came to shove, on things he needed to advocate for, he didn't do it,'' said Gary Axelbank, the host of ''BronxTalk,'' a talk show on local public-access cable television. 
 Mr. Carrion's handling of two big projects especially angered many in the Bronx.
 The shopping center being built on the site of the old Bronx Terminal Market displaced about two dozen wholesale produce and ethnic foods merchants, and a community benefits agreement negotiated by Mr. Carrion with the developer was criticized for shortchanging residents.
 The new Yankee Stadium was built on land occupied by two neighborhood parks, and a number of community leaders and parks advocates objected to the loss of the parks and plans to replace them with smaller parks scattered around the neighborhood. Months after a Bronx community board voted against the stadium plan, Mr. Carrion replaced or demoted several board members in 2006.
 ''It's ironic that President Obama hired Adolfo Carrion, whose record in the Bronx at every turn thwarted the interest of the community, and yet the president started his career as a community organizer,'' said Richard Lipsky, a lobbyist for the market's former merchants.
 Mr. Carrion received thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from several individuals who worked for developers, companies or institutions building retail, housing or other developments in the borough, often as plans for those projects were still winding through the approval process. Those donors included officials with Boricua College and the Atlantic Development Group.
 Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president, praised Mr. Carrion's performance and said criticism of his tenure was understandable. ''I still live in the Bronx, so I have a stake in this,'' Mr. Ferrer said. ''Overall, he's been a terrific borough president. That he has some detractors means that he's made decisions.''
 Mr. Carrion, a former public school teacher, had entered the office steeped in community affairs. 
 He had worked as an urban planner at the Department of City Planning before becoming district manager for Community Board 5. In 1997, he ran for and won a City Council seat, later raising his political profile in 2001, when he and three others, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, were imprisoned for protesting bombing exercises on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques. He served 40 days in jail and took part in a hunger strike. ''I feel strong, I feel good in my spirit, and I feel we are doing the right thing,'' he told a reporter at the time.
 One of Mr. Carrion's accomplishments has been helping to develop housing for low- and moderate-income families. Borough presidents decide how to spend a small pot of money from the city's capital budget, and Mr. Carrion gave millions of dollars each year to help finance housing units. In a typical contribution, he gave $3 million to the nonprofit Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation to build 300 units that cost a total of $82 million.
 But critics say Mr. Carrion has exaggerated his role in building housing. The roughly 40,000 units he said were created during his tenure were made up of all residential development inthe borough, including projects he contributed capital money toward and projects he did not help finance.

HEADLINE: Poll Finds U.S. Muslims Thriving, but Not Content

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
A Gallup poll of Muslims in the United States has found that they are far more likely than people in Muslim countries to see themselves as thriving. 
 In fact, the only countries where Muslims are more likely to see themselves as thriving are Saudi Arabia and Germany, according to the poll.
 And yet, within the United States, Muslims are the least content religious group, when compared with Jews, Mormons, Protestants and Roman Catholics. 
 Gallup researchers say that is because the largest segment of American Muslims are African-Americans (35 percent, including first-generation immigrants), and they generally report lower levels of income, education, employment and well-being than other Americans. 
 But American Muslims are not one homogeneous group, the study makes clear. Asian-American Muslims (from countries like India and Pakistan) have more income and education and are more likely to be thriving than other American Muslims. In fact, their quality of life indicators are higher than for most other Americans, except for American Jews. 
 ''We discovered how diverse Muslim Americans are,'' said Dalia Mogahed, executive director and senior analyst of the Gallup Center for Muslim Studies, which financed the poll. ''Ethnically, politically and economically, they are in every way a cross-section of the nation. They are the only religious community without a majority race.'' 
 The Gallup study is significant because it is the first to examine a randomly selected sample of American Muslims. Gallup interviewed more than 300,000 people by telephone in 2008 while conducting broader polls, and focused on 946 who identified themselves as Muslims. (The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.) 
 Previous studies of American Muslims located respondents based on surnames, mosque attendance or geographic clusters, which polling experts say can skew the results. 
 Gallup asked an extensive battery of questions, producing a picture of American Muslims through the prisms of race, gender, class, age and education. The international comparisons were possible because of earlier Gallup studies of Muslims overseas. 
 American Muslim women, contrary to stereotype, are more likely than American Muslim men to have college and post-graduate degrees. They are more highly educated than women in every other religious group except Jews. American Muslim women also report incomes more nearly equal to men, compared with women and men of other faiths.
 Muslim women in the United States attend mosque as frequently as Muslim men -- a contrast with many Muslim countries where the mosques are primarily for men. American Muslims are generally very religious, saying that religion is an important part of their daily lives (80 percent), more than any other group except Mormons (85 percent). The figure for Americans in general is 65 percent. 
 By political ideology, Muslims were spread across the spectrum from liberal to conservative, with about 4 in 10 saying they were moderates. By party identification, Muslims resembled Jews more than any other religious group, with small minorities registered as Republicans, roughly half Democrats and about a third independents. 
 There are clear signs of social alienation, however. Lower percentages of Muslims register to vote or volunteer their time than adherents of other faiths. They are less likely to be satisfied with the area where they live. These indicators are ''worrying,'' said Ahmed Younis, a senior analyst at the Muslim studies center. 
 ''There is still a sense among American Muslims of being excluded from the mainstream,'' Mr. Younis said, ''and among young people that's more acute.'' 
 But the perception is far worse among Muslims in England and France, the study found.
 Mr. Younis said the finding ''reinforces the proposition that the integration process for American Muslims is, on the whole, a much more successful endeavor than it is for European Muslims.'' 

GRAPHIC: CHART: SATISFIED OR NOT: Interviews with American Muslims in 2008 indicated that their satisfaction with their lives was similar to all Americans and much better than Muslims in many other countries. Respondents evaluated their own lives, and they were then classified as to whether they were ''thriving,'' ''struggling'' or ''suffering.'' (Source: Gallup Center for Muslim Studies)

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''In Tough Times, Humanities Must Justify Their Worth'' (Arts pages, Feb. 25):
 Of course the liberal arts in general and the humanities in particular are under pressure ''to justify their existence.'' As a humanities teacher, I wouldn't have it any other way. To be under this kind of pressure makes for ideal working conditions. 
 We pride ourselves on selecting and arraying evidence; on arguing and reasoning persuasively; and on teaching students to do the same. When what we say in class and all the reading, writing and conversing we assign no longer contribute to legitimating our work, this work will become faith-based rather than fact- and reason-based. 
 When we start telling students, their families and the public who pay for our services: ''Trust us. Don't ask questions. We know what we're doing,'' instead of encouraging them to ask, ''Why do you what you do?'' or ''What's the point of studying literature and philosophy?,'' we'll deserve to go out of business.
 James D. Bloom Allentown, Pa., Feb. 25, 2009
 The writer is a professor of English and American studies, Muhlenberg College.
 To the Editor:
 During my 40 years teaching European history at Trinity College, my answer to the question ''What do you do with a history major?'' was, ''Nothing, unless you want to teach.'' 
 The better question is, ''What do history majors do?'' And the answer is, ''Everything -- law, business, finance, medicine, journalism, politics and much more.'' 
 Humanities majors do very well when in training or professional school for specific jobs and go on to careers that are both satisfying and remunerative. 
 In speaking about the many lifelong benefits of the humanities, I never shied away from mentioning the ''bread and butter'' one.
 Borden Painter West Hartford, Conn., Feb. 25, 2009
 The writer is emeritus president of Trinity College.
 To the Editor:
 Your article reminded me of a sign taped to the door to the classics department in the early 1960s at Yale, where I majored in Latin: ''Studying the classics teaches you the values you need to live without the money you give up because you studied the classics.''
 At age 66, after being battered by the storms and vicissitudes of life that most of us experience, I find that those values have stood me in good stead. Not to mention the habits of perseverance and attention to detail I learned by painstakingly parsing Horace or Thucydides in the original.

 It is shockingly inappropriate to reduce support for the humanities when most of the problems we are faced with in the nation and the world are the result of deficiencies in integrity and ethics, not deficiencies in vocational skill sets. 
 The subtleties of civilized living require an understanding of human functioning through centuries of ethical dilemmas, missteps and their consequences. Searching for meaning and purpose in our lives is not a trivial matter to be left to M.B.A.'s -- we've tried that already. 
 A significant number of excellent humanities courses should be required of all college graduates, no matter what their major course of study happens to be.

 The writer is a retired director of graduate studies in psychology at Trinity University.
 To the Editor:
 An important aspect of the humanities mentioned in your article needs to be spelled out. ''Critical thinking,'' many would agree, is valuable, and the humanities promote it. But what is it?
 It is the ability to ask pertinent questions on any subject of human concern, recognize pertinent and defensible answers, and reject spurious or irrelevant ones. Equally, it is the habit of doing so, an intellectual virtue.
 Absent this virtue, we reap the disasters of the Iraq war and our financial meltdown.

 To the Editor:
 Thank goodness that Derek Bok, a former president of Harvard, and Anthony T. Kronman, a Yale law professor -- as well as President Obama -- are such strong advocates for humanities education. 
 Without poetry, art, music, philosophy, languages, literature and history, we might as well all be robots. 
 To educate only with the short-term goal of producing a worker bee for the economic hive is to miss what it means to be a human being. And without a humanities background, the grads are not even likely to be as creative, thoughtful or insightful as those employees who have a liberal arts degree.

 BODY:
HSBC Is Hardier 
 Than Most Banks 
 HSBC is changing its feathers. Two years ago, it was the canary in the global bank vault when it alerted the world to the problems of subprime mortgages. Now it's on the verge of raising more than $:12 billion. The call for capital echoes its banking peers' and suggests the financial crisis is lurching into an ugly new phase. And news reports over the weekend say the bank is going to cut back on lending in the United States.
 That said, HSBC is in better health than most banks. Its Tier 1 capital ratio late last year was 8.9 percent, and its core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of true equity, was a hearty 7.8 percent. And unlike its rivals Citigroup and the Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC hasn't leaned on the state for extra capital or paid rich interest rates on preference shares. 
 Instead, HSBC looks ready to tap existing shareholders. With Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Cazenove apparently on board to underwrite, it's likely much of the issuance has already been taken up by institutions and hedge funds. Combined, it all suggests a measure of support for HSBC management, which is impressive in the face of a likely cut in the dividend.
 Of course, with HSBC due to report annual results on Monday, the capital increase may coincide with the revelation of bad news. But before accounting for any asset write-downs, bad loans or dividend payout savings, the extra capital would push HSBC's Tier 1 capital ratio close to 10 percent and provide a nice cushion against rising defaults, worsening unemployment and falling economic growth.
 HSBC likes to be ahead of the pack, especially where capital is concerned. Snatching a big slug of it before nonfinancial companies swamp the market could give HSBC an edge for the day when valuations hit bottom, even if the timing and record size of its capital call suggest that day is still a long way off.
 He Still Looks Sage
 Berkshire Hathaway shares lost more than 30 percent in 2008 -- and more since. Yet the value of the company's portfolio fell just 10 percent. The Sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, doesn't focus on the share price. But he says that risks, formerly underappreciated in the investment world, are now being overpriced. As that corrects, shares of the billionaire's investment company could benefit.
 Mr. Buffett acknowledges making some faulty investments, like buying billions of dollars of ConocoPhillips stock when energy prices had peaked. Even so, the per-share book value, or assets minus liabilities, of Berkshire's holdings fell a smidgeon less than 10 percent against a 38 percent loss on the S.& P. 500 index and a near 20 percent fall for the average hedge fund last year. 
 In that context, the investor's worst performance since 1965 -- and only his second annual decline in book value -- doesn't look so bad.
 Berkshire shares tell a different story. At the end of 2007, they traded at a premium to book value of more than 80 percent. By the end of last year, the premium had shrunk to less than 40 percent. Now, it's only around 10 percent based on the year-end book value, admittedly now too high. The shares are half of their late 2007 peak.
 Mr. Buffett also sees the economic outlook as a real concern through 2009 and probably beyond. That affects Berkshire's own businesses and those of stocks it owns. But other potential worries look less rational.
 One is derivatives. Berkshire has written put options on global stock indexes and various derivatives on corporate credit. These have generated $13 billion of paper losses between them, so far. 
 Yet not only is Mr. Buffett's record comforting as to the eventual outcomes, the exposure is scaled to Berkshire's capacity -- unlike, say, that of the flailing American International Group. An improbable total loss on the credit derivatives, for instance, would absorb only half Berkshire's cash on hand.
 Meanwhile, Berkshire has what Mr. Buffett calls a ''Gibraltar-like'' balance sheet. As shown by his investments in prominent companies as diverse as Goldman Sachs, Harley-Davidson, General Electric and Tiffany, he's finding opportunity.
 A fearful market could be focusing too much on the unhappy keywords attached to Berkshire: finance, derivatives, investments and insurance, to name a few. When irrational fears start to subside, the Buffett premium could return. While it might be damped by the fact that the 78-year-old isn't immortal, that could still help Berkshire stock even before the underlying investments turn around.JEFFREY GOLDFARB and RICHARD BEALES

HEADLINE: Southeast Asian Nations Talk of Economic Union

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Southeast Asian governments want to speed up the formation of an economic group modeled on the European Union as the global recession slows their export-driven economies.
 Leaders from the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations gathered in Thailand over the weekend for their annual meeting, and signed trade deals and agreements to form an integrated economic community, without a common currency, by 2015. 
 But analysts said that absent from the agenda were the concessions they said were necessary to increase growth in the region.
 ''Asean's biggest problem is that individual members haven't been willing to sacrifice for the common good,'' said Michael Montesano, a visiting research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore. ''Every European Union member has given up sovereignty to be part of a stronger union, and we haven't seen that in Asean.''
 Wide economic disparity among Asean members has hindered the region's ability to leverage its market of 570 million people and compete for investments with China and India, the world's fastest growing economies. Thailand's prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, who led the meeting, called on the bloc to ''accelerate'' the formation of an ''attractive single market.''
 Southeast Asian leaders agree that closer regional integration would help growth, Thailand's finance minister, Korn Chatikavanij, said in an interview. Still, the large differences in wealth among Asean members make it ''difficult to create common standards because our national standards remain so far apart,'' he said.
 The push for more integration comes at a time when the European Union is straining under the pressures created by a similar disparity in the strength of its constituent economies.
 Multinational companies have scaled back spending because of the global recession, leading to fiercer competition among governments looking to attract investment and create jobs.
 China Recovering, Premier Says
 China's economy has shown some signs of recovery after the government put into place its 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) economic stimulus package, Premier Wen Jiabao said.
 ''The government's measures to tackle the financial crisis have shown preliminary results,'' Mr. Wen said during an online chat with the public on the government's Web site on Sunday. He cited rising loans, retail sales in January and growing power output and consumption since the middle of February.
 China's economy, the world's third largest after those of the United States and Japan, expanded 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the slowest in seven years.
 China's consumer spending jumped 18 percent in January, bank loans surged and power output and consumption regained growth since the middle of February, Mr. Wen said.
 Still, he cautioned that the positive data might be temporary.

HEADLINE: In Obama, Labor Finds The Support It Expected

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
John J. Sweeney, the nation's top union official, often complains that he was invited just once to the White House during George W. Bush's eight years in office -- and even that was at the Vatican's behest during a visit by Pope Benedict.
 If an index is needed for how much closer organized labor is to President Obama than to his predecessor, it might be the number of times Mr. Sweeney, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s president, has visited the White House since Inauguration Day -- at least once a week for receptions, bill signings and a meeting on fiscal responsibility. 
 Mr. Obama has delighted labor by issuing four pro-labor executive orders that reversed Bush policies. He has also appointed a union-friendly chairwoman to the National Labor Relations Board and named a labor secretary whose parents were both union members. 
 But those changes worry corporate America, especially as Mr. Obama has signaled he will push for legislation that would expand labor's thinned ranks by making it far easier to unionize workers. Labor leaders expect Vice President Joseph Biden to spell out the administration's battle plans for the bill on Thursday, when he is scheduled to speak at the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s winter meeting in Miami Beach. 
 Any doubts that union leaders might have had about Mr. Obama dissolved several weeks ago when, in announcing a new Task Force on the Middle Class, he said: ''I do not view the labor movement as part of the problem. To me, it's part of the solution. You cannot have a strong middle class without a strong labor movement.''
 Mr. Sweeney and many other labor leaders were thrilled. ''It's like night and day having a president who believes in helping working people build power,'' Mr. Sweeney said. ''I look upon Obama as the most pro-union president since John Kennedy, and I have even compared him to Franklin Delano Roosevelt.''
 But Republicans and business leaders are not so happy. They complain that Mr. Obama is simply paying back labor for all the money and volunteers that unions invested in his victory. 
 ''This last election the labor bosses spent $400 million to $500 million getting the other side elected, and they just didn't do that for their good health,'' John Boehner, the House Republican leader, said at a conference in Washington last Thursday. ''They've been making investments in the other side so they can control the policy-making side.''
 Randel Johnson, vice president for labor policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, also voiced concern. ''The jury is still out on the degree to which the Obama administration will be controlled by organized labor,'' he said. ''Whether he will triangulate organized labor like Clinton or become their handmaiden, we're not sure.''
 Nate Tamarin, an associate White House political director who is in charge of outreach to labor, said Mr. Obama's pro-worker policies reflected what he promised during his campaign.
 ''Everything he has done is consistent with what he thinks is right for American working people and is consistent with what he viewed throughout his career as the important place unions have in building the American middle class,'' Mr. Tamarin said.
 Union leaders are certainly pleased with Mr. Obama's $787 billion recovery package, as well as his plans for universal health coverage and increasing taxes on the rich. 
 The president of the Communications Workers of America praised the $7.2 billion earmarked in the recovery package to expand broadband service. The steelworkers' president hailed Buy America provisions. And the president of the American Federation of Teachers lauded billions set aside for spending on education.
 Unions also applaud the four executive orders, including one that makes it more likely that construction projects receiving federal dollars will be unionized. Unions also played a role in persuading the president to delay revamping Social Security and possibly making benefits less generous.
 Most of all, they are looking to President Obama to help unions reverse their decades-long slide in power and membership. With 16 million members, unions represent just 7.6 percent of private-sector workers today, down from more than 25 percent in the early 1980s.
 Labor is pinning its biggest hopes on the passage of the Employee Free Choice Act, a bill that unions hope will add millions of new members by giving workers the right to union recognition as soon as a majority of employees at a workplace sign pro-union cards. The bill would take away management's ability to insist on a secret ballot election. 
 Business leaders have warned of Armageddon in their fight to kill the bill, which Democratic leaders say will come up for a vote in May, June or July. Union leaders voice confidence that they will muster the 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster, while Republicans expect to defeat the bill in the Senate. 
 Republican and business strategists say they are focusing on lobbying several Democratic senators, especially Mark Pryor and Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas, Mark Warner of Virginia, Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, to help deny the 60 Senate votes needed for passage.
 Mr. Johnson, of the Chamber of Commerce, denounced the bill, saying, ''The idea of radically changing employment law when companies are trying to dig themselves out of a hole is ludicrous.''
 But Mr. Obama disagreed, telling regional newspaper reporters last month: ''I don't buy the argument that providing workers with collective-bargaining rights somehow weakens the economy or worsens the business environment. If you've got workers who have decent pay and benefits, they're also customers for business.'' If there is one area where labor remains uneasy with Mr. Obama, it is trade policy. 
 Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers, said he was worried that the trade representative, Ron Kirk, and commerce secretary-designate, Gary Locke, were too much in favor of free trade and would not do enough to preserve America's manufacturing jobs.
 ''We cannot work our way out of this economic mess unless we refocus on making things in America,'' Mr. Gerard said.

HEADLINE: For Obama Pick, a 2nd Chance To Move Ahead on Health Care

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

DATELINE: TOPEKA, Kan. 

 BODY:
In Kansas, Gov. Kathleen Sebelius is known as a Democrat who can deal with Republicans, a necessity in a state where the opposition party dominates both houses of the Legislature.
 But on matters of health policy, which she will oversee if she is confirmed as President Obama's secretary of health and human services, Ms. Sebelius's efforts to forge bipartisan consensus have rarely succeeded. She recently observed that the greatest frustration of her six years in office had been her inability to persuade lawmakers to raise tobacco taxes for a modest expansion of government health coverage.
 Now, with the backing of a Democratic Congress, Ms. Sebelius will have a chance to achieve in Washington what she failed to accomplish in Topeka, and then some. When he announces her nomination on Monday, Mr. Obama will effectively make her the point person for what may become the largest expansion of taxpayer-subsidized health insurance in more than four decades. 
 Ms. Sebelius, 60, would start the job in midstream. Last week, while she was battling with the Legislature over its desire to allow a pair of coal-fired power plants in western Kansas, Mr. Obama began his effort to revamp American health care by telling Congress that change ''will not wait another year.'' 
 Mr. Obama then proposed to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans to help pay for a $634 billion investment in expanded government health coverage over 10 years. His efforts are complicated by the recession, which is draining the Medicare trust fund more quickly than expected, according to federal officials. 
 Ms. Sebelius's nomination comes nearly a month after Mr. Obama's first choice, former Senator Tom Daschle, withdrew upon revealing that he had owed $128,000 in back taxes and paid it only after being selected. The White House used the time not only to vet Ms. Sebelius, but also to make sure that the two Republican senators from Kansas, Sam Brownback and Pat Roberts, would not oppose her confirmation.
 The governor is a Roman Catholic who supports abortion rights, and her vetoes of anti-abortion measures have drawn derision from social conservatives, including a request by the archbishop of Kansas City that she not take communion. Her spokeswoman declined an interview request for the governor, saying her schedule would not permit it.
 Ms. Sebelius is said to have a wonkish understanding of health policy, but she has failed to make significant improvements in health coverage or costs during her two terms as governor. Although the proportion of Kansans who are uninsured remains well below the national average -- 12.7 percent versus 15.3 percent -- it has grown seven times as fast in the state than in the nation during her tenure, according to census figures. 
 Health insurance premiums in Kansas rank just below the national average and have increased at about the same rate as the nation's, according to figures compiled by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The same was true during the previous eight years, when Ms. Sebelius served as state insurance commissioner.
 In that job, Ms. Sebelius cast herself as a consumer champion by pushing to protect patients from rationed care by health maintenance organizations and rapid discharges by hospitals. She declined campaign contributions from the industry she regulated and, in her boldest move, rejected the 2002 purchase of the state's largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas, by Anthem Inc., based in Indianapolis. 
 No other state insurance commissioner had blocked such a sale, but Ms. Sebelius argued that it would result in higher premiums for Kansans. Litigation ensued, and she ultimately was upheld by the State Supreme Court. 
 ''She rode that decision all the way to the governor's office,'' said Sandy Praeger, the current insurance commissioner and a Republican. 
 Legislators in both parties said that as governor, Ms. Sebelius's efforts to reach across the aisle had seemed more strategic than instinctually bipartisan. She is skilled at exploiting the divisions between moderate and conservative Republicans, and has successfully forged coalitions with one caucus or the other on redistricting, school financing and the state budget, among other issues. 
 When she stood for re-election in 2006, she persuaded a former state Republican chairman, Mark Parkinson, to join her ticket as a Democrat (he will succeed her if she is confirmed for the cabinet position).
 But when it comes to health care, the governor and the Legislature have been separated by a philosophical gulf, with Ms. Sebelius supporting a larger government role and the Republicans steadfastly resisting it. 
 ''Both her proposals and her accomplishments have been limited to some extent by the political realities of the state that she governs,'' said Dr. Robert F. St. Peter, president of the Kansas Health Institute, a research foundation.
 In 2004, her second year in office, Ms. Sebelius proposed expanding the state's low Medicaid thresholds to cover 70,000 of the state's 300,000 or so uninsured, and to pay for it by raising tobacco taxes. The measure died.
 The next year, she issued an executive order creating a new health policy agency that would centralize purchasing and planning in her office. The Legislature blocked the move, and instead created an agency controlled by legislative appointees. Ms. Sebelius went along.
 In her 2007 State of the State address, Ms. Sebelius urged lawmakers to ''commit ourselves to universal coverage.'' Though she said little about how to achieve that, Republicans tarred her as an advocate of ''socialized medicine'' -- or ''Hillarycare,'' as Melvin Neufeld, who was House speaker at the time, put it.
 Ms. Sebelius, a former state representative, called on the Legislature to begin by covering all children up to age 5. Again, she made little headway, though in 2008, an election year, the Republicans expanded eligibility for the State Children's Health Insurance Program without appropriating any money to do so. 
 Although she signed the bill, which also made a modest expansion of Medicaid for pregnant women, she called it the session's biggest disappointment. She had also failed to win approval of a statewide indoor smoking ban. 
 ''It has been something that I find puzzling and troubling and not a lot different from what's happened in Congress and with the administration,'' she said in a December interview with the Kansas Health Institute News Service. 
 Legislative leaders say Ms. Sebelius presses her case in occasional meetings and news conferences, but rarely cajoles or twists arms.
 ''I see her in the hall and say hello, and that's it,'' said State Representative Brenda K. Landwehr, a conservative Republican who heads the Health and Human Services Committee. ''She's never asked me to visit with her. I think she's a very strong individual, that things are either done her way or the highway, with little room for compromise.'' 
 The daughter of an Ohio governor, John Gilligan, and daughter-in-law of a Kansas congressman, Ms. Sebelius herself appears healthy and fit. She and her husband, Gary, a federal magistrate judge, have been married for 34 years and have two sons. She played basketball in college, runs three miles nearly every day and does not smoke. By all accounts, she remains popular in Kansas, scoring a 57 percent approval rating in one January poll. 
 Because the possibilities for change here have been so narrow, there is little sense of Ms. Sebelius's views on broad questions like whether Americans should be required to have health insurance or whether, as Mr. Daschle proposed, health policy should be delegated to a board styled after the Federal Reserve.
 As secretary, Ms. Sebelius would have considerable influence over government policy on abortion. Although she says she personally opposes abortion, she has consistently defended abortion rights in a state where the anti-abortion movement can be fierce. She has vetoed anti-abortion measures almost every year, including bills that would have required the licensing of abortion clinics and allowed relatives to petition a court to stop a late-term abortion.

The leaders of the European Union gathered Sunday in Brussels in an emergency summit meeting that seemed to highlight the very worries it was designed to calm: that the world economic crisis has unleashed forces threatening to split Europe into rival camps.
 An urgent call from Hungary for a large bailout for newer, Eastern members was bluntly rejected by Europe's strongest economy, Germany, and received little support from other countries. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, facing federal elections in September, said countries must be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. 
 ''Saying that the situation is the same for all Central and Eastern European states, I don't see that,'' Mrs. Merkel told reporters. She spoke after Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany of Hungary warned, ''We should not allow that a new Iron Curtain should be set up and divide Europe.''
 With uncertain leadership and few powerful collective institutions, the European Union is struggling with the strains this crisis has inevitably produced among 27 countries with uneven levels of development. 
 The traditional concept of ''solidarity'' is being undermined by protectionist pressures in some member countries and the rigors of maintaining a common currency, the euro, for a region that has diverse economic needs. Particularly acute economic problems in some newer members that once were part of the Soviet bloc have only made matters worse. 
 Europe's difficulties are in sharp contrast to the American response. President Obama has just announced a budget that will send the United States more deeply into debt but that also makes an effort to redistribute income and overhaul health care, improve education and combat environmental problems.
 Whether Europe can reach across constituencies to create consensus, however, has been an open, and suddenly pressing, question.
 ''The European Union will now have to prove whether it is just a fair-weather union or has a real joint political destiny,'' said Stefan Kornelius, the foreign editor of the German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung. ''We always said you can't really have a currency union without a political union, and we don't have one. There is no joint fiscal policy, no joint tax policy, no joint policy on which industries to subsidize or not. And none of the leaders is strong enough to pull the others out of the mud.''
 Thomas Klau, Paris director of the European Council on Foreign Relations, an independent research and advocacy group, said, ''This crisis affects the political union that backs the euro and of course the E.U. as a whole, and solidarity is at the heart of the debate.''
 The crisis also has implications for Washington, which wants a European Union that can promote common interests in places like Afghanistan and the Middle East with financial and military help. 
 ''All of that is in doubt if the cornerstone of the E.U. -- its internal market, economic union and solidarity -- is in question,'' said Ronald D. Asmus, a former State Department official who runs the Brussels office of the German Marshall Fund.
 The problems are basically twofold: within the inner core of nations that use the euro as their common currency, which together have an economy roughly the size of the United States'; and within the larger European Union. 
 The 16 nations that use the euro -- introduced in 1999, and one of the proudest European accomplishments -- must submit to the monetary leadership of the European Central Bank. That keeps some members hardest hit by the economic downturn, like Ireland, Spain, Italy and Greece, from unilaterally taking radical steps to stimulate their economies. 
 Germany once vowed never to bail out weaker members in return for giving up its strong national currency, the deutsche mark. But German leaders are now faced with the unpalatable prospect of having to put German money at risk to bail out less responsible partners that do not adhere to European fiscal rules.
 Within the larger European Union, fissures are growing between older members and newer ones, especially those that lived under the yoke of Soviet socialism. Some countries of Central Europe, like the Czech Republic and Poland, are doing relatively well. Others, including Hungary, Romania and the Baltic states, are in a state of near-meltdown. 
 But only two newer members -- tiny Slovenia and Slovakia -- are protected by being among the countries that use the euro, and there was little support on Sunday for changing the rules to allow more to join quickly. 
 Many new members have seen their currencies plummet against the euro. That has made their debt repayments to European banks, their primary lenders, a much greater burden even as the global recession has meant a plunge in orders from consumers in the West. Some countries are asking for aid, both from their European partners and from the International Monetary Fund, to prop up their currencies and the banks. 
 While Western European countries are reluctant, with their own problems both at home and among the countries using the euro, there is a deep interconnectedness in any case. 
 Much of the debt at risk in Eastern Europe is on the books of euro zone banks -- especially ones in Austria and Italy. The same is true of problems farther afield, in Ukraine, which is not yet a member. 
 Having watched the Soviet Union collapse, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe embraced the liberal, capitalist model as the price of integration with Europe. That model is now badly tarnished, and the newer members feel adrift. 
 Before the larger European summit meeting on Sunday, the Poles called an unprecedented meeting of nine of the new member nations in the East to discuss common grievances. 
 Prime Minister Mirek Topolanek of the Czech Republic, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union, tried to ease tensions, insisting that no member would be left ''in the lurch.''
 ''We do not want any dividing lines; we do not want a Europe divided along a north-south or east-west line, pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy,'' Mr. Topolanek said.
 But his Hungarian colleague, Mr. Gyurcsany, called for a special European Union fund of up to $241 billion to protect the weakest members. His government circulated a paper on Sunday suggesting that Central Europe's refinancing needs this year could total $380 billion. 
 ''Failure to act,'' the paper said, ''could cause a second round of systemic meltdowns that would mainly hit the euro zone economies.'' 
 Mrs. Merkel opposed an undifferentiated package, although she suggested on Thursday that targeted help might be offered to specific countries, like Ireland. 
 Governments of the countries of the European Union have already spent a total of $380 billion in bank recapitalizations and put up $3.17 trillion to guarantee banks' loans and try to get credit moving again.
 On Friday, the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, the European Investment Bank and the World Bank said they would jointly provide $31.1 billion to support Eastern European nations, but much more will be needed.
 Mr. Klau, of the European Council on Foreign Relations, sees a worrying loss of faith in a certain brand of capitalism. ''It's politically dangerous there since they've just emerged from an ultraregulated and stifling system, were confronted with shock therapy that created great hardship, and are just beginning to recover and stabilize,'' he said. ''Now they're thrown back into an economic and political cauldron.'' 
 The new members are finding that their European partners are putting their own national interests ahead of ''collective and necessary solidarity,'' Mr. Klau said.
 Charles Grant, director of the Center for European Reform, a research group in London, is more sanguine, however. ''My expectation is that the euro zone countries, out of pure self-interest, will bail each other out,'' he said. ''For Central and Eastern Europe it is too early to say there won't be solidarity. But non-E.U. countries in the east -- particularly Ukraine -- seem to be the No. 1 worry.''

HEADLINE: HSBC Is Reportedly Seeking $17 Billion in New Capital

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
Unlike most of its global rivals, the British bank HSBC Holdings has been healthy enough to avoid raising capital to cope with the credit crisis. Until now.
 HSBC plans to announce on Monday that it is trying to sell about $:12 billion, or about $17 billion, worth of new shares to current investors, said a person with direct knowledge of the plans. 
 As the economic outlook deteriorates and bad loans in the United States weigh on earnings, the sale would come as the bank releases its 2008 financial results, said the person, who declined to be identified because plans for the capital increase were not complete. 
 HSBC will also probably lower its dividend, the person said. HSBC declined to comment on any capital-raising plans.
 The bank is also planning to scale back on consumer lending and branches in the United States, The Wall Street Journal online and The Financial Times reported on Sunday.
 Some analysts and investors have pressed HSBC's management for weeks for a capital increase, saying the bank needs a bigger cushion to safeguard it against a further decline of asset values in Britain and the United States. 
 HSBC bought the American subprime mortgage lender Household International in 2003, and losses at the unit continue to increase, undermining growth in Asia. HSBC's shares have fallen 28 percent this year in London.
 HSBC is expected to announce on Monday that pretax profit for last year fell about 11 percent to $21 billion and that impairment charges for bad loans would reach $22 billion, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette and Woods have estimated.
 Knight Vinke Asset Management, the shareholder activist investor, said last month that HSBC would be required to sell shares to cope with the crisis and analysts said previously that there is investor appetite for such a capital-raising effort. But any capital increase in the current market remains undoubtedly challenging. Goldman Sachs Group and JPMorgan Cazenove would be managing the sale, the person said.
 A capital increase would match and possibly surpass the record for the amount a British company has raised. Royal Bank of Scotland, which is majority-owned by the government, raised $:12 billion last year.
 HSBC's plan illustrates that even those lenders that coped better with the economic downturn so far and did not have to ask for government support are improving their capital ratios in light of further market deterioration.
 A capital increase would also prepare the bank for any capital requirements by regulators in the future and would enable it to spend on expanding its market share while its main rivals are unable to do so.
 Financial companies in Europe have been pushed to raise more than $355 billion because of credit market losses and investment write-downs.
 HSBC relied on its large operations in Asia to contribute to earnings while businesses in the United States and parts of Europe struggled. But now, even growth in Asia is likely to slow.

HEADLINE: White House Poised for Budget Fight

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Obama administration this weekend pursued a vigorous offensive to sell its economic program, counterattacking strongly against Republicans who call the new budget plan ''mind-boggling'' in its numbers and ambition.
 In his weekly radio talk on Saturday, President Barack Obama had called for the passage of a plan that would invest heavily in expanded health care, cleaner energy and education, but do so partly through taxes affecting the wealthy and polluters. He predicted fierce opposition from the insurance industry, oil and gas companies, student lenders and banks, saying: ''I know they're gearing up for a fight as we speak. My message to them is this: So am I.''
 On Sunday, top White House advisers amplified on those comments, defending the breadth of the $3.6 trillion budget plan and sharply rejecting Republican arguments that it would cost, not create, jobs, and send energy costs up. 
 Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, said he was confident the budget would be passed by April, though he accused Republicans of ''scare tactics'' in trying to arouse public opposition. Mr. Emanuel, speaking on CBS's ''Face the Nation,'' said that it was time for the country to move away from ''a culture of rising deficits and more and more consumer spending,'' and toward one that invests and saves.
 Peter Orszag, the White House budget director, said it was wrong to suggest, as Republicans have, that the administration would be raising taxes at a time of deep recession, because those measures would take effect only in 2011, when the administration presumes the economy will be growing. ''We face big problems and we've got to tackle them,'' he said on ABC's ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos.''
 At the same time, Mr. Emanuel and Mr. Orszag indicated that the president would not pick a fight over the estimated 9,000 ''earmarks,'' or special provisions inserted by individual lawmakers, in the omnibus spending bill passed last week.
 Mr. Obama had frequently voiced his distaste for such costly provisions.
 But Mr. Orszag indicated that the president would sign the legislation, needed to keep this year's governmental programs running for the next several months. ''This is last year's business,'' he said. ''We just need to move on.''
 A major legislative fight over the budget is certain. Republicans expressed shock at the size and radical change implied by some White House proposals, even if some conservatives appeared to quietly relish the issue as a rallying point useful as they try to begin their political recovery.
 ''I think it's terrifying in the policy implications as well as mind-boggling in the numbers,'' Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona and a Finance Committee member, said on ''Fox News Sunday.'' ''You're directly punishing job creation with this kind of huge tax policy.''
 Representative Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, called the $3.6 trillion budget proposal ''breathtaking.''
 ''What surprises me most about this budget is that they would bring it out in the middle of a recession,'' said Mr. Ryan, who serves on both the Budget and Ways and Means Committees. The proposed fee for manufacturers who pollute would amount to an energy tax on all Americans, he said on Fox.
 But Senators Kyl and Ryan said it would be difficult for Republicans to block the budget.
 ''I hope that we can, but that means that all of us will have to be together on this,'' Kyl said. ''We have to be absolutely united.''
 This would be especially true if the majority Democrats employed a parliamentary maneuver that would require only 51 votes in the Senate for passage of budget legislation, not the usual 60.
 Democrats control 58 seats in that chamber. Republicans' best hope is that some conservative Democrats -- uneasy over cuts in agricultural subsidies, or a drop in the amount the wealthy can deduct for charitable contributions -- might join them.
 ''You can't stop this in the House,'' Mr. Ryan said. ''If you can get a few Democrats to turn then I think you can slow this thing down.''
 Mr. Emanuel said on Sunday that the Obama administration wanted to ''continue to reach out'' to Republicans, even though only three congressional Republicans supported the White House stimulus plan. But when asked on ''Face the Nation'' who now speaks for the Republican Party, he offered a view that might surprise many mainstream Republicans.
 ''It was Rush Limbaugh,'' he said, referring to the conservative talk-show host who has said he hopes that Mr. Obama fails as president. ''He is the voice and the intellectual force and energy behind the Republican Party. And he has been upfront about what he views.''

HEADLINE: Running on Risk, Then Sticking With It

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
If Barack Obama played it safe, he never would have challenged Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination two years after leaving the Illinois legislature.
 Once he won the nomination, he never would have planned a splashy tour of foreign capitals that might have typecast him as inexperienced and pretentious. He never would have tried to fill a football stadium and become the first candidate since John F. Kennedy to accept a nomination outdoors. In the general election, he would not have bet on states like Indiana, North Carolina and Virginia that had not voted blue for decades.
 And in his first 100 days as president, he would not have sought $1 trillion from affluent Americans and a similar sum from businesses to finance health care, education and energy initiatives. All that while simultaneously trying to save the auto industry, revive financial markets, end the Iraq war and redouble efforts to battle Islamic extremists in Afghanistan. 
 Mr. Obama's closest aides have long embraced that pattern, even if it still startles official Washington. As his campaign manager, David Plouffe, put it last fall, ''We are always better off on the high wire.'' 
 New Territory
 The high wire served two distinct functions for candidate Obama -- one external, one internal. For the public, audaciousness underscored his larger theme of new leadership that threw out a political generation's playbook. 
 For his campaign, it forced aides to operate at peak efficiency by magnifying the risks of failure. ''We excelled as an organization because there was a tremendous downside,'' Mr. Plouffe said in an interview. ''The organization had to perform.''
 That poses a tougher challenge of governance. Achieving Mr. Obama's agenda, or even a substantial part of it, will require extraordinary responsiveness not only from his team, but also from Congress and the public.
 Every lawmaker the president now relies on has a different constituency than he does. Because of gerrymandering, House members' districts usually lean toward the right or left ends of the political spectrum, though lately Democrats have picked up seats in some relatively conservative areas. In the Senate, the interests of energy-state Democrats like Mary L. Landrieu of Louisiana or Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia differ from those of more environmentally sensitive colleagues like Barbara Boxer of California or Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. 
 Each of Mr. Obama's major initiatives might normally represent the work of an entire session of Congress. Mr. Obama's only apparent deference to overloaded circuits so far was his decision to slow his initial push for Social Security solvency, which rattled Democratic liberals.
 In ''The Last Campaign,'' his account of Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential race, Thurston Clarke speculated on when ''the dam will break'' and unleash a new flood of public activism mirroring Mr. Kennedy's aspirations. Obama aides, who sought to emulate Mr. Kennedy's effort, hope that has happened.
 But it is unproven. ''The risks are too much too soon, and piling on, and triggering class warfare,'' said Kenneth Khachigian, a former aide to Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan. 
 Most worrisome for Democrats is that Republicans might convince middle-class Americans that they, and not just the rich, will suffer from Mr. Obama's agenda. That is how Republicans defeated President Bill Clinton's proposal for universal health care in 1994 without a single committee vote in Congress.
 One vulnerable target: the Obama plan to cap carbon emissions, which opponents are already tarring as a back-door energy tax on consumers. ''Push won't really come to shove,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, ''until the average voter worries that he or she will be impacted -- whether through higher taxes or restrictions on health care choices or some other way.'' 
 Familiar Ambition
 What makes Mr. Obama's reach even more striking is that he has followed a president with similar ambitions.
 Accepting the 2000 Republican nomination, George W. Bush scalded Mr. Clinton for failing to lead and promised to ''confront the hard issues.'' Privately among aides, he disdained the ''small ball'' other politicians played.
 After the Sept. 11 attacks, Mr. Bush sought to transform the Middle East by invading Iraq. Later he pursued partial privatization of Social Security over the misgivings of fellow Republicans. Whatever the merits of either endeavor, both became costly political failures even before the economy fell into crisis.
 None of which deters the Obama White House as it enters its seventh week. Mr. Plouffe called far-reaching action on multiple fronts without delay ''core to why he ran'' to begin with.
 ''Political calculation and risk aversion really have to take a back seat,'' Mr. Plouffe said. ''It's a test for Washington in my view. We're in uncharted territory here.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Crisis of the Mind

BYLINE: By MASARU TAMAMOTO. 
Masaru Tamamoto is a senior fellow at the World Policy Institute.

DATELINE: Yokohama, Japan 

 BODY:
 RECENT events mark Japan's return to the world's stage, or at least so it seems. Tokyo was Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's inaugural overseas destination. Last week, Prime Minister Taro Aso was the first foreign leader to visit the Obama White House. All this suggests that Washington sees Japan, the world's second-largest economy, as a powerful nation. If only we saw ourselves the same way.
 The truth is, Japan is a mess. Mr. Aso's approval rate recently hit 11 percent, and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party is in open disarray. His predecessor barely lasted a year. The opposition Democratic Party of Japan just offers more of the same. This is largely because we have become a nation of bureaucrats. What passes for national policy is the sum of various ministerial interests, often conflicting or redundant, with jealously guarded turfs and budgets. 
 There can be no justification for all those mostly unused airports. Or for roads that lead nowhere. Or for the finance minister who appeared to be drunk at the Group of 7 meeting this month in Rome. Our problem is so deep that it sometimes seems that no political party can tame the bureaucracy and put in place a coherent national agenda.
 But what most people don't recognize is that our crisis is not political, but psychological. After our aggression -- and subsequent defeat -- in World War II, safety and predictability became society's goals. Bureaucrats rose to control the details of everyday life. We became a nation with lifetime employment, a corporate system based on stable cross-holdings of shares, and a large middle-class population in which people are equal and alike. 
 Conservative pundits here like to speak of this equality and sameness as being cornerstones of ''Japanese'' tradition. Nonsense. Throughout much of its history, Japan has had social stratification and great inequality of wealth and privilege. The ''egalitarian'' Japan was a creature of the 1970s, with its progressive taxation, redistribution of wealth, subsidies and the dampening of competition through regulation. This all seemed to work just fine until our asset-price bubble popped in the 1990s. Today, the hemmed-in Japanese seem satisfied with the knowledge that everyone around them is equally unhappy.
 Since the middle of the 19th century, our economic success has relied on the availability of outside models from which to choose. Our model for social security took inspiration from Bismarck's Germany, state planning from the Soviet Union, public works from the Tennessee Valley Authority, automobile assembly and manufacturing from Ford. Much of Japanese innovation has involved perfecting what others have created. Sony is famous for its Walkman, but it didn't invent the tape recorder. Japan's rise to economic greatness was basically a game of catch-up with the advanced West.
 So what happened once we caught up? Over the past two decades, the answer has largely been paralysis. Japan's ability to imitate outside models was mistaken for progress. But if progress is defined by pursuing a vision of a desirable future, then the Japanese never progressed. What we had was a concept of order and placement, which is essentially stasis.
 In the West, on the other hand, the idea of progress rests on establishing individual autonomy and liberty. In Japan, bureaucratic rule offered security and predictability -- in exchange for personal freedom. The problem is that our current political leaders can't keep their side of the bargain. Employment security can no longer be guaranteed. The national pension and health plans seem to be insolvent in the long run. People feel both insecure and unfree.
 Signs of despair are everywhere. Japan has one of the highest suicide rates among rich countries. There may be as many as one million ''hikikomori,'' from teenagers to those in their 40s, who shut themselves in their rooms for years on end. Then there are all those ''parasite singles'' -- or unmarried adults living with their parents. But by far our most serious problem is a declining and aging population. Given present trends, total population will likely decline from around 130 million to under 90 million in 50 years or so. By that same time, 40 percent of Japanese could be over 65.
 If we want to survive as a nation, we must shed our deeply rooted resistance to immigration. Contrary to widespread prejudices in favor of keeping Japan ''pure,'' we desperately need to dilute our blood. Our aging nation will need millions of university-educated middle-class immigrants with high productivity, people who will put down roots and raise families, whose pride and success will be the affirmation of new Japanese values. 
 Japan desperately needs change, and this will require risk. Risk-taking is not common among the bureaucratically controlled. You won't find many signs on Japanese beaches saying, ''Swim at your own risk. No lifeguard on duty.'' If that sign were to appear, many Japanese would likely ask the authorities to tell them if it is safe to swim. This same risk aversion translates into protectionism and insularity. The ministry of agriculture, for example, wants to increase self-sufficiency in food. There is not nearly enough critical thinking and dissent in the Japanese news media. 
 Still, the idea that the Japanese are afraid of risk has no basis in history, for better or for worse. Remember Pearl Harbor? In fact, Japan's passiveness today is in large measure a calculated and reasonable reaction to its behavior during the Second World War. But today, this emphasis on safety and security is long past its sell-by date.
 We have run out of outside models to imitate. We must start from scratch, embracing an idea of progress that is based on innovation, ambition and dynamism. Doing so will take risk -- and extraordinary leadership. But the alternative is to continue stumbling down a path of decline.

HEADLINE: White House Defends Approval of Pet Projects

BYLINE: By GINGER THOMPSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
White House officials said Sunday that President Obama would sign a $410 billion spending bill that includes thousands of pet projects, known as earmarks, despite campaign promises to put an end to the practice. 
 In appearances on television talk shows, Mr. Obama's budget director and chief of staff both played down the issue.
 ''This is last year's business,'' Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Office of Management and Budget, said in an appearance on the ABC program ''This Week.'' ''We want to just move on. Let's get this bill done, get it into law and move forward.''
 Republican leaders, meanwhile, accused the president of breaking his promises to change Washington's ways.
 Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the second-ranking Republican in the House, followed Mr. Orszag's appearance on ''This Week'' and challenged the president to ''stand up and draw the line right now and stop the waste.''
 Officials estimate that the omnibus spending bill, meant to pay for government operations through Sept. 30, contains nearly 9,000 provisions added by legislators to use public money to pay for projects in their home districts. The legislation, approved in the House last week, is expected to pass in the Senate this week. 
 The earmarks account for at least $3.8 billion of the total spending in the package, according to estimates, including $1 million to control Mormon crickets in Utah, $162,000 to control rodents in Hawaii, and money for the presidential libraries of three Democrats: Franklin D. Roosevelt ($17.5 million), John F. Kennedy ($22 million) and Lyndon B. Johnson ($2 million). 
 The legislation would increase overall spending by 9 percent compared with last year, including significant increases for health care, education and energy.
 Speaking on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS, the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, said Mr. Obama was not happy about the large number of earmarks in the bill. But Mr. Emanuel said the president had kept lawmakers from adding a single earmark to his $787 billion stimulus package and a $32.8 billion plan to expand the State Children's Health Insurance Program.
 Mr. Emanuel praised Congress for putting into place rules intended to make the budget process more transparent, particularly the requirement for disclosing the authors of earmarks.
 ''What the American people want to know is, do these individual Congressional earmarks meet a worthy public objective, or are they just an individual desire of a member of Congress?'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''And that's why transparency and accountability are so important.''
 Republicans on Sunday also criticized the 2010 fiscal year budget of nearly $3.6 trillion that Mr. Obama unveiled last week.
 ''I think it's terrifying in the policy implications, as well as mind-boggling in the numbers,'' Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, the second-ranking Senate Republican, said on ''Fox News Sunday.''
 Mr. Orszag defended the president's budget, saying it provides tax cuts for 95 percent of working families, helps constrain health care costs and leaves ''the vast majority of American families much better off.''

HEADLINE: Schumer Seeks Federal Stimulus Funds to Jump-Start Moynihan Transit Project

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
State officials selected two developers nearly four years ago for a grand project to transform the James A. Farley Post Office into a transit hub that would serve as an annex to Pennsylvania Station, the country's busiest train station. Despite widespread support, the project has languished because of a lack of financing, political inertia, squabbles with transportation agencies and the developers' ambitions.
 Now, Senator Charles E. Schumer is calling for the injection of $100 million in federal stimulus funds to convert the post office building, expand the city's transportation infrastructure and employ thousands of workers. Mr. Schumer also renewed his call for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to take charge of the project and asked them to invest $1 billion. 
 Mr. Schumer said Amtrak should move to the Farley building from Penn Station; the latest proposal had called for relocating New Jersey Transit and the Long Island Rail Road there. 
 Either move would help relieve congestion at Penn Station, where 550,000 passengers a day make their way through cramped and confusing corridors. Amtrak, which operates the high-speed Acela trains in the Northeast, accounts for 62 percent of the combined air and rail market between New York and Washington.
 ''This is just what was envisioned by the stimulus: shovel-ready projects that generate a lot of jobs,'' Mr. Schumer said in an interview on Sunday. ''We want Amtrak to play the major role in the station. There is new funding that could help them do that. The focus is now on the station, letting private development follow rather than the other way around.''
 Mr. Schumer's proposal recognizes the inability of private developers in the current economic environment to advance the six office towers they had wanted to build as part of the train station project. At the same time, Mr. Schumer is trying to navigate roiling fiscal waters in which city, state and Port Authority officials are facing declining revenues and widening budget gaps.
 ''I think it's a terrific idea,'' said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association, a nonprofit planning group. ''There are a whole set of transportation investments that need to be made at the station. Obviously the real estate market will be flat for a while. But is $100 million enough to get the ball rolling? I don't know.''
 The project is named after Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who first suggested in the 1990s using the Farley building to create a grand transit entrance to New York, something he said had been missing since the demolition of the above-ground Penn Station in 1968.
 The Bloomberg administration and Gov. David A. Paterson seemed to endorse Mr. Schumer's proposal.
 ''A redeveloped Penn Station would have enormous benefits for the entire region and would absolutely be a terrific use of federal transportation funds,'' said Andrew Brent, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg.
 To avoid conflicts with the state and the city, Mr. Schumer did not call for the $100 million to come out of New York's $21 billion portion of the federal stimulus package. Instead, he took aim at the $8 billion set aside for high-speed rail service and $1.3 billion set aside for Amtrak. 
 Mr. Schumer said that the state's Congressional delegation, as well as Mayor Bloomberg and Governor Paterson, should pursue that money.
 But he also called on the Port Authority to contribute at least $1 billion. The authority, which had been eager to gain control of the Moynihan project, has seen a sharp drop in revenues from tolls on its bridge and tunnel crossings and a rise in the cost of rebuilding the World Trade Center.
 ''The senator's effort to get Moynihan started is consistent with the port's goal of developing a financially viable project,'' said Christopher O. Ward, executive director of the authority. ''The key is to work with Amtrak on an important transportation project for the entire region. Finding the necessary funding is our No. 1 priority.''
 The state has spent $230 million buying the blocklong Farley building, which sits across Eighth Avenue from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.
 Amtrak, which has endured budget cuts for years, is also eager to shore up its network, but it has been concerned about absorbing the estimated $15 million annual cost to operate at the Farley building. To offset those concerns, Mr. Schumer suggested that rent from new retailers at a new transit hub in the Farley building could go to Amtrak.
 The developers involved in the Moynihan project -- Stephen M. Ross, chief executive of Related Companies, and Steven Roth, chairman of Vornado Realty Trust -- also seemed to back the Schumer proposal. 
 ''I agree with this 100 percent,'' Mr. Ross said. ''This kind of transit project is a much greater stimulus than anything else that could be done in the city.''
 In 2005, the developers won a bidding contest to create a train annex at the Farley and to develop a nearby office tower. But the project quickly swelled, with the developers proposing a $14 billion development, which involved demolishing Madison Square Garden to make way for a new train station and a half-dozen office towers, while erecting a new Garden inside the Farley building.
 That project foundered because of its size and complexity, and Governor Paterson's plan to unveil a new proposal focusing on transportation improvements fell by the wayside amid negotiations over the state budget.

HEADLINE: Obama's Health Plan, Ambitious in Any Economy, Is Tougher in This One

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama's goal of remaking the health care system was always going to be difficult to reach. But as he prepares to begin a campaign for universal coverage this week, the ailing economy has complicated his task.
 Mr. Obama is proposing a major expansion of the federal commitment to health care even though the government can barely afford the health insurance programs it has. The financial condition of Medicare is deteriorating because of the recession, according to new information from federal officials, and the Medicare trust fund could be depleted several years sooner than expected.
 As he gears up for a week focused on health care, Mr. Obama hopes to turn the economic crisis to his advantage by citing the burden of health costs and the growing ranks of the uninsured, now at 46 million people, to justify a shake-up. 
 ''Health costs are exploding,'' said Melody C. Barnes, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House. ''We are in a crisis. The circumstances are dire. That's driving people to conclude that we have to come up with a solution, and the time is now.'' 
 Mr. Obama has already won a gigantic economic stimulus bill, persuaded Congress to free up hundreds of billions more for the financial bailout and proposed a budget that in normal times would be attacked as fiscally reckless. Through it all, his popular standing has held up.
 On Monday, Mr. Obama is expected to introduce Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas as his pick for health and human services secretary. At a White House conference on Thursday, he will outline the basics of a plan to make affordable coverage available to all, and then invite Congress to fill in the details. He used a similar strategy on the stimulus legislation, inviting criticism from some quarters.
 The powerful interests that dominate the health care industry could challenge even Mr. Obama's political deftness. To pay for any new plan, he would tax upper-income households and require new ''efficiencies'' in health care. He has also proposed cutting federal payments to hospitals, insurers, drug companies and home health agencies, and that could turn powerful groups against him. 
 Lobbyists for the industry say they are torn between their impulse to work with the president to win universal coverage and the need to fight against deep cuts. They are already on guard because of Medicare's precarious condition, warning the administration not to try to mend the program by reducing their payments. 
 ''We support the president in his desire to bring the benefit of health care coverage to all Americans,'' said Val J. Halamandaris, president of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, a trade group. ''But it must not be accomplished on the backs of the homebound elderly who are so sick with multiple complex medical problems.''
 Administration officials say Medicare's financial problems reflect the larger problems plaguing the overall health care system and stem from a common source: the relentlessly rising costs of health care. For this reason, Mr. Obama contends, ''we can't solve Medicare in isolation from the broader problems of the health care system,'' and ''comprehensive health care reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come.''
 Ms. Barnes, the White House aide, said Mr. Obama would bring ''all the relevant players together'' at the White House on Thursday. ''Nobody will own the table, but everyone will be around it,'' she said. ''There will be people at the table who in the past were opponents of health care reform.''
 John C. Rother, policy director of AARP, the lobby for older Americans, said: ''The purpose of the White House forum is to launch the whole health reform initiative -- not to unveil a detailed plan, but to reinforce the need for change. It's an opportunity for Obama to take ownership of the issue again.''
 Mr. Obama's efforts have been hampered by delays in naming a secretary of health and human services to lead the campaign for universal coverage. His first nominee, Tom Daschle, withdrew on Feb. 3 after disclosing that he had belatedly paid more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest. Ms. Sebelius accepted Mr. Obama's offer to take the post on Saturday.
 Democrats in Congress said they looked forward to working with Ms. Sebelius. Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat who is the chairman of the Finance Committee, said she had ''solid experience'' as a state insurance commissioner and former president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. As a Democratic governor in a Republican state, she also has experience working across the aisle.
 Mr. Obama has set forth eight ''principles for health care reform,'' with which few would disagree. Rather than drafting his own legislative proposal, Ms. Barnes said, the president will work with Congress ''in a collaborative way,'' allowing lawmakers to write most of the specific provisions.
 ''It's important to be flexible and pragmatic about this,'' she said.
 The White House event is likely to include an element of political theater. ''One purpose is to have real people come in and tell their tales of woe,'' said a health lawyer who strongly supports the president's effort.
 But the event is also meant to galvanize members of Congress, especially those who have been waiting for a signal from the White House.
 Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the New Jersey Democrat who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said he would begin a series of hearings within days after the White House forum. ''We have been looking for guidance from the administration,'' Mr. Pallone said in an interview.
 For example, Mr. Pallone asked: Does the president favor an ''individual mandate,'' requiring all Americans to carry health insurance? Or should the requirement apply just to children at first, as Mr. Obama said in the campaign? Will Mr. Obama insist that the government offer a new public plan, to compete with private insurers? Insurance companies adamantly oppose that idea.
 In the Senate, Democrats have been working for months on comprehensive health legislation. 
 In November, one week after the election, Mr. Baucus unveiled a detailed proposal to guarantee health insurance for all. Aides to Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, have been meeting twice a week with lobbyists for consumers, doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and employers, in search of a consensus.
 On Thursday, Mr. Baucus will meet with members of his committee to set a timeline for work on health legislation. He may move in tandem with the health committee, led by Mr. Kennedy.
 Mr. Kennedy, who is in Florida battling brain cancer, spoke to Mr. Obama about health legislation last week. Aides said it was not clear if Mr. Kennedy would attend the White House forum.
 In their annual report last April, Medicare trustees estimated that Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund, a widely watched barometer of the program's financial health, would be depleted in 2019. But Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, now says the recession will speed exhaustion of the trust fund by as much as three years.
 Most of the money in the trust fund comes from payroll taxes. Because of the recession, Mr. Foster said, unemployment has been higher than expected, and wage growth slower, so payroll tax revenues have been lower.

HEADLINE: Recession Leaves State Vulnerable To Poaching

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM and PATRICK McGEEHAN; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
When Pepsi executives came to Gov. David A. Paterson's Manhattan offices in late October, they wanted to head off an expansion of bottle deposit requirements to noncarbonated drinks.
 They left the meeting thinking the governor was sympathetic to the concerns of one of his state's largest corporations and that the discussion would continue. But two weeks later, Mr. Paterson included the expanded deposit requirements in a deficit reduction plan; later, he proposed an 18 percent tax on nondiet sodas without giving the company a heads up. 
 Now Pepsi is weighing a searing response: moving the headquarters of the Pepsi Bottling Group and more than 1,000 jobs, from Somers, in Westchester County, to Connecticut, which has been dangling a roughly $30 million incentive package. 
 In the eyes of many executives and lobbyists, the handling of Pepsi exemplifies the kind of fumbled communications that have plagued the Paterson administration for months. 
 But it also underscores New York's growing vulnerability to cross-border poaching of businesses as states try to mitigate the ravages of recession, experts say. 
 As unemployment and commercial vacancy rates have risen in places like Stamford, Conn., and Morris County, N.J., officials in those states have stepped up efforts to lure New York companies. 
 New Jersey's governor, Jon S. Corzine, has proposed spending $150 million a year to attract larger businesses that promise to create at least 200 jobs in certain urban areas served by commuter train lines. New Jersey recently offered a 10-year subsidy package worth $74.6 million to the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation in Lower Manhattan, which is considering moving. And in December, the state granted $16.5 million in incentives to Tullett Prebon, a British financial company whose main American operations are in Manhattan. The company has promised to move 330 jobs to New Jersey. 
 Connecticut officials say they are in discussions with several New York companies, but declined to provide details. 
 Those discussions have infuriated Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who complained publicly about New Jersey's efforts in a news conference last month. And they have been sharply criticized by some economists, who assert that such incentives mainly benefit established companies with lobbying clout and are not very effective in creating new jobs. 
 ''Propping up the big guys and helping them stay big doesn't really promote economic growth,'' said Kevin C. Gillen, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He said much job growth comes from small businesses and fledgling companies.
 Multiyear tax-abatement programs are often ineffective, Mr. Gillen said, because ''they tend to work a lot better in the short term than the long term and often wind up being used to retain employers rather than to attract new firms.'' 
 Officials in Connecticut and New Jersey -- both of which, like New York, are facing deep budget deficits because of declining tax revenues -- say they are not singling out New York companies. But they acknowledge that they are talking to companies that are looking for lower taxes and rents. 
 ''Connecticut is not actively out there knocking on doors in New York recruiting, but we do have a lot of activity coming from New York,'' said Holly Campo De La Vera, executive director of the Office of Business and Industry Development for the State of Connecticut. ''A lot of businesses are coming to Connecticut particularly when their leases are running out.''
 In New Jersey, Jerold L. Zaro, the chief of New Jersey's Office of Economic Growth, was not coy about acknowledging the state's efforts to poach jobs from nearby states. ''We are talking with any number of major companies -- in Pennsylvania, in Delaware, in Maryland and, yes, in New York -- we make no bones about that,'' he said.
 ''He's given me quite an arsenal,'' Mr. Zaro said, referring to Mr. Corzine. ''We have changed our tax laws dramatically to be more business-friendly.''
 In Albany, however, some officials and business executives say the Paterson administration, reeling from a number of recent missteps, has been too poorly managed to respond effectively. 
 On Wednesday, Mr. Paterson overhauled his staff, and he has promised to rededicate himself to righting his administration. But in the meantime, the disarray in the administration, and the governor's tendency to tell people what they want to hear, has bewildered many businesses, including Pepsi.
 ''We were definitely surprised by the rollout of these proposals and, quite frankly, we've been confused by some of the mixed messages that we've been receiving from the governor's office,'' said Jeff Dahncke, a spokesman for the Pepsi Bottling Group, referring to the bottle deposit and soda tax proposals. 
 ''The recent developments have had a chilling effect on the discussions and haven't enhanced the attractiveness of New York State in any way,'' Mr. Dahncke said, adding that the company preferred to remain in New York, but that negotiations with the state over the group's headquarters were ''at a standstill.'' 
 ''The governor's office has worked tirelessly to keep Pepsi Bottling Group and its jobs from moving to Connecticut,'' Risa B. Heller, a spokeswoman for Mr. Paterson, said. ''Pepsi is a great company, and we are working closely with them to address any issues or concerns that they have.'' 
 PepsiCo, based in Purchase, N.Y., owns a 40 percent stake in the bottling group, which was spun off in 1999, and leases space at its headquarters in Somers. The companies have a joint government relations team and share a lobbyist. 
 Pepsi and the state have been negotiating over an incentive package aimed at keeping the company in New York, while also discussing their policy differences.
 After the October meeting with the governor, Pepsi executives met in December with William J. Cunningham III, then the governor's top deputy. Again, they left the meeting feeling that their voices had been heard, but were shocked to read in media accounts a few days later that the governor would propose his tax on nondiet sodas, one of the most aggressive pieces of anti-obesity legislation in the nation. 
 Pepsi officials said they had no idea the proposal was even being discussed, and neither did state economic development officials negotiating with Pepsi. 
 ''Being upset would be an understatement -- it was stunned,'' said one person with knowledge of the discussions, who was granted anonymity because of the intricacies of the talks between Pepsi and the state.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat, said, ''It's never effective or helpful when companies play a locational card, and we're working cooperatively with the governor and with Pepsi to make sure the right thing happens.''
 Some experts and officials say that as the recession trickles down from New York's once-mighty financial institutions to other parts of the economy, more businesses may be tempted to leave the state -- and that New York may feel compelled to enter bidding wars to keep them. 
 Amid growing worries about an exodus of corporate tenants from Manhattan, the Real Estate Board of New York, a powerful organization representing landlords and developers, has had a series of recent meetings with the Bloomberg administration to push a proposal to market the benefits of New York City, as well as provide companies incentives to stay. 
 The administration's longstanding policy has been to offer incentives to companies that add new jobs, rather than subsidize businesses' laying off employees. Landlords claim that may not be enough. 
 ''There is a need for some gestures to tenants,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board. ''We ought to hold onto what we got.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Says Iran Has Enough Material to Construct an Atomic Bomb

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States now believes that Iran has amassed enough uranium that with further purification could be used to build an atomic bomb, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff declared Sunday. 
 The statement by the chairman, Adm. Mike Mullen, went further than previous, official judgments of the Iranian nuclear threat, and it essentially confirmed a new report by the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, which found that Iran had enough nuclear material for a bomb.
 ''We think they do, quite frankly,'' Admiral Mullen said on ''State of the Union'' on CNN. ''And Iran having a nuclear weapon, I've believed for a long time, is a very, very bad outcome for the region and for the world.''
 The International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations agency, reported Feb. 19 that its inspectors had found that Iran understated by a third how much uranium it had enriched.
 In its study, the agency declared for the first time that the amount of low-enriched uranium that Tehran had stockpiled, estimated at more than a ton, was sufficient to make an atomic bomb, but only with added purification. 
 Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, also appearing on a Sunday television talk show, emphasized that Iran still lacked the ability to build a nuclear arsenal rapidly.
 ''They're not close to a stockpile,'' Mr. Gates said on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC. ''They're not close to a weapon at this point. And so, there is some time.''
 The Obama administration came to office expressing a desire to increase the dialogue with Iran; disclosures of the new assessments will be likely to add urgency and difficulty to that effort. Iran insists that its nuclear program is for the peaceful pursuit of energy supplies.
 Mr. Gates underscored the opportunities for diplomatic efforts to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, especially with the drop in oil prices and broader global economic pressures.
 ''The question is whether you can increase the level of the sanctions and the cost to the Iranians of pursuing that program, at the same time you show them an open door if they want to engage with the Europeans, with us and so on if they walk away from that program,'' Mr. Gates said.
 ''There are economic costs to this program,'' he added. ''They do have economic challenges at home.''
 The Obama administration is deep into a series of foreign and national security policy reviews, including how to manage relations with Iran, which overlaps with how Washington deals with other foreign partners and rivals.
 For example, a view is emerging within the administration of a possible way to link a compromise on missile defense with Russia to diplomatic progress in halting Iran's nuclear program.
 The United States says its planned missile defense sites in Poland and the Czech Republic are needed to guard against a potential Iranian nuclear attack, while Russia vehemently complains that those systems are designed to thwart the Russian arsenal.
 Obama administration officials may propose that if Russia wants the United States to rethink its plans for building two missile defense sites in Europe, then the Kremlin must do more to help halt Iran's nuclear program.

 AFTER COUNTERFEITING CRACKDOWN,
 Beijing Vendors Fight Back
 Managers of Beijing's famous Silk Street Market temporarily shut down 29 stalls over the past month for selling counterfeit goods.

 CLINTON PLEDGES AID FOR GAZA
 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her first foray into Middle East diplomacy, landed in Sharm el Sheik, a Red Sea resort, carrying a pledge of $300 million for war-torn Gaza. Mrs. Clinton is to present the aid on Monday at an international donors' conference convened by Egypt. PAGE A9 
 OLMERT FACING INDICTMENT
 Israel's attorney general announced that he intended to indict the departing prime minister, Ehud Olmert, in a corruption case involving a Long Island businessman, Morris Talansky. Also, Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, visited Gaza as the international representative for Palestinian development. PAGE A9 
 Mazatlan Journal
 Among the Kingpins
 Although Mazatlan, Mexico, markets itself as a seaside paradise, it is a beach resort with a dark side, one that enterprising taxi drivers are exploiting the with unauthorized ''narco-tours,'' in which visitors pay for a glimpse of the vacation homes and favorite hangouts of notorious drug traffickers.

 U.S. MUSLIMS THRIVING,
 But Not Content, Poll Says
 A Gallup poll of Muslims in the United States has found that they are far more likely than people in Muslim countries to see themselves as thriving. And yet Muslims are the least content religious group within the United States when compared with Protestants, Roman Catholics, Mormons and Jews, according to the poll. PAGE A11

 Sticking With Risk
 President Obama and his closest aides continue to embrace a pattern of risk, even if it startles official Washington. As his campaign manager, David Plouffe, put it last fall, ''We are always better off on the high wire.'' PAGE A14 
 REMAKING HEALTH CARE AMID CRISIS
 As he begins to remake the healthcare system, President Obama hopes to turn the economic crisis to his advantage by citing the burden of health costs and the growing ranks of the uninsured, now at 46 million people, to justify a shake-up. PAGE A14 
 White House Memo
 Entertaining, Obama-Style
 A star-studded tribute to Stevie Wonder in the East Room of the White House was part of an effort by President Obama and his wife, Michelle, to throw open the doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, giving it a far livelier feel than during the twilight of the Bush administration. But the open-door policy is not just frivolity; it is an exercise in presidential image-making. PAGE A15

 RECESSION LEAVES STATE VULNERABLE TO POACHING
 PepsiCo said it might move the headquarters of the Pepsi Bottling Group and more than 1,000 jobs from Westchester County to Connecticut after Gov. David A. Paterson did not head off an expansion of bottle deposit requirements to noncarbonated drinks. The episode underscores New York's vulnerability to cross-border poaching of businesses as states try to mitigate the ravages of recession, experts say. PAGE A17

 Byrne Songs, New and Old
 The album that David Byrne made with Brian Eno, ''Everything That Happens Will Happen Today,'' was reason for a tour. But something went wrong with ''Songs of David Byrne and Brian Eno'' at Radio City Music Hall. What was once startling became cute, Jon Pareles writes. PAGE C5 
 A TASTE OF 'ASTRAL WEEKS'
 Van Morrison's concert at the WaMu Theater at Madison Square Garden, a tribute to ''Astral Weeks,'' his best-regarded album, was not quite a celebration. Nor was it a re-evaluation. Instead, Jon Caramanica writes, it often felt like obligation. PAGE C5 
 ORCHESTRAL NIGHT FOR 2 INDIE BANDS
 The indie-rock bands Final Fantasy, from Toronto, and Grizzly Bear, from Brooklyn, both traffic in meticulous layers and shifting textures. So neither was on shaky ground in their concert with the Brooklyn Philharmonic, Nate Chinen writes. PAGE C7 
 SPORTS
 THE GAME THEY LOVE,
 And the Source of Family Rifts
 The Barons are the first family of Rhode Island basketball. Jim is the head coach at the University of Rhode Island, which is angling for an N.C.A.A. tournament berth. Jimmy is a senior star on the team, and its captain. Billy is a high school star and a serious college prospect. But their hardwood obsession is the source of deep tension in their household, with Cindy Baron, above, Jim's wife and the players' mother, caught in the middle. PAGE D1
 31 PITCHES, HUNDREDS OF SIGHS
 Johan Santana, the Mets ace, threw 31 pitches in a bullpen session at spring training, and he looked comfortable enough on the mound to ease the team's worries about his surgically repaired elbow. PAGE D3

 As a member of the United States team for the World Baseball Classic, Derek Jeter will play against the Yankees in a warm-up exhibition game at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla. ''It will probably feel like an intrasquad game,'' he said. PAGE D3
 AS IF HE NEVER LEFT
 Martin Brodeur's second game back for the Devils was supposed to be his first strenuous test after missing four months due to elbow surgery. But the team easily handled the Flyers, 3-0, and Brodeur earned his 100th career shutout and 547th victory -- putting him three shutouts and four victories short of the N.H.L. records. PAGE D4

 STRESS TESTING THE BANKS
 On Wednesday, the Treasury Department released more details of its plan to stress test the nation's 19 largest banks to see just how short of capital they would be if the recession worsened. Conceptually, the test makes sense. In practice, however, it could be yet one more step toward a seemingly endless string of bailouts that do not stop the bleeding, stabilize the banks -- or adequately protect taxpayers. PAGE A22
 THE RIGHT TO DNA EVIDENCE

 Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's trip to Tokyo suggests that Washington views Japan as a powerful nation. But Masaru Tamamoto, senior fellow at the World Policy Institute, argues in an Op-Ed article that his country is in the doldrums -- and that the problem is mainly psychological. To renew itself, Japan will have to get over both its fear of outsiders and its love of stability. PAGE A23

 FOOD MAGAZINES ADJUST
 The March cover of Gourmet, a magazine customarily devoted to high-end eating, featured a startling guest: a ham sandwich (albeit a fancy ham sandwich). In a bad economy, food magazines are focusing more on budget eating. Readers seem to like it. But advertisers seem unmoved. And in a crowded market every franchise may not emerge on the other side.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 4, 2009

 CORRECTION:
A capsule summary on Monday for a sports article about goalie Martin Brodeur's 100th career shutout for the Devils misstated the timing of that accomplishment. It came in his third N.H.L. game after returning from elbow surgery, not his second game.

HEADLINE: Clinton Packs Heavy, Bringing Cash and Caution, for Trip to Israel and West Bank

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: SHARM EL SHEIK, Egypt 

 BODY:
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, in her first foray into Middle East diplomacy, landed in this Red Sea resort on Sunday, carrying a pledge of $300 million for war-torn Gaza.
 Mrs. Clinton is to present the humanitarian aid on Monday at an international donors' conference convened by Egypt -- possibly the simplest part of a visit shadowed by deep mutual distrust between Israelis and Palestinians and the still-unresolved political situation in Israel.
 On Tuesday and Wednesday, Mrs. Clinton will travel to Jerusalem and the West Bank, as the Obama administration shows it is determined to pursue robust, sustained peacemaking efforts, after years of neglect and belated engagement on the part of the Bush administration. 
 The United States has promised an additional $600 million to the Palestinian Authority to cover a budget shortfall and bolster the Palestinian economy. Some of that money may also end up in Gaza, large parts of which are in ruins after Israel's military assault on the militant group Hamas. But much of it will go to the West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority is in control.
 ''Everyone is in agreement that we need to shore up the Palestinian Authority,'' said Robert A. Wood, the acting State Department spokesman. ''We don't want that money to go through Hamas.''
 As the United States tries to give new momentum to the peace process, the role of Hamas remains a sticking point. Several European countries are more open to dealing with the group, provided it becomes part of a so-called unity government with the Palestinian Authority.
 The United States and Israel, however, will not deal with Hamas, saying it is a terrorist organization bent on the destruction of Israel. And Israel has kept border crossings to Hamas-controlled Gaza closed -- prompting criticism that it is blocking desperately needed relief.
 ''The big question is, What is U.S. policy toward Hamas?'' said Martin Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel who advised Mrs. Clinton on Arab-Israeli issues during her presidential campaign.
 Publicly, not much has changed. On Friday, Mrs. Clinton restated Washington's demand that Hamas renounce terrorism and recognize Israel as a condition for dealing with the United States.
 But the Obama administration is not discouraging talks between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas to form a unity government. A senior American official said that if such a government was formed, the United States would not rule out dealing with it, in some fashion.
 Such openness, Mr. Indyk said, would be a significant shift in policy from the Bush administration, which had focused on buttressing the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and isolating Hamas in Gaza.
 Administration officials cautioned, however, that the conditions remained hostile, with Hamas militants launching more rockets at Israeli towns. In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu may end up forming a narrow right-wing government, even less inclined to dealing with Hamas.
 With so little positive to talk about, Mrs. Clinton has been tight-lipped on this trip -- a contrast to her recent Asian tour, during which she seemed to revel in plain talk and spoke about delicate issues like the jockeying to succeed the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-il.
 Even the United States' pledge -- a headline number of more than $900 million -- is a hodgepodge of new money and commitments already made. Congress must approve at least a portion of it.
 ''Fortuitously, she's got a conference to go to,'' said Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator in the Clinton administration who now works at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. ''But a trip like this could easily highlight how gloomy the situation is.''
 Among the biggest challenges, he said, is opening the border crossings so that the aid can flow into Gaza. The United States has pressed Israel to relax its controls, with little success. The Israelis have barred concrete and other building materials, out of a fear that rebuilding would strengthen Hamas. Last week, there were reports that they had even stopped deliveries of pasta.
 Mr. Netanyahu, analysts said, is unlikely to relent on that approach once he forms a government, since it is popular with the Israeli public. After days of fitful coalition talks with Tzipi Livni, the leader of the Kadima party, Mr. Netanyahu seems most likely to form a right-wing coalition.
 Mr. Netanyahu has a checkered history with the Clintons. In 1996, when he last formed a government, he was bitter that the administration of President Clinton openly favored his opponent, Shimon Peres. This time, analysts predict, he will reach out to Mrs. Clinton with open arms.
 With so many impediments to an Israeli-Palestinian deal, analysts say the more promising avenue may be an opening to Syria. The State Department invited Syria's ambassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha, to a two-hour meeting on Thursday, which might serve as a first step toward engagement.

HEADLINE: Backed by Green Party, Comic Pastor Runs for Mayor

BYLINE: By REBECCA WHITE

 BODY:
Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping is -- to say the least -- not your typical candidate for mayor. With his blond pompadour, cobalt blue suit, black shirt and white collar, he made his announcement in Union Square on Sunday accompanied by a choir in green robes.
 But he has the nomination of an actual political party and might have a spot on the ballot in November, something Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has yet to secure. 
 ''Even if you have 20 billion dollars, you're not going to buy this election!'' he shouted through a white bullhorn to a small gathering of supporters and reporters. ''This campaign will be the revolt of the fabulous 500 neighborhoods, amen!''
 Reverend Billy, 58, a longtime street activist and performance artist whose real name is William C. Talen, said he was approached by leaders of the state's Green Party in December.
 He decided to run last month and received the nomination late last week. He now has to get at least 7,500 signatures to get on the ballot in November.
 ''When the Green Party approached him, he was thinking that Bloomberg was essentially purchasing a third term,'' said Michael O'Neil, 29, the campaign's press officer. ''He wanted to run because it seemed unlikely that any of the front-runners in the election would speak to the issues that have been challenging New York City's neighborhoods.''
 Reverend Billy, who according to Mr. O'Neil makes a living with paid appearances at colleges and other venues, said refocusing attention on the city's neighborhoods -- he used the word ''neighborhood'' dozens of times -- would be the centerpiece of his campaign, though he said little about other issues, like subway fares and the economic crisis. 
 He did make it clear that he did not approve of Mr. Bloomberg's pursuit of a third term. ''We're at a critical point in the city's history right now,'' he said. ''The mayor's trying to privatize Union Square. We're surrounded by logos everywhere. We need to oppose that.''
 Reverend Billy, who grew up in the Midwest and arrived in New York from San Francisco in 1994, has long been known for his colorful street-theater tirades on what he sees as corporate intrusions on American life. He was arrested during a protest in Union Square in 2007 and that year was the subject of the documentary ''What Would Jesus Buy?''
 But Gloria Mattera, the co-chairwoman of the Green Party's campaign committee, insisted that this was a serious candidacy. ''We're planning on talking in each borough,'' she said. ''Our team is already formed. This is a chance not just to stand up against Bloomberg but to stand up against corporate interests as well.''
 Mr. O'Neil said the campaign hoped to raise at least $250,000 to qualify for matching funds from the city. 
 ''He's the alternative that we're desperate for,'' said one supporter, Elizabeth Culbert, 34, a freelance writer who lives in the West Village. ''He's worked for so many years for New York, and I think he'll put up an extremely good fight.'' 
 Steve Kraftsow, 49, who was walking through Union Square during the rally, did not share that enthusiasm. ''Never met him, never heard of him,'' he said. ''I haven't even considered the mayoral race yet. What I know is I want a mayor who can handle the fiscal responsibilities. I liked Bloomberg, but vote for Billy? It's not out of the question. I just need to learn more about him.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 3, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Monday about the mayoral campaign of the street artist known as Reverend Billy of the Church of Stop Shopping misstated the age of the candidate's press officer and misspelled his surname at one point. As noted elsewhere in the article, he is Michael O'Neil, not O'Neill, and he is 29, not 30.

HEADLINE: Economy Down, Vermin Thrive

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WILSON

 BODY:
Brace yourselves for more fun news: Recessions, it turns out, while bad for humans, may be good for cockroaches and mice.
Veterans in the pest control industry said that their customers, both residential and commercial, appear to be sacrificing on regular exterminations. 
Robert Agatowski, with Control Exterminating Company on East 33rd Street in Manhattan, recalled a recent call from a general manager of a business.
''He said: 'It's very simple. I don't know if we can make the rent or the payroll,' '' Mr. Agatowski said. '' 'So in other words, you're out. We'll step on the bugs and kick the mice.' The exterminating almost becomes like a luxury item.''
He and other exterminators interviewed this week were careful not to name names.
''People are being penny-wise and pound-foolish,'' said Gil Bloom, with Standard Pest Management in Long Island City, Queens. ''Monitoring pest control is very much pest prevention. It's not just killing what's there today. One mouse, a month later, could easily be a dozen mice.''
Some exterminators said they were too busy to be hurt by any slowdown in the fight against roaches and mice. ''Business is a little lackluster, but they're able to keep above water because of the bedbug situation,'' said Leonard Douglen, executive director of the Pest Management Associations in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. ''I would be concerned about it if people start cutting down on that service, because it's essential. Especially in New York City.''
Restaurants do not have much leeway: If an inspection turns up pests or evidence of them, like rodent droppings, stiff fines follow.
''They end up spending as much as they would have spent if they'd maintained the whole time,'' said Jeff Eisenberg, president of PestAway Exterminating in Manhattan. ''You want to change your oil every month, or you want to spend the $700 for a whole new something or other?''
So far, so good: City health officials reported a slight decrease in pest-related violations from inspections in the last quarter of 2008, compared with the same period in 2007.
Exterminators said it was too soon to blame a slowdown in service calls solely on the recession, as the cold winter months were typically when people cut back. ''I've been doing this 17 years, so I know the cycles,'' Mr. Eisenberg said. ''I don't panic.''

HEADLINE: Rewards for Students Under a Microscope

BYLINE: By LISA GUERNSEY

 BODY:
For decades, psychologists have warned against giving children prizes or money for their performance in school. ''Extrinsic'' rewards, they say -- a stuffed animal for a 4-year-old who learns her alphabet, cash for a good report card in middle or high school -- can undermine the joy of learning for its own sake and can even lead to cheating.
But many economists and businesspeople disagree, and their views often prevail in the educational marketplace. Reward programs that pay students are under way in many cities. In some places, students can bring home hundreds of dollars for, say, taking an Advanced Placement course and scoring well on the exam.
Whether such efforts work or backfire ''continues to be a raging debate,'' said Barbara A. Marinak, an assistant professor of education at Penn State, who opposes using prizes as incentives. Among parents, the issue often stirs intense discussion. And in public education, a new focus on school reform has led researchers on both sides of the debate to intensify efforts to gather data that may provide insights on when and if rewards work. 
''We have to get beyond our biases,'' said Roland Fryer, an economist at Harvard University who is designing and testing several reward programs. ''Fortunately, the scientific method allows us to get to most of those biases and let the data do the talking.''
What is clear is that reward programs are proliferating, especially in high-poverty areas. In New York City and Dallas, high school students are paid for doing well on Advanced Placement tests. In New York, the payouts come from an education reform group called Rewarding Achievement (Reach for short), financed by the Pershing Square Foundation, a charity founded by the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. The Dallas program is run by Advanced Placement Strategies, a Texas nonprofit group whose chairman is the philanthropist Peter O'Donnell.
Another experiment was started last fall in 14 public schools in Washington that are distributing checks for good grades, attendance and behavior. That program, Capital Gains, is being financed by a partnership with SunTrust Bank, Borders and Ed Labs at Harvard, which is run by Dr. Fryer. Another program by Ed Labs is getting started in Chicago.
Other systems are about stuff more than money, and most are not evaluated scientifically. At 80 tutoring centers in eight states run by Score! Educational Centers, a national for-profit company run by Kaplan Inc., students are encouraged to rack up points for good work and redeem them for prizes like jump-ropes.
An increasing number of online educational games entice children to keep playing by giving them online currency to buy, say, virtual pets. And around the country, elementary school children get tokens to redeem at gift shops in schools when they behave well.
In the cash programs being studied, economists compare the academic performance of groups of students who are paid and students who are not. Results from the first year of the A.P. program in New York showed that test scores were flat but that more students were taking the tests, said Edward Rodriguez, the program's executive director.
In Dallas, where teachers are also paid for students' high A.P. scores, students who are rewarded score higher on the SAT and enroll in college at a higher rate than those who are not, according to Kirabo Jackson, an assistant professor of economics at Cornell who has written about the program for the journal Education Next.
Still, many psychologists warn that early data can be deceiving. Research suggests that rewards may work in the short term but have damaging effects in the long term.
One of the first such studies was published in 1971 by Edward L. Deci, a psychologist at the University of Rochester, who reported that once the incentives stopped coming, students showed less interest in the task at hand than those who received no reward.
This kind of psychological research was popularized by the writer Alfie Kohn, whose 1993 book ''Punished by Rewards: The Trouble With Gold Stars, Incentive Plans, A's, Praise and Other Bribes'' is still often cited by educators and parents. Mr. Kohn says he sees ''social amnesia'' in the renewed interest in incentive programs.
''If we're using gimmicks like rewards to try to improve achievement without regard to how they affect kids' desire to learn,'' he said, ''we kill the goose that laid the golden egg.''
Dr. Marinak, of Penn State, and Linda B. Gambrell, a professor of education at Clemson University, published a study last year in the journal Literacy Research and Instruction showing that rewarding third graders with so-called tokens, like toys and candy, diminished the time they spent reading.
''A number of the kids who received tokens didn't even return to reading at all,'' Dr. Marinak said.
Why does motivation seem to fall away? Some researchers theorize that even at an early age, children can sense that someone is trying to control their behavior. Their reaction is to resist. ''One of the central questions is to consider how children think about this,'' said Mark R. Lepper, a psychologist at Stanford whose 1973 study of 50 preschool-age children came to a conclusion similar to Dr. Deci's. ''Are they saying, 'Oh, I see, they are just bribing me'?''
More than 100 academic studies have explored how and when rewards work on people of all ages, and researchers have offered competing analyses of what the studies, taken together, really mean.
Judith Cameron, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Alberta, found positive traits in some types of reward systems. But in keeping with the work of other psychologists, her studies show that some students, once reward systems are over, will choose not to do the activity if the system provides subpar performers with a smaller prize than the reward for achievers.
Many cash-based programs being tested today, however, are designed to do just that. Dr. Deci asks educators to consider the effect of monetary rewards on students with learning disabilities. When they go home with a smaller payout while seeing other students receive checks for $500, Dr. Deci said, they may feel unfairly punished and even less excited to go to school.
''There are suggestions of students making in the thousands of dollars,'' he said. ''The stress of that, for kids from homes with no money, I frankly think it's unconscionable.''
Economists, on the other hand, argue that with students who are failing, everything should be tried, including rewards. While students may be simply attracted by financial incentives at first, couldn't that evolve into a love of learning?
''They may work a little harder and may find that they aren't so bad at it,'' said Dr. Jackson, of Cornell. ''And they may learn study methods that last over time.''
In examining rewards, the trick is untangling the impact of the monetary prizes from the impact of other factors, like the strength of teaching or the growing recognition among educators of the importance of A.P. tests. Dr. Jackson said his latest analyses, not yet published, would seek to answer the questions.
He also pointed out that with children in elementary school, who typically show more motivation to learn than teenagers do, the outcomes may be different.
Questions about how rewards are administered, to whom and at what age are likely to drive future research. Can incentives -- praise, grades, pizza parties, cash -- be added up to show that the more, the better? Or will some of them detract from the whole?
Dr. Deci says school systems are trying to lump incentives together as if they had a simple additive effect. He emphasizes that there is a difference between being motivated by something tangible and being motivated by something that is felt or sensed. ''We've taken motivation and put it in categories,'' Dr. Deci said of his fellow psychologists. ''Economics is 40 years behind with respect to that.''
Some researchers suggest tweaking reward systems to cause less harm. Dr. Lepper says that the more arbitrary the reward -- like giving bubble gum for passing a test -- the more likely it is to backfire. Dr. Gambrell, of Clemson, posits a ''proximity hypothesis,'' holding that rewards related to the activity -- like getting to read more books if one book is read successfully -- are less harmful. And Dr. Deci and Richard M. Ryan report that praise -- which some consider a verbal reward -- does not have a negative effect.
In fact, praise itself has categories. Carol Dweck, a Stanford psychologist, has found problems with praise that labels a child as having a particular quality (''You're so smart''), while praise for actions (''You're working hard'') is more motivating.
Psychologists have also found that it helps to isolate differences in how children perceive tasks. Are they highly interested in what they are doing? Or does it feel like drudgery? ''The same reward system might have a different effect on those two types of students,'' Dr. Lepper said. The higher the interest, he said, the more harmful the reward.
Meanwhile, Dr. Fryer of Ed Labs urges patience in awaiting the economists' take on reward systems. He wants to look at what happens over many years by tracking subjects after incentives end and trying to discern whether the incentives have an impact on high school graduation rates.
With the money being used to pay for the incentive programs and research, ''every dollar has value,'' he said. ''We either get social science or social change, and we need both.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Likely to Keep the Reins On 2 Fallen Mortgage Giants

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG

 BODY:
Despite assurances that the takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be temporary, the giant mortgage companies will most likely never fully return to private hands, lawmakers and company executives are beginning to quietly acknowledge.
The possibility that these companies -- which together touch over half of all mortgages in the United States -- could remain under tight government control is shaping the broader debate over the future of the financial industry. The worry is that if the government cannot or will not extricate itself from Fannie and Freddie, it will face similar problems should it eventually nationalize some large banks.
The lesson, many fear, is that a takeover so hobbles a company's finances and decision making that independence may be nearly impossible. 
In the last six weeks alone, the Obama administration has essentially transformed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into arms of the federal government. Regulators have ordered the companies to oversee a vast new mortgage modification program, to buy greater numbers of loans, to refinance millions of at-risk homeowners and to loosen internal policies so they can work with more questionable borrowers.
Lawmakers have given the companies access to as much as $400 billion in taxpayer dollars, a sum more than twice as large as the pledges to Citigroup, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, General Motors, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined.
Regulators defend those actions as essential to battling the economic crisis. Indeed, Fannie and Freddie are basically the only lubricants in the housing market at this point.
But those actions have caused collateral damage at the companies. On Monday, Freddie Mac's chief executive, David M. Moffett, unexpectedly resigned less than six months after he was recruited by regulators, having chafed at low pay and the burdens of second-guessing by government officials, according to people with knowledge of the situation.
Fannie Mae has also experienced a wave of defections as people leave for better-paying and less scrutinized jobs.
Last week, Fannie Mae announced that it lost $58.7 billion in 2008, more than all its net profits since 1992. Freddie Mac is also expected to reveal record losses in coming days.
Most important, by taking over the companies, lawmakers have gained a lever over the housing market and national economy that many -- particularly Democrats -- are loath to discard, legislators say.
''Once government gets a new tool, it's virtually impossible to take it away,'' said Representative Scott Garrett, a Republican of New Jersey and member of the Financial Services banking subcommittee. ''And Fannie and Freddie are now tools of the government.''
One reason that Fannie and Freddie will never return to their earlier forms is simple mathematics: to become independent, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must repay the taxpayer dollars invested in the companies, plus interest. Even if the firms achieve profitability, it could take them as long as 100 years -- or longer -- to pay back the government. And almost no one expects the companies to return to profitability anytime soon.
Moreover, the takeover has provided legislators with a long-sought ability to influence the mortgage marketplace directly and pursue social goals like low-income housing.
''There is a commitment to restructure these companies, and we are going to want to retain a hand in the things that matter, like affordable housing and making sure that the housing economy doesn't become a threat to the entire economy again,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ''Some of what these companies did will be returned to the private sector, and some of it is going to remain with a public entity.''
Republican lawmakers -- many of whom believe the federal government should not be involved in the mortgage business at all -- have signaled they will try to end the government's involvement with Fannie and Freddie, even as they acknowledge that effort is likely to fail.
And lawmakers of all stripes are quietly voicing worries that government involvement in the mortgage industry could lead to the very problems that caused the current crisis.
''When you use mortgage companies for political purposes, such as helping low-income borrowers or expanding homeownership, you make bad economic decisions,'' said Mr. Garrett, the Republican congressman. ''And bad economic decisions are why we're in this trouble right now.''
Analysts say that one reason Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were privatized in the first place was to prevent political whims from dominating the mortgage marketplace. The companies were founded by the government but sold to investors decades ago.
''The theory was that if Fannie and Freddie were private, they would only be interested in profits, and so they wouldn't take too many risks,'' said Thomas A. Lawler, an economist who worked at Fannie Mae for more than two decades before leaving in 2006 to become a consultant. ''If the government owns Fannie and Freddie, politicians will make choices that make voters happy, but may not be wise from an economic standpoint.
''Of course, the past year has proved that focusing on profits alone doesn't protect you from bad choices, either,'' Mr. Lawler added.
Lawmakers are quietly discussing a handful of possible proposals for Fannie and Freddie. They range from outright nationalization, in which the government would formally absorb the companies and guarantee millions of new home loans, to public-private hybrids, in which lawmakers would explicitly backstop part of the mortgage industry if economic catastrophe strikes, and would dissolve Fannie and Freddie into smaller, private companies that would handle the day-to-day business of mortgage finance, but be heavily regulated.
Lawmakers say they are unlikely to begin serious discussion about the companies' futures until this fall.

HEADLINE: Grass-Roots Uprising Against River Dam Challenges Tokyo

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

 BODY:
HITOYOSHI, Japan -- First, the farmers objected to an ambitious dam project proposed by the government, saying they did not need irrigation water from the reservoir. Then the commercial fishermen complained that fish would disappear if the Kawabe River's twisting torrents were blocked. Environmentalists worried about losing the river's scenic gorges. Soon, half of this city's 34,000 residents had signed a petition opposing the $3.6 billion project.
In September, this rare grassroots uprising scored an even rarer victory when the governor of Kumamoto prefecture, a mountainous area of southern Japan, formally asked Tokyo to suspend construction. The Construction Ministry agreed, temporarily halting an undertaking that had already relocated a half-dozen small villages, though work on the dam itself had not started. 
The suspension grabbed national headlines as one of the first times a local governor had succeeded in blocking a megaproject being built by the central government. It also turned the governor, Ikuo Kabashima, into a new emblem of a broader rethinking of Japan's highly centralized style of government, in which Tokyo's powerful ministries have held a tight grip on decision making all the way down to local levels.
''We can't cower before the central government,'' said Mr. Kabashima, a former politics professor.
The apparent victory brought a flurry of similar revolts by other regional governments against big public works projects. In November, four prefectural governments in the western Kansai region requested the cancellation of a planned dam, and last month the governor of Niigata prefecture refused to help pay for a new bullet train line. The governor of Osaka said the city would not finance a new bridge to an airport.
This backlash is partly a result of tighter budgets during the current economic crisis. But it also reflects how Japan's long stagnation has brought growing criticism of the old top-down model, and efforts by regional leaders to change it.
Sensing the shift in political winds, even Japan's long-governing Liberal Democratic Party, which ran the old regime along with powerful bureaucrats, has jumped on the decentralization bandwagon. The administration of Prime Minister Taro Aso says it wants to draw up a bill as early as this year that would eventually replace Japan's 47 relatively weak prefectures with 9 to 13 larger entities that would have powers roughly analogous to American state governments.
It is unclear how realistic the proposal is, given Mr. Aso's own unpopularity and intense opposition within the party and the bureaucracy. But the fact the idea emerged at all underscores how the Kawabe River Dam's suspension has helped rekindle the debate here over whether to hand more power to localities.
''The Kawabe River Dam is a symbol that Tokyo cannot just impose its will on the regions anymore,'' said Yoshihiro Katayama, a political professor at Keio University and former governor of Tottori prefecture. ''Public opinion is shifting against the central government and its missteps.''
In planning the Kawabe River Dam, the government tried to brush aside local doubts about dams going back to an accident 44 years ago when the sudden release of water from a smaller dam during heavy rainfall caused a flash flood that killed one person in Hitoyoshi, in Kumamoto prefecture.
The suspension also drew national attention because citizen groups played a large role, something unusual in a country used to following Tokyo's lead. Local environmentalist groups, backed by farmers, fishermen and operators of rafting trips on the river's rapids, demanded greater openness in decisions traditionally made behind closed doors between politicians and central government bureaucrats. They challenged the Construction Ministry's arguments that the dam, which was first proposed in the 1960s, was needed for irrigation and flood control.
Under pressure from these groups and prefectural officials, the Construction Ministry made a rare concession, agreeing to hold public hearings to explain the dam and hear residents' concerns. Some of the hearings devolved into shouting matches between dam opponents and construction industry workers who wanted the jobs, residents said.
In the end, the ministry appeared unable to present a convincing rationale for the project, and opinion polls show that around 85 percent of voters in the prefecture now oppose the dam.
''People realized they could speak up against the national government,'' said Nobutaka Tanaka, mayor of Hitoyoshi, who won office two years ago on an anti-dam platform. ''In the old days, if officials said it was for the nation, everyone felt they had to be silent and accept it.''
An overreliance on public works spending has also created a huge burden for local governments, which are required to pay a third of the cost of national infrastructure projects. And now, with municipal budgets under increasing strain, local governments are demanding a bigger voice in spending decisions.
Japan's prefectural and municipal governments are now saddled with some $2.1 trillion in outstanding debt, substantially below the national government's $6.5 trillion but still the equivalent of 39 percent of Japan's entire economy, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. By contrast, state and local government debt in the United States totals about 16 percent of the American economy, according to the Census Bureau.
Early this decade, independent governors in strapped prefectures began opposing public works dictated by Tokyo. The reformist former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi also shifted some tax revenues and fiscal responsibilities to local governments. But never has a local government tried to stop a project as large as the Kawabe River Dam. The backlash has put the powerful Construction Ministry on the defensive. The ministry agreed to a sweeping review of all its dam projects, saying it would make a final decision on the Kawabe River Dam by year's end.
''They paint us as the bad guys who want big projects,'' complained Yasushi Kaneko, the Construction Ministry's senior vice minister, a Kumamoto native who said the Kawabe River Dam was needed for flood control.
Governor Kabashima, who won election last year as a conservative backed by the Liberal Democrats, said he was on the fence about the dam until he saw the depth of public opposition.
He said that his request to suspend the dam was not a rejection of public works, which Kumamoto still depends on for jobs. Nor is it about saving money, since he said the prefecture would have to spend heavily to clean up the unfinished construction.
''Kasumigaseki's self-confidence is down,'' Mr. Kabashima said, referring to the district in Tokyo where the national ministries are located. ''Now is the time for Japan to decentralize.''

HEADLINE: A Hurdle for Health Reform: Patients and Their Doctors

BYLINE: By TARA PARKER-POPE. 
Join the discussion at nytimes.com/well.

 BODY:
Recently, I went to the drugstore to fill a prescription. Instead, I left with a costly lesson in health care economics.
 At the checkout, I was surprised when the clerk billed me for $100 instead of my usual small co-payment. It was only then that I realized my doctor had traded me up to a costly branded migraine drug, even though the old drug had worked just fine. And I had allowed it.
 As a conversation about health care reform intensifies in Washington, much of the focus is on the role the government and insurance companies will play in a revamped health system. But surprisingly little attention has been paid to the role that patients and their doctors have played in shaping the way medical care is delivered. 
 Ultimately, for any reform to work, patients will have to change their behavior. Of course, everyone should continue to demand the best possible care. But we will have to accept that ''best'' doesn't always mean the newest drug or the latest treatment. The looming question is whether patients are ready to embrace the realities of reform.
 ''You can make policy changes till you're blue in the face, but if patients and doctors don't change the way they think about medicine, we'll never change medicine,'' said Dr. David Newman, an emergency medicine physician at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York and the author of ''Hippocrates' Shadow: Secrets From the House of Medicine'' (Simon & Schuster, 2008). ''If everybody at the ground level believes that prescriptions and procedures are the things we need to make us healthy and well, then it doesn't matter what kind of policy you draft or what kind of system you build. It's never going to get better.''
 Americans spend $2.5 trillion a year on health care, or about $8,160 per person, more than twice as much as many countries in Europe. But we clearly aren't getting our money's worth. Today, 46 million Americans aren't covered, and measures like life expectancy and maternal and childhood health lag far behind those of many developed nations and even less-developed ones.
 At the heart of reform is a plan to cut costs, in part by trying to discern which treatments really work. President Obama's economic stimulus plan includes $1.1 billion for studies that will ask basic questions about the comparative effectiveness of expensive procedures versus less expensive ones. For instance, with certain kinds of injuries, does surgery work better than physical therapy? Are costly new drugs any more effective than their generic predecessors?
 Dr. Harold Varmus, the president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and a former director of the National Institutes of Health, said increasing public access to the findings of medical research would be important for health care reform to succeed.
 ''One obvious goal is getting information out to health care practitioners about effectiveness experiments,'' said Dr. Varmus, a Nobel Prize-winning cancer biologist and the author of the new book ''The Art and Politics of Science'' (Norton). ''This is going to be crucial, because if the government's going to spend $1.1. billion from the stimulus bill on comparative effectiveness research, you want that stuff to be in the public domain.''
 But when it comes to comparative effectiveness, the track record of the American public and their doctors is not encouraging. Even when such comparisons are available, we tend to ignore them. In 2002, for example, one of the largest government-financed clinical trials ever found that generic pills for high blood pressure worked better than newer drugs that were up to 20 times as expensive. But most hypertension patients still use costlier drugs marketed by pharmaceutical companies.
 Despite numerous studies showing that most ear infections aren't helped by antibiotics, many parents still insist on prescriptions for their children. Last month, The Archives of Internal Medicine reported that 37 percent of doctors in one survey complained that patients routinely demanded unnecessary prescriptions. By some estimates, unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions add $2 billion a year to health care costs.
 The list goes on. Whether it's invasive back surgery, medical scans or expensive drugs, patients and doctors alike often refuse to believe that costly treatments aren't worth it. 
 ''Doctors believe the industry propaganda that new drugs are better than old ones, and that for every ailment there is a drug,'' said Dr. Marcia Angell, a senior lecturer in social medicine at Harvard Medical School and the author of ''The Truth About the Drug Companies: How They Deceive Us and What to Do About It'' (Random House, 2004). ''They learn to practice a drug-intensive style of medicine.''
 In a 2004 study in The American Journal of Public Health, researchers found that technology played a surprisingly minor role in improving health. In analyzing mortality data from the 1990s, the researchers concluded that only about 1 in 16,000 Americans had their lives extended or saved as a result of recent improvements in health care technology. The real gains in health, experts say, have come from lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and seat-belt use or from public health improvements like vaccination, a cleaner water supply and increasing access to primary care.
 ''In American culture, prescriptions and procedures have become surrogates for real health care and real dialogue,'' Dr. Newman said. ''We need doctors and patients to conceive of medicine and health in a totally different way than they have been taught in the last 20 to 30 years.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 9, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The Well column on Tuesday, about the role that doctors and patients play in health care reform, referred incorrectly to data from a study published in 2004. The researchers, analyzing mortality data from the 1990s, showed that only about 1 in 16,000 Americans per year had their lives extended or saved as a result of recent improvements in health care technology, not 1 in 16,000 over the entire study period.

HEADLINE: The Case For a Giant, By a Giant

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN. 
The latest news on mergers and acquisitions can be found at nytimes.com/dealbook.

 BODY:
Inside the corridors of power in Washington, a 21-page document has been getting a lot of attention. It is marked confidential and titled ''A.I.G.: Is the Risk Systemic?''
 The report, prepared for regulators by the American International Group, examines the economic apocalypse that would follow if A.I.G. failed.
 This document may help explain why the federal government just rescued the insurance giant for the fourth time in six months -- and why the government was willing to spend $30 billion more of taxpayers' money for very little return. The government, which owns nearly 80 percent of A.I.G., not only did not take more equity in A.I.G., but it also converted its preferred shares, which paid a 10 percent dividend, into shares that don't pay a dividend at all. 
 ''Systemic risk'' is a phrase often used to describe the domino effect of one business's failure on the rest of the economy. We saw the dangers of systemic risk in action when Lehman Brothers failed in September. And we've heard a lot from Detroit automobile executives about the systemic risk they say the nation would face should General Motors teeter.
 But those failures look like summer thundershowers compared with the financial hurricane that a collapse of A.I.G. would represent, according to the document, which was presented to Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Lawrence H. Summers, head of the National Economic Council, in recent weeks.
 One of the biggest worries, besides the considerable collateral damage to the banking system, is a risk that most people aren't talking about, perhaps because it's too scary. This one is probably easier to understand than any kind of financial chicanery: the dangers lurking below A.I.G.'s seemingly stable, highly regulated life insurance business. In the United States, A.I.G. has more than 375 million policies with a face value of $19 trillion.
 If policyholders lost faith in A.I.G. and rushed to cash in their policies all at once, the entire insurance industry could falter. 
 ''A 'run on the bank' in the life and retirement business would have sweeping impacts across the economy in the U.S.,'' according to the A.I.G. document. ''In countries around the world with higher savings rates than in the U.S., the failure of insurance companies would be a catastrophe.''
 Even though A.I.G.'s insurance business is regulated by states, there probably would not be enough money to pay out to consumers from what's known as a guarantee fund. Other regulated insurance companies, which have been weakened by credit losses, would be required to pay money into the fund to cover the shortfall, weakening them further and in some cases bankrupting them. 
 Some would have to sell more and more of the bonds in their portfolios to honor their obligations to the scared-off policyholders. And that would freeze up the bond markets again, because life insurance companies to a very great extent are the bond markets. They buy more corporate debt than any other institutions.
 David E. Wood, a partner at the law firm Anderson Kill Wood & Bender, takes the possibility of a bankruptcy one step further. ''Given the number of states in which A.I.G. is domiciled or in which it issued large numbers of policies, the net effect may be regulatory gridlock and high administrative expenses, delaying payment and decreasing the funds available to pay claims.''
 What's worse, if A.I.G. failed, many people would be unable to obtain the same insurance from a competitor for the same price. In fact, many people would probably be shut out. ''Some life-policy holders may no longer be insurable at commensurate rates or as a result of adverse health situations since the purchase of the original policy,'' the document said.
 How we got here is a well-worn tale that others have detailed extensively: A.I.G. used its triple-A rating from the insurance part of its business to run a huge casino that then overwhelmed the entire business.
 ''It's an interesting structure where you have an insurance company that works really well and on top of it is a holding company and the holding company's biggest asset is this huge hedge fund,'' Edward M. Liddy, who became A.I.G.'s chief executive last fall, told me, sitting in the conference room adjacent to his office, which was once the den of Maurice R. Greenberg, A.I.G.'s former patriarch. ''It just doesn't make any sense to me.''
 The problem is that the casino has infected the rest of the business. That's why the structure of the government's deal is actually quite clever. 
 First, Mr. Geithner appears to have decided that he can't be punitive -- a reversal from the deal he helped shape in September while at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which nearly wiped out shareholders and added a huge cost to A.I.G. to do business. Indeed, it was all those added costs, in part, that forced the multiple restructurings because A.I.G. couldn't afford to make the payments. The new deal makes it more likely A.I.G. can afford to stay in business.
 Of course, there seems to be a slight disconnect: at one moment Mr. Geithner appears to be toeing a populist line when it comes to executive pay and corporate aircraft, and at another, he is generous about spending tax dollars without an immediate return. The good news is that he's taking a more long-term, holistic approach -- and he's setting up A.I.G. for a much-needed breakup down the road. (The deal calls for two units of A.I.G. -- American International Assurance and the American Life Insurance Company -- to be owned directly by taxpayers.) 
 The bad news is that he had every right to press to own 100 percent of A.I.G., and he didn't take it. 
 The markets, of course, didn't react well to all this maneuvering, as investors cashed out of their shares on Monday, sending stocks to their lowest levels since 1997. Let's just hope people don't start cashing out their life insurance policies, too.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 10, 2009

 CORRECTION:
The DealBook column last Tuesday, about the systemic risks posed by any collapse of the American International Group, misstated the size of A.I.G.'s life insurance business. The company has more than 81 million life insurance policies with a face value of $1.9 trillion globally, and says that a run by its policyholders to cash in policies with cash value could result in the collapse of the entire life insurance industry. A.I.G. does not have more than 375 million policies with a face value of $19 trillion; that is the total of all policies held by insurance companies in the United States.

HEADLINE: Europe to Allow Two Bans on Genetically Altered Crops

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
European Union governments delivered a blow Monday to the biotechnology industry, allowing Austria and Hungary to maintain national bans on growing genetically modified crops from Monsanto.
 The vote, taken by European environment ministers, could irritate Washington, which has complained to the World Trade Organization about obstacles to planting bioengineered crops. 
 The vote was also a setback for the European Commission, the union's executive arm. The commission has sought to ease the restrictions in Europe on gene-altered crops, in part to keep down the cost of animal feed.
 Member countries were ''firm'' and the ''commission should take a close reading of the result,'' the French environment minister, Jean-Louis Borloo, said after the announcement in Brussels, according to Bloomberg News.
 The market for genetically engineered crops is worth several billion dollars worldwide. Only one genetically altered crop is currently grown in Europe: a form of corn, called MON 810, produced by Monsanto and other companies.
 In 2003, Argentina, Canada and the United States brought complaints about Europe's biotechnology policies to the W.T.O., which ruled in 2006 that a de facto ban on imports of genetically modified foods from 1984 to 2004 violated trade rules.
 Since that ruling, the commission has required Austria to drop its ban on imports of genetically modified foods. But some other countries have maintained bans on imports and cultivation of such crops.
 ''The risk has increased this morning that attention now will be thrown back to the W.T.O.,'' said Willy De Greef, the secretary general of Europabio, a biotechnology industry organization in Brussels.
 The United States Mission to the European Union had no immediate comment. Officials at offices of the United States trade representative could not be reached.

HEADLINE: A Far Cry From the Previous Job but ...

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Forced Down the Job Ladder, From Executive Pay to Hourly Wage'' (front page, March 1) speaks to me. A traffic accident in 1994 left me disabled. Since then, I've relied on a friend's income to keep me afloat.
 Social Security disability is barely enough to live on. Six months ago, my housemate lost her job at Arizona State University, and we've both slipped downward. Not even a doctorate from Harvard University means much in this bleak economic climate. She remains unemployed. 
 A letter arrived the other day stating that she had exhausted her unemployment benefits. At 54, I never thought I'd have to rummage through the garbage for aluminum cans to redeem, but I need the cash. It's shameful and degrading when neighbors see me, but I have to swallow my pride. 
 I start shopping in the dollar store hoping they have organic produce. I buy day-old bagels. The bank won't refinance our mortgage because my housemate doesn't have a job, and my disability income isn't enough. We both played by the rules, but it may be too late.
 Debra J. White Tempe, Ariz., March 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 While the economic downturn has surely been hard on many, including Mark Cooper and the other subjects in this article, they are merely experiencing what many Americans have been living through for the last few decades. 
 The period of economic abundance skipped over the vast majority of Americans. The working poor. Business owners and the self-employed with no health insurance. Families, one illness away from bankruptcy. College graduates unable to find work above minimum wage.
 It is ironic that those recently unemployed from their well-paying jobs are suddenly concerned with health insurance, car payments and housing costs. Welcome to the way of life most of us have been living for years.
 Sarah Stamm Seattle, March 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Like Mark Cooper, I, too, mopped floors and cleaned urinals and toilets. I did it for $7 an hour, at two jobs for 85 hours a week. The year before, in 1986, I was earning $72,000 a year as a copywriter.
 Here is an excerpt from my unpublished memoir:
 ''Madvertising: excellent advertising = unemployment. This Equal Opportunity Plague (of which many examples are to be found throughout this book) makes no distinction between the young, the old, the lowly paid, the highly paid, the Creatives, the Suits -- all are fired.''
 Alas, this excerpt is outdated. The soul-deadening venom of pink slips and rejections has spread from advertising to every field of endeavor. 
 Howard S. Kaplan Long Beach, N.Y., March 1, 2009
 To the Editor:
 Your article calls to mind the thousands (millions?) of people who were ''forced down'' not by an economic but a political downturn in their homeland. The political refugees escaping Nazism, Communism and other ''isms,'' wars, revolutions and other upheavals left behind successful professional careers and because of language skills or other requirements, were forced to start at the bottom of the job ladder. 
 And in addition, these doctors, lawyers and other professionals doing janitorial work were depressed not only by the downturn of their economic situation but also were often faced with discrimination because of their race, religion or nationality. 
 Most of them, however, never lost hope and managed to re-establish themselves, fulfilling the American Dream.
 Geza Madarasz Edison, N.J., March 1, 2009
 The writer was a Hungarian refugee in 1956.
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Even Worse for Young Workers'' (column, Feb. 28):
 I agree with Bob Herbert's assessment of the abysmal opportunity for young workers. And I want to emphasize that the situation is just as dire at the other end of the employment curve -- workers 50 to 64.
 Forget about the cause. Instead, ask questions. 
 When older workers lose their jobs, how many return to full-time employment? How long does it take? Is the salary more or less than before? The answers are grim and getting grimmer.
 Ours is an equal-opportunity unemployment, affecting all education levels -- including those with advanced degrees who become ''consultants'' to salvage shreds of dignity and income.
 We were a ''sandwich'' generation -- blithely supporting our kids and our parents and believing that we could work until we wanted to stop. Now, at best, we're an unfortunate footnote in the broader unemployment statistics. 
 Wow. We never thought a stupid clock could do us in.

HEADLINE: Predicting a Derby Winner? It's Never Too Early to Start Making a List

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
''Nobody knows nothing,'' is a saying that has been ascribed to everyone from movie executives to economists. It is particularly true of horseplayers trying in the early days of March to divine the winner of the Kentucky Derby on the first Saturday in May. 
 It is the reason bookmakers in Las Vegas offer future bets at long odds, on any and every 3-year-old to win America's greatest horse race. 
 In January, holding tickets at 125-1 on the prospects Shafted and Poltergeist seemed smart. In February, however, after they ran up the track in the Robert B. Lewis and the Southwest Stakes, the colts were off the Derby trail and the tickets were worthless.
 Still, horseplayers know better than most that (a) the more you guess, the sooner you're going to be right; and (b) everyone only remembers your winners. In line with that philosophy, The New York Times offers its first list of Derby contenders. 
 With the Triple Crown prep races at the halfway point, some familiar archetypes are arriving on the Derby landscape. In the Fountain of Youth at Gulfstream Park on Saturday, Quality Road romped to a four-and-a-quarter-length victory and became this year's version of the lightly raced, late-blooming contender in the mold of last year's Derby winner, Big Brown.
 Quality Road won his first race in November at Aqueduct and generated plenty of buzz about his talent and speed. His father, the miler Elusive Quality, sired the 2004 Derby winner, Smarty Jones. But in Quality Road's next race, an allowance on Jan. 10 at Gulfstream, he was battling a cough and looked ordinary in finishing second. 
 After Quality Road's victory on Saturday, his trainer, Jimmy Jerkens, tried to quiet expectations. He said he had no idea if his colt could handle the Derby's mile-and-a-quarter distance.
 ''A one-turn mile is still basically a sprint and a lot different than going two turns,'' he said.
 Later Saturday, in the Sham Stakes at Santa Anita Park, the odds-on favorite, The Pamplemousse, led every step of the way. As impressive as his six-length victory was, The Pamplemousse will receive more attention in the coming weeks for his name and ownership group.
 Pamplemousse means grapefruit in French, and the colt is named after Pamplemousse Grille, a high-end restaurant across the street from Del Mar racetrack in California. Jeffrey Strauss, the restaurant's owner-chef, owns part of the horse with Alex Solis II, whose father rides The Pamplemousse.
 ''I've never ridden anything like him,'' said Alex Solis, a highly regarded rider who has never won a Derby but has finished second three times. ''He has such a high cruising speed and he's getting more and more amazing. He has such a good mind and he was real relaxed the whole way.''
 At the top of the list, however, are two colts whose credentials are rock solid but perhaps a little boring. Old Fashioned has beaten all comers in his four races, including an impressive performance in the mile-and-an-eighth Remsen as a 2-year-old and a victory in the Southwest Stakes.
 He is trained by the highly skilled Larry Jones, whose Hard Spun ran second in the 2007 Derby to Street Sense. Old Fashioned, a son of Unbridled's Song, is training and racing at Oaklawn Park in Arkansas, a successful path for Triple Crown horses like Smarty Jones and Curlin.
 Old Fashioned is the deserving early favorite, but that does not mean he is going to win on May 2. The No. 2 horse on the list is Pioneerof the Nile, who is being prepped in stout, old-school fashion by the three-time Derby winner Bob Baffert. 
 Pioneerof the Nile, a son of Empire Maker, has already raced six times, recording three victories, including the Grade I CashCall Futurity as a 2-year-old and the Robert B. Lewis Stakes. 
 What Baffert, and all the California horses, are up against is whether their performances on synthetic tracks will transfer to dirt at the Derby. 
 Baffert does not particularly like the new surfaces, but he does not plan to travel east with Pioneerof the Nile -- to a race like the Wood Memorial -- to test him on dirt. 
 Instead, he says he will take Pioneerof the Nile to Churchill Downs early and let him adjust to the new surface in the mornings. 
 Baffert, who is eligible for the Hall of Fame and should be a unanimous selection, also subscribes to the ''nobody knows nothing'' theory of picking a Derby winner.
 ''All I know for sure is that The Nile will run all day and has developed a terrific kick and is improving every day,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ''Really love his chances. He is the real deal. Needs racing luck being that he comes from off of it but has tactical speed to stay in range. Love this guy.''

HEADLINE: Chip Makers Watch Sales Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

DATELINE: MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. 

 BODY:
While accustomed to the boom-and-bust nature of their industry, the companies making the semiconductor chips that run computers, cellphones, digital cameras and even cars find themselves in the middle of a collapse in sales that resembles total chaos. 
 With sales of most manufactured goods plunging in this recession, demand for chips is evaporating. In January alone, chip sales plummeted by almost a third from the previous year, to $15.3 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association. 
 ''This is the worst recession the semiconductor industry has seen since its inception,'' said Sean M. Maloney, the chief sales and marketing officer at Intel, at a news conference Monday.
 Consumers have benefited from some of the underlying turmoil. Smartphones and the cheap laptops known as netbooks are getting more powerful even as they drop in price. And the prices for the memory chips used to store information in iPods, digital cameras and cable set-top boxes are plummeting as the companies making the products grapple with overcapacity at their factories. 
 Major chip makers like Intel, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia have felt the sting of businesses and consumers curtailing their spending on computers. Last month, Hewlett-Packard, the world's largest PC maker, reported a 19 percent drop in computer sales, while Dell, the second-largest PC maker, posted a 27 percent decline in desktop sales. 
 On Monday, the research firm Gartner predicted that computer shipments would dive by 12 percent in 2009 to 257 million units -- the steepest decline ever. 
 In the memory chip industry, conditions have turned cataclysmic. 
 In the last couple of years the production of memory chips swelled as companies chased rising interest in consumer gadgets. The result was a vast oversupply, which led to plummeting prices. Memory prices fell 60 percent last year and could fall 40 percent this year, according to Jim Handy, the director of the chip research firm Objective Analysis. 
 Now, on top of the oversupply, memory makers like Spansion and Micron Technology must also deal with falling demand for the consumer devices that use their products. 
 ''We're in unprecedented territory for the chip industry as a whole, and the memory makers are then in a category by themselves,'' said Dale Ford, an analyst at the research firm iSuppli. ''These companies put themselves in a position of putting in place so much capacity that they were bleeding cash when the downturn took place.''
 Burdened with aging chip factories, Micron announced in October that it would lay off close to 3,000 people, or 15 percent of its work force. In February, it said it would eliminate up to 2,000 additional jobs. Qimonda, a German memory maker, began insolvency proceedings in January. 
 And over the weekend, Spansion, the largest maker of a type of memory popular in cellphones, automobiles and set-top boxes, filed for bankruptcy protection after having already cut 3,000 jobs, or 35 percent of its work force. The company has said it was open to acquisition proposals. 
 ''There is no relief valve from the credit markets,'' said Thomas T. Eby, an executive vice president at Spansion, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif. 
 Mr. Eby conceded that the memory chip makers brought some of this misery upon themselves by building too many factories, which led to the declining prices. But he added that chip makers must try to anticipate demand and pay for and build their expensive factories two to three years ahead of time. ''The bigger issue is that no one had a crystal ball to see what was coming from the economy,'' he said. 
 With the complexity and cost of building chips only continuing to rise, the current market conditions could accelerate a trend toward consolidation while also making it less likely that start-ups will challenge the incumbents, say industry observers.
 And credit problems will probably result in some companies just disappearing, Mr. Ford said. ''The industry doesn't have its historical ability to manage through this.''

HEADLINE: Security Guards Become The Front Lines in India

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI 

 BODY:
In much of India, the first line of defense against crime stands just over five and a half feet tall, earns less than $100 a month and is armed with little more than a shiny belt buckle. 
 Security guards have long been a sleepy presence here, but a string of fatal attacks, culminating in the siege of three Mumbai hotels by terrorists last November, have created a demand for new and better trained guards, state-of-the-art equipment and guns for the guards and businessmen themselves. 
 Capsi, an industry trade group, estimates that India's $2 billion private security sector will add a million employees this year, even as other industries lay off workers while the economy cools. Already, it employs about 5 million people, 1.3 million more than India's police and armed forces combined. 
 In fact, with India's official police stretched thin (there is one officer for every 1,000 people in India, less than half the United States average and one-tenth the average in China), security guards are moving from fetchers of tea at government offices and car washers at wealthy homes to becoming corporate India's de facto police force.
 Still, what measure of security these guards provide came under question after the Mumbai attacks. Terrorists were able to store ammunition in the Taj Hotel, and enter it and two other hotels with arms, despite a sizable private security contingent at all three. For nearly three days, they were able to keep hundreds of people hostage. 
 In many areas of India, a police presence is ''nonexistent,'' said Arjun Wallia, the chairman and founder of Walsons, an Indian security firm that employs 12,000 guards and is partly owned by the global giant Securitas. But just adding ''more guards and more people is not a solution,'' he said. Instead, Mr. Wallia and others in the business are talking about better training and increasing pay scales and, in many cases, arming guards. 
 Many guards were farm workers in small villages just a month ago. Through job fairs and local offices in rural states like Rajasthan, Bihar and Punjab, companies sign on thousands of young men at a time, put them through training camps, then send them into urban centers.
 According to security firm executives and interviews with job candidates themselves, many of the recruits are men who tried and failed to enter the police or military but still crave a job with a uniform. Most of them earn a starting salary of about 4,000 rupees a month, or $82. 
 ''No one picks private security over armed forces,'' said Rituraj Sinha, the chief operating officer of Security and Intelligence Services, which plans to add 10,000 guards this year to its 30,000-member force. 
 Recruits must provide police verification of their identity, pass routine medical tests and tests for literacy and basic math. But there is little vetting of their character or their background. 
 Security firms say relatively new rules making training mandatory help to weed out corrupt or ineffective guards. In the past, companies used to just ''pick up a boy and give him a uniform'' said J. R. Trikha, a retired colonel who is the executive director of the security trade association. ''Now he gets 28 days of training before being deployed to the site.''
 Before the training, most of the recruits have never been to an office park, ridden an elevator, used a fire extinguisher or, often, seen a gun. 
 In about a month, they are supposed to be able to determine who should and should not enter the malls, corporate office parks, apartment blocks and even public transportation in India's urban areas. They are also the first on the scene in accidents and fires because fire and ambulance services are slow or nonexistent in many parts of India. 
 Some companies, like the real estate giant DLF -- which counts Cartier jewelers, Max New York Life and Citigroup among its tenants -- have started their own private security forces. Terra Force will patrol DLF's thousands of Indian properties. The company is hiring as many experts as it can, including former National Security Guards, the black-clad commandos who reclaimed the Mumbai hotels. 
 ''Only those that deliver well-trained security personnel will survive'' in the industry, said Harsh Wardhan, president and chief executive of Terra Force Securities, who was recruited from G4S, the only foreign security firm that operates in India. Terra Force uses bomb-sniffing dogs, night-vision goggles and I.B.M. surveillance systems and is importing instructors from the Israeli army and the United States Marine Corps, Mr. Wardhan said. 
 Still, much of the business revolves around training fresh recruits from rural areas of India in camps like one on the outskirts of Gurgaon, a slapdash boomtown city south of New Delhi. 
 On a recent visit to the camp, located where Gurgaon's glass towers and malls peter out to low-slung buildings and open lots, a batch of young men in creased navy trousers stood at attention. Their superior barked an order and they saluted and yelled in unison ''Good morning, sir'' again and again. 
 Kammesh Baboo Rathore, a 28-year-old recruit, said that Terra Force was his third choice. ''I tried the army and the police and didn't get through'' he said. ''This is my next choice. I want to work for the nation and am enamored by the uniform.''

HEADLINE: Steep Market Drops Highlight Despair Over Rescue Efforts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Bettina Wassener and Judy Dempsey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fears that the world's economies are even weaker than had been thought ricocheted around the globe on Monday as investors from Hong Kong to London to New York bailed out of stocks. 
 Losses cascaded from one market to the next as concern spread that government efforts had not been enough to stabilize troubled financial institutions or broader economies. Only by Tuesday morning did markets show signs of stabilizing, with key indexes in Asia showing more modest declines.
 But Monday's losses were bad everywhere, and particularly severe in Europe, where an emergency meeting over the weekend ended in bickering and the rejection of a bailout plea from Hungary.
 In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell below 7,000 for the first time since 1997 as investors reacted to reports that construction and industrial activity had continued to decline and to a $61.7 billion loss posted by the insurance giant, the American International Group. It was the largest quarterly loss ever for a company. 
 In Britain, the major stock market index lost 5.3 percent, and the performance of the major Italian index was worse, declining 6 percent. With the dollar also gaining, the losses were even greater for international investors in those markets.
 In the United States, the Dow fell 299.64 points, or 4.24 percent, to 6,763.29, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 34.27 points, or 4.66 percent, to 700.82. The Nasdaq composite ended 54.99 points, or 3.99 percent, lower, at 1,322.85.
 Crude oil settled at $40.15 a barrel, down $4.61.
 ''It's pretty despondent everywhere,'' said Dwyfor Evans, a strategist at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. ''O.K., there are signs that some of the leading indicators have stabilized to some extent, but it's at a very, very low level, and we're not seeing corporate investment picking up, or consumers starting to spend again -- in other words, the traditional mechanisms by which economies come out of a recession are absent at this time.''
 Hopes that the American economy, which led the world into recession, might lead it back out this year have been fading. 
 Last weekend, Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote in his company's annual report that ''the economy will be in shambles, throughout 2009, and, for that matter, probably well beyond.''
 As if to emphasize the problems, the Institute for Supply Management reported that companies in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States said business was getting much worse, especially in terms of jobs.
 Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, pointed to the survey in forecasting that the February employment report will show a decline of 785,000 jobs when it is released on Friday. If so, it would be the largest one-month decline in employment in nearly 60 years. 
 Last week, the United States revised its estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product to show a decline at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, the worst in more than a quarter century. On Monday in reporting that construction activity fell sharply in January, the government also revised the December figure lower. 
 ''That change could move the fourth quarter figure down to a 7 percent decline,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a research firm. 
 Despite the American problems, the dollar has been gaining, particularly against European currencies. The euro slipped to under $1.26, nearing a two-year low and down from a high of almost $1.60 last spring. There was a renewed flight to safety, with the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling to under 3 percent.
 The continued plunge of the stock markets has stunned investors and governments. Over the six months that ended last week, the S.& P. 500 lost 43 percent of its value. There were similar declines during the Great Depression, but since then, the worst six-month performance before the current plunge was a 32 percent fall in 1974 when the world was also in recession.
 While there has been speculation about international cooperation to deal with the growing financial and economic crisis, the European Union summit this weekend provided an indication that few countries were willing to risk their own taxpayers' money to help others.
 ''The E.U. again has proven it is unable to manage a coordinated response to the crisis,'' Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note Monday. ''The problems arising in Eastern Europe will put further pressure on the euro.''
 While all countries are suffering, the United States and some Western European countries still have access to loans, which has enabled them to mount large stimulus plans and bear the costs of bailing out banks.
 But in some other areas, notably Eastern Europe, the value of the local currencies has plunged as economic activity has weakened. That is a perilous path in countries where the government and many homeowners took out loans in foreign currencies, seeking lower interest rates, and now find themselves owing far more than they borrowed.
 Reflecting that fact, over the same six months that the American stock market fell 43 percent, most European and Asian markets did even worse when measured in dollars. The Hungarian market, for example, was off 67 percent, while the German exchange fell 48 percent. 
 Investors have greeted the stimulus spending plans with some hesitation in part because of signs that the financial system continues to weaken. 
 ''We can unleash as many trillions of dollars in stimulus as we wish, but if we don't fix the banking system, we still have a patient in cardiac arrest,'' the chief strategist at Charles Schwab, Liz Ann Sonders, said.
 In addition to the loss at A.I.G., HSBC, the London-based international bank, said it would close its American consumer finance business, which it took on when it acquired Household Finance in 2003, in one of the decade's worst acquisitions. HSBC said it would raise $17 billion in new capital from shareholders. Its shares fell 19 percent, to its lowest level in a decade.
 The A.I.G. loss far exceeded the previous quarterly record deficit of $44.9 billion, set by Time Warner in 2002 when it wrote down the value of AOL. 
 Another factor depressing investors is the dividend cuts that many companies have been forced to make. On Monday, the large regional bank PNC Financial Services Group cut its dividend 85 percent and the International Paper Company cut its by 90 percent. Last week, General Electric cut its dividend 68 percent, and JPMorgan Chase reduced its dividend 87 percent. 
 The surveys of businesses, which ask whether various aspects of business are getting better or worse, showed figures in the low-to-mid 30s in all countries, driven down by sharply lower employment expectations. On those surveys, a figure of 50 indicates that business is neither getting better nor worse, and figures below 40 show a sharp rate of decline.
 That very plunge could augur well in the not-too-distant future, since it appears that production in many areas is running below sales as companies seek to cut costs. 
 ''The intensity of inventory reduction is stunning,'' said Tobias Levkovich, a Citigroup strategist, in a note to clients. ''The depressed level of production relative to final sales argues that there is real potential for production levels to lift'' in the second half of the year, he said, leading to surprisingly good profits.
 For now, at least, few investors expect any such good news. The S.&. P 500 fell 18.6 percent in the first two months of 2009, even before Monday's fall. That was its worst start, exceeding the 18.2 percent fall recorded in the first two months of 1933, another year when a new president took office during an economic and financial crisis. In 1933, the stock market soon turned, and nearly doubled over 12 months.
 The S.& P. 500 has now fallen below, and the Dow is close to, the levels that prevailed on Dec. 5, 1996, when Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, inquired in a speech, ''How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?''
 It was a question that has been answered over the last 17 months. During that period, the Dow has fallen 52.3 percent, a larger percentage decline than in any bear market since the Great Depression, but nowhere near the 89 percent collapse that took less than three years to complete after the 1929 high.

HEADLINE: On Jets Coaches' Trip, Scott Is the Souvenir

BYLINE: By GREG BISHOP

 BODY:
Bart Scott had never been recruited. He always played on football's fringes, rising from a college unknown at Southern Illinois to an undrafted free agent to a special-teams standout to a starting Ravens linebacker, albeit one who played in the sizable shadow of Ray Lewis.
 But shortly after midnight Friday, Scott received his first in-home recruiting visit, a surprise arrival announced by his barking dogs outside his home in Owings Mills, Md. Scott figured his German shepherds, McQueen and Mater, were chasing deer. Instead, they were barking at three Jets coaches, including the head man, Rex Ryan, standing outside the home of their most-coveted free agent. 
 Scott now felt the full-court press, the unbridled affection of the Jets, and called it moving from the passenger seat to the driver's seat. 
 ''This was one of the most flattering things of my career,'' Scott said Monday in a conference call. ''I'm still in awe about it.''
 Ever since his arrival in January, Ryan has made bold proclamations, with his no-nonsense welcoming of high expectations. Scott clearly attended the Ryan School of Public Communications.
 Scott declared himself a lifelong underdog cut from the Rudy cloth. He labeled the Jets the ultimate underdog, ever since Super Bowl III and Joe Namath's guarantee made good.
 He said this constituted the perfect pairing, and he promised that the Jets ''won't back down from anybody'' and ''won't take a step back from anybody.'' He sounded just like Ryan in the coach's public comments since assuming the head role.
 Scott repeatedly reminded reporters how football was a physical, violent game, and how the Jets' defense would play a physical, violent style.
 He claimed to have been a violent and angry player since Pee Wee, a style further developed in high school and eventually controlled by Ryan in Baltimore. It was Ryan who taught Scott to harness that passion and funnel it without playing too recklessly. An organized chaos, Scott called it, adding that football is a game best played with bad intentions.
 ''I don't know if this division has ever seen a violent defense,'' Scott said of the American Football Conference East. ''It's one thing to be physical and make a tackle. It's another thing to be violent. To tell you the truth, you have to shut me up. That's why I never called the plays out there. I was too busy fighting.''
 Scott had reporters at hello, the same as Ryan, and now all both have to do is win. Scott played down reports that he engaged in a bidding war with the Ravens, saying he had wanted to return to Baltimore, but felt the Jets pursued him harder Friday.
 Now, he becomes a cornerstone of the Jets' work-in-progress defense. The team has hosted safety Jim Leonhard and cornerback Corey Ivy, two other Ravens, since last Friday, and has expressed interest in the former Baltimore defensive end Marques Douglas.
 The Jets also added cornerback Lito Sheppard in a trade with Philadelphia. But Scott marked the biggest splash so far this off-season.
 Scott, who spoke for more than 30 minutes Monday, said nose tackle Kris Jenkins presented Albert Haynesworth-type matchup problems. He said he studied economics in college but may go into television after playing football. He said the Jets could win it all this season, even if history, now 40 years and counting, suggests otherwise.
 ''The defense automatically improved the day they hired Rex,'' he said. ''It's his ability to come down to the level of people that he's dealing with. He's able to connect with his players, because he cares about them. It's not, I care about my stars. He cares about everybody.'' 
 EXTRA POINT

HEADLINE: Hoping for a Latino Archbishop, in Due Course

BYLINE: By PAUL VITELLO

 BODY:
Latinos account for at least half of the Roman Catholics in New York. Their neighborhood churches are often filled to capacity. Parishes originally named for Irish saints have been renamed for Hispanic ones. Masses at St. Patrick's Cathedral honoring the feast days of their patron saints draw crowds so large and fervent that worshipers sometimes spill out onto Fifth Avenue to pray on their knees on the sidewalk.
 And when the Vatican announced last week that the next leader of the Archdiocese of New York would be Archbishop Timothy M. Dolan of Milwaukee -- the 10th in an unbroken line of Irish-American archbishops to hold that job since 1842 -- Latino Catholics in New York reacted as they would to news of another sunrise over the East River. 
 The muted response did not reflect indifference to the new archbishop, whom many people seemed to like, or to the notion that appointing a prelate with a Hispanic name instead of a Celtic one might be smart: Latinos are not only ascendant in New York, but also likely to be the majority of Catholics in the United States within a decade. The archbishop of New York, with his pulpit in the media nexus of the world, has been called the pope of America. 
 As Latino leaders described their reaction, it was more like accepting the limits of one's options in the family business.
 ''It's not called St. Patrick's Cathedral for nothing,'' said Richard Espinal, executive director of Centro Altagracia for Faith and Justice, a Jesuit-sponsored Latino advocacy group in Harlem. ''The old guard of Irish-American priests -- that's still the church's power base in New York. I have no problem with it. I'm just happy to read in the paper that the new archbishop can say Mass in Spanish.''
 By historians' account, Irish immigrants and their offspring essentially built the Catholic Church in America. Between 1840 and 1880, Irish immigration accounted for most of the sixfold increase in the country's Catholic population, to 6 million. The influx fueled a boom in church and school construction, much of it with Irish labor, that culminated with the completion of St. Patrick's in 1878.
 But Latinos in New York today are almost the statistical twins of Irish New Yorkers of the late 19th century: They account for 30 percent of the city's population and, by the archdiocese's estimate, 40 to 50 percent of its 2.5 million Catholics -- an estimate that community advocates say probably misses large numbers of undocumented immigrants.
 And while the archdiocese has welcomed Latinos -- rededicating churches and underwriting tuition for Hispanic students in its parochial schools -- they have not inherited the vast stake in the institution that their Irish-American forbears have. 
 There are still far more Irish-American priests than Latino ones in New York, as in most of the country. The board of directors of the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation, which sponsors the New York Archdiocese's biggest fund-raiser of the year, a white-tie dinner that attracts the city's political and business elite, still reflects the white Catholic population that arrived in New York a century and more ago, and is mostly Irish-American.
 Appointing a Latino archbishop in New York would not change the fundamental equation, but it would send a message, some community leaders said.
 ''This was a lost opportunity,'' said the Rev. Ray Rivera, founder of the Latino Pastoral Action Center in the Bronx, a network of evangelical ministries that promotes economic development and operates a charter school. 
 Mr. Rivera is a former Catholic, like many evangelical Protestants, and evangelicals have given the Catholic Church stiff competition in courting Latinos. But he knows the landscape of Hispanic faith in New York. 
 ''The Catholic Church's renewal in New York is due to the Latino community,'' he said. ''Naming an archbishop who reflects the fastest-growing constituency it has would have sent a message that this church is not in a world apart.'' 
 More typical, though, was the sentiment of Joel Magallan, who was a Jesuit brother when he was recruited by Cardinal John J. O'Connor in the 1990s to organize the first observance of the feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe at St. Patrick's Cathedral. For many Latinos, the Dec. 12 observance of the feast, a Mexican rite signifying the apparition of the Virgin Mary near Mexico City in 1531, is the most important holy day after Christmas.
 ''When they realized that Mexicans were coming to the city for work, they opened the doors to bring our celebration into the cathedral,'' said Mr. Magallan, who is no longer in the order. ''When so many people showed up, they couldn't fit inside. I asked O'Connor why we don't go to Yankee Stadium. He said: 'Because St. Patrick's is the symbol of the Catholic Church in New York, Joel. You have to bring the people here.' 
 ''To me, the Irish are the masters of immigration. They understand what it means better than anybody.''
 Anthony M. Stevens-Arroyo, a scholar of Latino Catholicism and a professor emeritus at Brooklyn College, said half-jokingly of himself and everyone who grew up Catholic in America in the last century under the tutelage of Irish-American priests, ''We're all Irish Catholics.''
 A Latino will be appointed archbishop of New York in due course, he said, as the Vatican grooms Hispanic priests for prestigious ''pipeline'' posts as heads of important seminaries and dioceses.
 In the past decade, the Vatican has appointed Hispanic bishops to lead 12 dioceses in the United States, or about 6 percent of the 195 dioceses nationwide. With one exception, all are in the West and Southwest, including the dioceses of San Antonio; El Paso and Laredo, Tex.; Yakima, Wash.; and Sacramento, where Latino populations are flourishing. The exception was the archdiocese of San Juan, Puerto Rico, led by Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves, who was reported to be under consideration to succeed the New York archbishop, Cardinal Edward M. Egan, who will retire in April. 
 In New York, church officials have struggled with changing demographics since at least the 1960s, when Cardinal Terence J. Cooke began sending priests to Puerto Rico to learn Spanish in response to the first wave of newcomers from that island territory, said Bishop Dennis Sullivan, the diocese's vicar general, or first deputy to Cardinal Egan.
 ''Our main problem is we need more priests,'' Bishop Sullivan said. ''Spanish-speaking and otherwise.''
 The shortage of priests, especially those who speak Spanish or understand Latino culture, has coincided with the growing defection of Latino Catholics to evangelical Christian denominations with Hispanic ministers, like the Pentecostals. 
 But Bishop Sullivan said communication between a priest and his flock is about more than language. ''What is most important is that the bishop be able to communicate,'' he said, ''and I think Archbishop Dolan's eloquence was evident to Catholics in the pictures of him. His smile is its own language.''
 Archbishop Dolan said last week that while he had studied Spanish and could say Mass in the language, he was not fluent.
 William J. Flynn, a longtime fund-raiser for the church and a past grand marshal of the St. Patrick's Day Parade, said the archdiocese had reached out as best as it could to Latinos, given ''the difficulties, the language problems and so forth.''
 He said he was ''happy to see the Irish have found a home in the leadership of this diocese -- but the day of the Irish is coming to a close.''
 Mr. Flynn, 82, a retired insurance executive and the son of an Irish immigrant, said he saw the history of Latino immigration in America as no different from that of the Irish, ''and that includes our illegal residents.''
 ''Their sons and daughters are going to be running our country and fighting our wars,'' he said. ''So I fully expect that we will have a man of Spanish heritage as archbishop of New York.''

CORRECTION-DATE: March 5, 2009

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the muted reaction among Latino Roman Catholics to the announcement that the next archbishop of New York is another in a long line of Irish-Americans misstated, in some editions, the former vocation of Joel Magallan, who was recruited by Cardinal John J. O'Connor in the 1990s to organize the first observance of the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe, a holy day for Latinos, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. He was a Jesuit brother at the time, not a priest.

HEADLINE: Eating Well on a Downsized Food Budget

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Now may be a good time to bring back the basics -- the nutritious and affordable foods that have been all but forgotten by many affluent families since the Great Depression.
 I'm not going to suggest a nightly diet of stone soup or the cheap fat- and sugar-rich menus of the urban poor. But many people who once gave little thought to dining on steak, lobster, asparagus, baby spinach or creme brulee are now having to spend less on just about everything, including food.
 Those who have lost jobs may be able to turn some of their unwanted spare time toward the grocery and kitchen. Others, like families with two working parents or working single parents, have to carve out time to provide economical, nourishing meals.
 Not only is it possible, but it can improve the health and reduce the girth of Americans, regardless of socioeconomic status. 
 A Little Effort Goes a Long Way
 ''We need to look at real foods for real people, the foods that got us through the last depression,'' said Adam Drewnowski, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington's Center for Public Health Nutrition. ''We must avoid the temptation to turn to cheap, empty calories -- the refined grains, added sugars and added fats that give you the most calories you can get for your food dollar.''
 Instead, Dr. Drewnowski said, ''there are many foods that are affordable and nutrient-rich and not loaded with empty calories.'' 
 And eating for good health does not have to mean eating less. ''If you have equal portions of foods that are nutrient-dense, you will end up eating fewer calories,'' he said.
 For families accustomed to eating out and ordering in, shopping for and preparing meals can take more time. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, low-income women who work full time spend just over 40 minutes a day on meal preparation. With a little planning, another 20 or 30 minutes can provide healthy, economical fare.
 Households not accustomed to home cooking may have to make small investments in kitchen equipment and ingredients that can speed food preparation and will remain useful long after the economy improves. Even families using food stamps can afford the foods discussed below to make recipes like those posted with this column at nytimes.com/health. And no one need go hungry.
 Value-Added Foods
 To assess which foods provide the best value of balanced nutrients for less money, Dr. Drewnowski said, ''we need to calculate nutrients per calorie and nutrients per dollar and make those foods part of the mainstream diet.'' 
 Researchers at the State University of New York at Buffalo who studied families in a program for overweight children found that basing the family diet on low-calorie, high-nutrient foods not only improved the health of the entire family but also reduced the amount spent on food. 
 One myth to dispel is that fruits and vegetables must be fresh to be nutritious. Not only do canned and frozen versions usually cost less and require less preparation, but nutrient value is as good or better and less food is wasted. Fresh produce is often harvested before it is fully ripe and so comes to the consumer with fewer than optimal nutrients. But fruits and vegetables that are canned or frozen are picked at the peak of ripeness. There is more vitamin C in a glass of orange juice made from frozen concentrate than in freshly squeezed juice.
 So let's welcome back to the American table meals made from potatoes, eggs, beans, low-fat or nonfat yogurt and milk (including reconstituted powdered milk), carrots, kale or collards, onions, bananas, apples, peanut butter, almonds, lean ground beef, chicken and turkey, along with canned or frozen corn, peas, tomatoes, broccoli and fish. For nutrient-dense beverages, Dr. Drewnowski suggests 100 percent fruit juice blends and fruit-and-vegetable juice blends.
 To his suggestions I would add pasta and rice (the whole-wheat kinds cost just pennies more), which can be a base for many quick, nutritious meals. Combining leftover vegetables and meat or poultry with a pot of pasta or rice takes just minutes, and has the added benefit of reducing potential waste.
 For dessert, try frozen yogurt or low-fat ice cream topped with seasonal fruit for the best nutrient-to-calorie ratio and value.
 Potatoes: One of the Good Guys
 Some perfectly good foods have been unfairly smeared by a broad brush. Potatoes are an example, deplored by nutrition advocates for how they are most often consumed -- fried and heavily salted -- and by the low-carb set for their high glycemic index.
 In fact, potatoes are highly versatile, they are easily prepared in many delicious ways with little or no added fat, and they are nearly always consumed with other foods, which greatly reduces their effect on blood sugar. And they are nutritious. A five-ounce potato provides just 100 calories, for which you get 35 percent of a day's recommended vitamin C, 20 percent of the vitamin B6, 15 percent of the iodine, 10 percent each of niacin, iron and copper, and 6 percent of the protein. 
 Try potatoes baked, boiled or steamed and topped with low-fat yogurt or sour cream seasoned with your favorite herbs or spices.
 Beans, whether prepared from scratch (soaked overnight and then cooked) or taken from a can, are a low-cost nutritional powerhouse. They are low in fat, rich sources of B vitamins and iron, and richer in protein than any other plant food. When combined in a meal with a grain like rice (preferably brown), bulgur or whole-wheat bread, the protein quality is as good as that of meat.
 Cabbage, too, gives you more than your money's worth of nutrients, including vitamin C and potassium, at only 17 calories a cup eaten shredded and raw, 29 calories a cup when cooked. Collards are high in vitamins A and C, potassium, calcium (cup for cup, on a par with milk), iron, niacin and protein, and yet low in sodium and calories. Kale has only 43 calories a cup when cooked.
 In the fruit category, it's hard to beat apples for year-round, economical, nutritious and versatile fare that can be a part of any meal or served as a snack or dessert (as in baked apples). Bananas are also handy; even when overripe, they can be mashed and used to make banana bread or a smoothie. 
 Here are some other tips for busy cooks concerned about nutrition and cost:
 Buy family-size packages of meat or poultry; divide them up and freeze meal-size portions, labeled and dated.
 Choose the less expensive store brands of canned and frozen produce.
 Use powdered reconstituted milk for cooking.
 Cook in batches, enough for two or more meals, and freeze single portions for lunch.
 Use meat, poultry and fish as a condiment, in small amounts added to main-dish salads, soups and sauces.
 Try main-dish soups and salad for filling yet low-calorie meals. Soups can also be made in large amounts and frozen.
 Consider buying a slow cooker for efficient, one-dish meals.
 Recipe: Five Dishes for Lean Times
 The following recipes for affordable, nutritious dishes are designed for busy health- and wallet-conscious cooks. They are based on recipes published in ''Jane Brody's Good Food Book'' and ''Jane Brody's Good Food Gourmet.'' Here's to your health, if not wealth.
 Pork and Potato Chowder
 1/4 pound lean smoked pork or Canadian bacon, finely diced
 1 teaspoon olive oil
 1 cup chopped onion
 4 cups diced potatoes
 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley or 1 teaspoon dried parsley flakes (optional)
 2 cups boiling water
 1 cup corn kernels
 2 cups low-fat milk
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 Dash hot pepper sauce, or to taste
 Salt, if desired
 1. In a nonstick skillet, briefly cook the pork or bacon, stirring to prevent burning.
 2. Add the oil and onion, and saute the onion until it is golden.
 3. In a large saucepan, combine the pork and onion with the potatoes and parsley (if using). Add the water, bring the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer the mixture for about 20 minutes.
 4. Add the corn and milk. Heat but do not boil, simmering the chowder for about five minutes. Add the pepper, hot pepper sauce and salt (if using).
 Serves: Four
 Lentil Soup With Collards 
 1 1/2 cups beef broth
 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 cups water, as needed
 1 cup lentils
 1 cup diced carrots
 1 cup chopped onions, divided
 1/2 cup finely diced smoked pork or ham (optional)
 1 teaspoon butter or margarine
 1/2 cup chopped celery
 2 cloves garlic, minced
 4 cups packed, coarsely chopped collard greens (or Swiss chard or spinach)
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 1. In a large saucepan, bring the broth and 2 1/2 cups water to a boil. Add the lentils, carrots, 1/2 cup of the onions and the pork (if using). Return the mixture to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pan and simmer the mixture for 30 minutes.
 2. Meanwhile, melt the butter or margarine in a small skillet and saute the remaining onion and celery for five minutes. Add the garlic and saute it, stirring, a minute longer. Set the vegetables aside.
 3. After the lentils have simmered for 30 minutes, added the reserved vegetables and the collard greens. Cover the pain and simmer the soup 20 minutes longer, adding more water if needed. Stir in the pepper.
 Serves: Four to six
 Turkey Cabbage Soup
 1 pound ground turkey
 1 cup chopped onion
 1 46-ounce can tomato or tomato-vegetable juice
 1 1/4 pounds green cabbage, cored and chopped
 3 large carrots, peeled and chopped
 2 or 3 ribs celery, chopped
 1 bouillon cube or packet
 Salt to taste (optional)
 Freshly ground black pepper to taste
 Water, if needed
 1. In a large nonstick skillet, brown the turkey with the onion, breaking up the turkey into small bits. Transfer the mixture to a large saucepan.
 2. Add the tomato or tomato-vegetable juice, cabbage, carrots, celery, bouillon cube or packet, salt (if using) and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce the heat, cover the pan and simmer the soup for 1 1/2 hours, adding water if the soup gets too thick.
 Serves: Six to eight
 Simple Tuna Salad
 1 6 1/2-ounce can water-packed tuna, drained
 1 cup low-fat creamed cottage cheese
 1 rib celery, finely chopped
 1 or 2 scallions, chopped
 1. Place the tuna in a medium-sized bown and flake it with a fork. 
 2. Add the remaining ingredients and combine them well.
 Serves: Two or three
 Black Bean Burritos
 Sauce 
 1 14- or 16-ounce can whole tomatoes, drained
 1/4 cup minced onion
 1 tablespoon minced jalapenos
 Burritos
 8 10-inch flour tortillas
 2 cups cooked and drained black beans
 1/2 cup finely chopped red onion
 1 cup grated Monterey Jack, divided
 1 avocado, diced, for garnish (optional)
 2 to 4 tablespoons minced cilantro for garnish (optional)
 1. In a blender, puree the tomatoes with the onion and jalapeno and set the sauce aside.
 2. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 3. In a heated skillet, soften a tortilla for about 10 seconds on each side. Spread 1/4 cup of the beans across the middle of the tortilla and top with 1 tablespoon of the red onion and 1 1/2 tablespoons of the cheese. Wrap the tortilla around the filling and place it seam side down in a greased baking pan. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, placing them side by side in the pan.
 4. Spoon the reserved sauce over the burritos, and sprinkle them with the remaining cheese.
 5. Place the pan in the hot oven and bake the burritos for 15 minutes, or until the cheese melts and the burritos are hot.
 6. Serve topped with the diced avocado and cilantro, if desired.
 Serves: Four
 Potato-Salmon Croquettes 
 1 7 1/2-ounce can salmon

HEADLINE: A Plea to Keep Cameras Rolling in New York

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Even the film and television industry, one of the few fields generating profits in the throes of this recession, says it needs government help to stay in New York.
 At a news conference at Kaufman Astoria Studios in Queens, dozens of film and television workers gathered on Monday to ask politicians to expand the incentive program offered to their industry in the past few years, not scale it back as planned. 
 The program, which offers studios tax credits from the city and state for up to 35 percent of the production costs -- 30 percent from the state and 5 percent from the city -- has been so successful that the state has already paid out the $690 million that was to last through 2013. 
 That money was expected to generate nearly $2.7 billion in state and local taxes through the end of the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report by Ernst & Young. The program's advocates say it could create and preserve 19,000 jobs and generate $200 million in additional tax revenue for the state in the next 12 to 18 months alone. 
 But the state, facing its own fiscal restraints, is limiting its portion of the program's future financing. At a breakfast held by the Association for a Better New York last week, Marisa Lago, president of the Empire State Development Corporation, suggested an alternative program that would cut the state tax break to 20 percent from 30 percent and limit the total amount distributed to $100 million a year.
 ''We are committed to this vital industry, and we are working to ensure that New York remains in front of the cameras,'' she said. ''Funding to this important program has not been cut, but exhausted due to its immense popularity with the film and television industry.''
 Workers say the program has been crucial in recruiting efforts.
 ''If it weren't for the credit, this show would not be shooting in New York,'' said Richard Masur, an actor and former president of the Screen Actors Guild, standing on the set of the television program ''Life on Mars.''
 He said that there had already been a fall-off since the money had run out. There were 19 television pilots filmed locally in 2008, but none even planned for 2009. 
 Douglas C. Steiner, chairman of Steiner Studios, said that when he met with budget officials at the major movie studios in Los Angeles last week, they told him that studios would not consider New York as a filming site without firm incentives.
 ''They're not going to bother budgeting for something they don't know is for sure,'' he said.
 The film industry itself is not the only beneficiary of the tax credits.
 Beth Kushnick, the set decorator for the science fiction drama ''Fringe,'' which is relocating to Vancouver in May, said the show had 200 workers here, most of whom would lose their jobs. Last week, when the program rented a restaurant on Broadway to use for a set, workers bought food and picked up extra props at local businesses.
 She added that the program tried to make a donation to the block associations of the neighborhoods it filmed in. For a shoot in Brooklyn on Monday, the program made donations to a waterfront planning association and a soup kitchen in Greenpoint.
 The incentives benefit film productions throughout the state. The filmmaker Ang Lee's work on a movie about Woodstock near Albany brought about $8 million in revenue to that area, said Sam Freed, the New York president of the Screen Actors Guild. He said the incentive helped keep it in the area, even though the filmmaker had attractive offers to film it elsewhere.
 ''That film was on its way down to North or South Carolina,'' he said.
 And then there is the global effect. Maxine Kaplan, president of the Prop Company -- Kaplan & Associates, said that two of the seven workers she employs are from Tibet and depend on their salaries to send money to relatives overseas.

HEADLINE: Nortel Loses $2.14 Billion On Declining Revenue

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TORONTO 

 BODY:
The Nortel Networks Corporation, the telecommunications equipment company, said Monday that its fourth-quarter loss widened as the weak economy led customers to lower or defer spending. 
 Nortel, which is operating under bankruptcy protection, reported a loss of $2.14 billion, or $4.28 a share, which compared with a loss of $844 million, or $1.70 a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 15 percent, to $2.72 billion from $3.2 billion in the same quarter in 2007.
 The company said its fourth-quarter loss included a $1.24 billion noncash write-down of its good will and a $951 million noncash charge to raise the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets.
 Excluding one-time items, Nortel earned 36 cents a share.
 The company, which is based in Toronto, filed for creditor protection Jan. 14 in Canada and the United States.
 The chief executive, Mike S. Zafirovski, said that the company was working on a plan that would allow it to emerge from bankruptcy protection as a viable business. Nortel announced last week that it planned to cut its work force by 3,200 jobs worldwide.
 ''The market continued to deteriorate and customers either reduced or deferred spending,'' Mr. Zafirovski said in a statement.
 Nortel said Pavi Binning, the chief financial officer, would take on the duties of chief restructuring officer.
 Henry Dewing, a research analyst at Forrester, said the move suggested Nortel will try to sell off some assets. But, he added, ''they are not disappearing.''
 Mr. Dewing said he expected Nortel to emerge as an important player in the telecommunications industry but said it was an open question whether the company would be as prominent as it once was.

Because of an editing error, an article on Feb. 6 about the possible lessons the United States could draw from Japan's attempts to recover from a severe downturn after the bursting of a real estate bubble in the late 1980s referred incorrectly to the steps the country took to try to stimulate its economy. Although the country spent trillions of dollars on infrastructure projects and cleaned up the debt-ridden banking system, it did not reduce consumption taxes to encourage consumer spending. (The government raised the tax in 1997 over the objection of many economists in an attempt to reduce growing budget deficits.)

HEADLINE: The Never-Ending Bailout

 BODY:
Americans awoke to the news on Monday that federal officials had spent yet another feverish weekend concocting yet another bailout. This time, the Obama Treasury Department -- sounding a lot like the Bush Treasury Department -- promised another $30 billion to the American International Group, the giant insurer.
 It was the fourth time since September that taxpayers have been called upon to rescue A.I.G. from collapse. It brings the bailout commitment for that one company to some $160 billion. 
 In a joint statement with the Federal Reserve on Monday, the Treasury justified the move, saying that ''the potential cost to the economy and the taxpayer of government inaction would be extremely high.'' 
 That's a textbook rationale for any bailout. What no one is saying -- the Bush folks wouldn't, and the Obama team seems to have taken the same vow of Wall Street omerta -- is which firms would be most threatened by an A.I.G. collapse. The Treasury and the Federal Reserve noted in their statement that A.I.G. is a ''significant counterparty to a number of major financial institutions.'' 
 That means that by enabling A.I.G. to avert bankruptcy proceedings, the taxpayer is also bailing out -- whom exactly? 
 Not knowing is not acceptable. At this stage of a deepening crisis, no one is arguing that the government should let A.I.G. collapse into a disorderly bankruptcy. It is too interconnected. During the housing bubble, it used unregulated derivatives to insure mortgage securities that turned out to be toxic -- without putting aside reserves in case it had to pay up. If it now went under, there could be a chain of catastrophic defaults among banks that hold the securities and related investments. 
 The A.I.G. bailouts fail the basic test of transparency: Who ends up with the money? Major financial institutions are not innocent victims of A.I.G.'s demise. They are sophisticated investors, and they should have known the risks being taken -- and who profited mightily from the relationship before it all came crashing down. 
 Whomever the recipients are, they should be investigated for their roles in the crash and, to the extent possible, be made to pay for the bailouts. 
 The serial A.I.G. bailouts are especially problematic for their connection to the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs. At the time of the first A.I.G. rescue last fall, it was reported by Gretchen Morgenson in The Times that Goldman was A.I.G.'s largest trading partner, with some $20 billion of business tied into the insurer. Goldman has said that its exposure to risk from A.I.G. was offset, or hedged, by other investments.
 What is certain is that Goldman has lots of friends in high places -- yet one more reason why this bailout has to be as transparent as possible. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chief executive, was the only Wall Street executive at a September meeting at the New York Federal Reserve to discuss the initial A.I.G. bailout. Also involved in the discussion was the then head of the New York Fed, Timothy Geithner, who is now President Obama's Treasury secretary. 
 It is also painfully clear that more of the same black-hole bailouts are failing to restore stability or confidence. Stock markets worldwide tanked on Monday. A growing chorus of economists and commentators -- including this page -- are urging the Obama administration to adopt a more comprehensive solution: a government-run restructuring, or nationalization. 
 The government would not only take an ownership stake in firms that require extensive and ongoing bailouts -- as it has done with A.I.G. and Citigroup -- but also direct control of the weakest ones. It would get a realistic assessment of the assets crippling them and revamp their finances before returning them to the private sector, where they would be smaller and healthier and could start lending again. 
 We know that many Americans are uncomfortable with the word nationalization -- politicians even more so. But each new bailout of old losers only feeds mistrust of the government and weakens public support for the even tougher decisions to come.

HEADLINE: Dish Network's Income Up Despite Subscriber Loss

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Dish Network, a satellite TV provider, said income rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter despite its biggest-ever drop in subscribers.
 Dish said it lost 102,000 net subscribers in the period, compared with the average forecast for an addition of about 20,000 subscribers, according to a survey of five Wall Street analysts. In the year-earlier period, Dish added 85,000 customers. 
 Dish said customer defections were likely to continue because a marketing partnership with AT&T ended on Feb. 1. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Dish said the partnership had been a substantial contributor to subscriber growth in the last few years.
 The company, based in Denver, said it earned $216.6 million, or 48 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, up from $175 million, or 39 cents a share, a year earlier. 
 Revenue rose 1 percent, to $2.92 billion, just shy of the analysts' forecast of $2.95 billion from $2.89 billion. 
 ''Unfortunately, 2009 looks poised to be worse,'' Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, wrote in a note to clients. ''Without AT&T, gross additions will face continued downward pressure. And a worsening economy poses a stiff headwind to any hopes of churn improvement.'' 
 Dish said it ended the year with 13.68 million subscribers, down from 13.78 million at the end of 2007. Average revenue per user increased to $69.27 from $65.83.
 Dish also cited weaker economic conditions, the ailing housing market, signal theft and other forms of fraud, and operational inefficiencies for the subscriber losses. 
 Last year ''was kind of a year where our goal was to stop getting worse,'' said Charles W. Ergen, the chief executive. ''In 2009, we are now prepared to go forward by getting better and it's just easier to manage a company when you are trying to get better than when you are trying to stop getting worse.''
 Stock in Dish, which is based in Englewood, Colo., fell $1.32, or 12 percent, to $9.93 a share.

HEADLINE: Spending Rises, but Most Signs Slip

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Consumer spending rose in January after falling for a record six straight months, pushed higher by purchases of food and other nondurable items. But the increase is expected to be fleeting given the problems facing the economy. 
 Several new reports on Monday showed little sign of an economic rebound, with nonresidential construction spending falling to its lowest level in more than a decade and manufacturing activity contracting for a 13th straight month.
 The Commerce Department report on consumers showed spending rose 0.6 percent in January, better than the 0.4 percent gain that economists had expected.
 Personal incomes rose 0.4 percent in January, partly reflecting the cost-of-living adjustments provided to millions of Social Security recipients. Still, that was better than the 0.2 percent decline economists had expected.
 The personal savings rate surged to 5 percent, the highest level since 1995 as consumers continued to sock away more of their incomes. The government calculates the savings rate as a percentage of after-tax income. The growth, from 3.9 percent in December, partly reflected an increase of 1.7 percent in after-tax income.
 The 0.6 percent increase in consumer spending followed a record six straight monthly declines.
 The January increase was driven by a 1.3 percent rise in purchases of nondurable goods, particularly food. Durable goods, products expected to last at least three years, posted a 0.1 percent increase as Americans again avoided spending on cars and other large items.
 While the 0.6 percent increase in consumer spending was the largest since May, analysts did not expect the strength to continue in a recession that is already the longest in a quarter-century.
 The Commerce Department also reported that construction spending fell 3.3 percent in January, more than twice as much as economists had expected. Residential construction fell 2.9 percent and nonresidential activity was down 4.3 percent, the biggest decline since January 1994.
 Meanwhile, the Institute for Supply Management, a trade group, said its measure of manufacturing activity showed the sector contracting for a 13th straight month in February. The index rose slightly, to 35.8 from 35.6 in January. A reading below 50 indicates that manufacturing is contracting. Analysts had expected a decline to 33.8.
 Concern about the economic downturn drove investors away from stocks and into fixed-income securities like United States Treasuries.
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 1 8/32, to 99, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.86 percent, down from 3.01 percent late Friday.
 Following are the results of Monday's auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: HSBC Seeks $18 Billion From Investors

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
HSBC Holdings, the biggest bank in Europe, decided on Monday to finally draw a line under its troubled subprime mortgage lender as it asked investors for $:12.5 billion, or about $18 billion, of new capital to prepare for further deterioration of the global economy. 
 HSBC, which has not sought capital from the British government, said it would stop writing consumer loans in the United States and wind down the unit, formerly called Household International, which it renamed HSBC Finance, in the next five years. 
 The bank will retain its credit card business and commercial retail bank in the United States, but the closure of most of its HSBC Finance branches and the reduction of 6,100 jobs will signify the end of HSBC's push, started six years ago, to grab a share of the subprime market. 
 In announcing the share sale for about $18 billion, the bank conceded that the acquisition of the business, whose increasing losses ate into group earnings last year, had been a mistake. But it also said it would have to continue to inject capital into the business until its closing as impairment charges were likely to increase.
 ''With the benefit of hindsight, this is an acquisition we wish we had not undertaken,'' the HSBC chairman, Stephen Green, said at a news conference in London.
 HSBC's bad loan charges amounted to about $53 billion over the last three years, most of that from the United States unit. The bank wrote off $10 billion for the entire value of the American business, but the unit still has a mortgage portfolio of $62 billion.
 Mr. Green added that HSBC remained committed to the United States, but now must rethink its strategy there. 
 Any new strategy would be closely linked to HSBC's goal of further shifting earnings toward Asia, Latin America and other emerging markets. Mr. Green said any new lending business in the United States would be linked to operations elsewhere, like offering products to Hispanics in the United States by using existing networks in Latin America.
 ''The sensible thing for HSBC would have been not to buy Household in the first place,'' said Colin Morton, an investment director at Rensburg Fund Management in Leeds, England. ''But they are right to get rid of it, and now they should be in a pretty good position to get some high-quality business.''
 HSBC said it planned to use part of the capital increase for acquisitions, but ruled out any large takeovers. The bank plans to raise the money it needs in a rights issue by offering new shares to existing investors. It has been fully underwritten by a group of banks led by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Cazenove.

HEADLINE: Thomson Reuters Plans Video-on-Demand Service

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Thomson Reuters will announce on Tuesday an ambitious new video-on-demand service for its financial services clients, with thousands of searchable videos and transcripts on a range of topics, hoping to become a one-stop source for business people. 
 The Web-based service, which will be introduced in the next few months, differs significantly from existing sources of financial news video reports. It has no television outlet and no programming schedule -- each piece is viewed only on demand -- and it will not be open to the general public.
 ''We've created something completely new here,'' Devin Wenig, chief executive of the company's markets division, said in an interview in his office above Times Square, where he demonstrated the service. ''This is meant for the 550,000 financial professionals who have a Thomson Reuters screen on their desks.''
 The hope is not to compete directly with established sources like CNBC or Bloomberg Television, but to create a new niche -- and make the company's core business of financial data and news more attractive in the competition with Bloomberg and Dow Jones Newswires. The Thomson Reuters service has features that allow especially fast access to specific pieces of video, whether produced in a studio or recorded at a conference or a hearing. Each video is accompanied on screen by a searchable transcript, with a set of key words highlighted at the top. Clicking anywhere on the transcript causes the video to jump to that point.
 A user can search the entire database of videos for any that mention a particular topic, person, industry or company. And the service can compile a montage that pulls out the quick bits of relevant video on a subject and strings them together.
 Mr. Wenig said that in designing the service, Thomson Reuters emphasized speed in finding and displaying videos. The Wall Street that emerges from the current economic crisis, he said, will be not only smaller, but much younger, populated by a generation accustomed to instant searches and on-demand services.
 The company has built bare-bones television studios in its offices in New York City, London and Hong Kong, and is training its news staff to produce short video reports on the topics they cover. The company will not say what kind of investment went into the new service.
 The site is built around a series of ''vertical'' channels on broad topics, each with a set of subchannels. Thomson Reuters wants its clients, like research firms, banks and investment firms, to supply video of their own people discussing financial news, and even create their own channels on the site. It says a number of companies have already signed on, though it would name only a few, like the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Argus Research.
 ''I don't think anyone else has deployed something like this, though no doubt they will,'' said Paul G. Hayward, associate director of broadcast and digital communications at the mercantile exchange. ''I'm quite excited about it.''
 Most eligible Thomson Reuters clients will gain access to the service in June, but a few hundred have been already begun using a test version. Subscribers to the company's premium service will be allowed to use it, and subscribers at lower levels will be able to buy access for an additional charge.

HEADLINE: Patching a Wound

BYLINE: By DUFF WILSON

DATELINE: BOSTON 

 BODY:
In a first-year pharmacology class at Harvard Medical School, Matt Zerden grew wary as the professor promoted the benefits of cholesterol drugs and seemed to belittle a student who asked about side effects.
 Mr. Zerden later discovered something by searching online that he began sharing with his classmates. The professor was not only a full-time member of the Harvard Medical faculty, but a paid consultant to 10 drug companies, including five makers of cholesterol treatments.
 ''I felt really violated,'' Mr. Zerden, now a fourth-year student, recently recalled. ''Here we have 160 open minds trying to learn the basics in a protected space, and the information he was giving wasn't as pure as I think it should be.''
 Mr. Zerden's minor stir four years ago has lately grown into a full-blown movement by more than 200 Harvard Medical School students and sympathetic faculty, intent on exposing and curtailing the industry influence in their classrooms and laboratories, as well as in Harvard's 17 affiliated teaching hospitals and institutes. 
 They say they are concerned that the same money that helped build the school's world-class status may in fact be hurting its reputation and affecting its teaching. 
 The students argue, for example, that Harvard should be embarrassed by the F grade it recently received from the American Medical Student Association, a national group that rates how well medical schools monitor and control drug industry money. 
 Harvard Medical School's peers received much higher grades, ranging from the A for the University of Pennsylvania, to B's received by Stanford, Columbia and New York University, to the C for Yale.
 Harvard has fallen behind, some faculty and administrators say, because its teaching hospitals are not owned by the university, complicating reform; because the dean is fairly new and his predecessor was such an industry booster that he served on a pharmaceutical company board; and because a crackdown, simply put, could cost it money or faculty. 
 Further, the potential embarrassments -- a Senate investigation of several medical professors, the F grade, a new state law effective July 1 requiring Massachusetts doctors to disclose corporate gifts over $50 -- are only now adding to pressure for change.
 The dean, Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, who says he wants Harvard to catch up with the best practices at other leading medical schools, recently announced a 19-member committee to re-examine his school's conflict-of-interest policies. The group, which includes three students, is to meet in private on Thursday. 
 Advising the group will be Dr. David Korn, a former dean of the Stanford Medical School who started work at Harvard about four months ago as vice provost for research. Last year he helped the Association of American Medical Colleges draft a model conflict-of-interest policy for medical schools. 
 The Harvard students have already secured a requirement that all professors and lecturers disclose their industry ties in class -- a blanket policy that has been adopted by no other leading medical school. (One Harvard professor's disclosure in class listed 47 company affiliations.)
 ''Harvard needs to live up to its name,'' said Kirsten Austad, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student who is one of the movement's leaders. ''We are really being indoctrinated into a field of medicine that is becoming more and more commercialized.''
 David Tian, 24, a first-year Harvard Medical student, said: ''Before coming here, I had no idea how much influence companies had on medical education. And it's something that's purposely meant to be under the table, providing information under the guise of education when that information is also presented for marketing purposes.''
 The students say they worry that pharmaceutical industry scandals in recent years -- including some criminal convictions, billions of dollars in fines, proof of bias in research and publishing and false marketing claims -- have cast a bad light on the medical profession. And they criticize Harvard as being less vigilant than other leading medical schools in monitoring potential financial conflicts by faculty members. 
 Dr. Flier says that the Harvard Medical faculty may lead the nation in receiving money from industry, as well as government and charities, and he does not want to tighten the spigot. ''One entirely appropriate source, if done properly, is industrial funds,'' Dr. Flier said in an interview.
 And school officials see corporate support for their faculty as all the more crucial, as the university endowment has lost 22 percent of its value since last July and the recession has caused philanthropic contributors to retrench. The school said it was unable to provide annual measures of the money flow to its faculty, beyond the $8.6 million that pharmaceutical companies contributed last year for basic science research and the $3 million for continuing education classes on campus. Most of the money goes to professors at the Harvard-affiliated teaching hospitals, and the dean's office does not keep track of the total. 
 But no one disputes that many individual Harvard Medical faculty members receive tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars a year through industry consulting and speaking fees. Under the school's disclosure rules, about 1,600 of 8,900 professors and lecturers have reported to the dean that they or a family member had a financial interest in a business related to their teaching, research or clinical care. The reports show 149 with financial ties to Pfizer and 130 with Merck.
 The rules, though, do not require them to report specific amounts received for speaking or consulting, other than broad indications like ''more than $30,000.'' Some faculty who conduct research have limits of $30,000 in stock and $20,000 a year in fees. But there are no limits on companies' making outright gifts to faculty -- free meals, tickets, trips or the like. 
 Other blandishments include industry-endowed chairs like the three Harvard created with $8 million from sleep research companies; faculty prizes like the $50,000 award named after Bristol-Myers Squibb, and sponsorships like Pfizer's $1 million annual subsidy for 20 new M.D.'s in a two-year program to learn clinical investigation and pursue Harvard Master of Medical Science degrees, including classes taught by Pfizer scientists. 
 Dr. Flier, who became dean 17 months ago, previously received a $500,000 research grant from Bristol-Myers Squibb. He also consulted for three Cambridge biotechnology companies, but says that those relationships have ended and that he has accepted no new industry affiliations.
 That is in contrast to his predecessor as dean, Dr. Joseph B. Martin. Harvard's rules allowed Dr. Martin to sit on the board of the medical products company Baxter International for 5 of the 10 years he led the medical school, supplementing his university salary with up to $197,000 a year from Baxter, according to company filings. 
 Dr. Martin is still on the medical faculty and is founder and co-chairman of the Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center, which researches degenerative diseases, and actively solicits industry money to do so. Dr. Martin declined any comment. 
 A smaller rival faction among Harvard's 750 medical students has circulated a petition signed by about 100 people that calls for ''continued interaction between medicine and industry at Harvard Medical School.'' 
 A leader of the group, Vijay Yanamadala, 22, said, ''To say that because these industry sources are inherently biased, physicians should never listen to them, is wrong.''
 Encouraging them is Dr. Thomas P. Stossel, a Harvard Medical professor who has served on advisory boards for Merck, Biogen Idec and Dyax, and has written widely on academic-industry ties. ''I think if you look at it with intellectual honesty, you see industry interaction has produced far more good than harm,'' Dr. Stossel said. ''Harvard absolutely could get more from industry but I think they're very skittish. There's a huge opportunity we ought to mine.''
 Brian Fuchs, 26, a second-year student from Queens, credited drug companies with great medical discoveries. ''It's not a problem,'' he said, pointing out a classroom window to a 12-story building nearby. ''In fact, Merck is right there.''
 Merck built a corporate research center in 2004 across the street from Harvard's own big new medical research and class building. And Merck underwrites plenty of work on the Harvard campus, including the immunology lab run by Dr. Laurie H. Glimcher -- a professor who also sits on the board of the drug maker Bristol-Myers Squibb, which paid her nearly $270,000 in 2007.
 Dr. Glimcher says industry money is not only appropriate but necessary. ''Without the support of the private sector, we would not have been able to develop what I call our 'bone team' in our lab,'' she said at a recent student and faculty forum to discuss industry relationships. Merck is counting on her team to help come up with a successor to Fosamax, the formerly $3 billion-a-year bone drug that went generic last year. But Dr. Marcia Angell, a faculty member and former editor in chief of The New England Journal of Medicine, is among the professors who argue that industry profit motives do not correspond to the scientific aims of academic medicine and that much of the financing needs to be not only disclosed, but banned. Too many medical schools, she says, have struck a ''Faustian bargain'' with pharmaceutical companies.
 ''If a school like Harvard can't behave itself,'' Dr. Angell said, ''who can?''

HEADLINE: Getting Enough Sleep

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE NEGRONI

 BODY:
New airplanes like the Airbus 380 and Boeing 777 that are capable of flying nonstop for as much as 20 hours are adding urgency to a question the airlines and the Federal Aviation Administration have long wrestled with: How do you make sure the flight crews get enough sleep?
 In October, the F.A.A. issued an operations bulletin for ''ultra long-range flights'' that doubled the amount of time pilots and flight attendants must remain at their overseas destination. The change to 48 hours from 24 is intended to make sure that flight crews get two full periods of sleep before making the return flight.
 But seven airlines have asked the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to set aside the new requirements, arguing that they would impose ''substantial burdens and costs.'' 
 The F.A.A.'s plan was based on policies that Delta Air Lines had initiated when it began flying to Mumbai, India, in 2006. And Delta has filed a petition with the court arguing that a reversal of the rules could hurt its ability to ''sustain safe and economically viable operations.'' Delta argues that if other airlines do not have to apply at least some of those procedures on their ultra long-range flights, it will be at a competitive disadvantage.
 ''Primary components for pilots flying these flights are that they have a 24-hour rest in advance, a 48-hour layover at the destination and a 24-hour rest period after the flight,'' said a Delta spokeswoman, Betsy Talton. 
 Delta also assigns two captains and two first officers to these flights, one crew to fly the plane and another to take over so the first crew can rest en route. 
 Stephen Powell, a Boeing 777 pilot who regularly flies to Shanghai, Mumbai and Dubai, United Arab Emirates, for Delta, said he was happy that his airline was ahead of the industry in dealing with pilot fatigue. ''We have a culture that embraces how important it is to get crew rest,'' he said. 
 The disagreement is not over making sure that pilots are well rested but how to accomplish that. In suing the F.A.A., the seven airlines -- American, Continental, JetBlue, United, US Airways and two cargo carriers, Atlas Air and Evergreen International -- argue that not enough is known about preventing fatigue in an industry like aviation that works around the clock. 
 For many international flights leaving the United States, workdays begin at night. When crews arrive at the destination ready for bed, the sun is shining. 
 The F.A.A. has spent more than a decade studying the effects of fatigue on workers. Dr. Martin Moore-Ede, a former medical school professor and an expert in fatigue management, has contributed to this as part of a scientific study committee, but he said he did not support the idea that longer layovers would necessarily make more rested pilots.
 ''It's the simple solution, but it is not the best solution,'' said Dr. Moore-Ede, who also consults for American Airlines. He said that the longer one stays at the destination, the more acclimated the body becomes to the foreign time zone.
 While Delta keeps its ultra long-range crews at their overseas destinations for 48 hours, American (with flights from Chicago to Delhi) and Continental (flying from Newark to Hong Kong and India) give their pilots 24 hours. 
 The different approaches present an opportunity to make comparisons that could lead to a more precise understanding of how to avoid fatigue. Dr. Moore-Ede suggests collecting data from each airline as they now operate. 
 ''We can measure using the tools we have,'' he said, ''to answer important questions about how much rest the crew should have, when it should be and how long should the layover be before turning around and coming back again.''
 How much time should be spent on the ground is not the only item in dispute. The F.A.A. is also weighing in on the number of pilots and in-flight sleeping accommodations. 
 Delta uses Boeing 777s with a private sitting-sleeping area for pilots above the cabin, just below the roof of the airplane. There, the pilots can change into pajamas and tuck themselves into a bed or sit in a business class-size seat and read. Three hours of that, Mr. Powell says, and he emerges refreshed. ''We're up there. It's quiet. It's really a good rest.'' 
 Pilots flying American's Boeing 777 airplanes to India can rest in a seat reserved for them in first class or crawl into a smaller, walled-off bunk area outside the cockpit. 
 ''If you have any issues with cramped spaces, the bunk is useless,'' said Scott Shankland, an American pilot. ''You can't sit up in the bunk. It is a horizontal position only. It's not the most desirable, but it is horizontal.'' 
 Mike Rossetti, a captain at American who is on the technical analysis and scheduling committee of the Allied Pilots Association, supports the F.A.A.'s changes. 
 ''The safety of the entire operation critically depends on pilots and flight attendants being able to get adequate rest on the aircraft during the flight,'' he said. ''That's why the quality and quantity of onboard rest facilities is so important.'' 
 Continental Airlines began offering flights that could exceed 16 hours when it started service between Newark and Hong Kong in 2001. But it was not until Delta started its flight to Mumbai in 2006 that any agreement with the F.A.A. was worked out regarding crew rest, staff and layover policies. 
 The F.A.A.'s work with Delta was then modified and applied to other American carriers. Whether the F.A.A. has the right to impose those changes without subjecting them to public comment or conducting a cost benefit analysis, will be argued in court.
 ''To be clear, our reason for filing the lawsuit is because the F.A.A. did not follow the rulemaking process,'' said Tim Wagner, a spokesman for American, which is owned by AMR. 
 For years, reduction of accidents caused by human fatigue has been on the list of the 10 most important safety improvements at the National Transportation Safety Board. It has been looking at the issue not just for pilots and flight attendants but for maintenance workers and air traffic controllers. 
 ''This is a real good start to have a dialogue,'' Mr. Powell, the Delta pilot, said recently, chipper and optimistic before departing for a 16-hour flight to Shanghai. ''This may be just the beginning.''

HEADLINE: Steep Market Drops Highlight Despair Over Rescue Efforts

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS; Bettina Wassener and Judy Dempsey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Fears that the world's economies are even weaker than had been thought ricocheted around the globe on Monday as investors from Hong Kong to London to New York bailed out of stocks. 
 Losses cascaded from one market to the next as concern spread that government efforts had not been enough to stabilize troubled financial institutions or broader economies. Only by Tuesday morning did markets show signs of stabilizing, with key indexes in Asia showing more modest declines.
 But Monday's losses were bad everywhere, and particularly severe in Europe, where an emergency meeting over the weekend ended in bickering and the rejection of a bailout plea from Hungary.
 In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average fell below 7,000 for the first time since 1997 as investors reacted to reports that construction and industrial activity had continued to decline and to a $61.7 billion loss posted by the insurance giant, the American International Group. It was the largest quarterly loss ever for a company. 
 In Britain, the major stock market index lost 5.3 percent, and the performance of the major Italian index was worse, declining 6 percent. With the dollar also gaining, the losses were even greater for international investors in those markets.
 In the United States, the Dow fell 299.64 points, or 4.24 percent, to 6,763.29, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 34.27 points, or 4.66 percent, to 700.82. The Nasdaq composite ended 54.99 points, or 3.99 percent, lower, at 1,322.85.
 Crude oil settled at $40.15 a barrel, down $4.61.
 ''It's pretty despondent everywhere,'' said Dwyfor Evans, a strategist at State Street Global Markets in Hong Kong. ''O.K., there are signs that some of the leading indicators have stabilized to some extent, but it's at a very, very low level, and we're not seeing corporate investment picking up, or consumers starting to spend again -- in other words, the traditional mechanisms by which economies come out of a recession are absent at this time.''
 Hopes that the American economy, which led the world into recession, might lead it back out this year have been fading. 
 Last weekend, Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, wrote in his company's annual report that ''the economy will be in shambles, throughout 2009, and, for that matter, probably well beyond.''
 As if to emphasize the problems, the Institute for Supply Management reported that companies in Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the United States said business was getting much worse, especially in terms of jobs.
 Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics, pointed to the survey in forecasting that the February employment report will show a decline of 785,000 jobs when it is released on Friday. If so, it would be the largest one-month decline in employment in nearly 60 years. 
 Last week, the United States revised its estimate of fourth quarter gross domestic product to show a decline at an annual rate of 6.2 percent, the worst in more than a quarter century. On Monday in reporting that construction activity fell sharply in January, the government also revised the December figure lower. 
 ''That change could move the fourth quarter figure down to a 7 percent decline,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a research firm. 
 Despite the American problems, the dollar has been gaining, particularly against European currencies. The euro slipped to under $1.26, nearing a two-year low and down from a high of almost $1.60 last spring. There was a renewed flight to safety, with the 10-year Treasury bond yield falling to under 3 percent.
 The continued plunge of the stock markets has stunned investors and governments. Over the six months that ended last week, the S.& P. 500 lost 43 percent of its value. There were similar declines during the Great Depression, but since then, the worst six-month performance before the current plunge was a 32 percent fall in 1974 when the world was also in recession.
 While there has been speculation about international cooperation to deal with the growing financial and economic crisis, the European Union summit this weekend provided an indication that few countries were willing to risk their own taxpayers' money to help others.
 ''The E.U. again has proven it is unable to manage a coordinated response to the crisis,'' Commerzbank analysts wrote in a note Monday. ''The problems arising in Eastern Europe will put further pressure on the euro.''
 While all countries are suffering, the United States and some Western European countries still have access to loans, which has enabled them to mount large stimulus plans and bear the costs of bailing out banks.
 But in some other areas, notably Eastern Europe, the value of the local currencies has plunged as economic activity has weakened. That is a perilous path in countries where the government and many homeowners took out loans in foreign currencies, seeking lower interest rates, and now find themselves owing far more than they borrowed.
 Reflecting that fact, over the same six months that the American stock market fell 43 percent, most European and Asian markets did even worse when measured in dollars. The Hungarian market, for example, was off 67 percent, while the German exchange fell 48 percent. 
 Investors have greeted the stimulus spending plans with some hesitation in part because of signs that the financial system continues to weaken. 
 ''We can unleash as many trillions of dollars in stimulus as we wish, but if we don't fix the banking system, we still have a patient in cardiac arrest,'' the chief strategist at Charles Schwab, Liz Ann Sonders, said.
 In addition to the loss at A.I.G., HSBC, the London-based international bank, said it would close its American consumer finance business, which it took on when it acquired Household Finance in 2003, in one of the decade's worst acquisitions. HSBC said it would raise $17 billion in new capital from shareholders. Its shares fell 19 percent, to its lowest level in a decade.
 The A.I.G. loss far exceeded the previous quarterly record deficit of $44.9 billion, set by Time Warner in 2002 when it wrote down the value of AOL. 
 Another factor depressing investors is the dividend cuts that many companies have been forced to make. On Monday, the large regional bank PNC Financial Services Group cut its dividend 85 percent and the International Paper Company cut its by 90 percent. Last week, General Electric cut its dividend 68 percent, and JPMorgan Chase reduced its dividend 87 percent. 
 The surveys of businesses, which ask whether various aspects of business are getting better or worse, showed figures in the low-to-mid 30s in all countries, driven down by sharply lower employment expectations. On those surveys, a figure of 50 indicates that business is neither getting better nor worse, and figures below 40 show a sharp rate of decline.
 That very plunge could augur well in the not-too-distant future, since it appears that production in many areas is running below sales as companies seek to cut costs. 
 ''The intensity of inventory reduction is stunning,'' said Tobias Levkovich, a Citigroup strategist, in a note to clients. ''The depressed level of production relative to final sales argues that there is real potential for production levels to lift'' in the second half of the year, he said, leading to surprisingly good profits.
 For now, at least, few investors expect any such good news. The S.&. P 500 fell 18.6 percent in the first two months of 2009, even before Monday's fall. That was its worst start, exceeding the 18.2 percent fall recorded in the first two months of 1933, another year when a new president took office during an economic and financial crisis. In 1933, the stock market soon turned, and nearly doubled over 12 months.
 The S.& P. 500 has now fallen below, and the Dow is close to, the levels that prevailed on Dec. 5, 1996, when Alan Greenspan, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve, inquired in a speech, ''How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values, which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?''
 It was a question that has been answered over the last 17 months. During that period, the Dow has fallen 52.3 percent, a larger percentage decline than in any bear market since the Great Depression, but nowhere near the 89 percent collapse that took less than three years to complete after the 1929 high.

HEADLINE: Castro, With Entourage, Is Spotted on Strolls in Havana

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
It is not unusual to see people exercising early in the morning in the exclusive Siboney neighborhood on the outskirts of Havana, Cuba's capital. But the old man recently spotted ambling along the side of the road wearing shorts, white socks pulled up high and a track jacket has stood out, neighbors say.
 He moved slowly, shuffling along while looking down at his feet, they said, and he was ringed by security guards and trailed by a dark Mercedes-Benz sedan. 
 ''It was the Comandante,'' insisted one of those who spotted him, using the nickname of Fidel Castro, the convalescing 82-year-old former president who had not been seen in public since he underwent emergency intestinal surgery in July 2006.
 President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, a close friend of Mr. Castro, first disclosed in a speech last week that the former Cuban leader had emerged from the hospital and had begun walks through Havana. ''Fidel went out and they saw him, Fidel walking in the streets in Havana,'' Mr. Chavez said. ''A miracle. The people cried.''
 It could not be confirmed whether there had been any crying, as Mr. Chavez said, nor did the Cuban state media provide their own account of Mr. Castro's recent forays. 
 But there was plenty of anxiety. Some of the Havana residents who had spotted him insisted that their names, sex, and even the exact day in which they saw Mr. Castro not be published to avoid running afoul of the government, which has declared Mr. Castro's illness a state secret. 
 Mr. Castro's brother Raul officially took over the presidency last February, after more than a year and a half as interim leader. On Monday, Raul Castro took a big step toward putting more of his own imprint on the government, replacing or demoting several veteran leaders who had served in his brother's administration and were considered possible successors in a post-Castro Cuba. 
 Among the ousted, according to an announcement on state television, were Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque, a former personal secretary to Fidel Castro, and Economy Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez, as well as numerous others.
 Vice President Carlos Lage lost some of his portfolio, replaced as a cabinet secretary by an army general close to Raul Castro. 
 A State Department spokeswoman declined to comment on what the United States government, which has declared Fidel Castro to be on his deathbed in the past, knew about Mr. Castro's current health.
 But a jogger said he saw an old man ringed by security two weeks ago walking slowly near the Center for Medical and Surgical Research, the state hospital that is widely believed to be treating Mr. Castro. 
 Others said they had spotted Mr. Castro, with his trademark beard, early in the morning moving from the hospital toward Punto Cero, the nickname for Mr. Castro's home about a mile away. One witness said Mr. Castro's son Alejandro had been walking with him one morning.
 A third witness said that Mr. Castro had greeted some government workers whom he encountered on one of his walks.
 Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst who has watched Cuba for decades, believes that Mr. Castro may well be walking, but that his health remains grave. 
 ''God knows, if I were in his condition I'd want a breath of fresh air,'' said Mr. Latell, author of the book ''After Fidel'' and a researcher at the University of Miami's Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies. ''But I don't believe there's any reason to think his health is rebounding. He's still severely, gravely ill.''

HEADLINE: Wars, Endless Wars

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The singer Edwin Starr, who died in 2003, had a big hit in 1970 called ''War'' in which he asked again and again: ''War, what is it good for?''
 The U.S. economy is in free fall, the banking system is in a state of complete collapse and Americans all across the country are downsizing their standards of living. The nation as we've known it is fading before our very eyes, but we're still pouring billions of dollars into wars in Afghanistan and Iraq with missions we are still unable to define.
 Even as the U.S. begins plans to reduce troop commitments in Iraq, it is sending thousands of additional troops into Afghanistan. The strategic purpose of this escalation, as Defense Secretary Robert Gates acknowledged, is not at all clear. 
 In response to a question on NBC's ''Meet the Press'' on Sunday, Mr. Gates said:
 ''We're talking to the Europeans, to our allies; we're bringing in an awful lot of people to get different points of view as we go through this review of what our strategy ought to be. And I often get asked, 'Well, how long will those 17,000 [additional troops] be there? Will more go in?' All that depends on the outcome of this strategy review that I hope will be done in a few weeks.''
 We invaded Afghanistan more than seven years ago. We have not broken the back of Al Qaeda or the Taliban. We have not captured or killed Osama bin Laden. We don't even have an escalation strategy, much less an exit strategy. An honest assessment of the situation, taking into account the woefully corrupt and ineffective Afghan government led by the hapless Hamid Karzai, would lead inexorably to such terms as fiasco and quagmire.
 Instead of cutting our losses, we appear to be doubling down.
 As for Iraq, President Obama announced last week that substantial troop withdrawals will take place over the next year and a half and that U.S. combat operations would cease by the end of August 2010. But, he said, a large contingent of American troops, perhaps as many as 50,000, would still remain in Iraq for a ''period of transition.'' 
 That's a large number of troops, and the cost of keeping them there will be huge. Moreover, I was struck by the following comment from the president: ''There will surely be difficult periods and tactical adjustments, but our enemies should be left with no doubt. This plan gives our military the forces and flexibility they need to support our Iraqi partners and to succeed.''
 In short, we're committed to these two conflicts for a good while yet, and there is nothing like an etched-in-stone plan for concluding them. I can easily imagine a scenario in which Afghanistan and Iraq both heat up and the U.S., caught in an extended economic disaster at home, undermines its fragile recovery efforts in the same way that societies have undermined themselves since the dawn of time -- with endless warfare.
 We've already paid a fearful price for these wars. In addition to the many thousands of service members who have been killed or suffered obvious disabling injuries, a study by the RAND Corporation found that some 300,000 are currently suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression, and that 320,000 have most likely experienced a traumatic brain injury.
 Time magazine has reported that ''for the first time in history, a sizable and growing number of U.S. combat troops are taking daily doses of antidepressants to calm nerves strained by repeated and lengthy tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.''
 Suicides among soldiers rose in 2008 for the fourth consecutive year, largely because of the stress of combat deployments. It's believed that 128 soldiers took their own lives last year. 
 Much of the country can work itself up to a high pitch of outrage because a banker or an automobile executive flies on a private jet. But we'll send young men and women by the thousands off to repeated excursions through the hell of combat -- three tours, four tours or more -- without raising so much as a peep of protest.
 Lyndon Johnson, despite a booming economy, lost his Great Society to the Vietnam War. He knew what he was risking. He would later tell Doris Kearns Goodwin, ''If I left the woman I really loved -- the Great Society -- in order to get involved with that bitch of a war on the other side of the world, then I would lose everything at home. All my programs... All my dreams...''
 The United States is on its knees economically. As President Obama fights for his myriad domestic programs and his dream of an economic recovery, he might benefit from a look over his shoulder at the link between Vietnam and the still-smoldering ruins of Johnson's presidency.

HEADLINE: Ravitch Uses His Credibility to Help the M.T.A. With an Unpopular Plan

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Richard Ravitch insists that the fight has not been as lonely as it often looked. Public transit advocates, environmentalists, labor unions, regional planners, building contractors, editorial writers, chambers of commerce and civic groups, he says, have also gotten on board. 
 But if the Legislature finally agrees this month to spare New York City's subway and bus systems from draconian service cuts and fare increases -- by imposing a regional payroll tax and levying tolls on bridges over the East and Harlem Rivers -- most of those involved in the issue agree that the single-minded Mr. Ravitch would be entitled to much of the credit.
 ''He has been a force of nature throughout this process,'' said Kevin Sheekey, New York City's deputy mayor for government affairs.
 About nine months ago, Gov. David A. Paterson enlisted the 75-year-old Mr. Ravitch, a successful builder and businessman, to help rescue the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. There may be few second acts in American lives, but Mr. Ravitch gamely agreed to reprise the mission he successfully undertook three decades ago for the state's bankrupt Urban Development Corporation and shortly thereafter for the transportation authority as its chairman. 
 In December, after public hearings, Mr. Ravitch's commission concluded that the tax and tolls, coupled with a much more modest fare hike than the transportation authority was proposing, represented the most equitable long-term fix. He faced a dauntingly heavy political lift, but nonetheless believed his assignment would be finished by now, well before Albany confronted the state's own gaping deficit for the fiscal year that begins April 1.
 The political climate he has encountered, however, is very different from the one he found in the 1970s when he helped Gov. Hugh L. Carey deliver the state from an even worse fiscal crisis. These days, the consensus is that Albany has been hobbled by less bipartisanship and weaker leadership.
 Until recently, Mr. Paterson, an unelected governor, appeared to be more consumed by filling Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate seat. As for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, his political capital seemed depleted by his fight to extend term limits, and by the legacy of losing a battle in Albany last year to impose congestion pricing, a fee on drivers entering Manhattan.
 And though Democrats control the Legislature for the first time in decades, they hold a bare majority in the Senate. 
 In the Assembly, Speaker Sheldon Silver had been reluctant to corral recalcitrant Brooklyn, Queens and Bronx legislators; he depends on them for his leadership post, and many of their constituents object to the tolls on bridges into Manhattan that are now toll-free.
 Last week, Mr. Silver offered a compromise. He suggested that all the new tolls equal the base subway fare of $2.
 In the first few years, the lower tolls might not raise as much as Mr. Ravitch had envisioned, but an agreement to impose tolls would offer the potential for more revenue for the transportation authority in the future. 
 As Mr. Silver explained it: ''This plan is partially in response to hours and hours of hearing objections to prior plans and is an attempt to bring about a compromise. That's the role of leadership.'' 
 On Friday, the Senate majority leader, Malcolm L. Smith, said his fellow Democrats would seriously consider Mr. Silver's compromise. But on Monday, he called for a full accounting of the transportation authority's finances to ensure that the latest plan would indeed result in a smaller fare increase and minimal service cuts.
 Since issuing the commission's recommendations, Mr. Ravitch has relentlessly wooed individual legislators, attended town meetings in their districts, conferred with them in person and made repeated trips to Albany.
 ''Dick's put a lot of time into this and has a lot of street cred up there,'' said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a mass transit advocacy group that supports the Ravitch Commission proposals. ''There's a night-and-day difference between this and congestion pricing. The reaction of the political class to Bloomberg and to Dick is 180 degrees.'' 
 As he headed to Albany last week on another lobbying mission, Mr. Ravitch said, ''I do have a good personal relationship with the Legislature, and I've known these people a long time. Shelly has given me every opportunity I could have to make this case,'' Mr. Ravitch added. 
 Mr. Silver hinted at a comparison to Mr. Bloomberg, with whom he has often clashed, when he described Mr. Ravitch's approach. ''His style is not confrontational,'' Mr. Silver said. ''He recognizes, more than most people, the importance of the members of the Legislature and speaks with the appropriate tone to them. 
 ''One of the big difficulties with the M.T.A. is a credibility gap -- a history of two sets of books, of hiding surpluses,'' said Mr. Silver, who became close to Mr. Ravitch during his chairmanship of the transportation authority and through their involvement in Jewish civic affairs. ''I've known Dick for over 30 years. It's not a big leap for me when I can have confidence that these are the numbers that are necessary, when someone with Dick's credibility talks about a very simple equation here: fare hikes and service cuts or more revenue.''
 To help the authority close a projected $3.4 billion deficit through next year and avoid sharp service cutbacks and a 23 percent increase in fare revenues, the Ravitch commission proposed a long-term solution: a payroll tax, coupled with charging the same tolls on the East River bridges as drivers pay at the authority's major crossings, like the Robert F. Kennedy (formerly Triborough) Bridge. Tolls on the Harlem River bridges would match the subway fare. 
 The tolls would take at least 18 months to implement. Meanwhile, any fare increases and reductions in service would be much smaller than those that the authority initially proposed. 
 At Mr. Ravitch's urging, the governor issued a statement last week urging legislators to reach agreement this week and warning that ''the fare increases and service cuts that will happen without this legislation will do further damage to our fragile economy.''
 On Friday, Mr. Sheekey, the deputy mayor, credited Mr. Ravitch and Mr. Silver for advancing the proposal this far. 
 Mr. Silver expressed doubt that the proposal would have survived even this long without Mr. Ravitch's lobbying. ''I don't believe so, not from my perspective,'' he said. 
 For his part, Mr. Ravitch was self-effacing. ''It isn't about me,'' he said, listing others who have supported the commission's recommendations. ''If it were just me, it wouldn't make one whit of difference.''

HEADLINE: In a Helpless Baby, the Roots of Our Social Glue

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
In seeking bipartisan support for his economic policies, President Obama has tried every tip on the standard hospitality crib sheet: beer and football, milk and cookies, Earth, Wind and Fire.
 Maybe the president needs to borrow a new crib sheet -- the kind with a genuine baby wrapped inside. 
 A baby may look helpless. It can't walk, talk, think symbolically or overhaul the nation's banking system. Yet as social emulsifiers go, nothing can beat a happily babbling baby. A baby is born knowing how to work the crowd. A toothless smile here, a musical squeal there, and even hard-nosed cynics grow soft in the head and weak in the knees. 
 In the view of the primatologist Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, the extraordinary social skills of an infant are at the heart of what makes us human. Through its ability to solicit and secure the attentive care not just of its mother but of many others in its sensory purview, a baby promotes many of the behaviors and emotions that we prize in ourselves and that often distinguish us from other animals, including a willingness to share, to cooperate with strangers, to relax one's guard, uncurl one's lip and widen one's pronoun circle beyond the stifling confines of me, myself and mine. 
 As Dr. Hrdy argues in her latest book, ''Mothers and Others: The Evolutionary Origins of Mutual Understanding,'' which will be published by Harvard University Press in April, human babies are so outrageously dependent on their elders for such a long time that humanity would never have made it without a break from the great ape model of child-rearing. Chimpanzee and gorilla mothers are capable of rearing their offspring pretty much through their own powers, but human mothers are not.
 Human beings evolved as cooperative breeders, says Dr. Hrdy, a reproductive strategy in which mothers are assisted by as-if mothers, or ''allomothers,'' individuals of either sex who help care for and feed the young. Most biologists would concur that humans have evolved the need for shared child care, but Dr. Hrdy takes it a step further, arguing that our status as cooperative breeders, rather than our exceptionally complex brains, helps explain many aspects of our temperament. Our relative pacifism, for example, or the expectation that we can fly from New York to Los Angeles without fear of personal dismemberment. Chimpanzees are pretty smart, but were you to board an airplane filled with chimpanzees, you ''would be lucky to disembark with all 10 fingers and toes still attached,'' Dr. Hrdy writes. 
 Our capacity to cooperate in groups, to empathize with others and to wonder what others are thinking and feeling -- all these traits, Dr. Hrdy argues, probably arose in response to the selective pressures of being in a cooperatively breeding social group, and the need to trust and rely on others and be deemed trustworthy and reliable in turn. Babies became adorable and keen to make connections with every passing adult gaze. Mothers became willing to play pass the baby. Dr. Hrdy points out that mother chimpanzees and gorillas jealously hold on to their infants for the first six months or more of life. Other females may express real interest in the newborn, but the mother does not let go: you never know when one of those females will turn infanticidal, or be unwilling or unable to defend the young ape against an infanticidal male. 
 By contrast, human mothers in virtually every culture studied allow others to hold their babies from birth onward, to a greater or lesser extent depending on tradition. Among the !Kung foragers of the Kalahari, babies are held by a father, grandmother, older sibling or some other allomother maybe 25 percent of the time. Among the Efe foragers of Central Africa, babies spend 60 percent of their daylight hours being toted around by somebody other than their mother. In 87 percent of foraging societies, mothers sometimes suckle each other's children, another remarkable display of social trust. 
 Dr. Hrdy wrote her book in part to counter what she sees as the reigning dogma among evolutionary scholars that humans evolved their extreme sociality and cooperative behavior to better compete with other humans. ''I'm not comfortable accepting this idea that the origins of hypersociality can be found in warfare, or that in-group amity arose in the interest of out-group enmity,'' she said in a telephone interview. Sure, humans have been notably violent and militaristic for the last 12,000 or so years, she said, when hunter-gatherers started settling down and defending territories, and populations started getting seriously dense. But before then? There weren't enough people around to wage wars. By the latest estimates, the average population size during the hundreds of thousands of years of human evolution that preceded the Neolithic Age may have been around 2,000 breeding adults. ''What would humans have been fighting over?'' Dr. Hrdy said. ''They were too busy trying to keep themselves and their children alive.'' 
 Dr. Hrdy also argues that our human ancestors became emotionally modern long before the human brain had reached its current average volume of 1,300 cubic centimeters, which is about three times the size of a chimpanzee brain -- in other words, that we became the nicest apes before becoming the smartest. You don't need a bulging brain to evolve cooperative breeding. Many species of birds breed cooperatively, as do lions, rats, meerkats, wolves and marmosets, among others. But to become a cooperatively breeding ape, and to persuade a bunch of smart, hot-tempered, suspicious, politically cunning primates to start sharing child care and provisionings, now that took a novel evolutionary development, the advent of this thing called trust. 
 To explain the rise of cooperative breeding among our forebears, Dr. Hrdy synthesizes an array of new research in anthropology, genetics, infant development, comparative biology. She notes that recent research has overturned the longstanding insistence that humans are a patrilocal species, that is, with women moving away from their birth families to join their husbands. Instead, it seems that young mothers in many traditional societies have their own mothers and other female relatives close at hand, and who better to trust with baby care than your mom or your aunt? New studies have also shown the importance of postmenopausal women to gathering roots and tubers, the sort of unsexy foods that are difficult to disinter and lack the succulent status of, say, a freshly killed oryx, but that just may help feed the kids in hard times. Other anthropologists have made the startling discovery that children have entertainment value, and that among traditional cultures without television or Internet access, a bobble-headed baby is the best show in town. 
 However cooperative breeding got started, its impact on human evolution was profound. With helpers in the nest, women could give birth to offspring with ever longer childhoods -- the better to build big brains and stout immune systems -- and, paradoxically, at ever shrinking intervals. The average time between births for a chimpanzee mother is about six years; for a human mother, it's two or three years. As a result of our combined braininess and fecundity, humans have managed to colonize the planet; exploit, marginalize or exterminate all competing forms of life; build a vast military-industrial complex all under the auspices of Bernard Madoff and with one yeti of a carbon footprint, and will somebody please hand me that baby before it's too late.

HEADLINE: A Moderate Manifesto

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
You wouldn't know it some days, but there are moderates in this country -- moderate conservatives, moderate liberals, just plain moderates. We sympathize with a lot of the things that President Obama is trying to do. We like his investments in education and energy innovation. We support health care reform that expands coverage while reducing costs.
 But the Obama budget is more than just the sum of its parts. There is, entailed in it, a promiscuous unwillingness to set priorities and accept trade-offs. There is evidence of a party swept up in its own revolutionary fervor -- caught up in the self-flattering belief that history has called upon it to solve all problems at once. 
 So programs are piled on top of each other and we wind up with a gargantuan $3.6 trillion budget. We end up with deficits that, when considered realistically, are $1 trillion a year and stretch as far as the eye can see. We end up with an agenda that is unexceptional in its parts but that, when taken as a whole, represents a social-engineering experiment that is entirely new. 
 The U.S. has never been a society riven by class resentment. Yet the Obama budget is predicated on a class divide. The president issued a read-my-lips pledge that no new burdens will fall on 95 percent of the American people. All the costs will be borne by the rich and all benefits redistributed downward. 
 The U.S. has always been a decentralized nation, skeptical of top-down planning. Yet, the current administration concentrates enormous power in Washington, while plan after plan emanates from a small group of understaffed experts. 
 The U.S. has always had vibrant neighborhood associations. But in its very first budget, the Obama administration raises the cost of charitable giving. It punishes civic activism and expands state intervention.
 The U.S. has traditionally had a relatively limited central government. But federal spending as a share of G.D.P. is zooming from its modern norm of 20 percent to an unacknowledged level somewhere far beyond. 
 Those of us who consider ourselves moderates -- moderate-conservative, in my case -- are forced to confront the reality that Barack Obama is not who we thought he was. His words are responsible; his character is inspiring. But his actions betray a transformational liberalism that should put every centrist on notice. As Clive Crook, an Obama admirer, wrote in The Financial Times, the Obama budget ''contains no trace of compromise. It makes no gesture, however small, however costless to its larger agenda, of a bipartisan approach to the great questions it addresses. It is a liberal's dream of a new New Deal.''
 Moderates now find themselves betwixt and between. On the left, there is a president who appears to be, as Crook says, ''a conviction politician, a bold progressive liberal.'' On the right, there are the Rush Limbaugh brigades. The only thing more scary than Obama's experiment is the thought that it might fail and the political power will swing over to a Republican Party that is currently unfit to wield it.
 Those of us in the moderate tradition -- the Hamiltonian tradition that believes in limited but energetic government -- thus find ourselves facing a void. We moderates are going to have to assert ourselves. We're going to have to take a centrist tendency that has been politically feckless and intellectually vapid and turn it into an influential force.
 The first task will be to block the excesses of unchecked liberalism. In the past weeks, Democrats have legislated provisions to dilute welfare reform, restrict the inflow of skilled immigrants and gut a voucher program designed for poor students. It will be up to moderates to raise the alarms against these ideological outrages.
 But beyond that, moderates will have to sketch out an alternative vision. This is a vision of a nation in which we're all in it together -- in which burdens are shared broadly, rather than simply inflicted upon a small minority. This is a vision of a nation that does not try to build prosperity on a foundation of debt. This is a vision that puts competitiveness and growth first, not redistribution first.
 Moderates are going to have to try to tamp down the polarizing warfare that is sure to flow from Obama's uber-partisan budget. They will have to face fiscal realities honestly and not base revenue projections on rosy scenarios of a shallow recession and robust growth next year. 
 They will have to take the economic crisis seriously and not use it as a cue to focus on every other problem under the sun. They're going to have to offer an agenda that inspires confidence by its steadiness rather than shaking confidence with its hyperactivity.
 If they can do that, maybe they can lure this White House back to its best self -- and someday offer respite from the endless war of the extremes.

HEADLINE: A.I.G. Reports Loss of $61.7 Billion as U.S. Gives More Aid

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The federal government agreed Monday morning to provide an additional $30 billion in taxpayer money to the American International Group and loosen the terms of its huge loan to the insurer, even as the insurance giant reported a$61.7 billion loss, the biggest quarterly loss in history.
 The loss of $22.95 a share compared with a fourth-quarter loss in the period a year ago of $5.3 billion or $2.08 a share. For the year, A.I.G. lost $99.3 billion or $37.84 a share, compared with a profit of $6.2 billion or $2.39 a share for 2007.
 In the quarter, A.I.G. took a $21 billion charge related to taxes and wrote down $25.9 billion in assets, including mortgage-back securities and credit-default swaps.
 The company's general insurance business lost $2.8 billion compared with a profit of $2.1 billion in the quarter a year ago. Premiums dropped 16.3 percent to $9.2 billion and earnings from premiums fell 5.9 percent to $10.98 billion. 
 The government intervention would be the fourth time that the United States has had to step in to help A.I.G., the giant insurer, avert bankruptcy. The government already owns nearly 80 percent of the insurer's holding company as a result of the earlier interventions, which included a $60 billion loan, a $40 billion purchase of preferred shares and $50 billion to soak up the company's toxic assets.
 In a conference call Monday, the chief executive, Edward Liddy, who joined A.I.G. in September, said the insurer had drawn down about $38 billion of the $60 billion credit line it received from the government last year.
 Earlier, in an interview on the NBC News program ''Today,'' Mr. Liddy said A.I.G. ''was in much worse condition than I thought.'' In addition, he said: ''The economy is worse. The financial markets are worse.''
 Although he avoided offering a forecast on the first quarter, Mr. Liddy said A.I.G.'s outlook was ''very much going to be influenced by what happens to the condition of the economy and the financial marketplace around the globe.''
 But he tried to reassure policyholders, saying that the insurance portion of the company was in good shape. ''It's all of the other ancillary businesses that are causing this,'' Mr. Liddy said. ''And it's the decline in asset values around the globe.''
 Federal officials, who worked feverishly over the weekend to complete the restructuring, said they thought they had no choice but to prop up A.I.G., because its business and trading activities are so intricately woven through the world's banking system. 
 But the deal also presents more financial risks to taxpayers at a time when the public and Congress have been sharply questioning the wisdom of risking federal money to bail out private enterprises.
 The government's commitment to A.I.G. far eclipses its rescue of other financial companies, including Citigroup, which has received $50 billion in rescue financing, and Bank of America, with $45 billion. 
 Credit rating agencies like Moody's, Fitch Ratings and Standard & Poor's had been preparing to sharply downgrade A.I.G.'s credit ratings on Monday because of the record quarterly loss. That would have forced A.I.G. to default on its debt, threatening to set off shock waves throughout the financial system as banks holding A.I.G. derivatives contracts would probably demand cash collateral and other payments from A.I.G. during a time when it has little to spare.
 The major credit-rating agencies were briefed on the pending deal between A.I.G. and the government, the people involved in the talks said, and they have committed not to downgrade the company's debt as a result.
 ''The steps announced today provide tangible evidence of the U.S. government's commitment to the orderly restructuring of A.I.G. over time in the face of continuing market dislocations and economic deterioration, the Treasury said in a statement.
 Both Fitch Ratings and Moody's Investors Service on Monday affirmed A.I.G.'s senior debt credit ratings, but downgraded its hybrid bonds on the risk that payments may be deferred. Under the deal, the government will commit $30 billion in cash to A.I.G. from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, should the company need it, the Treasury Department said in a statement. A.I.G. is not expected to draw down the money immediately, but the government's commitment was enough to satisfy the rating agencies.
 Another part of the deal would allow A.I.G. to exchange 
 $40 billion in preferred nonvoting shares, which paid a 10 percent dividend, for new preferred shares that do not require a dividend. That would save A.I.G. $4 billion annually.
 To further ease A.I.G.'s debt burden, instead of paying back $38 billion in cash with interest that it has used from a federal credit line, government will convert that into equity in two of the insurer's subsidiaries in Asia -- American International Assurance and the American Life Insurance Company. 
 Both units are performing well. This would give the government direct ownership in those subsidiaries and provide saleable assets to American taxpayers even if the A.I.G. holding company were to default on its loans.
 The government stake in American International Assurance will probably be controversial. The unit had been put up for sale recently, without success. That suggests that the government is giving A.I.G. better terms than private investors were willing to give, exposing the government to further accusations that it is providing a handout to A.I.G.
 Also as part of the deal, the government would agree to lower the interest rate on all remaining A.I.G. debt to match the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor. That would replace the previous rate, which was three percentage points higher than Libor. That move would save A.I.G. $1 billion in interest payments.
 The new cash commitment reached on Sunday represented the fourth time since September that the federal government has taken steps to keep A.I.G. from collapsing. The previous rescues were intended to stabilize A.I.G. and buy it time to restructure. But the rescues were insufficient, in part because A.I.G. has either invested in or insured so many assets that keep losing value as the economy sours.
 In September, the Federal Reserve lent A.I.G. $85 billion when the company suddenly found itself unable to meet a round of cash calls. To secure the emergency loan, A.I.G. issued the Fed warrants for slightly less than 80 percent of the company's shares.
 Officials said at the time that they thought the loan would provide A.I.G. all the cash it could possibly need. The government brought in a Mr. Liddy to sell off some of A.I.G.'s operating units to raise money, since the rescue loan had to be paid back within two years. Mr. Liddy drew up a plan, saying he expected a smaller, well-capitalized version of A.I.G. to remain after the restructuring.
 But in just weeks it became clear that A.I.G.'s problems were so grave the $85 billion would not be enough. It was using up that money alarmingly fast, thus burdening itself with higher than expected debt-servicing costs, because it had to pay the Fed a higher rate of interest on the part of the loan that it drew down.
 In October, the government cut A.I.G. some slack by creating a new $38 billion facility to shore up its securities lending business, and gave the company access to a new commercial paper program, which had a much lower interest rate than the rescue loan.
 But that was not enough either. In mid-November, the government restructured its loans to A.I.G., raising its total commitment to $150 billion. The new arrangement reduced the rescue loan to $60 billion and stretched out its term to five years instead of two. 
 At the same time, it injected $40 billion into A.I.G. in exchange for preferred shares. And it created two special-purpose entities to take the most toxic assets then plaguing A.I.G. out of play.
 Those arrangements kept the government's stake in A.I.G. at 77.9 percent. The government has not wanted to go above 80 percent, because it would then have to consolidate all of A.I.G.'s assets and liabilities into its own finances, putting taxpayers on the hook for the claims of roughly 76 million insurance policyholders around the world.
 While November's restructuring did buy A.I.G. more time, it was not able to sell the operating units that Mr. Liddy put up for sale -- or, when assets were sold, the prices were shockingly low.

HEADLINE: On Health, President Takes Team Approach

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In naming a new team to run health policy for his administration, President Obama has recruited a formidable array of talent, but has not clarified the lines of authority, leaving various appointees to jockey for primacy.
 Mr. Obama announced his intention on Monday to nominate Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas to be secretary of health and human services. 
 He also named Nancy-Ann DeParle to coordinate health policy for the administration. Her position, counselor to the president and director of the White House Office for Health Reform, is not subject to Senate confirmation. 
 In separating the roles of health czar and health secretary, Mr. Obama is adding to an already large stable of experts who will help him in his effort to overhaul the health care system, one of his priorities. It was not immediately clear who would dominate, or who would corral members of the ever-growing team, with their varying viewpoints.
 Mr. Obama's first choice for secretary of health and human services, former Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, was also to have been chief of the White House health office and was widely viewed as likely to be first among equals on health issues. Mr. Daschle withdrew early last month after belatedly paying more than $140,000 in back taxes and interest. In searching for a replacement, Mr. Obama decided to split the duties between two people.
 At the White House news briefing on Monday, Robert Gibbs, the president's press secretary, struggled to say who specifically would lead negotiations with Congress on health care.
 Ms. DeParle will ''head health care reform here in the White House,'' Mr. Gibbs said, but he emphasized that ''a lot of people who work in this building and in different agencies will be involved.''
 ''This isn't something that's just going to lie with one or two people,'' Mr. Gibbs said, adding that that ''the entire economic team'' would be involved.
 Administration officials said Ms. DeParle's office would not be in the West Wing of the White House, a symbolically important location, with proximity to the president. Rather, it will be next door in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Mr. Daschle was to have had offices in the West Wing and at the Department of Health and Human Services.
 Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, said: ''President Obama's health team is talented and has considerable experience, but there will obviously be competing power centers. That raises several questions. Will one of these people be dominant? To what extent will the others coordinate their activities with that individual?''
 In introducing them on Monday, Mr. Obama said Ms. DeParle would provide Ms. Sebelius with ''an excellent partner at the White House.'' But the enterprise has many partners.
 Peter R. Orszag, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, has stepped into the vacuum caused by the vacancy at the top of the health department and has become a dominant voice on health policy within the administration.
 As budget director, Mr. Orszag would have leverage in any event because the cost of legislation to achieve universal coverage is a crucial factor. But Mr. Orszag commands additional respect because, as director of the Congressional Budget Office in 2007-8, he became an expert on health policy and health economics. He prepared two book-length studies analyzing the issue and more than 100 options for cutting costs and expanding coverage.
 Another influential voice at the White House is that of Dr. Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist and medical ethicist. Dr. Emanuel, a brother of Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff, is working for Mr. Orszag and is sometimes described as the kibitzer-in-chief on health policy.
 While all the players agree with Mr. Obama on the goal -- providing affordable health insurance to all-- they have expressed different ideas about how to get there. 
 In a book published last year, for example, Dr. Emanuel proposed ''a guaranteed health care access plan,'' under which all Americans would receive vouchers to enroll in health plans offering a standard package of benefits like those available to members of Congress. The program would be administered by a National Health Board, modeled on the Federal Reserve Board.
 As a House member, Rahm Emanuel showed strong interest in health care. As White House chief of staff, he led negotiations with Congress on the recent economic recovery bill. His top health policy adviser in Congress, Lauren Aronson, has joined him at the White House.
 Others with influence on the issue include Melody C. Barnes, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House, and Lawrence H. Summers, the director of the National Economic Council. Ms. DeParle will not be a member of either council, the White House said.
 Ms. Sebelius, a former president of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, is an expert on insurance regulation, which is likely to be a major component of any comprehensive health legislation.
 Ms. DeParle was commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Human Services from 1987 to 1989. Under President Bill Clinton, from 1997 to 2000, she was administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, now known as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
 Since then, she has gained extensive experience in the business world. That experience, though seen as an asset by many, prompted questions from some of the people vetting personnel for Mr. Obama, supporters of Ms. DeParle said. 
 Ms. DeParle has been a director of large health care companies including Medco Health Solutions, a pharmacy benefit manager; Cerner, a supplier of health information technology, including electronic medical records; Boston Scientific, a medical device company; DaVita, which runs kidney dialysis centers; and Triad Hospitals.
 Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, expressed concern about the proliferation of White House policy czars for health care, urban affairs and climate change.
 ''Too often,'' Mr. Byrd said in a letter to Mr. Obama, ''I have seen these lines of authority and responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-making process.''

HEADLINE: In Turbulent Time for Britain's Premier, a Hope to Bolster U.S. Ties

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
When Gordon Brown talks about the United States, he rarely fails to mention the many summer vacations he has taken on Cape Cod. Perhaps more than any British prime minister since Winston Churchill, he exudes a personal fondness and admiration for America, and he says his experiences there have helped make him a committed ''Atlanticist.''
 But no trip to the United States has been weightier for Mr. Brown than the two-day visit to Washington he will begin on Tuesday with a meeting with President Obama. He will be the first European government leader to visit the White House since Mr. Obama took office, and he said in a weekend newspaper article that he aimed to give new momentum to the ''special relationship'' between Britain and the United States. 
 ''There is no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between Britain and the United States,'' Mr. Brown wrote in The Sunday Times of London. ''I believe there is no challenge so great or so difficult that it cannot be overcome by America, Britain and the world working together,'' he added.
 He said he planned to discuss with Mr. Obama his ideas for ''a global New Deal, whose impact can stretch from the villages of Africa to reforming the financial institutions of London and New York.''
 The British leader seemed undaunted by the comments of Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who said last week that the visit would be an occasion to renew the ''special partnership'' between the two countries, a slight shift in language that had some Britons saying that Mr. Obama might be pulling back from the closeness that had developed between President George W. Bush and Tony Blair, Mr. Brown's predecessor. 
 British newspapers have noted that Mr. Obama's formative experiences abroad were as a child in Indonesia, and that his administration intended to give new priority to American ties in the Pacific. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr. Obama had ordered the removal of a bust of Churchill displayed in the Oval Office under Mr. Bush, and it noted that Mr. Obama devoted 35 pages of his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' to his grandfather's claims of torture under British colonial rule in Kenya. 
 Even reaching the Oval Office before President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany may mean less than meets the eye. Mr. Obama's first presidential visit to Europe will be for an economic summit meeting in London in April. White House officials have pointed to Mr. Brown's chairmanship of the meeting and the need to set common goals for resolving the global financial crisis as central reasons for inviting Mr. Brown first.
 Still, British pundits have cast the visit as an opportunity for Mr. Brown, 58, to begin a revival of his sinking political fortunes at home, and to help his chances of leading the Labor Party to re-election sometime before June next year.
 Part of the bounce Mr. Brown is seeking, the pundits say, could come simply from the fact of meeting with Mr. Obama. The American president continues to receive approval ratings in European polls that are as high or higher than those he has received in the United States, and European leaders hope some of that popularity will rub off on them.
 Mr. Brown has said that he sees himself as a natural partner for Mr. Obama, as a left-of-center leader battling political opponents -- Republicans in the United States, Conservatives in Britain -- who have resisted huge economic stimulus programs and bank bailouts. In his newspaper article, Mr. Brown said he would also seek common ground with Mr. Obama on action to slow climate change and on development aid to the world's poorest countries. 
 One point on which Mr. Brown seems likely to resist his American host is Afghanistan. Britain has deployed more than 8,300 troops there, second only to the United States. However, Britain has said it is reluctant to respond to Mr. Obama's call for more NATO troops to match the increase of 17,000 American troops he announced last month, at least as long as other nations refuse to increase their combat forces. France and Germany's troop commitments are currently a fraction of Britain's.
 Mr. Brown also hopes to benefit in Washington from the plaudits he won last fall for his program to recapitalize Britain's failing banks before the Bush administration adopted that approach. That early surefootedness, from a man who served 10 years as Britain's finance minister, helped Mr. Brown in the polls at home.
 But with unemployment soaring, home prices plunging and the failure of billions injected into the banks to revive credit flows, Labor's recovery has faltered. Recent polls have shown the Conservatives with a lead of 10 percentage points and more.
 Mr. Brown's personal popularity has plunged, too, partly because of what many see as his refusal to acknowledge his failure, as finance minister, to tighten the lax regulation of investment banking and hedge-fund management that financial experts said was a primary contributor to the financial crisis.
 That criticism seems unlikely to relent, especially when comparisons are drawn with Mr. Obama. ''When Obama bungled a key appointment recently, he simply said, 'I screwed up,' '' Martin Ivens, a columnist in The Sunday Times, wrote this weekend. By contrast, Mr. Brown's strictures for one of the British bankers whose missteps forced a multibillion-dollar government bailout, and who then quit with a pension of close to $1 million a year, seemed ''a bit rich,'' Mr. Ivens said, ''when Brown can't bring himself to say 'sorry' for anything.''

HEADLINE: Justice Not for Sale

 BODY:
The Supreme Court hears arguments Tuesday in a case that goes to the heart of the nation's justice system and the rule of law: the right to a fair hearing before an impartial judge, untainted by money or special interests. 
 The case involves a brazen -- and so far successful -- attempt by the chief executive of a large coal company to overturn a major damage award against his firm. A West Virginia jury decided that the coal company, Massey Energy, had fraudulently driven a small competitor, the Harman Mining Corporation, into bankruptcy proceedings. Massey's chief executive, Don Blankenship, decided to appeal. But before that, he spent an extraordinary $3 million to help elect a member of West Virginia's State Supreme Court, Brent Benjamin. 
 When Massey's case came before the West Virginia court, Mr. Benjamin declined to do the right thing and recuse himself. ''No objective information is advanced to show that this justice has a bias for or against any litigant,'' he wrote. Mr. Benjamin subsequently cast the deciding vote to toss out the award against Massey. 
 This case offers the nation's top court the opportunity to make clear that judges who receive outsize campaign contributions have a duty to recuse themselves. Although not all contributions implicate due process, Mr. Blankenship's multimillion-dollar quest to tilt the scales of justice surely does. It is vitally important for the Supreme Court to say so.
 Sadly, the West Virginia case, while extreme, points to an alarming trend. It comes at a moment when judicial neutrality -- and the appearance of neutrality -- basic to due process are under a growing threat from big-money state judicial campaigns and the special-interest contributions that fuel them. 
 Thirty-nine states elect at least some of their judges. Recent years have seen a proliferation of multimillion-dollar judicial races, replete with nasty attack ads and all of the other accoutrements of sleazy partisan politics. This sort of low politics is bad enough in campaigns for legislatures and statehouses. But it must be kept as far away as possible from the nation's courthouses. 
 This case has drawn an unusual array of friend-of-court briefs from lawyers, jurists and business groups, including the Brennan Center for Justice, the Committee for Economic Development and the Conference of Chief Justices. A wise decision would recognize the threat posed by record-breaking fund-raising for judicial elections -- and make clear that judges and justice are not for sale.

PERSON: Jacob T. Schwartz 

HEADLINE: Jacob T. Schwartz, 79, Restless Scientist

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Jacob T. Schwartz, a mathematician and computer scientist who did seminal research in fields as diverse as molecular biology and robotics, died Monday at his home in Manhattan. He was 79.
He died in his sleep of liver cancer, his wife, Diana, said. He was chairman of the computer science department at New York University, which he founded, from 1964 to 1980.
During a career that also included 42 years as a professor at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences at the university, Dr. Schwartz wrote more than a dozen books and more than 100 scientific papers and research reports. At his death Dr. Schwartz was actively working on research in both molecular biology and logic. 
Throughout his life, Dr. Schwartz, who was known as Jack, moved from one scientific field to the next. He was not a dilettante, but mastered each field in turn and then made significant contributions.
''He didn't dabble, he plunged,'' said W. Daniel Hillis, a computer scientist and founder of the Thinking Machines Corporation, an early maker of massively parallel thinking machines.
Invited to spend a summer consulting at the start-up firm in the early 1980s, Dr. Schwartz arrived and asked to see the documentation of the company's CM-1 supercomputer, Dr. Hillis recalled. When he learned that the computer manual did not exist yet, he sat down and wrote it single-handedly.
His most influential publication was one of his first. As a mathematics graduate student at Yale, he worked with Nelson Dunford. The two men cooperated on ''Linear Operators,'' which was published in three volumes in 1958 and remains in print today as a standard in the field, referred to by mathematicians simply as ''Dunford and Schwartz.''
During the 1960s, Dr. Schwartz turned his attention to computing and became involved in the nascent field of computer science.
He spent time as a visiting scientist at I.B.M., which led to a collaboration with two I.B.M. researchers, John Cocke and Frances E. Allen. That led to pioneering work in optimizing compilers, software tools that are used by programmers to increase the performance of application programs. Dr. Allen would later become his second wife.
His background in mathematical algorithms led Dr. Schwartz to develop an early programming language called SETL, based on the mathematical theory of sets. The language was intended to make it possible for programmers to efficiently express algorithms. The language would later influence the designer of the Python programming language, widely used by programmers today.
The Courant Institute had financial support both from the National Science Foundation and from the Atomic Energy Commission and housed an early version of the Control Data Corporation 6600 supercomputer, designed by Seymour Cray.
Dr. Schwartz went out of his way to open the supercomputer to a generation of scientifically inclined high school students who were given access to the machine, which initially could be used by only one user at a time.
In the late 1970s, Dr. Schwartz's interests shifted toward parallel computing, and he designed an innovative early parallel computer called the Ultracomputer.
His later interests ranged as far afield as robotics, to which he made important theoretical contributions on how robots move around obstacles.
In the mid 1980s, he spent a year as the head of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Information Processing and Techniques Office.
While there he shifted the research focus of the organization away from artificial intelligence.
In 1999, Dr. Schwartz became interested in molecular biology and began a multiyear collaboration with Michael Wigler, a professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.
The son of Ignatz and Hedwig Schwartz, Dr. Schwartz was born on Jan. 9, 1930, in the Bronx. He received his bachelor of science degree from City College of New York in 1949 and his master's degree and Ph.D. from Yale.
His marriages to Dr. Allen and to Sandra Weiner ended in divorce. Besides his third wife, Diana, survivors include his daughters, Abby Schwartz of Manhattan and Rachel Fainman of Winnipeg, Manitoba; and a sister, Judith Dunford, the widow of the literary critic Alfred Kazin.
So fearsome was Dr. Schwartz's early reputation as a mathematician that when John Forbes Nash Jr., the Nobel Prize winning mathematician and economist, learned that he was attempting to solve an extremely challenging mathematical problem known as the ''embedding problem,'' he became agitated, apparently fearing Dr. Schwartz might beat him to a solution, said Sylvia Nasar, author of ''A Beautiful Mind,'' a biography of Nash.
Nash's own reputation in mathematics was cemented by his 1954 solution to the embedding problem, which was perceived by mathematicians as a more formidable challenge than game theory, for which he won his Nobel, she said.
''They were at some level of birds of feather, which was probably why Nash was so concerned,'' she said.
Correction: March 10, 2009, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on Wednesday about Jacob T. Schwartz, a mathematician and computer scientist who did research in many fields, misstated the given name of a mathematician with whom he worked as a graduate student at Yale and later wrote a mathematical reference work. He was Nelson Dunford, not Neilson.

HEADLINE: Bigger Woes For Library, As a Buyer Backs Out

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
A decision by Orient-Express Hotels Ltd. to back out of its plans to buy the former Donnell Library building in Midtown Manhattan is likely to deprive the New York Public Library of millions it was counting on. The sum was to help jump-start a $250 million renovation of its central library on Fifth Avenue at 42nd Street.
Orient-Express said on Monday that it wanted to revisit the $59 million agreement because of the global financial crisis and a shortage of credit for construction and real estate development. The Donnell, a five-story building on West 53rd Street, was to be razed to make way for an 11-story hotel, with the library on the first floor and underground. 
The hotel conglomerate said in a statement that it was seeking to ''defer or restructure'' that project.
The company's move is likely to stoke anxiety among cultural organizations with outstanding commitments vital to major capital projects. Many are already reeling from a steep decline in donations and revenue as a result of the economic downturn.
Leaders of such groups say they are watching the situation warily. ''Given the state of the economy, it's a risk that everyone runs,'' said Reynold Levy, president of Lincoln Center, which is currently undergoing a major overhaul of its campus.
Mr. Levy added that so far Lincoln Center had not had ''a single corporation reduce or defer payment'' on its rebuilding effort.
The $59 million sale of the Donnell was to go toward a major renovation by the British architect Norman Foster that would transform the main library on Fifth Avenue into a circulating library. It had received a $7 million deposit from Orient-Express on the Donnell project, according to a person involved in the deal, who requested anonymity because the terms of the deal are confidential; other details remain undisclosed.
The New York Public Library said through a spokesman that it planned to study various options to get Orient Express to honor its commitment. It declined to comment further, citing possible litigation.
Legal experts say the library might have no recourse but to seek damages but suggested that it was unlikely to recover the full $59 million purchase price.
''To require somebody to go through with something, you have to establish how you are damaged,'' said Allan G. Sperling, a corporate lawyer at Cleary Gottlieb in New York. For the library, those damages would involve factoring in how much the Donnell site had diminished in value since Orient-Express agreed to buy it in November 2007. What is more, the library has yet to sell its Mid-Manhattan branch, on the east side of Fifth Avenue at 40th Street, whose circulating collection is to be absorbed into the main library across the street. Proceeds from that sale were also to go toward the Foster renovation.
Given the dire state of the economy, however, the library may have to compromise. ''What is happening quite frequently now is the parties are getting together and renegotiating the agreement,'' Mr. Sperling said. ''It's in everyone's interest to do that, because legal fees are expensive.''
Paul LeClerc, president of the library, and Catherine Marron, its chairwoman, declined to comment. And Melanie Brandman, a spokeswoman for Orient-Express, said the company had no further comment.
The Orient-Express decision stirred speculation about whether the Wall Street financier Stephen A. Schwarzman would make good on a $100 million pledge to the library announced in March 2008, given recent setbacks for his company, the Blackstone Group. But Peter Rose, a Blackstone spokesman, said on Tuesday that Mr. Schwarzman's gift was ''still going ahead,'' unchanged.
The central library renovation is part of a far broader $1.2 billion plan to update the entire system by improving branches, bolstering the endowment and creating two new libraries, in Upper Manhattan and on Staten Island.
When the Orient-Express deal to buy the Donnell, a highly trafficked and popular branch, was announced in 2007, some found the project an uncomfortable conflation of art and commerce. But the library system said it had little choice in relocating the Donnell within the proposed hotel because the branch, built in 1955, was in dire need of renovations that it could ill afford.
The project was to contain 150 hotel rooms costing $750 to $2,000 a night and a restaurant on the top floor. Five floors were to connect to the ''21'' Club on West 52nd Street, also owned by Orient-Express. Construction was originally scheduled to begin this year and to be completed by early 2011.

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Slipped 41% In February

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Despite their offers of deeper discounts, automakers had more trouble luring shoppers into showrooms in February, when vehicle sales fell to their lowest level in 28 years.
Auto companies, which reported sales figures Tuesday, had hoped the market would start to stabilize after months of falling sales. Instead, industry sales slipped 4.9 percent from January, and dropped 41 percent from February of last year.
Every major automaker reported significant declines, and analysts said there was little reason to expect even a mild recovery in the months ahead. 
''It's just stunning how horrible the market is now,'' said Rebecca Lindland, an analyst with IHS Global Insight. ''We are not expecting to see sales recover at all until the consumer recovers.''
Sales in February represent an annualized rate of 9.1 million vehicles, the lowest figure recorded since December 1981, according to MotorIntelligence.com, which tracks sales.
The decline occurred even as auto companies discounted their vehicles by an average of $2,900 -- an 8 percent jump from a month earlier, according to the auto research Web site Edmunds.com. Two years ago, the average incentive was about $2,200, Edmunds said.
The industry has long relied on big discounts to entice consumers in a difficult sales environment. But with unemployment rising and housing prices still depressed, they are not as effective.
''Incentives are helping the few buyers who are in the market to make a purchase, but they are not drawing new buyers at all,'' Ms. Lindland said.
Sales for the month were down 53 percent at General Motors, 48 percent at the Ford Motor Company, 44 percent at Chrysler, 40 percent at Toyota and 38 percent at Honda.
G.M. and Ford both said the steep declines would force even more production cuts at their plants. The companies expect their second-quarter production schedules to be at least one-third lower than in the same period in 2008.
Ford's senior United States economist, Emily Kolinski Morris, said February's decline was particularly disappointing, given that sales had been relatively flat on a month-to-month basis since October.
''It implies that we did not reach the bottom,'' Ms. Kolinski Morris said. ''It may be that this month is now the bottom, but there's no anchor on the economic horizon to allow us to make that call conclusively.''
The drastic slide in sales, which accelerated with the credit crisis last fall, has wreaked havoc on the financial health of auto companies around the world.
G.M. and Chrysler are subsisting on a combined $17.4 billion in government loans, and seeking another $21.6 billion in federal aid to avoid bankruptcy. European auto companies, as well as the Japanese stalwart Toyota, have also requested emergency assistance from their home governments.
Auto executives said Tuesday that the falloff in February increased the need for government support.
G.M., for example, has submitted a restructuring plan to the Obama administration that suggests it will break even if annual industry sales fall in a range of 11.5 million to 12 million vehicles. Last year, the industry sold 13.2 million vehicles, an 18 percent drop from 2008.
''The February numbers are clearly a step down from where we have been running the last four months,'' said Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s chief sales analyst. ''These are obviously unsustainable levels, which are causing almost every auto manufacturer across the world to look for government aid.''
Brian Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, said in a note to clients that the dismal selling rate ''at least reinforces the case to Washington that the unprecedented industry conditions should justify a continued federal bailout.''
Chrysler led the industry in incentives during February, with an average of $5,500 in discounts on each vehicle sold -- which Edmunds said amounted to about 20 percent of the overall price of each car.
The company's head of sales, Steven J. Landry, said the discounts helped Chrysler's retail sales, but not enough to offset a huge drop in sales to fleet customers.
To save money, consumers are moving to used cars. In February, an estimated 27 percent of people who visited a dealership intending to buy a new car opted to buy a used model instead, according to Edmunds. That compares with a 16 percent shift to used cars in recent months.
Tyler Corder, the chief financial officer of Las Vegas-based Findlay Automotive, which operates G.M., Toyota, Honda and other dealerships in four Western states, said used cars had accounted for about half of sales in recent months, up from a more typical 40 percent.
''If they can buy a used car instead and save $10,000, they'll do that,'' he said.
But more have just stayed away from dealerships altogether.
''I really believe they'll get back in the market once they start to read more good news than bad,'' Mr. Corder said. ''People just want to see that maybe we're starting to pull out of the economic slump a little bit.''
Many consumers are postponing or canceling plans to buy a new vehicle, according to a study by the company CNW Research.
More than 60 percent of individuals surveyed in January about their intentions to buy a new car had dropped out of the market by February, according to CNW.
''The primary reason across the board: uncertainty about Washington, D.C.'s plans for the economy,'' said Art Spinella of CNW.

HEADLINE: Casualties Of the Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
What does the worst recession in a generation look like?
It is both deep and broad. Every state in the country, with the exception of a band stretching from the Dakotas down to Texas, is now shedding jobs at a rapid pace. And even that band has recently begun to suffer, because of the sharp fall in both oil and crop prices.
Unlike the last two recessions -- earlier this decade and in the early 1990s -- this one is causing much more job loss among the less educated than among college graduates. Those earlier recessions introduced the country to the concept of mass white-collar layoffs. The brunt of the layoffs in this recession is falling on construction workers, hotel workers, retail workers and others without a four-year degree.
The Great Recession of 2008 (and beyond) is hurting men more than women. It is hurting homeowners and investors more than renters or retirees who rely on Social Security checks. It is hurting Latinos more than any other ethnic group. A year ago, a greater share of Latinos held jobs than whites. Today, the two have switched places. 
If the Great Recession, as some havecalled it, has a capital city, it is El Centro, Calif., due east of San Diego, in the desert of California's Inland Valley. El Centro has the highest unemployment rate in the nation, a depressionlike 22.6 percent.
It's an agricultural area -- because of water pumped in from the Colorado River, which allows lettuce, broccoli and the like to grow -- and unemployment is in double digits even in good times. But El Centro has lately been hit by the brutal combination of a drought, a housing bust and a falling peso, which cuts into the buying power of Mexicans who cross the border to shop.
Until recently, El Centro was one of those relatively cheap inland California areas where construction and home sales were booming. Today, it is pockmarked with ''bank-owned'' for sale signs. A wallboard factory in nearby Plaster City -- its actual name -- has laid off workers once kept busy by the housing boom. Even Wal-Mart has cut jobs, Sam Couchman, who runs the county's work force development office, told me.
You often hear that recessions exact the biggest price on the most vulnerable workers. And that's true about this recession, at least for the moment. But it isn't the whole story. Just look at Wall Street, where a generation-long bubble seems to lose a bit more air every day.
In the long run, this Great Recession may end up afflicting the comfortable more than the afflicted.
--
The main reason that recessions tend to increase inequality is that lower-income workers are concentrated in boom-and-bust industries. Agriculture is the classic example. In recent years, construction has become the most important one.
By the start of this decade, the construction sector employed more men without a college education than the manufacturing sector did, Lawrence Katz, the Harvard labor economist, points out. (As recently as 1980, three times as many such men worked in manufacturing as construction.) The housing boom was like a giant jobs program for many workers who otherwise would have struggled to find decent paying work.
The housing bust has forced many of them into precisely that struggle and helps explain the recession's outsize toll on Latinos and men. In the summer of 2005, just as the real estate market was peaking, I spent a day visiting home construction sites in Frederick, Md., something of a Washington exurb, interviewing the workers. They were almost exclusively Latino.
At the time, the national unemployment rate for Latino men was 3.6 percent. Today, when there aren't many homes being built in Frederick or anywhere else, that unemployment rate is 11 percent. And this number understates the damage, since it excludes a considerable number of immigrants who have returned home.
Frederick was typical of the boom in another way, too. It wasn't nearly as affluent as some closer suburbs. Now the bust is widening that gap.
If you look at the interactive map with this column, you will see the places that already had high unemployment before the recession have also had some of the largest increases. Some are victims of the housing bust, like inland California. Others are manufacturing centers, as in Michigan and North Carolina, whose long-term decline is accelerating. Rhode Island, home to both factories and Boston exurbs, has one of the highest jobless rates in the nation.
All of these trends will serve to increase inequality. Yet I still think the Great Recession will eventually end up compressing the rungs on the nation's economic ladder. Why? For the same three fundamental reasons that the Great Depression did.
The first is the stock market crash. Clearly, it has hurt wealthy and upper middle-class families, who own the bulk of stock, more than others. In addition, thousands of high-paying Wall Street jobs -- jobs that have helped the share of income flowing to the top 1 percent of earners soar in recent decades -- will disappear.
Hard as it may be to believe, the crash will also help a lot of young families. The stocks that they buy in coming years are likely to appreciate far more than they would have if the Dow were still above 14,000. The same is true of future house purchases for the one in three families still renting a home.
The second reason is government policy. The Obama administration plans to raise taxes on the affluent, cut them for everyone else (so long as the government can afford it, that is) and take other steps to reduce inequality. Franklin D. Roosevelt did something similar and it had a huge effect.
Of course, these two factors both boil down to redistribution. One group is benefiting at the expense of another. Yes, many of the people on the losing end of that shift have done quite well in recent years, far better than most Americans. Still, the shift isn't making the economic pie any bigger. It is simply being divided differently.
Which is why the third factor -- education -- is the most important of all. It can make the pie larger and divide it more evenly.
That was the legacy of the great surge in school enrollment during the Great Depression. Teenagers who once would have dropped out to do factory work instead stayed in high school, notes Claudia Goldin, an economist who recently wrote a history of education with Mr. Katz.
In the manufacturing-heavy mid-Atlantic states, the high school graduation rate was just above 20 percent in the late 1920s. By 1940, it was almost 60 percent. These graduates then became the skilled workers and teachers who helped build the great post-World War II American economy.
Nothing would benefit tomorrow's economy more than a similar surge. And there is some evidence that it's starting to happen. In El Centro, enrollment at Imperial Valley Community College jumped 11 percent this semester. Ed Gould, the college president, said he expected applications to keep rising next year.
Unfortunately, California -- one of the states hit hardest by the Great Recession -- is in the midst of a fiscal crisis. So Imperial Valley's budget is being capped. Next year, Mr. Gould expects he will have to tell some students that they can't take a full load of classes, just when they most need help.

HEADLINE: Ex-Lenders Profit From Home Loans Gone Bad

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON

 BODY:
CALABASAS, Calif. -- Fairly or not, Countrywide Financial and its top executives would be on most lists of those who share blame for the nation's economic crisis. After all, the banking behemoth made risky loans to tens of thousands of Americans, helping set off a chain of events that has the economy staggering.
So it may come as a surprise that a dozen former top Countrywide executives now stand to make millions from the home mortgage mess.
Stanford L. Kurland, Countrywide's former president, and his team have been buying up delinquent home mortgages that the government took over from other failed banks, sometimes for pennies on the dollar. They get a piece of what they can collect. 
''It has been very successful -- very strong,'' John Lawrence, the company's head of loan servicing, told Mr. Kurland one recent morning in a glass-walled boardroom here at PennyMac's spacious headquarters, opened last year in the same Los Angeles suburb where Countrywide once flourished.
''In fact, it's off-the-charts good,'' he told Mr. Kurland, who was leaning back comfortably in his leather boardroom chair, even as the financial markets in New York were plunging.
As hundreds of billions of dollars flow from Washington to jump-start the nation's staggering banks, automakers and other industries, a new economy is emerging of businesses that hope to make money from the various government programs that make up the largest economic rescue in history.
They include big investors who are buying up failed banks taken over by the federal government and lobbyists. And there is PennyMac, led by Mr. Kurland, 56, once the soft-spoken No. 2 to Angelo R. Mozilo, the perpetually tanned former chief executive of Countrywide and its public face.
Mr. Kurland has raised hundreds of millions of dollars from big players like BlackRock, the investment manager, to finance his start-up. Having sold off close to $200 million in stock before leaving Countrywide, he has also put up some of his own cash.
While some critics are distressed that Mr. Kurland and his team are back in business, the executives say that PennyMac's operations serve as a model for how the government, working with banks, can help stabilize the housing market and lead the nation out of the recession. ''It is very important to the entire team here to be part of a solution,'' Mr. Kurland said, standing in his office, which has views of the Santa Monica Mountains.
It is quite evident that their efforts are, in fact, helping many distressed homeowners.
''Literally, their assistance saved my family's home,'' said Robert Robinson, of Felton, Pa., whose interest rate was cut by more than half, making his mortgage affordable again.
But to some, it is disturbing to see former Countrywide executives in the industry again. ''It is sort of like the arsonist who sets fire to the house and then buys up the charred remains and resells it,'' said Margot Saunders, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center, which for years has sought to place limits on what it calls abusive lending practices by Countrywide and other companies.
More than any other major lending institution, Countrywide has become synonymous with the excesses that led to the housing bubble. The firm's reputation has been so tarnished that Bank of America, which bought it last year at a bargain price, announced that the name and logo of Countrywide, once the biggest mortgage lender in the nation, would soon disappear.
Mr. Kurland acknowledges pushing Countrywide into the type of higher-risk loans that have since, in large numbers, gone into default. But he said that he always insisted that the loans go only to borrowers who could afford to repay them. He also said that Countrywide's riskiest lending took place after he left the company, in late 2006, after what he said was an internal conflict with Mr. Mozilo and other executives, whom he blames for loosening loan standards.
In retrospect, Mr. Kurland said, he regrets what happened at Countrywide and in the mortgage industry nationwide, but does not believe he deserves blame. ''It is horrible what transpired in the industry,'' said Mr. Kurland, who has never been subject to any regulatory actions.
But lawsuits against Countrywide raise questions about Mr. Kurland's portrayal of his role. They accuse him of being at the center of a culture shift at Countrywide that started in 2003, as the company popularized a type of loan that often came with low ''teaser'' interest rates and that, for some, became unaffordable when the low rate expired.
The lawsuits, including one filed by New York State's comptroller, say Mr. Kurland was well aware of the risks, and even misled Countrywide's investors about the precariousness of the company's portfolio, which grew to $463 billion in loans, from $62 billion, three times faster than the market nationwide, during the final six years of his tenure.
''Kurland is seeking to capitalize on a situation that was a product of his own creation,'' said Blair A. Nicholas, a lawyer representing retired Arkansas teachers who are also suing Mr. Kurland and other former Countrywide executives. ''It is tragic and ironic. But then again, greed is a growth industry.''
David K. Willingham, a lawyer representing Mr. Kurland in several of these suits, said the allegations related to Mr. Kurland were without merit, and motions had been filed to seek their dismissal.
Federal banking officials -- without mentioning Mr. Kurland by name -- added that just because an executive worked at an institution like Countrywide did not mean he was to blame for questionable lending practices. They said that it was important to do business with experienced mortgage operators like Mr. Kurland, who know how to creatively renegotiate delinquent loans.
PennyMac, whose full legal name is the Private National Mortgage Acceptance Company, also received backing from BlackRock and Highfields Capital, a hedge fund based in Boston. It makes its money by buying loans from struggling or failed financial institutions at such a huge discount that it stands to profit enormously even if it offers to slash interest rates or make other loan modifications to entice borrowers into resuming payments.
Its biggest deal has been with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which it paid $43.2 million for $560 million worth of mostly delinquent residential loans left over after the failure last year of the First National Bank of Nevada. Many of these loans resemble the kind that Countrywide once offered, with interest rates that can suddenly balloon. PennyMac's payment was the equivalent of 38 cents on the dollar, according to the full terms of the agreement.
Under the initial terms of the F.D.I.C. deal, PennyMac is entitled to keep 20 cents on every dollar it can collect, with the government receiving the rest. Eventually that will rise to 40 cents.
Phone operators for PennyMac -- working in shifts -- spend 15 hours a day trying to reach borrowers whose loans the company now controls. In dozens of cases, after it has control of loans, it moves to initiate foreclosure proceedings, or to urge the owners to sell the house if they do not respond to calls, are not willing to start paying or cannot afford the house. In many other cases, operators offer drastic cuts in the interest rate or other deals, which PennyMac can afford, given that it paid so little for the loans.
PennyMac hopes to achieve a profit of at least 20 percent annually, and it is actively courting other investors to build its portfolio, which now consists of $800 million in loans, to as much as $15 billion in the next 18 months, executives said. For the borrowers whose loans have ended up with PennyMac, it can translate into an extraordinary deal.
The Laverdes, of Porter Ranch, Calif., had fallen three months behind on their mortgage after sales at a furniture store owned by the family dipped in the economic crisis. Margarita Laverde and her husband were fearful that they might need to move their four children, three dogs and giant saltwater aquarium into a cramped apartment, leaving behind their dream home -- a five-bedroom ranch on a suburban street overlooking the San Fernando Valley.
But a PennyMac representative instead offered to cut the interest rate on their $590,000 loan to 3 percent, from 7.25 percent, cutting their monthly payments nearly in half, Ms. Laverde said.
''I kept on asking, 'Are you sure this is correct? Are you sure?' '' Ms. Laverde said. Even with this reduction, PennyMac stands to make a profit of at least 50 percent, a company official said.
Ms. Laverde could not care less that executives at PennyMac used to work at Countrywide.
''What matters,'' she said, ''is that we know our house is secure and our credit is safe.''

HEADLINE: Stimulus Prompting Road Work In All Sizes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
Kansas will widen U.S. 69 to remove a bottleneck outside Kansas City, along with a few other expensive projects. Maryland will spend its money in smaller pieces, resurfacing dozens of rutted roads and highways. Colorado will build an interchange on Elk Creek Road in Jefferson County, complete with an underpass for the elk.
There is nothing monumental in President Obama's plan to revive the economy with a coast-to-coast building spree, no historic New Deal public works. The goal of the stimulus plan was to put people to work quickly, and so states across the country have begun to spend nearly $50 billion on thousands of smaller transportation projects that could employ up to 400,000 people, by the administration's estimates.
More than a dozen states have now said how they plan to spend at least some of their transportation money, giving the clearest picture yet of how one of the president's signature programs is playing out around the country. Beyond all the money for Medicaid and unemployment benefits in the huge bill passed last month, this will be the face of the country's stimulus program: a bridge will be painted on a rural road, a new lane added on a suburban highway, a guardrail built on a median strip. 
They may be old plans that the recession had forced a state to shelve, but multiplied by thousands, they will quickly get bulldozers rolling again and paychecks flowing. On the highway projects alone, the White House said Tuesday that 150,000 jobs would be created or saved.
Some states are taking radically different approaches with their transportation money. While Kansas is using it on a few big marquee projects to expand capacity at several highways, Maryland has adopted a fix-it-first policy, and plans to use its money to repair dozens of roads and bridges instead of building new ones.
The work, however mundane much of it is, cannot come too soon for a construction industry buffeted by an unemployment rate that has risen to twice the national average as many states cut back on building. Mike Gibson, the executive director of Associated Contractors of New Mexico, a trade group, said his state had lost 4,500 highway construction jobs in the last year.
''We have lost the equivalent of a plant closure,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''When you lose 10 jobs here, 100 jobs here, it adds up very quickly.''
States have tremendous latitude in how they spend the money, and in some places that is leading to pitched political battles -- battles that must be waged quickly, since the states must begin spending the money in four months. Regional politics is playing a role in some states, as local lawmakers fight to get money sent to their districts.
Since the stimulus law provided much less money for transportation than many states had expected -- less than $50 billion, which is about what the federal government spends on transportation every year -- the competition for those dollars can be particularly fierce.
A fight in Washington State is emblematic of the questions facing state lawmakers across the country: Who decides how the money is spent? Is it better spent on a few big projects or many smaller ones? Should the bulk of the money go to metropolitan regions where the bulk of the population and economic activity are or should it be spread out evenly to suburban and rural areas across the state?
Seattle, in one of the most ambitious building projects in the nation, plans to tear down the aging, unsafe elevated highway that blocks off its waterfront and replace it with a tunnel. Seattle's mayor, Greg Nickels, and Washington's governor, Christine Gregoire, both Democrats, wanted to jumpstart the project with around $75 million in stimulus money to help the city replace two major roads.
The state's Democratic-controlled Legislature had other ideas. It drew up a list of how it wanted to spend the $341 million in transportation money -- and none of it went to Seattle. Lawmakers said they had decided to spend the money on roads that the state controlled and on projects that they had been forced to put off because of fiscal constraints.
''There's not a single project in Seattle on the entire list,'' Mr. Nickels said in an interview, arguing that the Seattle road projects would continue to stimulate development and create jobs long after the last asphalt was spread. ''The fact is that the 100 largest metropolitan areas in this country generate 75 percent of the gross national product, so if you're going to create jobs, that's where you're going to do it.''
But lawmakers argued that the money should be spread out to other regions in the state. State Senator Mary Margaret Haugen, Democrat of Camano Island and chairwoman of the transportation committee, said the state had fallen behind on its planned construction projects as the economy worsened, and she saw this as an opportunity to begin catching up.
''I think everybody thought there was going to be more money,'' Ms. Haugen said. ''Had it been double, we might have made our decisions differently.''
In Texas, a proposal to use $181 million of the federal money to help build a toll road that will eventually form part of an outer ring around Houston has drawn criticism from some transportation advocates who warn that the project will spur more sprawl.
Two schools of thought are emerging as states decide what to do with their shares.
Kansas decided to concentrate its money on a few new projects that its transportation secretary, Deb Miller, called ''game changers.'' So it will spend nearly a quarter of its money building the next leg of a project to expand U.S. 69 in Overland Park, a bustling suburb of Kansas City. It will rebuild an interchange in Wichita in an area where developers want to put more retail space, rebuild a rural highway in Gove County that has heavy truck traffic, and complete a 10-year project to improve a corridor in McPherson County where work was stopped because the money had dried up.
''We wanted to build projects that would have a lasting impact, so that 20 years later people could look at them and see what we did,'' said Ms. Miller, who added that the department was considering making plaques to show that the projects had been paid for by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, the official name of the stimulus law.
Others argue that the money should be used to fix the crumbling infrastructure that already exists. They note that for years, many states have put off much-needed maintenance to save money, and that repair projects can be done quickly. In the absence of a broader policy discussion about the future of transportation -- which would involve wrestling with questions about sprawl and how to reduce dependence on foreign oil -- these states have decided it is better to fix existing roads than to build new ones that would only attract more cars.
Maryland is taking the fix-it-first approach -- and calls the $638 million it will receive in stimulus money most welcome, given that the state was forced to defer $2.1 billion worth of construction and repair projects when the economy soured. John D. Porcari, Maryland's transportation secretary, said the state would quickly put some 10,000 people to work resurfacing dozens of roads, painting and repairing bridges and putting in guardrails.
''It's like maintaining your car: if you neglect the relatively easy periodic maintenance, you're building up to a very big bill -- and eventually replacing it,'' Mr. Porcari said. ''Instead of having one or two or three megaprojects, we have literally dozens and dozens of projects in every corner of the state, which maximizes the ability of local firms to compete for them.''
Now contractors across the country -- many of which have had to shed workers as construction slowed to a halt -- are gearing up for more work. Jim Andoga, the president of Austin Bridge & Road, which does heavy highway work in Texas, said his firm had mothballed one of the asphalt plants it owned and let go about 50 workers. Other companies have had to lay off up to half of their workforce, Mr. Andoga said.
Mr. Andoga predicted that with so many companies desperate for work, the government would get some bargains on early bids.
''I'll tell you,'' he said, ''the first round of the stimulus, I think the work's going to go pretty cheap.''

BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE ECONOMY,
More Cube Steak and Memories
The popularity of cube steak has risen as the economy has worsened. Even grass-fed cube steak -- named for the process of tenderizing it -- is inexpensive. For many, cube steak means a deluge of polarized childhood memories: it was a dearly loved staple, or it was discreetly given to the dog. Page D1
ORGANIC? YES. SAFER? NOT ALWAYS.
The organic food movement was created out of a desire to produce food that was healthier with methods that were better for the land. By 2002, Food and Drug Administration had begun using a ''certified organic'' seal. But recent slip-ups, like salmonella-infested peanut butter, are showing that while certified organic can mean healthier, it doesn't necessarily mean safer. Page D1

THE TORTURED MEMOS
This week, the C.I.A. admitted to destroying 92 videotapes of interrogations that may have involved torture, and the Justice Department released several of the legal manifestos that former President George W. Bush used to justify mangling the Constitution after Sept. 11, 2001. It was horrifying to be reminded that the nation still has not plumbed the depths of the Bush administration's abuses. At the same time, it was a relief to see President Obama beginning to make good on his promise of greater transparency. Page A26

HEADLINE: Japan Considers Loans to Struggling Exporters

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
Japan will dip into its $1 trillion worth of foreign currency reserves to lend dollars to the country's struggling exporters, the government said Tuesday, a move that could help the carmaker Toyota provide more loans to buyers in the United States. 
 The manufacturer said Tuesday its auto loans arm could receive funds from a government-backed bank using a new lending facility that will tap Japan's vast foreign currency reserves. The government plans to use about $5 billion of its reserves to finance a government-backed bank charged with making dollar-denominated loans. 
 ''We expect difficulties in corporate financing in Japan as well as overseas to reach their peak soon as economic difficulties deepen,'' Japan's finance minister, Kaoru Yosano, said. Japan will also expand an emergency loan facility aimed at domestic companies to 1.5 trillion yen, or $15.4 billion, from 1 trillion yen, Mr. Yosano said. 
 Toyota's auto loans arm could become one of the first beneficiaries of the new lending facility. A financing subsidiary is in talks with the government-backed Japan Bank for International Cooperation for an emergency loan, the automaker said. 
 Toyota's request for state financing is an indication of trouble ahead for the manufacturer as demand for its vehicles evaporates worldwide. It also underscores how the credit crisis has started to affect even Japan's biggest businesses. Though many Japanese companies are flush with cash, they have found it increasingly harder to borrow in recent months as the country's troubled banks shy away from lending and credit tightens overseas. 
 The carmaker said its wholly owned subsidiary, Toyota Financial Services, was requesting money that would help it make more loans to customers in the United States. 
 According to the public broadcaster NHK, the Nagoya-based subsidiary, which has assets of 14.3 trillion yen, could receive about 200 billion yen, or $2 billion, in government-backed loans. 
 A spokeswoman at Toyota Financial Services, Mio Sugito, said the size and timing of the loan were undecided and refused to give details. The Japan Bank for International Cooperation said it could not confirm negotiations with individual companies. 
 Toyota called the move a sound strategy that would ease pressure on the company from the global credit squeeze. The carmaker had already entered discussions over using public financing at other subsidiaries, it said. 
 ''We are in no way uncomfortable or concerned over the loan discussions,'' Toyota's spokesman, Paul Nolasco, said in Tokyo. 
 Japan's car exports have slowed significantly in the worldwide economic slump, knocking most Japanese automakers into the red and forcing them to idle plants and lay off workers. Deteriorating earnings in turn hurt companies' creditworthiness and make borrowing more expensive. 
 In February, Toyota lost the top credit ratings status with cuts from both Moody's and Standard & Poor's. Moody's lowered its rating to Aa1 from a gilt-edged Aaa, and S.& P. cut its rating to AA+ from a top grade of AAA. 
 A wider slump in exports has helped throw Japan into its deepest recession in decades, with its economy shrinking at an annualized 12.7 percent in the last quarter of 2008. 
 Toyota expects a 350 billion yen loss for the fiscal year through March, a sharp contrast from the record 1.72 trillion yen profit it booked the previous year. 
 Its rival Nissan Motor, which is allied with Renault of France, has also said it was considering applying for government aid.

HEADLINE: Europe Backs Tariffs on U.S. Biofuel Imports

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Seeking to protect their beleaguered biodiesel industry, European governments backed on Tuesday a plan to impose provisional tariffs on American biodiesel producers like Cargill and Archer Daniels Midland, European Union diplomats said. 
 Both the European Union and the United States subsidize their biodiesel industries. But European producers have complained to trade regulators that their counterparts in the United States benefit twice: from subsidies by the United States government to produce biodiesel, and from subsidies granted by European governments when the fuel is sold on the Continent.
 Concerns are growing that protectionism by governments during the current downturn may spiral out of control. But representatives of the European biodiesel industry said the measures being undertaken by European officials were necessary and justified under World Trade Organization rules.
 ''Whatever the action of the United States will be -- even in front of the W.T.O. -- our complaint and our case is well grounded,'' said Raffaelo Garofalo, the secretary general of the European Biodiesel Board, an industry group. ''There is no logical explanation for why biodiesel sold in Europe could be cheaper than its raw materials.'' 
 European diplomats spoke on condition of anonymity because the final determination on the levels of duties is not expected to be published until next week. 
 Under European rules, the commission is entitled to impose provisional duties lasting six months. Any definitive measures, lasting five years, would need approval by European governments before the summer.
 ''We are not commenting on expected decisions and instead will wait for official action to be taken by the commission,'' said an American trade official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because a formal decision had not yet been made.
 To counter what it calls unfair subsidies to the American industry, the commission is poised to impose tariffs of 261 to 407 euros, or $328 to $511, on a ton of American biodiesel, the diplomats said. 
 Tariffs would be tailored to individual companies to reflect the types and amounts of the fuel they produce, and the amount of subsidies and other support they receive from American authorities, the diplomats said.

HEADLINE: Tenants Wary Of Clustering Of Homeless

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
Henry Perry just cannot get used to the 10 p.m. curfew notice posted since October in the Bronx apartment building where he has lived since 1963. Or the sign-in sheet, where the newer residents dutifully log comings and goings. Or the 24-hour security guard seated at a desk in the lobby.
 ''She came when the homeless people did,'' Mr. Perry, a wiry, gray-haired man of 68, nodded at the guard last week.
 Twenty-one of the 50 units in Mr. Perry's five-story brick building are now occupied by homeless families as part of a Bloomberg administration program that has turned dozens of apartment buildings throughout the city, most of them in the Bronx, into de facto homeless shelters. Known as cluster-site housing, the program contracts with nonprofit agencies to temporarily place families in apartments; it has swelled in two years to 1,503 apartments from 1,092, at an estimated cost of $59 million this year. 
 With the number of homeless families in New York at near-record levels, cluster-site has quietly replaced the costly and controversial scatter-site housing program that the Bloomberg administration pledged in 2002 to wipe out. Unlike the previous program, it uses nonprofit agencies to provide employment help and other social services to the homeless families, who spend an average of 284 days -- about nine months -- in the apartments.
 But while rent-paying tenants in the buildings are not subject to the curfew or sign-in requirements, many complain that their landlords have been pushing them out to make way for homeless families because the cluster-site program pays far more -- an average of $1,730 -- for the units, many of which are rent-stabilized (Mr. Perry pays $248.68 a month). Many say they have been intimidated with repeated notices regarding rent or other matters, and that they were never notified of the impending changes in their buildings (the city says it notifies residents only if more than half the building will be used).
 At Mr. Perry's building, on Mosholu Parkway in the northwest Bronx, longtime tenants were stunned on Sunday, Oct. 26, 2008, when several homeless families arrived in vans, carrying their belongings in shopping bags, and were swiftly ushered into recently renovated apartments. 
 ''They're going to bring in homeless people, and then they're going to make us homeless,'' said Deonarine Srikishun, 64, who pays $830 a month for the two-bedroom apartment where he has lived for 27 years.
 Advocates for the homeless condemn the cluster-site program for temporarily solving one problem by creating another: displacing low-income residents. Rather than put homeless people in temporary apartments, they say, the city should give more of them the federal subsidized housing vouchers known as Section 8.
 ''The city is shooting itself in the foot,'' said Steven Banks, the attorney in chief for the Legal Aid Society. ''It is far more costly to house families in apartments as shelter than to house them in permanent housing.''
 But Deputy Mayor Linda I. Gibbs, who oversees homeless programs, said cluster-site housing worked well because it provided families with caseworkers who develop independent living plans, including target move-out dates and employment goals. Families are expected to abide by a curfew, keep their rooms tidy -- there are weekly inspections -- and search for jobs.
 ''Our strategies are focusing on helping the families to become economically independent,'' Ms. Gibbs said. 
 The controversy over cluster-site housing comes amid Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's years-long battle to reduce the city's homeless population. He declared in 2004, when there were 38,000 homeless on the city's rolls, that he hoped to cut the number by two-thirds within five years; instead, the city is currently housing 35,000 people.
 Putting homeless people into apartments began during the Giuliani administration as an emergency measure to relieve overcrowded shelters. By 2002, it had grown from 50 units to more than 2,000, and was widely criticized as an expensive failure costing $2,900 a month per apartment. After a public outcry, Mayor Bloomberg and Ms. Gibbs, then the commissioner of homeless services, vowed to shut down the program. 
 Technically, they did. According to the Department of Homeless Services, there were 723 scatter-site units in December 2006; by January 2007, there were zero. But in a new column of data, labeled ''cluster sites,'' there were 1,092 units, a number that slowly crept up throughout 2007. 
 Unlike the scatter-site program, in which the city paid rent directly to landlords and provided little else for the families, the Department of Homeless Services works with five nonprofit agencies that seek out landlords, negotiate rents and offer support services to tenants in the 127 cluster-site buildings. Before the agencies establish longer-term contracts with the city, they are paid $90 per diem, about $2,700 per month, per family. 
 Robert V. Hess, the homeless services commissioner, said each apartment was inspected before a homeless family moved in to make sure it was suitable. 
 But at 3001 Briggs Avenue, a 26-unit building in Bedford Park in the Bronx that has been largely taken over by the cluster-site program in recent months, there are 315 open housing-code violations, according to city records, including complaints of broken windows, peeling lead paint, mice, roaches and bedbugs. 
 Outside the quiet, run-down building on Sunday afternoon, a security guard in a dark blue jacket patrolled the front door while a group of children played in the lobby. 
 Dominique Gee, 15, who was carrying a bag of laundry, paused outside the entrance of the building, where she moved with her mother, stepfather and sister three days earlier. ''It's not too bad, except we're not allowed to have visitors,'' she said. ''So if we want to see somebody, we have to come outside.'' 
 The cluster-site program at the building is run by Aguila Inc., an organization that began working with the city in 2000 with 55 scatter-site units; it now operates more than 300 cluster-site units in the Bronx as well as standalone shelters for single adults.
 According to public records, Aguila received $9.2 million from the Department of Homeless Services in 2006. Peter Rivera, the executive director of Aguila and the son of the Bronx state assemblyman of the same name, did not return calls seeking comment. 
 Fernando Tirado, the district manager for Community Board 7 in the Bronx, said he had been bombarded with calls from residents on Briggs Avenue. (Howard Miller, the manager of the building, did not return repeated telephone messages.)
 ''It has become apparent to us that landlords have been forcing tenants out, either through coercion or through other means,'' said Mr. Tirado, who called the cluster-site program ''despicable.'' 
 Geraldine Salvatorelli, whose 91-year-old father is among the few remaining rent-paying tenants there, said: ''It was easy to get most of them out -- they owed back rent.''
 Mr. Hess, of the homeless services department, says the city investigates thoroughly when it receives information that tenants have been intimidated, and had confirmed two such cases over the last three years.
 ''We're not going to allow anything to happen where other tenants are going to feel that they've been pushed out so we can occupy more,'' he said. 
 At the building on Mosholu Parkway, Mr. Srikishun, 64, said his landlord had wrongly accused him of owing more than $8,000 in back rent, slipping notices under his third-floor apartment door. 
 ''He's torturing me with these papers under the door, every month,'' Mr. Srikishun said, his voice rising in anger. ''All these things are fabricated.'' He says he has always paid his rent and owes nothing. The property managers, Lev Management, did not return calls. 
 Despite the opposition, the number of cluster-site apartments appears likely to keep increasing, given the deepening recession and state budget cuts to homelessness-prevention programs.
 ''We certainly understand the pressure they're under,'' said John Reilly, the executive director of the Fordham Bedford Housing Corporation. ''But to take existing affordable housing off the market, it just seems like it's an agency solving its own problem, but not solving the city's problem.'' 
 Catherine Barbosa, an elementary school teacher who pays $1,050 a month for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the cluster-site buildings, said she sympathized with the problem -- but not the solution.
 ''I understand that homeless people, they need a place to live, they don't need to be out on the street,'' she said. ''I don't pay rent to live in a homeless shelter, that's how I feel.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Henry Perry, who has lived in the same apartment building since 1963, says it has changed, now that 21 of the 50 units are temporary housing for the homeless.
 ''They're going to bring in homeless people, and then they're going to make us homeless,'' said Deonarine Srikishun, 64. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY G. PAUL BURNETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (pg.A22)

HEADLINE: Man Charged in Loan Fraud Is Linked to Ponzi Scheme

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
Sharmon Wade did business out of a Park Avenue office suite, where he ran a company called the Covenant Equity Group. The company solicited investors by promising them astronomical returns in real estate investments -- 50 to 100 percent within two months.
 But Mr. Wade was a con man, Manhattan prosecutors said, and for the second time in two weeks he was charged with real estate fraud. 
 In an indictment announced on Tuesday, District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau accused Mr. Wade of taking investors' money and spending it at nightclubs, restaurants, hotels and spas, among many other places, rather than on real estate ventures.
 Even as Mr. Morgenthau was announcing a state indictment, Mr. Wade was in federal court, about two blocks away, for a hearing on charges that he led a conspiracy to obtain more than $10 million in fraudulent home mortgage loans. 
 Mr. Morgenthau also charged Mr. Wade's business partner, Claudius Hannah, in the real estate investment scheme, which the district attorney said lasted from June 2007 to August 2008.
 Mr. Wade and Mr. Hannah are accused in the state case of stealing more than $1.3 million from more than a dozen investors.
 Mr. Wade is still in federal custody and Mr. Hannah, 45, was arrested in Orlando, Fla., on Tuesday. Each faces up to 15 years in prison if convicted on the state charges, which include grand larceny and fraud.
 The scheme started after Robert Martin, a municipal clerk in Jersey City, invested money with Covenant, Mr. Morgenthau said. Mr. Wade and Mr. Hannah returned a small amount to Mr. Martin, and he recommended the firm to other investors, Mr. Morgenthau said. 
 On several occasions, the defendants gave a small amount of money, which they described as profits, to investors to entice them to encourage friends and family members to invest, Mr. Morgenthau said -- using the phrase Ponzi scheme.
 The defendants told investors that they would invest their money in commercial properties obtained at very low prices. They were to be resold or refinanced for large profits, Mr. Morgenthau said, but the defendants never bought real estate.
 In some instances, Mr. Wade and Mr. Hannah asked investors to invest money directly into their company, and encouraged investors who did not have enough money to do so to borrow, Mr. Morgenthau said.
 In the federal case, prosecutors accused Mr. Wade and three others of using former prisoners and residents of a housing project to pose as home buyers and obtain subprime mortgages, usually for more than the cost of the property, falsifying information on the straw buyers' applications. 
 They then kept the difference between the sale price and the amount received from the mortgage, federal authorities said. The loans soon went into foreclosure. 
 The federal charges were brought against Sharmon Howell, but Mr. Morgenthau said that he and Mr. Wade are the same person. 
 ''The important message is there's no free lunch,'' Mr. Morgenthau said at a news conference discussing the state charges in his office. ''Anybody who tells you they're going to double your money in 30 to 60 days, that should be a red flag.''
 But the defendants were so convincing that Michele Bilotta did not think to question them until it was too late. 
 In an interview, Ms. Bilotta said she learned of the possibility of investing with Covenant through her hairdresser's brother. After an initial telephone conversation with Mr. Wade, she received several follow-up calls, she said.
 Eventually, she agreed to meet with him, and he sent a car service to her home in Bayonne, N.J., to bring her to his office in the Helmsley Building in Midtown Manhattan, she said.
 ''It was beautifully fronted,'' said Ms. Bilotta, 39. ''They looked professional.''
 She agreed to invest with Covenant in November 2007 after it promised to double her money within 30 days. When she did not receive any money after a month, she said, she contacted Mr. Wade, who told her that there was a delay. She continued to contact him but did not receive any of the $110,000 that she said she had given to the defendants. By the end of January 2008, she said she knew something was wrong.
 She eventually contacted WABC-TV, which ran a report on her situation. Although Ms. Bilotta, who lives with her 17-year-old daughter and is unemployed, said she was pleased to see Mr. Wade and Mr. Hannah arrested, that may not make help her recoup any of her losses: her life savings, her car, a Cadillac Escalade on which she could no longer make payments and her peace of mind.
 ''We went from having everything in life to living from day to day, thinking our lights are going be turned off,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Letters: Going Back In Brooklyn

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Now in Brooklyn, the 19th Century'' (Feb. 25): 
 Like the entrepreneurs you profiled, the organization I direct, New Amsterdam Market, is dedicated to creating an alternative to the present food system. Our vision is inspired by the 19th-century public market, where purveyors -- butchers, grocers and mongers -- personally sourced everything they sold. 
 This vision is far from utopian. There is a growing recognition that reinvigorating our economy and ensuring a healthful food supply require rethinking outdated models, such as the shopping mall and agribusiness, and returning to a time (which now seems suddenly ''modern'') when global trade existed alongside robust regional economies and when cities produced goods as well as consumed them.

HEADLINE: A Sign of Hope for China's Economy

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
A closely watched index of manufacturing activity in China edged up in February, an early sign that the economy may have seen the worst of the downturn.
 The official purchasing managers' index released by the Chinese authorities Wednesday rose to 49 in February, from 45.3 the previous month and continuing its improvement from a low of 38.8 in November. A reading below 50 indicates contraction, so the February outcome does not yet represent recovery. 
 Steven Zhang and Qing Wang, China economists at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. cautioned that the improvement in February may have been in part due to a technical rebound and a gradual normalization in trade financing. ''It is unlikely indicative of an inflection point beyond which a sustainable recovery in the Chinese economy can be achieved,'' they said in a report Wednesday. ''We in fact expect such a recovery to materialize in the second half of instead,'' they said in a note on Wednesday. 
 Still, the reading and a similar tentative improvement in an index compiled and released by the brokerage CLSA on Monday underline the relative resilience of the Chinese economy, where the authorities were quick last year to announce an ambitious stimulus package.
 Millions of jobs have been lost in China as producers catering to the export market have been hit by evaporating demand from overseas. And the economy, which powered ahead at double-digit growth rates for half a decade before the financial crisis in the United States escalated into an economic slump, has slowed sharply; many economists believe China may see growth of only 5 or 6 percent this year, markedly below the 8 percent the government is projecting.
 Last November, Beijing announced a 4 trillion Chinese yuan, or $584.7 billion, stimulus package, much of it for infrastructure projects like railways, airports and electricity grids. The authorities have also lowered interest rates sharply and encouraged banks to step up lending.
 On Wednesday, a senior planning official said China would increase spending above the 4 trillion yuan by an unspecified amount, Reuters reported. 
 The official also said China would spend more on welfare to strengthen the country's social safety net. This is something that analysts believe is key to ultimately getting ordinary Chinese to spend more, thus strengthening the domestic market and lowering China's reliance on exports.
 Analysts widely expect Beijing to announce added stimulus measures as the extent of the global downturn, and the effect on China's exporters in particular, becomes apparent.
 Jobs creation is a major priority for the authorities, who are concerned about the potential for social unrest as some 20 million migrant workers are estimated to be without employment.
 China's stock markets reacted positively on Wednesday: in Shanghai, the benchmark index jumped 4.7 percent, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.7 percent and Taiwan stocks rose 2.4 percent. 
 Elsewhere in the region, the Nikkei 225 in Tokyo nudged up 0.9 percent and the Kospi in South Korea rose 3.9 percent. 
 By contrast, the market in Australia sagged 1.6 percent on unexpected news that the economy shrank a seasonally adjusted 0.5 percent from the previous quarter, the first contraction in eight years.

HEADLINE: Commercial Renters Have a New Worry: A Landlord's Default

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Office landlords have always scrutinized the financial stability of prospective tenants, but now they are finding themselves under the lens.
 Prospective tenants are asking for financial statements from landlords, hoping to avoid companies that might default on their mortgages and leave tenants at risk of losing the space. Tenants are also more wary of subleasing space, and are tending to flock to buildings with stable owners.
 ''We have to be more attentive to the finances of our landlords than we've ever been to get a sense of their financial stability and ability to service their debt,'' said David N. Feldman, a managing partner at the law firm Feldman Weinstein & Smith, a 12,500-square-foot office tenant at 420 Lexington Avenue near Grand Central Terminal that, with a lease expiring in 2011, will soon start looking for office space. 
 During the recent era of cheap money that led to the real estate boom, many investors bought their office buildings at high prices with extensive debt, hoping to flip the building quickly. Some landlords calculated their cash flow too optimistically, intending to lease poorly performing office buildings at high rents to maximize their profit, and are having trouble paying their debt, in some cases falling behind on payments. 
 ''Today, we have this environment where we know that anyone who bought a building in the last few years is at jeopardy of losing that building,'' said Howard Fiddle, a vice chairman at the commercial real estate brokerage CB Richard Ellis. ''So, just from a purely operational perspective, you want to know who your landlord is.''
 In many ways it is a great time to be a tenant. Rents have dropped by 15 percent or so in Manhattan, smaller security deposits are required, and some landlords are offering free rent for as long as a year and a half. 
 But tenants also must be wary. Marisa Manley, president of Commercial Tenant Real Estate Representation, said there are reasons for an office tenant to worry about a landlord's losing the building. Money given by landlords to tenants to customize their office space, generally paid as an allowance over a period of time, could be lost, and in the current market, brokers said that money from landlords could be equivalent to $70 a square foot. Also, services in the building could deteriorate, Ms. Manley said.
 She suggested that tenants demand that landlords offering tenant improvements put the funds in escrow or in a letter of credit, which means they could not be seized in a bankruptcy proceeding.
 Protections against declining building services are harder to achieve, but a larger tenant can try to negotiate ''self-help rights,'' Ms. Manley said.
 ''If the landlord doesn't perform certain duties, you have the right to go and hire someone to do them yourself,'' she said, and get compensated by the landlord. ''These are things like cleaning, and heating, ventilation and air-conditioning maintenance.''
 Mr. Fiddle said that office tenants could also negotiate the ''right of offset.''
 ''Let's say part of the original deal was the landlord had to fund a $50-a-foot cash contribution toward tenant improvements,'' he said. ''And let's say the landlord paid about $30 a foot and then went bankrupt. The right of offset means that the additional $20 a foot could be deducted from the rent the tenant owes.''
 Mr. Fiddle said these types of protections did not get discussed much during the real estate boom.
 ''People know the terminology, but they have to pull it out and dust it off,'' he said. 
 To avoid the aggravation of these highly specialized negotiations, Mr. Fiddle said most office tenants would simply gravitate toward stronger landlords with lower debt on their office buildings. 
 ''What's basically happening is a flight to quality,'' said Frank Mancini, an executive managing director at the commercial real estate brokerage Grubb & Ellis. ''But it's not only quality of space, but quality of landlord or owner.''
 Though banks would be unlikely to kick out existing leaseholders on taking over ownership of an office building, tenants -- especially larger ones -- should get a nondisturbance agreement from a landlord's mortgage lender as a matter of routine, Mr. Fiddle said. This means the bank would have to recognize the existing lease of the tenant if it took over the building.
 ''Any full-floor or multiple-floor tenant will get a nondisturb -- it's almost automatic,'' he said. ''However, for very small tenants, it's not automatic.''
 Any potential pitfalls for office tenants in the current economic downturn are magnified for those companies seeking to sublease space, brokers said.
 ''The sublease market has been flooded with space, and most of these are fantastic spaces,'' said Ruth Colp-Haber, a founding partner at Wharton Properties, a commercial real estate brokerage. ''However, if you look at the profile of the average sublandlord, they're putting space on the market because they're having financial difficulty. Therefore, some type of lease default, and maybe even bankruptcy, is very conceivable.''
 Ms. Colp-Haber said that companies that sublease space could protect themselves by negotiating the right to stay in the space with the building's landlord if the sublandlord should default. 
 To avoid the perils of subleasing office space, the CRG Partners Group, a turnaround consulting business, is seeking to leave its subleasing situation at 711 Third Avenue at 45th Street for a direct lease, said Timothy J. Lewis, a partner with the firm.
 The New York office of the firm, which assists businesses in financial trouble or in bankruptcy, has been growing rapidly in recent months. Given the company's line of work, Mr. Lewis said CRG was especially careful about evaluating the financial stability of landlords.
 ''We're certainly aware of the risk, so we're probably a little bit more careful,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''If we decided to go the sublease route, we'd vet the financial condition of the lessor pretty closely, and partly for that reason, we've decided to try and do a direct lease.''

HEADLINE: No M.L.S. Team In South Florida

BYLINE: By JACK BELL

 BODY:
Major League Soccer, Barcelona and Marcelo Claure, a Bolivian businessman based in Miami, have all made it official -- there will be no soccer team in South Florida in 2010, 2011 or perhaps for the foreseeable future. 
 Prospects for the Miami team, which Barcelona hoped would begin play in M.L.S. in 2010, have fallen victim to a confluence of negative factors, including the global financial crisis, which has hit Florida especially hard.
 The withdrawal of the Barcelona/Claure bid leaves four candidates for two expansion slots: St. Louis; Ottawa; Portland, Ore.; and Vancouver, British Columbia.

HEADLINE: Countries Stepping In To Finance Export Trade

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo, Andrew Downs from Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Sang-Hun Choe from Seoul.

 BODY:
As hard as it is for businesses to get loans these days, consider this: even for Toyota Motor, the world's largest automaker, the well has run dry. 
 The problem, which led Japan to take the rare step Tuesday of tapping its foreign currency reserves to help, is a result of banks curbing the once-easy stream of credit that had helped nurture a boom in global trade. 
 When the world's economies were expanding, banks financed up to 90 percent of the $13.6 billion market for merchandise trade. But lenders pulled back sharply when the credit crisis hit, forcing governments that are already providing trillions of dollars to financial institutions to support another vital part of the system that extends loans to exporters and importers. 
 In Japan's case, while many companies are flush with cash, the government said Tuesday it would dip into $1 trillion worth of foreign currency reserves to lend dollars to Toyota, Sony and other struggling exporters, a sign of how deeply the credit crisis has started to affect even the biggest businesses. 
 About $5 billion of Japan's foreign currency reserves will be used to finance a government-backed bank that will be charged with making dollar-denominated loans. The carmaker said its wholly owned subsidiary Toyota Financial Services was requesting money that would help it make more loans to customers in the United States. 
 ''We expect difficulties in corporate financing in Japan as well as overseas to reach their peak soon as economic difficulties deepen,'' said Japan's finance minister, Kaoru Yosano. Japan will also expand an emergency loan facility aimed at struggling domestic companies to 1.5 trillion yen ($15.4 billion), from 1 trillion yen, Mr. Yosano said. 
 Elsewhere in the world, companies are complaining about similar problems. ''We cannot get credit from U.S. banks,'' said Byon Hyong Jun, who works for a small trading firm in South Korea that takes orders from American clothing companies and arranges for them to be made in Vietnam and other Asian countries. 
 In part because of the borrowing difficulties, he added, ''garment exporters like us have reduced our shipments to the U.S. by as much as 70 percent.''
 Normally, trade finance is considered virtually riskless. The collateral is the underlying merchandise itself, which is occasionally lost at sea or damaged but cannot vanish into the air like home values or the price of a stock.
 ''Trade financing is one of the safest lending activities, and it is very simple,'' said Jean-Francois Lambert, global head of trade finance at HSBC in London.
 But those dynamics have changed as the global economy contracts. Consider the tale of Jeff Auton, the manager of trade finance at Mark Andy, a maker of specialized printing equipment in Chesterfield, Mo. When he fielded a call from his distributor in Brazil in December, Mr. Auton received the good news first.
 ''Hey, we've got a buyer here,'' Mr. Auton recalled the distributor saying. The bad news, however, was that at least three sales, worth a total of $1 million, were at risk because ''the local banks were pricing the deal out of the picture.''
 Hoping to rescue the sales, Mr. Auton dug into the financials of his customers and managed to persuade the Export-Import Bank of the United States, a government agency, to guarantee a private loan to the Brazilian buyers.
 ''You can sit on the sidelines or you can get involved, especially with the customers you have relationships with,'' Mr. Auton said. ''But it is tough and it takes a lot of effort.''
 Mr. Auton, who called the current climate for exports the worst he has ever seen, said he was lucky to make the Brazilian sales. Many potential customers abroad, he thinks, simply give up when they cannot get credit locally.
 The change in the cost of financing trade deals highlights the problem. The interest rate on export finance loans to India, to take but one example, has gone from a fraction above Libor, a floating benchmark rate set in London, to about 5.5 percentage points higher.
 Sure enough, one potential Mark Andy customer in India, mulling a $750,000 order, has not been able to get financing.
 ''The deals don't so much fall through as we haven't been able to obtain the business in the first place,'' Mr. Auton said.
 That is amplifying a demand-driven downturn in international trade: For example, Japan, long an export powerhouse, registered its fourth consecutive month of trade deficits in January, the longest such stretch since the price of oil upset its trade balance in the 1970s. The International Monetary Fund expects the total volume of global trade to shrink in 2009 by 2.8 percent, the first contraction since 1982.
 Japan's initiative Tuesday was the latest in a series of programs by countries and international organizations to revive the private market.
 The nation recently pledged $1 billion to the World Bank to finance trade with emerging markets in partnership with banks, and is underwriting a regional insurance system for trade finance. In Europe, the French government recently used a new agency to finance exports of $6.5 billion in planes made by Airbus, the European commercial jetliner manufacturer. The German government, working through a private insurance company, is putting more resources into exports to Russia.
 The world's export credit agencies, like the Ex-Im Bank, are also finding new ways to finance exports. In a shift, the agency, which traditionally insures only loans made by private banks, is lending money directly to non-American buyers of American products, exercising a legal authority that it has but almost never uses. Last year, it lent about $12 million to sell helicopters to Brazil and $344 million for a rural electrification facility in Ghana. In January, it made two loans for Boeing-made airplanes to customers in Dubai and Morocco.
 Still, said Jeffrey Abramson, vice president for trade finance and insurance at Ex-Im, taking the place of the banks is a distant second choice.
 ''Part of our basic mandate is not to compete with the private market,'' he said. ''We want people to stay in the trade finance game.''

HEADLINE: Seeking to Intervene With Young Adults Before Crime Becomes a Way of Life

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM

 BODY:
Almost every time he was released from jail, Wilfredo Hierrezuelo stumbled back in, once after an arrest for dealing drugs, another time after he assaulted a school safety guard. By the time he walked out of Rikers Island in October 2008 at age 23, he had spent about seven years of his life behind bars. 
 He tried breaking that cycle, signing on with agencies that were supposed to connect him with employers. But one agency, he said, focused too narrowly on finding a temporary job, and another, in the Bronx, simply ''wasn't for me.'' 
 Last month, he began his fourth program, a city-financed pilot project that started in September in neighborhoods in the South Bronx and central Brooklyn where large numbers of people are sent to prison every year. In those neighborhoods, the city estimates, there are about 4,000 young people who have been convicted of a crime and would be eligible for such a program. 
 The odds against people like Mr. Hierrezuelo staying out of jail are long: 41 percent of prisoners released from Rikers Island end up being arrested again within a year and 34 percent end up back in the jail, according to the city's Department of Correction.
 In the basement of a Brooklyn community center, Mr. Hierrezuelo listened to Derek Freeman tell a story of escape from the cycle. 
 ''I came here sick,'' said Mr. Freeman, who has a drug-dealing conviction and was one of the first participants in the program, called the NYC Justice Corps. He was disrespectful when he arrived and was almost thrown out of the program, he said. But now, Mr. Freeman is leading a team of young men who are weatherizing a nearby home. ''The work is good work,'' he said. 
 Mr. Hierrezuelo reacted cautiously to what he heard. ''It sounds good,'' he said, as he played a video game during a break in the morning lectures. ''I have a son. Something's got to change.''
 Determining whether Justice Corps is more effective than other programs will take time, but organizers said that a number of features, including a requirement that participants work in their own communities, made it different and more promising. And they said they were heartened by early numbers that showed an 85 percent retention rate through the first five months. 
 All the participants so far have been black or Hispanic, from 18 to 24 years old, and all but 15 have been men. Most are referred by parole and probation officers. Of the 119 original participants in the six-month program, 18 have left, either because they were rearrested, had entered drug treatment programs or were thrown out for violating the program's code of conduct. 
 Some of those cases illustrate the difficulties of pulling young people away from their criminal pasts. Braulio Martinez, 19, already had a juvenile robbery conviction when he was arrested in the subway in November and accused of stealing a laptop. He started in Justice Corps in December, but the following month, Mr. Martinez, a self-assured, aspiring animator and poet, was sent back to Rikers Island for violating his probation terms. He is awaiting trial on the charge of theft.
 In an interview at the jail, he said he did not steal the laptop, was tired of being on probation and regretted having to leave the Justice Corps program. Mr. Martinez hoped to go back.
 ''They take you to the water,'' he said. ''You decide whether to drink.'' 
 Organizers say they must reach men like Mr. Martinez early, before jail becomes a habit. 
 ''We're tackling one of the hardest issues in our society,'' said Jeremy Travis, the president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice. ''This is a time when young people get off track.'' 
 ''We're trying to turn people who are growing up in poverty and engaged in some sort of antisocial behavior and make them pro-social in some aspect of their lives,'' Mr. Travis said.
 The college, the city's Center for Economic Opportunity and the Department of Correction are partners in the Justice Corps. 
 The Justice Corps is a hybrid of the national youth corps movement, the Depression-era program that put young people to work on community projects, and more traditional post-prison programs that help former inmates find work, shelter and education.
 Most important, the organizers said, young people are reintroduced to communities that in some cases they damaged.
 ''This program really appreciates a sense of self-value and worth,'' said Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services who oversees the agency financing the program. ''It's such an important thing for people to appreciate you're part of a larger community and making a contribution.''
 The Justice Corps sponsors tasks like painting a community center; participants are paid $8.50 to $9.50 an hour while they search for longer-term employment.
 Such transitional jobs are a feature of many programs for people who have been in prison or otherwise in trouble with the law.
 A continuing study of one such program in New York, the Center for Employment Opportunities, which provides technical assistance to the Justice Corps, suggests mixed results. So far, it has found that while the program significantly reduced recidivism and initially generated a large increase in employment, by the end of a year, participants were no more likely to have regular work than people who were not in the program, according to Dan Bloom of MDRC, a nonpartisan social policy research organization that is conducting the study. Mr. Bloom said the Justice Corps might benefit from its emphasis on young adults. ''If you can change someone's trajectory,'' he said, ''the logic of it makes sense.''
 The program is also seeking to distinguish itself by offering participants full-time work in so-called green-collar jobs. 
 Susan Tucker, who helped conceive the program and who is the director of the After Prison Initiative at the Open Society Institute, said the focus on emerging sectors like energy efficiency contrasted with the ''uninspiring'' nature of many post-prison programs, where people released from jail ''get training for jobs that don't exist or that they're barred from holding.'' 
 Still, the program's work goals may be a challenge to achieve. Participants in a similar program in New Orleans have struggled to find scarce jobs in environmental fields. 
 Regardless, those participating in the Justice Corps program said that at least they saw the potential for a fresh start. 
 Jaguar Loftin, 19, who said he had been arrested on a weapons charge, wrapped insulation around pipes in a Brooklyn home on a recent morning and said he saw a future in weatherization. 
 Yordanis Jusino, 25, was among a crew of men and women a few weeks ago preparing the Claremont Neighborhood Center in the South Bronx for coats of fresh paint.
 Ms. Jusino spent seven years in state prison for attempted murder. Before that, she lived in a group home. She has found intermittent work since her release, in construction and for a company that does telephone surveys.
 For many of the young people in the Justice Corps, participation is required by their parole or probation officers. But Ms. Jusino said she volunteered, hoping the program would open new doors, perhaps helping her achieve a dream of working with children whose parents are incarcerated. And indeed, she recently found a part-time job with a group called Exodus Transitional Community, another post-incarceration program, mentoring the children of people in prison. 
 But it has been difficult, she said, ''coming home to a society that, all they care about is your past.'' 
 ''They do all these background checks, credit checks,'' she said. ''What you do now is pretty much irrelevant. It's just hard.''

HEADLINE: Collecting Houses in Northern Italy

BYLINE: By ANNE GLUSKER

 BODY:
MONFERRATO, Italy
 Some people collect stamps, ornaments or miniatures, but Toni Hilton collects houses in the Monferrato region of northern Italy. 
 ''I'm a little bit of an obsessive,'' she said, referring to the four properties that she and her husband own in and around Villa Sansecondo, a small town about 55 kilometers (34 miles) from Turin. They rent them out for short-term stays.
 Ms. Hilton's fascination with the area's real estate began, oddly enough, on a bus in Mexico in 1992. She was on vacation from her job as a nurse in Florida and struck up a conversation with her Italian seatmate, Roberto Pierobon. They ended up traveling together -- followed by romance, marriage, Ms. Hilton's move to Italy and the birth of their daughter, Rebecca, now 11. 
 When Ms. Hilton first arrived in Italy, she was struck by the contrast between the American approach to real estate and that of her husband and his family. ''Italians always own their homes,'' she said. ''They don't like to rent.''
 During her first years in Italy, when the couple lived in Asti, a town in northern Italy, and then in Milan, Ms. Hilton made her first home purchase -- a former barn in the hamlet of San Martino Alfieri. 
 ''The old man who was selling the house selected me personally to buy his house,'' she said of her 1997 barn purchase. If he had not liked her, the sale of the 100-square-meter (1,076-square-foot) property and hectare (2.5 acres) of land would not have gone through. 
 Refurbishing the property took three years. She tore down the barn, but kept its facade. ''If you're buying a barn,'' she said, ''you never want one that was used to house animals -- it never loses its smell.'' She built a new house behind the barn's facade, at the time paying the lire equivalent of 30,000 euros (now $42,440).In 2000, Ms. Hilton and her husband bought their second property -- their current home -- in Villa Sansecondo for the lire equivalent of about 125,000 euros ($157,000). The property, which once belonged to a shoemaker, has a house, barn, garage and woodshed as well as one small outbuilding that had been the shoemaker's workshop.
 Like almost every house in the area, this one came equipped with its own underground cantina, or wine cellar, with walls made of tufo, a type of clay that is soft enough to give way when a wine bottle is pushed into it. These cool cellars have been used for centuries to store wine. There are indentations in Ms. Hilton's cellar walls where wine bottles once rested, although these days, the bottles sit on shelves set into the walls.
 Barely settled into the Villa Sansecondo house, Ms. Hilton felt the real estate itch once again and bought another, smaller house in the village. She calls it the Nido, or the Nest. The one-bedroom brick house is painted in cheery colors throughout -- a bright blue kitchen, an ochre-yellow bathroom, and another shade of yellow in the sitting room. Ms. Hilton paid about 25,000 euros for it in 2002, ($21,630 at the time) and estimates that she has spent the equivalent of 7,000 euros ($6,055) on its restoration.
 Ms. Hilton's role on her projects varies. ''I can be everything from project manager to gofer, muratore (mason) to head gardener,'' she said. She loves to do repairs herself when possible, and enjoys discussing the skills she has acquired such as wood refinishing and plastering.
 In Ms. Hilton's view, the pride of place in her collection goes to the stone cottage she bought for 42,000 euros in 2006 ($50,125 then). It is jammed between two similar buildings right in the center of the village of Villeadeati. 
 But unlike the two Villa Sansecondo houses nine kilometers (5.6 miles) away, this project was a complete restoration. ''We had seen literally 100 properties over the years, in the course of buying the other three houses, so we knew a jewel when we saw it,'' Ms. Hilton said. ''But when we bought it there was one loo and a kitchen sink, a wood stove and four decrepit fireplaces, electric cords hanging from the walls, no heat and no hot water.'' 
 The project has been ongoing for three years, and is now ''almost finished,'' Ms. Hilton said. She says she hasn't kept track of the total cost of the renovation, explaining, ''if I had to sit down and figure it out, I'd probably scare myself.''
 Paolo Lavagna of Immobiliare Valleversa, a Monferrato real estate agent, says the economic downturn hasn't affected prices for ''classical'' houses in the area, referring to the older homes, often made of stone. 
 Many of these houses were originally part of family compounds; real estate agents now call them ''semi independent'' as they often share courtyards or have common walls. A habitable house of this type ranging from 100 to 250 square meters (1,076 to 2,690 square feet) sells for 90,000 to 300,000 euros ($114,051 to $380,169). Recently restored, free standing houses with some land generally will sell for 300,000 euros or more. 
 ''Some of these houses need attention, Me. Lavagna said. ''They need love,'' and, of course, the more love required, the lower the price.
 ''Unlike Tuscany, we get many fewer foreign home buyers, although that's been changing in recent years,'' Ms. Hilton said. ''And with the economic downturn, we just don't know what we're going to see.''

HEADLINE: Economic Woes in Latvia Fuel Public's Anger at Government

BYLINE: By DAVID L. STERN

DATELINE: SEJA, Latvia 

 BODY:
Dressed plainly in a gray down-filled coat and faded black jeans, surrounded by his 130-odd milking cows, Normunds Kalnins hardly strikes a radical pose. 
 But among the multitudes of increasingly disaffected people in Latvia, a small, crisis-stricken Baltic nation of 2.2 million people, the soft-spoken Mr. Kalnins stands out. He was one of a 1,000-strong army of angry farmers who blocked the capital, Riga, with their tractors in February, prompting the resignation of Latvia's agriculture minister.
 Latvia, a former Soviet republic sandwiched between Lithuania and Estonia, has been strained by demonstrations over its imperiled economy. In January, an initially peaceful gathering of 10,000 turned into a riot when a handful of protesters attacked the police and looted stores after the crowd had mostly dispersed. About 40 people were injured in Latvia's worst violence since the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
 Last month, public discontent pushed Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis to resign, contributing to further political instability. Like Iceland, Latvia is a prime example of the way economic woes are being translated into public outrage against the excesses of market capitalism and what is seen as the government's failure to respond effectively.
 After posting Europe's highest growth rate just two years ago, the Latvian economy is collapsing. It shrank at an annual rate of more than 10 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and economists estimated that it could contract 12 percent or more this year, a rate that would almost certainly be the worst in Europe. The country's credit rating, already the lowest in the Baltics, was reduced to junk status by Standard & Poor's on Tuesday.
 Unemployment is climbing, and it reached 8.3 percent in January, up from 7 percent in December, and 5.6 percent as recently as October.
 ''Everyone has lost their job -- my mother, my best friend and my boyfriend,'' said Tatyana Makshtareva, 32, who was out of work herself for two months before finding a job at a cafe in Riga. ''I was very lucky,'' she added.
 Latvians are not sure whom to blame, but they have plenty of candidates.
 The government petitioned international financial institutions for aid and then imposed a stringent austerity program that went beyond even the requirements for the bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The tighter fiscal policy, people here often point out, is the exact opposite of the Keynesian stimulus programs being pursued in the United States and Western Europe.
 ''I don't see a way out of this,'' Ms. Makshtareva said. ''There is not one capable person in the government.''
 Then there are the banks, many from Scandinavia, that provided plenty of easy credit in recent years and are now moving to seize property and other forms of collateral to collect what they can on debts gone bad.
 And an increasingly popular target, at least among farmers, is the European Union.
 When the three Baltic nations -- Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania -- joined the European Union in 2004, it helped push their freewheeling economies into overdrive by offering a broader market for goods and making it easier to keep interest rates low. But now the union is often viewed as an overweening bureaucratic structure that pressed Riga to sign off on policies not in the nation's best interests.
 Latvian dairy farmers say they have been among the hardest hit; many of them borrowed heavily in recent years to finance expansion. After the financial crisis struck, milk exports, which had accounted for more than 60 percent of sales, dried up, while the average domestic price for a liter of milk dropped to just 28 cents from 50 cents.
 Many are hanging on only because their suppliers are not demanding immediate payment, because they know that doing so would drive the farmers out of business. ''If the suppliers asked for payment right now,'' said Mr. Kalnins, the dairy farmer, ''one-third, maybe one-half of the farms would shut down immediately.''
 Farming representatives contend that they are being undercut by low-cost imports from other European Union nations, like Germany, that provide greater assistance to their farmers. The problem, they say, is that the Baltic subsidies were set too low when Latvia entered the union because they were based on average figures from the late 1990s, when market prices were strong.
 ''Farmers are saying, 'We were tricked,' '' said Uldis Krievars, a dairy farmer and deputy chairman of Farmers Parliament, which helped organize the tractor demonstrations last month. ''We were told we would get into the E.U. and get fair prices.''
 European Union officials say that the opposite is true: The country's agricultural program when it joined the bloc was proposed by Latvian officials. And they say they are working closely with the government to try to extricate the country from its economic difficulties.
 Mr. Krievars said the Latvian government had cut the farm subsidy budget by 40 to 50 percent. To compensate, the government promised a $49.6 million bailout, but all but a third of that is in the form of guarantees to banks against defaults by farmers, while the remaining money is tied up in a protracted debate in Parliament.
 ''I also voted for joining the E.U. for security reasons -- to get out from Russian influence,'' Mr. Krievars said. ''But we were very naive to think that we would be invited to this big table and have a seat at it.''

HEADLINE: Philadelphia Mayor Plans Rise in Taxes

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Mayor Michael A. Nutter said Tuesday that Philadelphia would have to raise taxes or fees to close its budget deficit.
 ''We can't just cut our way out of this situation,'' Mr. Nutter said in an interview with WHYY radio. ''We will have to consider very seriously some form of revenue enhancement.'' 
 But the city will also be cutting services to balance its budget for the 2010 fiscal year and to close a projected shortfall of $1 billion over five years, Mr. Nutter said. ''We will have to get some savings out of general operations,'' he said. 
 At a series of public meetings on the budget, Philadelphians said they were willing to pay higher taxes to preserve services threatened by the budget crisis. 
 ''Given a chance to confront the tough tradeoffs, most citizens opted to tax themselves -- while struggling to give a tax break to those less fortunate,'' said a report by the Project for Civic Engagement at the University of Pennsylvania, which organized the meetings.
 Working groups concluded that residents would be prepared -- though reluctant -- to pay higher taxes on sales, wages, real estate transfers, businesses and parking, said the report, published late Monday.
 Mr. Nutter, who is in favor of cutting the wage tax, said he was ''surprised and concerned'' that people favored a rise because it could hurt economic growth. 
 Participants in the meetings said any increase in taxes or fees should exempt the poor and should come with a provision that they could be rolled back when the economy recovers. They also urged officials to end inefficiencies like having both fire and medical teams respond to the same emergency.
 Many people favored closing a city prison and finding alternative sentences for nonviolent offenders, the report said. 
 Mr. Nutter has promised to use the findings from the meetings in his budget presentation to the City Council on March 19.

HEADLINE: Brave Producers Break Into Opera At a Grim Time

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
It is lunch hour in Times Square on a numbingly cold Tuesday. The five-story-high advertisements wink at the world. Along the walls of the buildings, the riverbeds of digital news are swollen with ruin, theft and war. 
 Beneath it all, standing at the corner of 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, are Bryce Smith, a tall man with a sparse brown beard, and Rebecca Greenstein, a red-haired woman. 
 They are passing out little cards to promote the first full production of their own opera company -- homemade and heartfelt, all volunteer, backed with a loan from Mr. Smith's 401(k).
 In spite of everything. 
 ''I don't know what we were thinking, opening this in this economy,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We're artists; we want to make the music and the art first, and we'll figure out how to make the money later. It may not happen, but at least we believe in it.'' 
 These are dire times in opera land for the modest and the mighty. The Amato Opera, a cozy Lower Manhattan institution for 60 years, says it will close in May. The New York City Opera is wading out of two years of turmoil. The Metropolitan Opera is cutting budgets and wages.
 Even if the economics and logistics are crushing, the passion seems recession-proof. 
 Mr. Smith, 32, a bass from Lumberton, Miss., got off a bus at the Port Authority terminal on the night of Halloween 2003 with one bag of clothes and another filled with opera scores. A friend took him straight to a cafe on the Upper West Side where he could sing. By day, he works at a company that administers transit benefits.
 Ms. Greenstein, 28, a soprano from Alvarado, Tex., came to New York in the spring of 2001 to sing. She slept on the couch of a cousin of a friend from home until she could get her own place. She works at a construction company. 
 Last year, when she and Mr. Smith were performing in a children's cabaret, they realized that their summer calendars were wide open. So just as terms like ''credit default swaps'' were becoming part of the language, they created the Opera Manhattan Repertory Theater, a company for young and emerging singers.
 This week, Opera Manhattan is staging its first full production, an adaptation by Shawn E. Milnes of Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' that is set not in 19th-century Vienna, but at the masked Black and White Ball engineered by Truman Capote in 1966. Mr. Capote and Harper Lee are among its cast of characters. For good measure, it will include a special ballet based on ''Wild Thing,'' a hit single from 1966. The show runs from Thursday to Sunday at the Players Theater in Greenwich Village.
 THERE will be two separate casts to give more singers a chance to perform, said Mr. Smith, and all told, about 40 people are part of the production. They range in age from 19 to their mid-40s. 
 None of the singers are getting paid. They are doing their own makeup, hair and costumes. The director, choreographer, stage manager and conductor are working free. Ms. Greenstein and Mr. Smith have been passing out fliers in Times Square and in the plaza at Lincoln Center. 
 The city is full of singers so eager to perform that they will pay to be part of opera productions, Mr. Smith said. ''We don't want to take advantage of singers, who are the very definition of starving artists,'' he said. ''They can barely afford to make ends meet.''
 A year ago, Mr. Smith thought the stock market looked fishy and he moved his retirement savings into a money market. He has followed that visionary acumen by borrowing some of those savings to pay for ''Die Fledermaus.''
 The major expenses, Mr. Smith said, are for musicians -- a string section has just been added to the piano -- and for the theater.
 ''We got rehearsal time as part of the package for renting the theater, but we needed space at other times,'' he said. ''It's kind of pricey to produce opera. I didn't realize it.''
 Besides Amato, on the Bowery, the city has other small companies that run on devotion and shoestrings, Ms. Greenstein said. Among them are the Dicapo Opera on the Upper East Side, the Chelsea Opera in Chelsea, and the Regina Opera in Dyker Heights-Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.
 ''So far, we've sold 104 tickets,'' Mr. Smith said. ''We need 334 to break even.'' 
 ''Round it up and say 400,'' Ms. Greenstein said. ''I don't think there's such a thing as profit in opera.'' 
 ''It's crazy what people will do when they believe in something,'' Mr. Smith said.

HEADLINE: Turning to Cube Steak, And Back to Childhood

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
I AM in love with the cube steak.
 There. It's out. My madeleine is a piece of round steak mechanically mashed into submission.
 The realization came to me not too long ago, when I found a package in the grass-fed beef bins where I buy my groceries. I took them home, patted them with some seasoned flour and slipped them into a hot skillet. Six minutes later I was right back at my childhood dinner table, when cube steaks on a Tuesday night meant life was safe, steady and predictable. 
 But my feelings for the cube steak are more than nostalgic. That I can get grass-fed cube steaks for about $8 a pound (half that if I go for conventionally raised beef) is a comfort to my budget, too.
 The cube steak is suddenly one of the hottest cuts of beef in the country, according to figures from the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. The amount of cube steak sold during the last quarter of 2008 was up by almost 10 percent over the same period a year earlier. The overall amount of beef sold went up only 3 percent. 
 It doesn't take a wizard to figure out that the economy's swan dive has much to do with the cube steak's resurgence. But even before kitchen budgets became tight, the cube steak had its fan base. 
 Through good times and bad, it has remained a wallflower among meat cuts. Old-fashioned and a little mysterious, it's a steak without pretension, or maybe a hamburger with humble aspirations. 
 But tell people you're on a little cube-steak jag, and the reactions you get -- either pro or con -- are surprisingly powerful considering we're talking about a cutlet.
 ''I feel sad and sick whenever I hear the term 'cube steak,' '' said a friend whose mother used to bake them into greasy, grim casseroles studded with string beans. The cube steak represents all that was unstylish and lacking in her childhood.
 Bill Niman, the boutique beef man from California, has a strong reaction to the cube steak, too. It's not all bad. He appreciates that the cube steak once served as the convenience food for an entire generation. And he likes that the tenderizing method helps make use of the whole animal, which is especially helpful for small-scale grass ranchers with tiny profit margins.
 But when Mr. Niman fixed one for himself recently, it only served to remind him of the gloopy, tomato-soaked Swiss steaks of his childhood. 
 ''I fed it to the dogs,'' he said. 
 But other people jumped on me like I was a long-lost sorority sister when I brought up my appreciation of the cube steak.
 ''Oh, I just really love them,'' gushed Kathy Sullivan, 66. A Rhode Island resident, she has warm memories of cube steaks served alongside her father's homemade piccalilli relish. Later, she pan-fried them for her own children. But only good ones, she said, made from slices of sirloin or round steak she had the butcher cube by hand.
 Susan Schultz, who lives in Fort Atkinson, Wis., fondly described the slightly pink centers of cube steak sauteed in nothing more than butter and seasoned with a little salt and pepper. 
 ''It was kind of an upgraded hamburger if you couldn't afford steak,'' said Mrs. Schultz, who raised two children on pan-fried cube steaks. ''I'm going to have to have one now.''
 The term ''cube'' can be a little murky. It doesn't refer to the shape of the meat, which is usually beef but is sometimes made from pork, elk or other animals. Rather, it refers to both the shape of the dimples that checkerboard the surface of cube steak and the process that puts the dimples there.
 Although pounding tough pieces of beef to make them more tender has a long history in the Southern and Western United States, it wasn't until patents on mechanized cubing machines were handed out in the 1930s and 1940s that the cube steak became an inexpensive butcher shop staple.
 The machines are usually stainless-steel cases with innards fashioned from rollers covered in dozens of teeth sharp enough to pierce flesh cleanly. There are top-feeding home machines with cranks that do the job, too.
 As the steaks caught on, the term ''cubing'' entered the lexicon to describe other ways of dimpling a tough piece of meat to make it tender, whether the tool was a medieval looking mallet, a handheld device with thin blades or even the edge of a heavy plate. 
 As an added perk, the dimples provide more surface area for flour to cling to, which makes for crisper cutlets in applications like chicken-fried steaks.
 A cube steak is usually from the top or the round, parts of the animal that are tough because they get a lot of exercise. Sometimes, a butcher will use a slice of sirloin. The only cuts that can't be used are shank and heel meat. Usually the cube steak is one solid piece of meat, but sometimes the cubing machine has been used to compress several strips or bits of meat into one cutlet. 
 ''There'd be no crime to use two or three small pieces of top round or bottom round or sirloin and knit it together in the cube steak machine,'' said Louie Muench, whose father opened Louie's Finer Meats in Cumberland, Wis., almost 40 years ago.
 Certainly, the practice of knitting together odds and ends has contributed mightily to the cube steak's reputation as a mystery meat. Lynne Olver, a research librarian and editor of The Food Timeline, a culinary Web site, sent along a 1969 Consumer Reports investigation entitled ''Cube Steak: Often a Doubtful Buy.''
 ''There's nothing wrong with improving a good, but tough, cut of beef by running it through a tenderizer, and then selling it at beef prices,'' the authors wrote. ''But when there's no way to tell the difference between that product and meat scraps, perhaps with fat added, the products should be defined by law.''
 That kind of controversy has not dampened true fans of the cube steak. In the South, the cube steak is countrified under a blanket of onions and gravy. In the Midwest, the cube steak is happily baked into the casseroles. In Texas, it's buried under the cream gravy, and in Miami it's nestled alongside a pile of onions seasoned with lime.
 I sent out a family e-mail message to some Cuban in-laws asking them about the popularity of the cube steak in the Cuban kitchen. My query started a string of more than 50 e-mail messages among opinionated cooks from Miami to Seaside, Calif.
 They waxed lyrical about bistec de palomilla, the Cuban national steak, and debated whether lemon juice was a reasonable substitute for lime juice in the marinade. People weighed in on the etymology of the word ''palomilla'' and the political leanings of the late Nitza Villapol, the Cuban cooking teacher who codified the nation's cuisine in books and on television.
 So yes, the cube steak is popular in the Cuban kitchen.
 ''My mother-in-law makes it, my grandmother makes it and I make it about once a week,'' said Vivette Castro, among the best cooks in the clan. Family methods vary, but her steaks get a bath in lime juice and garlic for at least an hour. When she's in a hurry, she'll grab a foam tray of cube steaks, but her family prefers it when she has the butcher at the supermarket run a piece of round or sirloin through the tenderizer -- twice.
 In the Southeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, the cube steak dresses up regularly as a smothered steak. Braised slowly with fried onions and chicken stock, cube steaks were an essential part of Gillian Clark's childhood -- so much so that Ms. Clark, a chef in Washington, D.C., put the recipe in her memoir, ''Out of the Frying Pan,'' (Thomas Dunne Books, 2007). 
 Leftover braised cube steak, she writes, makes an irresistible sandwich. But make sure you add napkins to the lunch bag. A cube steak sandwich once made her daughter's hands so greasy, she slipped off the monkey bars at school and broke an arm.
 Texans view the chicken-fried steak as a birthright, but you best not call it a cube steak. The ensuing discussion can be as heated as one about whether a proper CFS (shorthand for chicken-fried steak among those who think deeply about it) should be coated with seasoned flour and pan-fried or dipped in a batter and deep-fried. 
 Most Texas restaurants will say they make the dish with flattened round steak, whether they tenderize it by hand or buy it mechanically tenderized. Technically, that is a cube steak. But in Texas, the supermarket-style cube steak is considered too puny for the job. 
 To understand the nuances of the Texas cube steak debate, I called Robb Walsh, the Houston-based food writer who has written extensively about the origins of CFS. 
 ''It's an interesting question,'' Mr. Walsh said. He would not concede that the meat in a chicken-fried steak is necessarily cube steak, although some recipes call for just that. 
 Mr. Walsh, who has divided the state into three distinct CFS regions, also thinks a batter-dipped slice of steak is just as good as one dipped in flour or even one dressed in a mixture of egg and bread crumbs, schnitzel-style.
 I ran this information by Bud Kennedy, who has been writing about things Texas for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram for 28 years. Even over the phone, I could tell he was shaking his head. A chicken-fried steak in his part of Texas is simply coated with flour and pan-fried.
 ''The only school of thought here is whether the gravy goes on top of the steak or under the steak,'' he said. ''He's dealing with the global chicken-fried steak issues down there in Houston. But it's not something you want to overthink.''
 For the record, Mr. Kennedy thinks cube steaks ''are just scrawny.'' He likes a pounded-out round steak. 
 Gus and Rosemarie Hudson fried, by their estimation, a million chicken-fried steaks before they retired and closed down Gennie's Bishop Grill near Dallas a few years ago. They liked to use bottom round because ''it was the best you could get for the price,'' Mr. Hudson said. His meat supplier tenderized them for him in a cubing machine.
 So would he call it a cube steak? 
 ''I don't care what you call it,'' he said. ''It's a cutlet, period.''

HEADLINE: San Diego Reinvents a Fading Quarry

BYLINE: By DAN LUZADDER

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
From a rocky patch of ground near the top of an old quarry, Thomas Sudberry, a developer, and Gordon Carrier, an architect, peered over the edge at what was left of an operation that had excavated sand and gravel in the geographic heart of this oceanside city since the Great Depression. 
 The quarry, owned since the late 1920s by the Grant family, has produced stone and concrete for many of the major construction projects in San Diego County over the last 70 years -- from airport runways at Lindbergh Field to skyscrapers, piers, Navy installations, highways and most recently, Petco Park, the downtown baseball stadium of the San Diego Padres. 
 On this February morning, the two men watched as a front-end loader dug into the last of the rapidly waning piles of fist-sized stone on the quarry floor. The deafening sound of rocks smashing into a metal dump truck will soon fall silent. In its place, Mr. Sudberry said, will be the sounds of ''waterfalls, song birds, wind in the trees'' and children playing. 
 Despite the national economic woes, the project is among the redevelopment efforts moving forward in a city that began its own economic recovery under a new mayor, Jerry Sanders, in 2005. 
 Mr. Sanders, who inherited a city in financial crisis -- its water and sewer systems deteriorating, its pensions underfunded and its municipal bond ratings low -- has overseen a turnaround that has helped restore the city's fiscal health and encourage new commercial and residential development, particularly in downtown areas that were havens for the homeless and deserted by most other citizens after dark. 
 The project, called Quarry Falls, has been on the drawing board for much of the last decade, but was approved by the city council last October. In the next months, earthmovers will finish compacting soil and terracing the 230-acre site as it is readied for the first phase of construction, set to begin next year. 
 Phase one -- which is budgeted for $375 million, a quarter of the project's $1.5 billion price tag -- will include construction of multifamily housing units, retail shops and some commercial office space. Marco A. Sessa, vice president of development for Sudberry Properties, based in San Diego, said financing would come in part from construction loans through local banks that had been long-time lenders for Sudberry projects. 
 While tight credit markets are affecting other projects in San Diego, as they have elsewhere in the country, Sudberry's private equity will cover the cost of getting Quarry Falls ready for initial construction, Mr. Sessa said. Additional capital will come from the Grant family, through the sale of property to developers seeking to build rental buildings. 
 ''We are fortunate to be in a joint venture with our landowner partner that allows us the ability to remain patient if the capital market situation continues to deteriorate,'' Mr. Sessa said.
 Quarry Falls follows an urban master plan called City of Villages that envisions mixed-use, self-sustaining communities. Among the first was Liberty Station, the former United States Naval Training Center that closed in the 1990s and left the city with a series of historic buildings. The Corky McMillin Companies of San Diego stepped in three years ago as contractor to turn the area into what is now a thriving center of residential, retail, office and business space -- which is also currently enjoying one of the lowest vacancy rates in the county at 2 percent.
 Joe Haeussler, senior vice president of McMillin's commercial division, said that the City of Villages plan helped the company navigate historic preservation concerns -- the area is on the National Register of Historic Places -- and guided the placement of retail shops, art centers, social events areas and a 50-acre waterfront park that serves residents and attracts tourists.
 Quarry Falls traces a similar path, which began with the Grant family. 
 ''The Grant family was interested in the legacy aspect of this property,'' said Mr. Sudberry, the owner of Sudberry Properties, who approached the family a decade ago when it became clear that the quarry was nearing the end of its productive life. 
 Alan Grant, one of six family members who serve on a trust that runs the quarry business, said the family wanted to ensure that the property was not turned into another shopping mall.
 As partners, the Grant family trust and Sudberry Properties plan to eventually build more than one million square feet of retail and office space around what Mr. Sudberry calls the area's version of Central Park. Features will include large waterfalls, walking paths, trolleys that connect to public transit and an elementary school. The project will also emphasize sustainability, energy efficiency and recycling.
 San Diego has already experienced some of what the rest of the country is now going through, said Mayor Sanders. But after trimming some 850 city workers, convincing bond underwriters that the city would pay its bills and investing in infrastructure, San Diego is better situated to weather the national economic storm, he said.
 More than $2 billion has been invested in overhauling downtown so far, said Frank Alessi, chief financial officer of the Centre City Development Corporation, and the city expects $2 billion more in downtown construction and remodeling over the next several years.
 Still, new financing is an issue. San Diego office vacancies rose to 17 percent at the end of 2008, according to CB Richard Ellis, and 30,000 construction industry workers have lost their jobs since last year, said Mr. Sanders. Its once soaring buy-and-flip office market is gone, and there is a glut of housing. 
 Still, a real estate study by the Urban Land Institute last year suggested San Diego was better suited to sustain development than other places.More than a dozen projects are under construction downtown, including some 632 hotel rooms and 48,000 square feet of commercial office and retail space, Mr. Alessi noted. He said most of the projects, to his knowledge, were adequately financed through completion. 
 ''These things are still happening,'' Mr. Alessi said. ''But do we expect fewer starts downtown in the next 18 months over finance? Yes, that is fair to say.''
 Mr. Sanders said he took pleasure these days in seeing what has happened in the city's downtown, which he once patrolled when he was a policeman.
 ''This used to be a place where people did not want to go at night because, one, there was nothing to do and, two, they were reluctant to meet up with some of the people hanging around there,'' Mr. Sanders said. ''We're on track to have a permanent population in the central city of some 90,000 residents soon. That is a village of its own.''

HEADLINE: Music Festivals Adopt An Installment Pay Plan

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
Consumers can use layaway to buy outdoor grills and patio sets at Sears, winter coats at Burlington Coat Factory and dining sets at Kmart. Now music fans can get concert tickets on installment plans, too. 
 For the first time in the 10-year history of the event, Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif., offered the option of spreading out the $269 cost of a three-day pass. 
 Customers had two options besides buying their ticket in one payment: splitting the amount into two equal parts or putting down 10 percent of the total, then paying the rest in two installments, in March and April, before the festival begins on April 17. 
 Other music festivals taking the same approach include Bonnaroo in Tennessee, All Points West in New Jersey and Country Thunder in Arizona.
 Paul Tollett, president of GoldenVoice, the production company behind Coachella, said the company began offering layaway as a pre-emptive measure against sluggish ticket sales that have already hurt other music festivals, including Langerado, an event planned for Miami that was canceled last month because of low sales. 
 Since Coachella tickets went on sale in late January, 18 percent of sales have been under some form of payment plan, Mr. Tollett said. He would not say how many tickets had been sold. ''Without the layaway option, maybe we wouldn't have done so well,'' Mr. Tollett said. He predicted that 50,000 to 60,000 people would attend this year's event, which will feature TV on the Radio, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and My Bloody Valentine, among other bands. 
 Mr. Tollett said the company had decided to test a layaway option in October for StageCoach, its country music festival on April 25 and 26 in Indio. ''That crowd has been rocked by foreclosures,'' he said. ''We thought if we made it easier, we could still get people there.'' 
 After roughly a quarter of StageCoach tickets were sold under some type of payment plan, GoldenVoice decided to offer similar plans for several more of its weekend-long events, including the Mile High Music Festival in Denver; the Rothbury Music Festival in Michigan and All Points West. 
 The plans have been a relief for fans who otherwise might have had to forgo the festivals. 
 ''It's a lot easier coming up with $100 as opposed to $300,'' said Nicole Behanna, 27, an engineer at Robert Morris University in Pennsylvania, who is using layaway to see Bruce Springsteen, Phish and Nine Inch Nails at the four-day Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in June in Manchester, Tenn. 
 Ms. Behanna is paying for her ticket in five installments of $50 each, with shipping and processing fees lumped into the first payment. 
 About 20 percent of Bonnaroo ticket sales so far this year have been under a payment plan, compared with 4 percent of total ticket sales last year, said Ashley Capps, president of AC Entertainment, one of the organizations behind the event.
 Mr. Capps cited the economy as a factor for the increase in layaway, but he said the company also marketed the plan a lot more heavily this year. ''For many people, three smaller payments are a lot more effective for their budget,'' he said. ''Why not make it easier for people to attend?''

HEADLINE: Pending Home Sales Hit New Low, Realtors' Index Shows

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The number of people who agreed to buy a previously owned home sank to a new low in January as economic woes turned them away from the housing market, the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday. 
 The group's seasonally adjusted index of pending sales contracts fell 7.7 percent, to 80.4, in January, from a downwardly revised December reading of 87.1.
 The January index was worse than the 85.1 economists had expected, according to Thomson Reuters, and was below the previous record low of 82.5 in November.
 ''It really does all come back to the job market,'' said Mike Larson, a real estate analyst with Weiss Research, in a research note. ''The latest evidence suggests we're seeing little relief on that front. Jobless claims are rising sharply and layoff announcements are coming fast and furious.''
 The index, which started in 2001, tracks signed contracts to buy previously owned homes. Typically there is a one- to two-month lag between a contract and a completed deal, so the index is a barometer for future sales.
 Pending sales were down in every region but the West, where soaring foreclosures have made prices attractive for buyers. The index there was up more than 2 percent from December.
 Pending sales were down about 13 percent in the Northeast, 12 percent in the South and 9 percent in the Midwest.
 Many in the real estate industry are counting on an $8,000 tax credit for first-time buyers as their best hope for improving sales. That incentive was in the economic stimulus package President Obama signed last month.
 ''Even with many serious potential home buyers on the sidelines waiting for passage of the stimulus bill, job losses and weak consumer confidence were a natural drag on home sales,'' Lawrence Yun, the Realtors' chief economist, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: For a Weekend, Fishermen Measure Haul in Verse

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: ASTORIA, Ore. 

 BODY:
Work, sometimes just the memory of it, is what brings the fisher poets to this faded port at the mouth of the Columbia River for a weekend each year. 
 They might wax about the versatility of a deck bucket or of romance in rubber boots, but they also describe a livelihood that can kill those who pursue it. And at a time when industries everywhere are in decline, this year some said that increasingly restrictive fishing laws had long ago taught them about struggle. 
 ''The bailout is there for bankers,'' said Jon Campbell, a former fisherman from Rhode Island, reading Saturday night from what he called a work in progress, ''but they're out to sink the fleet.'' 
 That line met rousing applause here at the annual Fisher Poets Gathering. First held in 1998 with a few people standing on a stage in a bar, the event now fills a weekend with verse, song and storytelling across four sites. Given the economy, attendance was somewhat lower this year than in the past. Then again, populism played particularly well. Camp converged with oceangoing cred. Old salts dazzled California transplants. Even a bad day of fishing, it seems, can produce a decent rhyme. Or not. 
 ''I have to set aside my English-teacher hat now and then,'' said Fred Chancey, recently retired from Chemeketa Community College in Salem, Ore., who showed up for the second year in a row, just to listen. ''But a lot of it is really good stuff. I like the blue-collar school of poetry.''
 The gathering generates what Mr. Chancey called ''friction,'' a constructive tension between those who have accumulated real experience at sea and those who are drawn to them. Looks can be deceiving. Some participants seem more city than seaworthy but can recount years on deck. Others look the part but mostly like the lore. 
 A few performers, like Mr. Campbell, have Web sites. Others, too busy fishing, write only when the gathering presents a deadline. Still others face parental expectations. 
 Max Broderick, 20, a junior at Humboldt State University who is majoring in natural resource planning, has fished his family's commercial site on Bristol Bay in Alaska each summer since he was 13. On Saturday night, he recounted one dreamlike haul: 
 As it turns out, this set saves the day,
 Because the fish train hits 
 and now we're being highly paid.
 With each jag that comes over the roller of kings, reds and chums, 
 This business of fishing has instantly become more fun.
 Mr. Broderick's father, Jon, teaches English and other subjects at Seaside High School, just south of Astoria and helped start the Fisher Poets Gathering. Jon Broderick said he was motivated by an interest in storytelling and because ''work was a better subject than love.'' 
 For a few fishermen, the event has helped introduce them to a new audience. Dave Densmore, 62, of Knappa, Ore., said he wrote his first poem as a joke while hung over one morning in the 1970s. He read it to fellow fishermen over a VHF radio off Kodiak, Alaska. Now Mr. Densmore gets calls to perform on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., in the middle of salmon season and has to decide what to do. He says he chooses fishing.
 ''Those are the people I want to talk to,'' Mr. Densmore said of the affluent coastal residents who have shown a steady interest in his stories. ''Not that I want to benefit, but I want the industry to benefit. We're being managed to death.''
 Mr. Densmore grew up on the Aleutian Islands, where his parents were missionaries. Writing was not an early interest; now he studies with a teacher from the local community college. 
 On Saturday morning, he held an ''open boat,'' inviting attendees of the gathering into the galley of his salmon fishing boat, the Cold Stream. Retirees in trim weatherproof jackets marveled at his hard-work hands. 
 ''This is the closest I've been to a boat like this,'' said Ted Osborn, an architect who, with his wife Wendy, is waiting for their new retirement home overlooking the Columbia to be completed. ''We lived for 30 years in Southern California, where pretentiousness is king. This place is much more real.''
 The Clatsop County Historical Society is preparing for Astoria's bicentennial celebration in 2011, two centuries after John Jacob Astor's Pacific Fur Company established a trading post here. Timber and fishing followed the fur trade. Struggle came when other ports rose, dams were built and resource industries faded. The population, about 10,000, has been flat for decades, though downtown is shifting toward art and espresso. Victorian houses clutter hillsides, some brightly renovated, others falling apart.
 The most striking legacy of the past is the pilings that rise everywhere out of the river, with no apparent purpose. They used to support scores of salmon canneries. Now the new Cannery Pier Hotel rests on one century-old set beneath the Astoria-Megler Bridge, which crosses the river to Washington State.
 Of course, fresh fish from the region is favored now, not canned. Entrants in the gathering's ''on-site'' poetry contest on Saturday night were told barely 24 hours earlier that submissions had to be at least eight lines, take less than a minute to read and include the phrase ''you might be missing fish.''
 Rob Seitz, who cycles nearly year round through cod, whiting and Dungeness crab seasons on his 80-foot steel boat, placed third with these verses:
 If your son is not intimidating
 On the line of scrimmage,
 If your daughter's report card
 Is not the brightest image,
 If your children are not turning out
 As healthy as you'd wished,
 Perhaps on your dinner table
 You might be missing fish.
 Mr. Seitz, 42, said he wrote only once a year, on gathering weekend in Astoria. But he does prepare.
 ''On the boat, I don't have a TV,'' he said. ''We just read.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Astoria's past is ever present in wood pilings that used to support salmon canneries and now dot the waters of the Columbia River under the Astoria-Megler Bridge.

Banking has long been to this tidy city what cars are to Detroit and computers to Silicon Valley, only more reliably. For while fortunes swung wildly in those places, quietly serving the world's wealthy made growth here as predictable as a fine Swiss watch.
 Until now. 
 With Switzerland's biggest bank, UBS, staggering beneath a tax scandal that has undermined this country's vaunted banking secrecy -- as well as $53 billion in write-downs on American subprime securities -- not only is Switzerland's reputation for stability threatened but so is the industry that made it one of the world's wealthiest countries.
 ''There is a sense that this is a very, very dangerous situation because the banking sector has been crucial to Switzerland's well-being,'' said Charles Wyplosz, director of the International Center for Money and Banking Studies in Geneva. ''If it were to shrink, there is no doubt it would have serious consequences for our standard of living.''
 Stability will not return soon. Last week, UBS replaced its chief executive, Marcel Rohner, after only 20 months in the job, choosing the former leader of its archrival, Credit Suisse, Oswald Grubel, to take his place. Pressure is building on Peter Kurer, the chairman of UBS, to step down. In the close-knit world of Swiss banking, speculation is rife that Mr. Kurer, who served in top management roles during both the tax and subprime debacles, could be out within days.
 Britain and the United States have spent hundreds of billions shoring up their banks, but Switzerland's resources are considerably more limited. At roughly $2 trillion, the balance sheet of UBS is four times as large as Switzerland's gross domestic product.
 Over all, Swiss bank assets equal 6.8 times gross domestic product, less worrisome than Ireland's 9.5 multiple, but still far more than in the United States, where commercial bank assets stand at 70 percent of G.D.P.
 What's more, this alpine wealth haven is set to get another blast of unwelcome attention Wednesday when a Senate panel examines how UBS helped American taxpayers evade the reach of the Internal Revenue Service.
 ''These abuses have been going on for much too long,'' said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who will lead the hearing and is sponsoring legislation that would crack down on offshore accounts.
 Last month, UBS paid a $780 million fine and turned over roughly 250 client names, avoiding a criminal indictment but igniting outrage in a country where bank secrecy -- or bank privacy, as the Swiss prefer to call it -- is practically an article of faith. 
 The numbered, virtually anonymous Swiss bank account is the stuff of movie legend and popular lore.
 But here it is a bread and butter issue -- Switzerland's financial services sector contributes 12.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product. That compares to 5 percent from financial services in the countries that use the euro and about 8.5 percent in the United States. 
 In Zurich, while politicians sputter about how Switzerland is being unfairly singled out and point fingers at British tax havens in the Caribbean and the Channel Islands, UBS executives have a more basic worry: client money is pouring out of the bank's coffers.
 In 2008, clients pulled 123 billion Swiss francs, or $105 billion, out of UBS's global wealth management business, equal to nearly 8 percent of assets under management. That outflow, along with the drop in value of investments like stocks and bonds in 2008, lowered UBS's total private assets under management to $1.4 trillion by the end of 2008, from nearly $2 trillion at the end of 2007.
 ''The main reason was bad publicity and the mistakes we made, not only in trading but in wealth management,'' said Mr. Grubel, the new chief executive. ''It created uncertainty and mistrust with clients and led to an outflow.''
 He admitted that restoring clients' confidence would not happen overnight. ''From my experience it takes up to 12 months for outflows to reverse,'' he said. 
 Referring to the United States tax case, Mr. Grubel added, ''We should never have gotten into it, and we should never do something like that in the future.''
 UBS shares closed at $8.35 in New York on Tuesday, down from a high of $35.36 last April. 
 For Switzerland over all, as for UBS, it has been an abrupt fall.
 From 2004 to 2007, the Swiss economy grew by nearly 3 percent annually, but in the final quarter of 2008, the economy shrank by 0.6 percent, according to data released Tuesday.
 That might not sound like much compared with the 6.2 percent contraction that hit the American economy during the same period, but the possibility of a steeper decline in 2009 is alarming to citizens long sheltered from issues like war and economic instability.
 ''A 2 or 3 percent contraction is quite exceptional for Switzerland,'' said Pirmin Bischof, a member of the Swiss Parliament from the center-right Christian Democratic party.
 Mr. Bischof, who studied at Harvard Law School and considers himself an admirer of the United States, said that for ordinary Swiss voters, the biggest issue after the economy was the fate of bank secrecy and Washington's effort to force UBS to hand over more names.
 ''It's a double standard,'' he said. ''What's going on now is very difficult to understand.''
 For UBS, the fallout from the tax case as well as the boardroom turmoil could not have come at a worse time. Just last fall, the Swiss National Bank agreed to buy $39.1 billion in so-called toxic assets, removing them from UBS's balance sheet and providing UBS with a $6 billion injection of cash.
 And by the beginning of 2009, it seemed as if things were beginning to stabilize, said Urs P. Roth, chief executive of the Swiss Bankers Association. ''It was in a turnaround and right at that moment, the Department of Justice decided to force UBS to deliver the information,'' Mr. Roth said.
 Over the long term, Mr. Roth said Switzerland would retain its position as a global wealth haven despite the pressure to provide more names to American authorities, and competition from even less regulated locales like the Cayman Islands and the Channel Islands.
 ''Bad cases are always a blow to reputations,'' he said. ''But we are quite confident that the reputation can be maintained and built up again.''

HEADLINE: Prosecutors Plan Crackdown on Doctors Who Accept Kickbacks

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS; Duff Wilson contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal health officials and prosecutors, frustrated that they have been unable to stop illegal kickbacks to doctors from drug and device companies, are investigating doctors who take money for using these products.
 For years, prosecutors rarely pursued doctors because they believed that juries would sympathize with respected clinicians. But within a few months, officials plan to file civil and criminal charges against a number of surgeons who they say demanded profitable consulting agreements from device makers in exchange for using their products.
 ''What we need to do is make examples of a couple of doctors so that their colleagues see that this isn't worth it,'' said Lewis Morris, chief counsel to the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services. ''We want to send the message to the physician community -- particularly surgeons -- that you can't do this.''
 The move against doctors is part of a diverse campaign to curb industry marketing tactics that enrich doctors but increase health care costs and sometimes endanger patients. Taken together, the new measures are likely to transform the relationship between medicine and industry. 
 Over the past year, for instance, prosecutors have greatly increased fines that are collected as part of plea agreements with drug and device companies charged with illegal marketing tactics. In January, Eli Lilly announced it would pay a record fine of $1.4 billion to settle federal criminal charges that it illegally marketed Zyprexa, an antipsychotic medicine. Two weeks later, Pfizer announced that it had set aside $2.3 billion to pay an expected fine over charges that it illegally marketed Bextra, a painkiller that has been withdrawn from the market. 
 Michael J. Sullivan, the United States attorney for Massachusetts, said that prosecutors -- after winning record fines from a record number of companies -- realized that they needed to expand the scope of their targets. 
 ''The strategy of looking at the companies alone was not completely successful in terms of our objective to deter health care fraud,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''So it's fair to say that the government is looking at evidence of criminal wrongdoing even by doctors.'' 
 Besides jail time and fines, doctors convicted in the cases could lose their licenses for a time and be excluded from the federal Medicare and Medicaid programs, severely limiting their potential pool of patients.
 Dr. Charles D. Rosen, an orthopedic surgeon and president of the Association for Medical Ethics, predicted that the pending cases would tarnish the entire profession. ''The abuse of the public trust by the few will hurt the many,'' Dr. Rosen said. 
 Also, as part of plea bargains, federal health officials are forcing a growing number of drug and device makers to post publicly all payments made to doctors who serve as consultants or speakers. Manufacturers have repeatedly used consulting payments in illegal schemes to persuade doctors to prescribe drugs or devices in inappropriate and unapproved ways, according to federal charges. 
 Prosecutors are hoping that public disclosures of the details of these agreements will make criminal conduct more difficult to conduct and easier to spot, and that they will discourage doctors from taking money and gifts from manufacturers at all. 
 ''The rules of the game have changed,'' said Dr. David Rothman, president of the Institute on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia University. ''You've got to presume that anything you take from a drug or device company is going to be on a Web site. Your colleagues will know; your patients will know. That's going to stop a lot of doctors from pocketing their gifts and funds.''
 Since a substantial share of doctors accept money from drug or device makers, the public postings could have considerable effects.
 In Minnesota, the state's unique payment disclosure and gift limit law has led a growing number of academic and private medical centers to impose severe restrictions on industry marketing practices. Park Nicollet Health Services, one of the largest health systems in the state, banned all industry gifts and nearly all free drug samples and has made public all doctor consulting payments. 
 The Department of Health and Human Services inspector general's power to require payment disclosures extends only to companies charged with wrongdoing. A bill sponsored by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Senator Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, would mandate that all drug and device makers disclose such payments.
 Companies that have announced their intentions to disclose payments to doctors even before the legislation is passed have won plaudits from ethicists and industry critics.
 ''Being more transparent by opening up our business to the public is an important step to building trust and confidence,'' John C. Lechleiter, the chief executive of Eli Lilly, said in a speech to the Economic Club of Indiana in September. 
 On Feb. 9, the chief executive of Pfizer, Jeffrey B. Kindler, said the disclosures were part of the company's commitment to increased transparency and would ''earn the trust of patients and the public.''
 Neither executive mentioned that prosecutors would soon require them to make such disclosures anyway. In addition to Eli Lilly and Pfizer, companies that have agreed to disclose payments to doctors include Merck, Cephalon, GlaxoSmithKline and Medtronic. Some executives contend that the disclosures will increase public support for the payments.
 ''Through greater transparency about the nature of these relationships, we will help people better understand how important they are to developing life-saving and enhancing products for patients who need them,'' Bill Hawkins, chairman and chief executive of Medtronic, said Tuesday.
 But doctors who have seen details of their consulting deals made public say they have been tarred.
 Dr. Richard Grimm, a Minnesota researcher, twice served on government-sponsored hypertension panels that create guidelines about when to prescribe blood pressure pills. But when state records revealed that he had earned more than $798,000 from drug companies from 1997 to 2005, invitations to serve on such panels dried up, he said. 
 ''There's this automatic assumption that if you make money from a drug company, you must be corrupt,'' Dr. Grimm said. 
 Prosecutors are hoping the new measures will finally stop drug and device companies from repeatedly breaking the law.
 Eli Lilly, for instance, pleaded guilty to illegal marketing charges in 1985 related to its arthritis drug Oraflex, in 2006 related to its osteoporosis drug Evista, and in January related to Zyprexa. In 2004, Pfizer paid a $430 million fine and pleaded guilty to criminal charges that it illegally marketed the epilepsy drug Neurontin, and it now faces similar charges over its marketing of Bextra.
 A common problem in illegal drug and device marketing cases is doctors' willingness to delude themselves into thinking that cash, lucrative trips and other kickbacks do not affect them, said Mr. Morris, the chief counsel.
 ''Somehow physicians think they're different from the rest of us,'' Mr. Morris said. ''But money works on them just like everybody else.''
 Mr. Sullivan, the United States attorney, said officials hoped to send a strong message to doctors. ''I have been shocked at what appears to be willful blindness by folks in the physician community to the criminal conduct that corrupts the patient-physician relationship,'' he said

HEADLINE: Bid to Undo Bush Memo On Threats To Species

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
A few weeks before he left office, President George W. Bush told federal officials that, in effect, they did not have to bother getting the advice of wildlife experts before taking actions that might harm plants or animals protected by the Endangered Species Act.
 On Tuesday, President Obama said that, in effect, they did. 
 At a visit to the Interior Department marking its 150th anniversary, the president said he had signed a memorandum directing the Interior and Commerce Departments to review a regulation that the Bush administration issued Dec. 16. 
 The regulation lifted longstanding requirements that agencies contemplating actions that might affect endangered species consult with scientists from the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service and to take their guidance into account.
 Until the review is complete, Mr. Obama's memorandum says, agencies must return to the former practice of seeking and acting on scientific advice.
 In brief remarks, the president said he had signed the memorandum to ''help restore the scientific process to its rightful place'' in the working of the Endangered Species Act.
 ''We should be looking for ways to improve it, not weaken it,'' Mr. Obama said of the act, according to a pool report. The president said it was ''false'' to say people must choose between economic growth and environmental protection.
 The announcement drew loud applause from the audience of about 500 who had gathered for the anniversary ceremony. Thousands of other employees watched by teleconference and video, the Interior Department said. 
 But in a statement, Bill Kovacs, the vice president for environment, technology and regulatory affairs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, condemned the action as an unreasonable interference with needed projects. 
 ''While real Americans are looking for jobs, Washington bureaucrats are debating if, for instance, a bridge project in Florida contributed to the melting of Arctic ice,'' Mr. Kovacs said.
 Arctic ice entered this debate last year, when polar bears were listed as a threatened species under the act. Critics said that as a result, the Endangered Species Act could in theory be applied to stop anything that might contribute in even a small way to global warming.
 Republicans in Congress said Mr. Obama's action could lead to needless delays in projects financed by the stimulus package.
 But Representative Nick J. Rahall II, Democrat of West Virginia and chairman of the House Resources Committee, called Mr. Obama's memorandum ''a change for the better.'' 
 Environmental groups agreed. Kieran Suckling, executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, called the shift ''welcome news.''
 Janette Brimmer, a staff lawyer with Earthjustice, a nonprofit legal group that has challenged the Bush change in court, said the memorandum was ''an important first step.'' 
 Before the Bush administration's action, Ms. Brimmer said, when agencies were told their proposals risked harming a listed species, they could ignore the advice but risked being fined for ''an illegal take'' if the species was harmed.
 If the agencies acted on the scientific advice by, say, modifying their plans, they could obtain ''an incidental take permit,'' exempting them from penalties.
 A rider undoing the Bush change has been attached to the budget bill, and if it passes, the change would be undone. But Ms. Brimmer said another bill had also been proposed that would reinforce the Bush change. 
 Because of this uncertainty, she said, Earthjustice will continue to press its lawsuit, which is being heard in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California.
 Ms. Brimmer said four suits challenging the change were pending in the court, three by environmental groups and a fourth by several states, including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.

HEADLINE: Bench Gives Nets Big Boost Over Bucks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Jarvis Hayes hit a tie-breaking 3-pointer on a pass from Vince Carter with 18 seconds left Tuesday night and the rookie Brook Lopez scored 24 points and grabbed 12 rebounds to lift the Nets to a 99-95 road win over the Milwaukee Bucks.
 The Nets' bench provided a bigger-than-expected boost after Carter and Devin Harris struggled, going a combined 8 of 34 from the field. But both provided offense down the stretch. 
 Carter, who had 15 points, made a 3-pointer with the Nets trailing by 84-76. Harris's free throws in the final 7.9 seconds sealed the game's outcome and moved the Nets only a half-game behind Milwaukee for the final playoff spot in the East.
 ''Better late than never,'' Carter said. ''My mentality is to just to keep going, keep shooting. Never be afraid to shoot the ball.''
 MAGIC 111, SUNS 99Dwight Howard had 21 points and 8 rebounds in a bruising battle with Shaquille O'Neal, and host Orlando defeated Phoenix.
 Rashard Lewis had 29 points for the Magic, which overcame a season-high 24 turnovers.
 O'Neal finished with 19 points and 11 rebounds, but his technical foul with 3 minutes 38 seconds left contributed to 9 straight points for the Magic that put the game out of reach.
 PISTONS 100, NUGGETS 95 The ex-Piston Chauncey Billups scored a season-high 34 points in his return to the Palace, but host Detroit came away with a victory against Denver, which was playing without Carmelo Anthony.
 Tayshaun Prince scored 23 points for the Pistons. Four of his teammates scored at least 16.
 The Nuggets suspended Anthony for a game after he refused to come out of a game Sunday night against the Indiana Pacers.
 ROCKETS 107, RAPTORS 97 Carl Landry matched a career high with 22 points as Houston extended its home-court winning streak to 10 games with a victory over Toronto. 
 BOBCATS 96, BULLS 80 Raymond Felton had 18 points and 9 assists, Raja Bell also scored 18 points and host Charlotte beat Chicago for its fourth straight victory.
 WARRIORS 118, WOLVES 94 Stephen Jackson had 23 points, 7 rebounds and 6 assists to lead Golden State to a victory in Minnesota. Corey Maggette added 16 points for the Warriors. Kevin Love had 18 points and 14 rebounds for the Timberwolves.
 minnesota's offer The Timberwolves have a risk-free offer on season tickets for next season: Lose your job and you're off the hook.
 The Timberwolves unveiled a new marketing plan that is keenly aware of the struggling economy and their own dwindling fan base. They are lowering prices on 95 percent of season tickets in Target Center. The team says the price drop is 44 percent in the upper tier and more than 11 percent in the lower tier.
 The Timberwolves are also guaranteeing a refund of any unused season tickets to buyers who lose their job in 2009.
 Kevin McHale, the team's coach, drew more attention to the league's financial problems by saying that ''corrections need to be made'' in the collective bargaining agreement.
 ''I think you'll see a lot of changes coming down the road,'' McHale said. ''I think that the players association knows it.''
 Glen Taylor, the Timberwolves' owner and the chairman of the N.B.A.'s Board of Governors, said he was ''very concerned'' about what the future held for the league if the current economic climate continued.

HEADLINE: Fed Chairman Tacitly Backs Call for Spending

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve on Tuesday tacitly endorsed President Obama's call for huge increases in spending and trillion-dollar deficits over the next couple of years, saying the economic crisis required aggressive action.
 Though the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, did not endorse any of Mr. Obama's specific proposals, he echoed the president's call for bold government action to address the economy's immediate travails and pointedly refused to criticize his longer-term plans.
 ''All else equal, this is a development that all of us would have preferred to avoid,'' Mr. Bernanke told the Senate Budget Committee, referring to record-breaking deficits expected this year and in the next two years. ''But our economy and financial markets face extraordinary challenges, and a failure by policy makers to address these challenges in a timely way would likely be more costly in the end.'' 
 Two officials on Mr. Obama's economic team, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and Peter R. Orszag, the budget director, made similar arguments as they defended the new Obama budget and fielded Congressional Republicans' criticism in separate appearances on Tuesday on Capitol Hill.
 Mr. Bernanke, a Republican who was appointed by President George W. Bush, provided Mr. Obama and Democratic lawmakers with crucial backing for the political battles ahead. His comments were reminiscent of the support that his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, gave to Mr. Bush's call for tax cuts in 2001. Many lawmakers in both parties said Mr. Greenspan's comments had helped override Democratic objections to Mr. Bush's tax cuts. 
 Mr. Bernanke deepened his working alliance with the new president on Tuesday, as the Fed and the Treasury announced plans to increase up a $1 trillion lending program faster than many had expected. 
 The new program, called the Consumer and Business Lending Initiative, was conceived as a way to finance lending to consumers. Last month, the Obama administration proposed expanding the program's reach to revive the frozen credit markets for business financing as well. 
 In a joint announcement on Tuesday, the Fed and the Treasury announced that the first money for consumer loans would start flowing in late March and that the program would expand in April to finance equipment purchases, automobile leasing and other types of loans.
 ''We have to jump-start the credit markets and get private lending going again,'' Mr. Obama said in an appearance at the Transportation Department to announce the first road projects to get financing from the new economic stimulus law. The new program, he said, ''will help unlock our frozen credit markets, which is absolutely essential for economic recovery.''
 In another appearance on Tuesday, with Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain, Mr. Obama suggested that it might be time to be putting money back in the stock market ''if you've got a long-term perspective on it.''
 ''You know, the stock market is sort of like a tracking poll in politics,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It bobs up and down day to day, and if you spend all your time worrying about that, then you're probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong.''
 Mr. Bernanke, warning that the economy had yet to show hardly any sign of recovery, brushed aside objections by Republicans that Mr. Obama's plans would lead to a dangerous growth of government.
 Republican lawmakers tried to draw the Fed chairman into their corner, to no avail. ''There is in this budget a massive movement of the government to the left, in other words a massive expansion of the government,'' warned Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, the committee's ranking Republican.
 But Mr. Bernanke simply said that Congress and the White House needed to start thinking now about how to bring the federal budget back to normal.
 Lawmakers in both parties chastised the Fed and the Treasury for providing $30 billion more to the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate that had already received three rounds of government help totaling $152 billion. 
 Mr. Bernanke, in an unusually emotional response, criticized the insurance giant as making reckless bets that jeopardized the entire financial system.
 ''If there is a single episode in this entire 18 months that has made me more angry, I can't think of one,'' he said.
 Saying that A.I.G. had ''exploited a huge gap'' in the regulatory system, Mr. Bernanke said it became a ''hedge fund, basically, that was attached to a large and stable insurance company'' and made ''huge numbers of irresponsible bets.''
 The administration officials testified that long-term deficit reduction was built into Mr. Obama's budget for the 2010 fiscal year that begins in October, and reflected in a 10-year projection of spending and revenues. Mr. Obama's plan would mainly reduce deficits through higher taxes on households with annual incomes of more than $250,000 and through savings from winding down the Iraq war.
 ''This is simply not a big-spending budget,'' Mr. Orszag, the budget director, told the House Budget Committee. He said that discretionary domestic spending -- nearly all programs other than the fast-growing Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security entitlements -- would average 3.6 percent of the total economy, the lowest level since data began to be collected in 1962. 
 Mr. Orszag added that the president's initiatives on health care, energy and education policies included proposals to offset the costs. None of the new taxes or revenue sources would take effect before 2011, by which time the economy should be recovering, he emphasized.
 Mr. Orszag and Mr. Geithner, who went before the House Ways and Means Committee, came under attack from Congressional Republicans who said the Obama budget was based on a far too rosy view of the recovery.
 When Mr. Geithner insisted to Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, that ''this is a realistic forecast,'' Mr. Brady countered that the budget's projections were ''nowhere close'' to private sector forecasts.
 Administration officials responded that most private forecasts did not account for the positive impact of the $787 billion, two-year stimulus package.

HEADLINE: CLINTON SAYS U.S. IS READY TO BEGIN TALKS WITH SYRIA

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
Signaling a new direction in Middle East diplomacy, the Obama administration will send two senior officials to Syria this weekend to begin discussions with the government, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said on a visit to Israel on Tuesday.
 The overture suggests how the Obama administration intends to tackle three interlocking challenges in the Middle East: the nuclear threat posed by Iran; long-simmering tensions between Israel and Syria; and the grinding conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Syria, regional experts say, could be the key to alleviating all three.
 By seeking an understanding with Syria, which has cultivated close ties to Iran, the United States could increase the pressure on Iran to respond to its offer of direct talks. Such an understanding would also give Arab states and moderate Palestinians the political cover to negotiate with Israel. That, in turn, could increase the burden on Hamas, the Islamic militant group that controls Gaza, to relax its hostile stance toward Israel. 
 But in a region where even small steps take years to negotiate, officials sought to tamp down expectations of rapid progress. ''It is a worthwhile effort to go and begin preliminary conversations,'' Mrs. Clinton said, noting Syria's wide influence in the region, as well as its troubled history with the United States. Yet, she cautioned, ''we have no way to predict what the future of our relations with Syria might be.'' 
 The State Department declined to elaborate on the issues the emissaries would broach in Syria or why negotiators were going now. 
 The two emissaries are Daniel B. Shapiro, a senior director at the National Security Council, and Jeffrey D. Feltman, the acting assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs. Mr. Feltman, a former ambassador to Lebanon, has extensive experience with Syria; Mr. Shapiro advised the Obama campaign on the Arab-Israeli conflict.
 Middle East experts say they believe that conditions for an opening to Syria are ripe on both sides.
 ''We've got a Syrian government that wants to engage,'' said Martin S. Indyk, a former ambassador to Israel and a peace negotiator in the Clinton administration. ''We're likely to get an Israeli government that will find it easier to engage with Syria than with the Palestinians.''
 There are clear benefits to Israel from better relations with Syria: the government of President Bashar al-Assad is a sponsor of Hezbollah, a militant group based in Lebanon, and provides a sanctuary for Hamas's leaders in Damascus, Syria's capital.
 In May, Israel and Syria announced that they were in negotiations for a comprehensive peace treaty through Turkish mediators. Israel's departing prime minister, Ehud Olmert, said he planned to brief Mrs. Clinton on those talks on Tuesday.
 Benjamin Netanyahu, who is likely to become Israel's next prime minister, will face pressure from the United States to move forward with the peace process. Mr. Indyk said that Mr. Netanyahu would find it more politically palatable to engage Syria than to alienate the settler movement by slowing or halting settlements as a concession to the Palestinians.
 Nonetheless, Israeli public opinion polls show wide opposition to giving up the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 war. In his previous stint as prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu initiated peace talks with Syria, but they came to nothing.
 The Obama administration has carefully laid the groundwork for the envoys' visit. Members of Congress, including Senator John Kerry, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, have recently traveled to the region. Last Thursday, Mr. Feltman met with Syria's ambassador to the United States, Imad Moustapha.
 ''We don't engage in discussions for the sake of having conversations,'' Mrs. Clinton said, after a meeting with the Israeli foreign minister, Tzipi Livni. ''There has to be a purpose to them; there has to be some benefit accruing to the United States and our allies.''
 The Bush administration largely shunned Syria, recalling its ambassador in February 2005, after the assassination of a former Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Many Lebanese accuse Syria of involvement in the assassination, a charge it denies. A United Nations tribunal has begun proceedings in the case.
 While Mr. Feltman was the ambassador in Lebanon, three people were killed when a car bomb exploded next to an American Embassy vehicle in Beirut in January 2008. Suspicions again fell on Syria.
 Mr. Feltman and Mr. Shapiro are accompanying Mrs. Clinton on her first tour of the Middle East as secretary of state, which began Monday in Egypt, where she said the United States would pursue peace ''on many fronts.''
 Meeting on Tuesday with Israel's leaders during a time of political transition, Mrs. Clinton reaffirmed the desire of the United States for an agreement that would create a separate Palestinian state side by side with Israel.
 But she was plainly reluctant to step into a domestic political tussle. Mr. Netanyahu, who is likely to form a right-wing government in the coming days, has emphasized economic development in the West Bank over negotiations to create a Palestinian state.
 ''We happen to believe that moving toward the two-state solution, step by step, is in Israel's best interests,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''But obviously, it is up to the people and the government of Israel to decide.''
 Ms. Livni said she embraced a two-state solution, a crucial difference between her Kadima Party and Mr. Netanyahu's Likud Party, and one that has impeded Mr. Netanyahu's efforts to form a coalition with Kadima. Mrs. Clinton met with Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday.
 She promised to consult Israel and other Middle Eastern countries as the United States develops its policy toward Iran. At a Gaza donors' conference in Egypt on Monday, Mrs. Clinton told the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates that she did not believe that Iran would respond positively to the Obama administration's offer of direct talks.
 Ms. Livni said she had no qualms about the American offer, but she maintained that Israel's Muslim neighbors were as worried as Israel by Iran. ''They feel that Iran tries to undermine their regimes,'' she said.
 Mrs. Clinton also declined to publicly press Israel to open border crossings into Gaza; critics say that closing the crossings has impeded the flow of humanitarian relief. Israel imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas took control of the territory in June 2007. It has allowed in aid since the end of the recent three-week assault on Hamas, but has not opened the crossings for many other goods. 
 On Monday, European officials said they expected Mrs. Clinton to raise the issue with the Israelis.
 But she said: ''It's very difficult to solve this dilemma when Israel is under physical attack. We have a humanitarian challenge in Gaza, with a lot of innocent Palestinians who need the help, and Hamas decides to continue to rain rockets down on Israel.''

HEADLINE: Shares' Early Gains Are Soon Reversed

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks retreated for a fifth day after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the banking system remained unstable, offsetting gains in commodity shares on speculation that China would increase demand for raw materials. 
 The Goldman Sachs Group and MetLife dragged a gauge of financial companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to its lowest level since 1992. 
 Home Depot fell more than 5 percent as fewer Americans than forecast signed contracts to buy previously owned homes. 
 Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold rose 7.3 percent as China, the world's largest consumer of copper, said its economy would recover this year.
 ''The prevailing mood now is that the government doesn't have enough bullets to deal with the problem,'' said Hayes Miller, a money manager at Baring Asset Management in Boston. ''There are too many uncertainties, and I don't think any particular plan is going to wipe the slate clean.''
 The S.& P. 500 slid 4.49 points, or 0.64 percent, to 696.33, its first close below 700 since October 1996. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 37.27 points, or 0.55 percent, to an almost 12-year low of 6,726.02. The Nasdaq fell 1.84 points, or 0.14 percent, to 1,321.01.
 The S.& P. 500 has dropped almost 56 percent since its October 2007 record close. 
 The index climbed as much as 1.6 percent in early trading after a sell-off on Monday left companies in the index valued at their cheapest level relative to earnings since 1986. 
 The early rally was erased after Mr. Bernanke, testifying before the Senate Budget Committee, spurred concern that the government would not be able to shore up the financial system.
 Goldman Sachs lost 4.5 percent to $82.37, while MetLife fell 17 percent to $13.72.
 ''Those comments that we clearly haven't stabilized are clearly taking the market down,'' said Michael Nasto, the senior trader at U.S. Global Investors in San Antonio.
 The S.& P. 500 Financials Index retreated 1.6 percent for its third straight drop. The Fed said its $1 trillion program to prop up the market for consumer and business loans will start disbursing funds March 25.
 Home Depot dropped $1.03 to $18.89. The index of pending home resales fell 7.7 percent after a 4.8 percent gain in December, the National Association of Realtors said.
 Mining shares advanced as copper rose on speculation that China will buy more raw materials as the country's stimulus plan takes effect. 
 The government is ''confident'' of achieving its 8 percent growth target, the minister of industry and information, Li Yizhong said.
 Producers of raw materials added 0.6 percent for the steepest advance among 10 industries in the S.& P. 500.
 Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note was down 4/32 at 98 29/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 2.88 percent, up from 2.86 percent late Monday.
 Following are the results of Tuesday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: Britain's Prime Minister Hopes to Bolster U.S. Ties

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
When Gordon Brown talks about the United States, he rarely fails to mention the many summer vacations he has taken on Cape Cod. Perhaps more than any British prime minister since Winston Churchill, he exudes a personal fondness and admiration for America, and he says his experiences there have helped make him a committed ''Atlanticist.''
 But no trip to the United States has been weightier for Mr. Brown than the two-day visit to Washington which he began on Tuesday and which will include a meeting with President Obama. He will be the first European government leader to visit the White House since Mr. Obama took office, and he said in a weekend newspaper article that he aimed to give new momentum to the ''special relationship'' between Britain and the United States. 
 ''There is no international partnership in recent history that has served the world better than the special relationship between Britain and the United States,'' Mr. Brown wrote in The Sunday Times of London. ''I believe there is no challenge so great or so difficult that it cannot be overcome by America, Britain and the world working together,'' he added.
 He said he planned to discuss with Mr. Obama his ideas for ''a global New Deal, whose impact can stretch from the villages of Africa to reforming the financial institutions of London and New York.''
 The British leader seemed undaunted by the comments of Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who said last week that the visit would be an occasion to renew the ''special partnership'' between the two countries, a slight shift in language that had some Britons saying that Mr. Obama might be pulling back from the closeness that had developed between President George W. Bush and Tony Blair, Mr. Brown's predecessor. 
 British newspapers have noted that Mr. Obama's formative experiences abroad were as a child in Indonesia, and that his administration intended to give new priority to American ties in the Pacific. The Sunday Telegraph reported that Mr. Obama had ordered the removal of a bust of Churchill displayed in the Oval Office under Mr. Bush, and it noted that Mr. Obama devoted 35 pages of his memoir, ''Dreams From My Father,'' to his grandfather's claims of torture under British colonial rule in Kenya. 
 Even reaching the Oval Office before President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany may mean less than meets the eye. Mr. Obama's first presidential visit to Europe will be for an economic summit meeting in London in April. White House officials have pointed to Mr. Brown's chairmanship of the meeting and the need to set common goals for resolving the global financial crisis as central reasons for inviting Mr. Brown first.
 Still, British pundits have cast the visit as an opportunity for Mr. Brown, 58, to begin a revival of his sinking political fortunes at home, and to help his chances of leading the Labor Party to re-election sometime before June next year.
 Part of the bounce Mr. Brown is seeking, the pundits say, could come simply from the fact of meeting with Mr. Obama. The American president continues to receive approval ratings in European polls that are as high or higher than those he has received in the United States, and European leaders hope some of that popularity will rub off on them.
 Mr. Brown has said that he sees himself as a natural partner for Mr. Obama, as a left-of-center leader battling political opponents -- Republicans in the United States, Conservatives in Britain -- who have resisted huge economic stimulus programs and bank bailouts. In his newspaper article, Mr. Brown said he would also seek common ground with Mr. Obama on action to slow climate change and on development aid to the world's poorest countries. 
 One point on which Mr. Brown seems likely to resist his American host is Afghanistan. Britain has deployed more than 8,300 troops there, second only to the United States. However, Britain has said it is reluctant to respond to Mr. Obama's call for more NATO troops to match the increase of 17,000 American troops he announced last month, at least as long as other nations refuse to increase their combat forces. France and Germany's troop commitments are currently a fraction of Britain's.
 Mr. Brown also hopes to benefit in Washington from the plaudits he won last fall for his program to recapitalize Britain's failing banks before the Bush administration adopted that approach. That early surefootedness, from a man who served 10 years as Britain's finance minister, helped Mr. Brown in the polls at home.
 But with unemployment soaring, home prices plunging and the failure of billions injected into the banks to revive credit flows, Labor's recovery has faltered. Recent polls have shown the Conservatives with a lead of 10 percentage points and more.
 Mr. Brown's personal popularity has plunged, too, partly because of what many see as his refusal to acknowledge his failure, as finance minister, to tighten the lax regulation of investment banking and hedge-fund management that financial experts said was a primary contributor to the financial crisis.
 That criticism seems unlikely to relent, especially when comparisons are drawn with Mr. Obama. ''When Obama bungled a key appointment recently, he simply said, 'I screwed up,' '' Martin Ivens, a columnist in The Sunday Times, wrote this weekend. By contrast, Mr. Brown's strictures for one of the British bankers whose missteps forced a multibillion-dollar government bailout, and who then quit with a pension of close to $1 million a year, seemed ''a bit rich,'' Mr. Ivens said, ''when Brown can't bring himself to say 'sorry' for anything.''

HEADLINE: Brown and Obama Discuss Global Rules for Banking

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain used his first meeting with President Obama on Tuesday to raise the prospect of ''a global New Deal'' that would set common principles for regulating banks, declaring that the fiscal crisis could help to overcome past resistance to increased oversight across borders. 
 In an appearance with Mr. Obama at the White House, Mr. Brown did not provide specifics about the components of the initiative. Mr. Obama, after saying he would not allow policy to be set by the day-to-day gyrations of stock markets, said the issues most important to him were halting ''massive over-leverage'' and ''huge systemic risks taken by unregulated institutions, as well as regulated institutions.'' 
 Mr. Brown was chancellor of the Exchequer, Britain's finance minister, during the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s. But he indicated Tuesday that the reforms set in motion by that crisis -- many of which fell by the wayside once prosperity returned -- would not have been sufficient to handle the complex financial products that contributed to the current stock sell-off as it has raced around the world.
 ''It's almost like a power cut that went right across the financial system,'' Mr. Brown said. ''And we have got to rebuild that financial system.''
 While Mr. Brown referred to his idea as a ''global New Deal,'' that phrase was not repeated in public by Mr. Obama. Aides said the president also did not repeat the slogan during the lunch. 
 In private, American and British officials have spoken of setting up regulations that would govern international banks' transactions wherever they happen in the world, so that banks could not find an offshore banking center where, for example, they could take risks of a kind that would not be allowed in New York or London. 
 The two men also suggested that they needed to find ways to build firewalls in the system, with Mr. Brown saying that under current, lax global regulatory coordination, ''A bad bank anywhere can affect good banks everywhere.'' 
 The meeting between the men was understated. While President George W. Bush often entertained Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Brown's predecessor, at Camp David, on Tuesday there was simply a private meeting in the Oval Office and a lunch at the White House. Thyme-roasted chicken and nine-herb ravioli were served in the old Family Dining Room.
 Mr. Obama tried to alleviate concerns in Britain that he was less interested in the trans-Atlantic relationship than his predecessors were, speaking of ''a bond there that will not break.'' 
 He suggested that the countries were being driven closer together by their shared commitment of troops in Afghanistan.
 ''This notion that somehow there is any lessening of that special relationship is misguided,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking to reporters in the Oval Office. ''Rest assured that the relationship is not only special and strong, but will only get stronger as time goes on.''
 During their meeting, Mr. Obama and Mr. Brown were trying to set the groundwork for a gathering next month of leaders of the Group of 20, the nations with the 20 largest economies. 
 The idea of global financial cooperation is one that both leaders find appealing, but once the specifics begin to be put on the table, many constituencies are likely to balk at rules set by foreigners.
 ''It will be easy to get the G-20 into a room to ratify the idea that the world is in trouble, and that they need to cooperate,'' said David Rothkopf, who worked in the Commerce Department under President Bill Clinton.
 ''Getting them to actually sign on to a new international architecture and to get out their checkbook to give billions more to the World Bank and the I.M.F. and to set up common regulatory systems will be very difficult. Yet if they stick to platitudes, the markets will give them a failing grade.''
 Mr. Obama cited one of the most pressing of the regulatory issues, making sure ''that problems that exist in emerging markets like Hungary or the Ukraine don't have these enormous ripple effects that wash back onto our shores.'' In Europe and Asia, though, the problem is seen in reverse: A crisis that began on American shores is now washing away smaller economies.
 ''There is the possibility in the next few months of a global New Deal that will involve all the countries of the world in sorting out and cleaning up the banking system,'' Mr. Brown said. 
 The meeting on Tuesday was the third time the two men had met, but it was the first since Mr. Obama took office. Aides said the men spoke mostly about the economy, but also discussed Afghanistan and the Middle East peace process.

HEADLINE: Who's Running Immigration?

 BODY:
Immigration enforcement ran off the rails in the Bush era, when federal agents stormed factories to shackle workers and local authorities staged their own crackdowns with little or no oversight from Washington. It was a war without a plan, and it solved nothing. 
 President Obama has repeatedly promised to take a smarter path. But if he and the homeland security secretary, Janet Napolitano, are making a clean break with the Bush way on immigration, we haven't seen it yet. That shambling machinery lurches on.
 Two recent examples tell the story. 
 The first was a large, peaceful protest in Phoenix on Saturday. Thousands stood up to the feared sheriff of Maricopa County, Joe Arpaio, who has brutally misused his powers under a program called 287(g). It enlists local police as immigration enforcers. He has terrorized Latino neighborhoods with relentless sweeps and has paraded shackled immigrants through the streets. 
 When she was the Arizona governor, Ms. Napolitano was an outspoken supporter of delegating neglected federal immigration duties to local authorities. Sheriff Arpaio is an example of that concept run amok. He has seldom been challenged as forcefully as he was on Saturday -- not by government but by a dogged organizer, Salvador Reza, a few clergy members and politicians and thousands of people who dared to say: Enough. 
 The other example was the first workplace immigration raid of the Obama administration, late last month in Bellingham, Wash. More than two dozen people were arrested at a family-run company that rebuilds car engines. They were charged with the usual paperwork offenses. The company said it was blindsided, and so was Ms. Napolitano. She said she had not known about the raid in advance and promised an investigation.
 Americans who might applaud any crackdown on illegal immigrants, particularly in a recession, should know that scattershot raids and rampaging sheriffs are not the answer. The idea that enforcement alone will eliminate the underground economy is a great delusion. It runs up against the impossible arithmetic of mass expulsion -- no conceivable regime of raids will wrench 12 million illegal immigrants from their jobs and homes. 
 The country is not a safer or better place because one more business and two dozen more families are torn apart outside Seattle or because Sheriff Arpaio has much of Maricopa County terrified. The system under which illegal immigrants labor, without hope of assimilation, is not any less broken. A new report from the Government Accountability Office shows that federal oversight of the 287(g) program has been sorely lacking.
 So, a question: Are Mr. Obama and Ms. Napolitano in charge or not? Let them show it by ending the raids and Sheriff Arpaio's abuses. Something has to be done about immigration, but it has to be smarter than this.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Says Insurance Giant Acted Irresponsibly

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT and BRIAN KNOWLTON; Jeff Zeleny and Jackie Calmes contributed reporting

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the country faces ''a prolonged episode of economic stagnation'' if they do not address the economic crisis forcefully, but he quickly encountered deep anger, particularly over the dealings of the ailing American International Group.
 Mr. Bernanke told the Senate Budget Committee that the worst outlook, should action on the crisis prove inadequate, would be ''further deterioration in the fiscal situation'' and probably ''lower output, employment and incomes for an extended period.''
 But the chairman was met at once with sharp questions from the senators, some of whom said they were passing on the resentment they have been hearing from constituents, not necessarily about President Obama's proposed $3.55 trillion budget for the next fiscal year but about the rescue plan for the financial system and the stimulus package. 
 ''Mr. Chairman,'' Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, asked at the outset, ''at what point will the taxpayer no longer be on the hook for the massive A.I.G. failure? What is the end game for American taxpayers?''
 Mr. Bernanke replied that nothing had made him more angry during the months of the sprawling financial crisis than the episode involving the insurance giant that has reported astronomical losses and has been given financial lifelines worth billions of dollars.
 ''A.I.G. exploited a huge gap in the regulatory system,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''There was no oversight of the financial products division. This was a hedge fund, basically, that was attached to a large and stable insurance company.'' And this quasi-hedge fund, Mr. Bernanke went on, to nobody's surprise, made irresponsible bets and took huge losses.
 ''We had no choice but to try to stabilize the system because of the implications that the failure would have had for the broad economic system,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke's testimony came as Congress began the long process of considering President Obama's spending plan, which envisions a deficit of $1.8 trillion this year and trillion-dollar deficits only slowly coming under control.
 While the Fed would normally look askance at numbers like that, the testimony on Tuesday seemed intended to give a green light, as part of a no-holds-barred recovery program.
 A.I.G., however, quickly took center stage. While not necessarily disagreeing with Mr. Bernanke on A.I.G., several senators seemed almost to be seething when they talked about A.I.G., as well as other big institutions that have been helped by the government. 
 Mr. Wyden, who acted as chairman in the absence of Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, cited what he said was a recent observation by the billionaire investor Warren E. Buffett: ''It is much better to be a financial cripple with a government guarantee than a Gibraltar without one.''
 Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, pressed Mr. Bernanke on whether A.I.G.'s fate is really linked to the welfare of ''just average everyday families.''
 Definitely, Mr. Bernanke said, talking about the ''potential for contagion.''
 ''In this case, we're dealing with the largest insurance company in the world,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Its failure would have sent shockwaves through the entire insurance industry'' and likely beyond. 
 Some senators said it did not seem right that A.I.G., whose recklessness was on a grand scale, was apparently deemed too big to fail -- unlike the owners of many small businesses whose troubles apparently do not resonate in Washington.
 Mr. Bernanke agreed that it is high time that stricter regulations be put in place to prevent future A.I.G.-type debacles. But for now, he said, helping the company is the best option.
 ''Because the downside of it failing is so enormous,'' Senator Lindsey O. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said. ''Is that correct?''
 ''Yes, senator,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Unfortunately, that's the case.''
 Senator Jim Bunning, Republican of Kentucky, was not soothed when Mr. Bernanke said that stabilizing A.I.G. would, ideally, make the company profitable enough to repay the money it has borrowed from the government. ''The bottom line is that the Fed and the Treasury will leave the door open for more bailouts in the future,'' the senator said.
 At the same time, the Fed officially kicked off a program to make consumer loans more easily available. That infusion of $200 billion, to support lending of up to $1 trillion, was announced in January, was supposed to begin in February, and is occurring this month.
 ''Our economy and financial markets face extraordinary challenges,'' Mr. Bernanke told the committee, ''and a failure by policymakers to address these challenges in a timely way would likely be more costly in the end.''
 At a time when badly shaken public confidence has slowed consumer spending and walloped the stock markets, Mr. Bernanke offered little in the way of near-term hope. Rather, he said that barring determined Congressional action -- and a degree of luck -- things might easily get worse.
 ''The recent near-term indicators show little sign of improvement,'' he said, pointing to the loss of 600,000 jobs in January, a sharp drop in manufacturing output and a steep decline in exports.
 The $787 billion economic stimulus package recently signed into law should increase demand and production over the next two years, Mr. Bernanke said, before adding that ''the timing and the magnitude of the macroeconomic effects of the fiscal program are subject to considerable uncertainty.''
 Even as the stimulus plan seeks to lay the groundwork for self-sustaining recovery, he said, this would depend heavily on a return to financial stability. And on that front, he said, ''more needs to be done.''
 But the billions spent on financial stabilization, the increased spending and reduced taxes from the stimulus package, and the broader effects of the weak economy would ''widen the federal budget deficit substantially this year,'' Mr. Bernanke said.
 The president's budget director, Peter R. Orszag, told the House Budget Committee on Tuesday that Mr. Obama's proposal ''is simply not a big-spending budget.'' Democrats gave Mr. Orszag a supportive reception, but Republicans' questions indicated the administration would get little, if any, support in their party -- just as House Republicans voted unanimously against the president's $787 billion economic recovery plan. 
 Meanwhile, President Obama announced a long-awaited Federal Reserve program intended to increase the availability of credit to small businesses and consumers. The initiative will generate up to $1 trillion in lending, which the president said would ''jumpstart the credit markets and get private lending going again.''
 Funds from the program, formally the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, will be disbursed beginning on March 25. 
 The TALF, meant to restore lending to auto buyers and businesses, will accept as collateral securities backed by ''rental, commercial, and government vehicle fleet leases, and ABS backed by small-ticket equipment, heavy equipment, and agricultural equipment loans and leases,'' the Fed said Tuesday.
 The program calls for the Federal Reserve to lend against securities that are secured by different types of debt, from credit cards to automobile and student loans. It is set to run through December, but officials said it could be extended.
 The White House has scheduled several events this week to highlight the administration's economic plans, with the president still forcefully arguing the merits of the economic stimulus plan that he signed into law last month. It is an effort, aides said, to keep the message fixed on economic recovery, rather than placing the entire focus on the costly domestic agenda that he has proposed.

HEADLINE: Obama's Budget as Rorschach Test

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 I was saddened by David Brooks's March 3 column, ''A Moderate Manifesto,'' in which he laments the ''class divide'' of President Obama's budget. I wonder where his outrage was while chief executives' salaries grew to 400 times the average worker's salary. 
 My friends saw their wages stagnate or reduced because of raises in health care premiums, all the while being told how great the economy was for the last eight years. We always wondered, ''Great for whom?'' 
 Now we finally have a president who gets it. The number of uninsured Americans is staggering (47 million), and health care bills remain our leading cause of private bankruptcies, yet we remain the only wealthy industrialized country without universal health care.
 The president's budget represents the path to get us out of our current recession, caused by the greed of the few who cared more for their personal wealth than for the health of our nation. I applaud his efforts.
 Karl Palazzolo St. Louis, March 3, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks imagines that ''the U.S. has never been a society riven by class resentment'' and that the Obama administration is playing up ''a class divide.'' 
 For the last three decades, class war has been waged on all fronts. Deindustrialization and de-unionization have devastated entire communities. Benefits like pensions and health care have been cut back or abolished. Wages and income for the average worker have stagnated or declined as tax policies skewed to the rich and unchecked financial speculation have led to a reconcentration of wealth unseen since the 1920s. 
 Perhaps, then, it's not so much the war that Mr. Brooks laments as it is that the tide seems to be changing, and now the heavy artillery is pointing in the opposite direction.
 Peter Quinn Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. March 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks's call to moderates is the voice that needs to be heard more than Rush Limbaugh's, Michael Steele's and Bobby Jindal's from the other side of the aisle. 
 As a supporter of then-candidate and now President Obama, I'm inclined left but practical and pragmatic and idealistic enough to believe the words and promises of bipartisanship to put my faith in it versus one-sided thinking. 
 No major shifts in American econopolitics will serve us well. I support Mr. Brooks's call for the president not just to listen but to understand that the future of his administration, legacy and of the country cannot be built on the backs of the few, no matter how rich, nor can it be artificially supported on the backs of the many, no matter how poor.
 Irv Rubenstein Nashville, March 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 In a time of lesser crisis, David Brooks's appeal for moderation might not only be appropriate but also advisable. But the last 30 years of federal deregulation, social and urban disinvestment, and economic polarization leaves our society in such a state of disrepair that to settle for a ''moderate'' policy response would be only to kick the ball further down the road. 
 Indeed, President Obama is advocating nothing short of a radical restructuring of civic life and priorities. But the intricately interdependent nature of our economic, health care, education and social welfare systems is such that nothing short of radical change has any hope of succeeding. 
 As evidenced by recent comments by its unelected spokesmen, the Republican Party is intellectually and morally bankrupt and in no position to offer a competing narrative. Although the road to recovery will probably leave no ox ungored, it is essential that we support President Obama as he undertakes the herculean -- not Sisyphean -- task before him.
 Kent L. Hurst Fort Worth, March 3, 2009
 To the Editor:
 I disagree with David Brooks that President Obama's budget unveils him as an irresponsible liberal. Many of the most progressive initiatives outlined in the budget are included as a specific response to our current circumstances, a concept I would think a pragmatist like Mr. Brooks would admire. 
 The budget treats the rich differently because, in fact, they have become alarmingly different from the rest of us. Government must spend billions on clean transportation and energy because of the scientific urgency of climate change and because the private sector will not act decisively on such a global problem. 
 Universal health care, which has been on the national agenda for more than 60 years, is today even more urgent as people lose their jobs and costs continue to soar. 
 In our current situation, a more tempered budget would have been irresponsible and ineffective, not moderate.
 Adam Ruder Glenville, N.Y., March 3, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 It is not history that has called upon the Democratic administration, party and president ''to solve all problems at once,'' as David Brooks laments.
 It was the history of the Bush administration, the Republican Party and a Republican president who presented all problems to be solved at once on Jan. 20.
 That is what I call the ''ideological outrage.''
 Connie Allenbury Cambridge, Mass., March 3, 2009
 To the Editor: 
 David Brooks writes of ''a nation in which we're all in it together -- in which burdens are shared broadly, rather than simply inflicted upon a small minority.'' 
 It's time we recognize that the biggest burden we've placed upon the smallest minority has been the defense of our country. It's time we brought back the draft to ensure that this most urgent burden is shared most democratically -- by women as well as men. 
 And defense of our country does not have to mean only service in the military. There's a great need in our national parks, hospitals and schools for young people to serve their country and learn a lot at the same time. It's about sharing burdens more broadly. And it's about time.
 Peter H. Reader Portland, Ore., March 3, 2009

HEADLINE: To Keep in Touch, Obama Picks Up the Phone

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Obama may like his Blackberry, but he loves the telephone.
 Whether he has a few spare minutes in the Oval Office, sitting aboard Air Force One or waiting in the wings before delivering a speech, he often picks up the phone and makes a call or two. On some days, aides say, Mr. Obama makes at least two dozen calls in an attempt to stay connected to -- and glean information from -- the outside world.
 The telephone habits of the president came to light late last week when Mr. Obama unexpectedly called George W. Bush to inform him of the administration's plan to remove most combat troops from Iraq over the next 19 months. That call, like many of those made to others in recent weeks by the new president, took the recipient by surprise. 
 The calls have not only been going out to members of Congress, governors and other dignitaries, but also to an array of experts who Mr. Obama has long been turning to for counsel and guidance.
 ''The president is reading and receiving a lot of information, but he still likes to pick up the phone and talk to people,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary, who is often in the room when Mr. Obama is making calls. ''Asking questions or getting ideas, you get instant feedback. And most of all, you can stay connected.''
 On Saturday evening, for example, Mr. Gibbs said he was sitting in the Oval Office when the president placed a call to Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas to inform her that she had been selected as his latest nominee to serve as Health and Human Services secretary. Those types of courtesy calls are made by all presidents, but they do not offer a full window into how attached Mr. Obama is to the telephone.
 To fully understand Mr. Obama's penchant for making calls, it is important to turn back the page to the days when he was dialing the numbers by himself, long before the White House switchboard could connect him to anyone in the world.
 At the end of his first year in Washington, Mr. Obama was asked to explain the best aspect of being a senator. His answer from an interview on Dec. 16, 2005, offers a glimpse into his attachment to the telephone, which aides said has not gone away.
 ''Everybody takes your phone calls,'' Mr. Obama told me. ''If there is a topic I'm interested in, I can call the smartest people in the world on that topic and talk to them about it. Sometimes they'll come into my office and that is just a huge luxury.
 ''If I'm interested in finance, I can call Warren Buffett. If I'm interested in health care, I can call the top administrators or health-care experts in the country. If I'm interested in foreign policy, I can not only call experts here, but I can call experts overseas,'' Mr. Obama added. ''That's fun.''
 The White House archives show that President Woodrow Wilson made the first transcontinental call from the Oval Office on January 25, 1915. Mr. Obama's first came barely an hour after stepping into the office for the first time on the morning of Jan. 21, as he reached out to four Middle Eastern leaders to talk about the peace process.
 Since then, according to an official record, Mr. Obama has called the presidents of China, Lebanon, Colombia and South Africa. He has talked to the prime ministers of Japan, Australia, Canada and Iraq, and the king of Saudi Arabia.
 The calls to foreign leaders, which are primarily made from a highly secure telephone at his desk in the Oval Office, are standard fare for all presidents. But it is the calls to a wide variety of others -- aides say his call list is confidential, just as his calls are secure -- that make this president's phone work more unusual. 
 ''He's always looking for ways to connect outside the bubble,'' said David Axelrod, a senior adviser to the president, who still excuses himself from the dinner table when he receives a call from Mr. Obama on some nights around 11 p.m., just as he did throughout the course of his two-year presidential campaign
 During the legislative debate over the economic recovery package, several senators and representatives reported receiving multiple calls from the president, more than they remember getting from Mr. Bush. Shortly after Air Force One returned to Washington from a visit to Indiana, the president dialed Senator Richard G. Lugar, the state's senior Republican, who was among Mr. Obama's friends in the Senate.
 ''The president called twice,'' said Mr. Lugar, who told Mr. Obama on the second call that he intended to vote against the stimulus bill. Rather than jumping off the phone, Mr. Lugar recalled that the two talked for a while longer. ''He said he hoped that it would not set the tone for future relations. I told him I look forward to happier times.''
 While his political advisers, legal team and security detail tried to dissuade him from keeping his Blackberry after he was elected -- a fight that Mr. Obama ultimately won -- there has been far less debate about weaning him from his telephone.
 That, aides concede, is not negotiable for the country's first president who rose to power in a culture of unlimited cell phone calling plans.
 Now, Mr. Obama is surrounded by telephones. There is a large, gray Raytheon phone -- programmed with speed dial buttons to most of his top aides (from ''Senior Advisor Axelrod'' to the ''CIA Director'') -- in nearly each room of the White House. He also has one in his office aboard Air Force One. And, Mr. Gibbs said, the president was particularly impressed by the many phones inside the presidential limousine.
 ''He thinks the coolest thing about this,'' Mr. Gibbs said, ''is that you can pick up the phone and say, 'I need to reach so and so,' and a minute later, the phone rings and they are on the line.''

HEADLINE: Paterson Does Poorly In Survey

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
Gov. David A. Paterson is making history these days, but not in a positive way. 
 On Tuesday, the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion released a poll that pegged Mr. Paterson's job approval rating at the lowest point in the 27 years that Marist has been surveying public opinion of New York governors. 
 Only 26 percent of the 1,045 registered voters surveyed said Mr. Paterson was doing either a good or excellent job, while 71 percent said he was doing a fair or poor job. 
 Even Eliot Spitzer had a higher approval rating, 30 percent, in his last days as governor after being implicated in a prostitution scandal almost a year ago. The poll, conducted in late February, indicates that voters believe Mr. Paterson is working hard and understands the state's problems, but suggests that people do not have confidence in his ability to lead.
 Mr. Paterson and his aides declined to comment on the survey Tuesday.
 After a series of missteps, including his botched handling of the selection of a senator to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton, the governor has acknowledged his political troubles. 
 ''If it wasn't for A-Rod and Bernie Madoff, they'd of just about run me out of this state right now,'' he joked in an interview on WFAN-AM in New York this weekend. Last week, he overhauled his staff, and he has said he is determined to right his administration. 
 The Marist poll follows a similar showing for Mr. Paterson in a Quinnipiac University poll; both showed that he would be trounced by Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo in a hypothetical primary matchup. Mr. Cuomo has said he likes the job he has, but has also not ruled out a run for governor. 
 Mr. Paterson has been beset by an array of difficulties. In Albany, Democrats have been unnerved by his tendency to contradict himself and back away from policy positions while the state is on a fiscal precipice. He also frayed his relationship with some senior Democrats after his administration leaked misleading information about Caroline Kennedy after she withdrew her candidacy for the Senate. 
 ''You're dealing with a bad economy, low scores on his handling of the budget, a messy Senate pick, a lot of TV ads about cutbacks and a drop in his leadership numbers,'' said Lee M. Miringoff, director of the Marist institute. ''There's a lot of erosion at the core, not just at the edges.'' 
 Roughly two-thirds of those surveyed feel the state is not headed in the right direction, but Mr. Miringoff said some politicians had managed to distinguish themselves amid the gloom. 
 ''It isn't that voters are in a grumpy mood,'' he said, adding that Senator Charles E. Schumer and Mr. Cuomo were doing well in approval ratings. ''So sometimes everyone takes a hit, and that's not what we're seeing here.''
 Among Democrats, Mr. Cuomo would beat the governor in a hypothetical primary matchup, 62 to 26 percent. In a general election, Rudolph W. Giuliani would beat Mr. Paterson, 53 to 38 percent, the poll found. There is evidence that Mr. Paterson could beat a lesser-known candidate like former Representative Rick A. Lazio, a Long Island Republican; according to Marist, Mr. Paterson would win, 47 to 35 percent.
 The Marist poll also suggests that Kirsten E. Gillibrand, whom the governor tapped to replace Mrs. Clinton, has yet to win over voters. Ms. Gillibrand, a former congresswoman from upstate New York, was rated as fair or poor by 32 percent of voters and good or excellent by 18 percent, with half still unsure of her performance. 
 The Marist poll was conducted by telephone last Wednesday and Thursday; it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
 One of the governor's biggest problems has been turmoil within his staff. Mr. Paterson, a former longtime state senator, had limited executive experience before taking over as governor after Mr. Spitzer resigned, and has struggled to assemble a staff. 
 In late October, he lost his top aide, Charles J. O'Byrne, amid a tax scandal; Mr. O'Byrne has since returned as an outside political adviser. In recent weeks, the governor's communications director, his main political consulting firm, his top security aide and his top communications strategist have all departed. Last week, the governor said that William J. Cunningham III, who had replaced Mr. O'Byrne, would himself be replaced after a little more than three months on the job. Larry S. Schwartz, a deputy executive of Westchester County, has replaced him. 
 ''He's got staff problems that are monumental,'' said Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, who said there was still time for the governor to turn himself around by the 2010 election -- not that it will be easy. 
 His first task will be successfully navigating the budget negotiations amid perilous fiscal circumstances. An array of powerful Albany interest groups, particularly labor unions, are spending millions of dollars on commercials criticizing his proposed cuts. 
 ''He's got himself in this mess, and he can get himself out of it,'' Mr. Carroll said. ''It's up to him.''

PERSON: Horton, Foote 

HEADLINE: Horton Foote, Chronicler of America in Plays and Film, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
Horton Foote, who chronicled a wistful American odyssey through the 20th century in plays and films mostly set in a small town in Texas and who left a literary legacy as one of the country's foremost storytellers, died on Wednesday in Hartford. He was 92 and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Wharton, Tex.
Mr. Foote died after a brief illness, his daughter Hallie Foote said. He had recently been living in Hartford while adapting his nine-play ''Orphans' Home Cycle'' into a three-part production that will be staged next fall at the Hartford Stage Company and the Signature Theater in New York.
In a body of work for which he won the Pulitzer Prize and two Academy Awards, Mr. Foote was known as a writer's writer, an author who never abandoned his vision even when Broadway and Hollywood temporarily turned their backs on him. 
In screenplays for movies like ''Tender Mercies,'' ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' and ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' and in plays like ''The Young Man From Atlanta'' and ''The Carpetbagger's Children,'' Mr. Foote depicted the way ordinary people shoulder the ordinary burdens of life, finding drama in the resilience by which they carry on in the face of change, economic hardship, disappointment, loss and death.
Robert Duvall, an actor who was one of Mr. Foote's most frequent interpreters, making his screen debut in ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' (1962) and winning an Oscar for best actor in ''Tender Mercies'' (1983), said on Wednesday that ''Horton was the great American voice.'' He added, ''His work was native to his own region, but it was also universal.''
Frank Rich, who as chief theater critic of The New York Times in the 1980s was one of Mr. Foote's champions, once called him ''one of America's living literary wonders.'' On Wednesday Mr. Rich described Mr. Foote as ''a major American dramatist whose epic body of work recalls Chekhov in its quotidian comedy and heartbreak, and Faulkner in its ability to make his own corner of America stand for the whole.''
In 1986, in an interview with The New York Times Magazine, Mr. Foote expounded on the themes that run through his work, saying, ''I believe very deeply in the human spirit and I have a sense of awe about it because I don't know how people carry on.'' He added: ''I've known people that the world has thrown everything at to discourage them, to kill them, to break their spirit. And yet something about them retains a dignity. They face life and they don't ask quarters.''
Mr. Foote spent most of his life writing about such people. In more than 60 plays and films, most set in the fictive town of Harrison, Tex., he charted their struggle through the century by recording their familial conflicts.
He often seemed to resemble a character from one of his plays. Always courteous and courtly, he spoke with a Texas drawl. He enjoyed good food and wine, but he usually opted for barbecue and iced tea or fried chicken with a Coca-Cola when he was home in Texas. He was jovial with a wry humor, and his white hair and robust frame gave him the appearance of a Southern senator or the favorite uncle who always had a story. Harper Lee, a lifelong friend since Mr. Foote adapted her novel ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' once said that Mr. Foote ''looked like God, only cleanshaven.''
Albert Horton Foote Jr., one of three sons of Albert Horton Foote and the former Hallie Brooks, was born March 14, 1916, in Wharton, Tex., a town about 40 miles southwest of Houston. His father was a haberdasher and his mother taught piano.
Although he boarded a train for Dallas at 16 to pursue acting, Mr. Foote never really left home. From his first efforts as a playwright, he returned again and again to set his plays and films amid the pecan groves and Victorian houses with large front porches on the tree-lined streets of Wharton. His inspiration came from the people he knew and the stories he heard growing up there.
Mr. Foote spent two years studying acting at the Pasadena Playhouse in California, then went to New York to become a Broadway star. He continued his studies there with Tamara Daykarhanova, a Russian emigre, and joined Mary Hunter's American Actors Company. While rehearsing a production of one-acts, Ms. Hunter had her cast perform improvisations based on life in the actors' hometowns. After Mr. Foote performed his, Agnes De Mille, who was doing choreography for another show, asked Mr. Foote if he had ever considered writing.
''No,'' he replied. ''What on earth would I write about?''
Ms. DeMille, who became a lifelong friend, gave Mr. Foote the age-old advice to every beginning playwright. ''Write what you know about,'' she said.
Mr. Foote went home that night and wrote a one-act called ''Wharton Dance,'' about the Friday-night dances in his hometown. He wrote the lead part for himself. The company performed the play in an evening of one-acts.
Mr. Foote continued to pursue acting and appeared in a few other plays. Then, during a trip home, he decided to write another play. This time he spread a large canvas, writing a three-act, multilayered drama set in a small-town drugstore. He called it ''Texas Town,'' and the American Actors Company staged it in 1941, with Mr. Foote in the lead.
To Mr. Foote's and the company's surprise, Brooks Atkinson, the critic for The Times, came to see it. Atkinson called it an ''engrossing portrait of small-town life.'' He praised it for being ''simply written'' and for giving ''a real and languid impression of a town changing in its relation to the world.'' He added, ''Mr. Foote's play is ''an able evocation of a part of life in America.''
To support himself, Mr. Foote took various jobs, including night elevator operator and bookstore clerk. While working in the bookstore a Vassar student came in looking for a summer job. Her name was Lillian Vallish. Mr. Foote asked her on a date, and the two were married the next year, on June 4, 1945. They had four children and remained together until Ms. Foote's death in 1992.
Besides his daughter Hallie, an actress who became a main interpreter of her father's plays, Mr. Foote is survived by his three other children -- Horton Jr., who also acted and directed and is a restaurant owner in New York; Walter, a lawyer; and Daisy, also a playwright -- and two grandchildren.
After World War II, Mr. Foote and Lillian moved to Washington to run the King Smith School along with Vincent Donehue. (Mr. Foote had been barred from serving in the military during the war because of a hernia.) The new theater fashion in those years was to blend words, music and dance into one theatrical experience, and Mr. Foote tried to write in the new form. One achievement during the Washington years was that Mr. Foote opened the King Smith theater to all races, the first integrated audiences in the nation's capital.
Mr. Foote returned to New York in 1950, just as television was beginning to command America's attention and producers like Fred Coe were recruiting writers to work for it. Mr. Donehue was hired by Mr. Coe to produce a weekly TV show for children that starred Gabby Hayes, the cowboy movie star and Roy Rogers sidekick.
Mr. Foote went to work for Mr. Coe at NBC, and his first assignment was to help write weekly half-hour episodes of ''The Gabby Hayes Show.'' In his spare time he continued to write plays.
Mr. Coe shortly signed Mr. Foote to a contract to write nine one-hour dramas for television. Mr. Coe liked to have one-page plot synopses from his writers, but for his third TV drama, Mr. Foote recalled, he didn't know how to put it on paper. So, by his account, he just told Mr. Coe the plot.
''It's about an old lady who wants to go home,'' Mr. Foote said.
''That's it?'' Mr. Coe asked
''That's it,'' Mr. Foote replied.
''Go ahead,'' Mr. Coe said. ''I trust you.''
''The Trip to Bountiful'' starred Lillian Gish as the gentle and long-suffering widow Carrie Watts. The play would have several incarnations over Mr. Foote's life, including a version on Broadway, a revival Off Broadway, a London production and, three decades later, a 1985 movie for which Geraldine Page would receive an Academy Award for best actress and Mr. Foote was nominated for the screenplay.
Mr. Foote went on to write 10 plays for television, mostly for Television Playhouse and mostly directed by Mr. Donehue. When Mr. Coe moved from NBC to CBS, Mr. Foote wrote several teleplays for ''Playhouse 90,'' including adaptations of the Faulkner stories ''Old Man'' and ''Tomorrow.'' Faulkner was so impressed with the latter that he offered to split the publication royalties with him.
Television had moved to the West Coast by this time, and Mr. Foote's work in TV there led to his first film projects. One of them was to adapt a screenplay of Ms. Lee's ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' about a white Southern lawyer defending a black man on rape charges. For his screenplay Mr. Foote received his first Academy Award. Gregory Peck won best actor for his performance as the lawyer, Atticus Finch, and the film introduced to the screen a young actor named Robert Duvall as the eccentric Boo Radley.
Mr. Foote had another film success with ''Baby, the Rain Must Fall'' (1965), a reworking of his play ''The Traveling Lady.'' The film starred Steve McQueen.
But Mr. Foote's Hollywood honeymoon began to sour. His next Hollywood venture was to adapt his play ''The Chase'' into a screenplay. But studio executives were unhappy with the script, and the producer Sam Spiegel hired Lillian Hellman to rewrite it. When the final film version was released, almost none of Mr. Foote's original material remained. Mr. Foote was then hired by Otto Preminger to work on a screenplay for ''Hurry Sundown'' (1967), but the producer never used a word of his dialogue, although Mr. Foote appeared in the credits as a co-writer.
The experiences so depressed Mr. Foote that he moved to New Hampshire to live on a farm, and even contemplated giving up writing. It was after the death of his parents that Mr. Foote began the nine-play cycle called ''The Orphans' Home,'' inspired by his father's family and spanning 1902 to 1928. The first of these plays were staged in New York by Herbert Berghof, who with his wife, Uta Hagen, ran the H-B Theater workshop. It marked the start of the Foote revival.
If Brooks Atkinson helped launch Mr. Foote's first career as a writer, it was Mr. Rich, of The Times, who helped start his revival with enthusiastic reviews of the cycle's plays. Producers started paying attention to Mr. Foote's work again, and a new generation of audiences was introduced to his work.
One of those who applauded Mr. Foote's return was the director and producer Alan J. Pakula, who had hired him to write the screenplay for ''Mockingbird.'' ''In a seemingly undramatic way,'' Mr. Pakula said, Mr. Foote ''has a specific voice, a specific style, and he has never abandoned it, even though it has cost him.''
While Mr. Foote worked on ''The Orphans' Home'' cycle, his agent, Lucy Kroll, suggested he write an original screenplay. He began working on a story about a group of young singers trying to break into country and western music. When his daughter Hallie reminded him that Mr. Duvall could sing, Mr. Foote started molding a character for him.
The movie, ''Tender Mercies,'' was written specifically with Mr. Duvall in mind for the role of Mac Sledge, a washed-up, alcoholic singer who finds redemption in the love of a young Vietnam War widow and her small son. The film was shot in Waxahachie, Tex., for only $4.5 million, and at first no studio wanted to distribute it. But, Mr. Duvall went on to win the best-actor Academy Award and Mr. Foote received his second Oscar for the screenplay.
With his new success, Mr. Foote again turned toward writing movies, but this time he pursued an independent route. With his wife, Lillian, as producer and the rest of his family acting or working behind the scenes, he made movies of two plays in the ''The Orphans' Home'' cycle, ''1918'' and ''On Valentine's Day.'' Both were shot in Waxahachie, cost under $2 million each and starred Hallie Foote.
The second act of Mr. Foote's career was given an extended run by the Signature Theater, an Off Off Broadway company that devoted its 1994-95 season to his work. One of the Foote plays that season had been written some years earlier, but had never been performed. It was ''The Young Man From Atlanta'' and was about a couple nearing retirement in Houston in the 1950s and trying to come to terms with their grown son's suicide and suspected homosexuality. It won the Pulitzer Prize in 1995.
As the 21st-century dawned, Mr. Foote wrote ''The Carpetbagger's Children,'' a play in which three grown daughters of a carpetbagger look back over their lives and the 20th century in alternating monologues. It was staged at Lincoln Center and drew sold-out audiences in an extended run. Another revival of ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' with Lois Smith, was a hit for Signature Theater, and Mr. Foote scored a Broadway success with the revival of ''Dividing the Estate,'' under Michael Wilson's direction.
Mr. Wilson, director of the Hartford Stage, and James Houghton of the Signature, put together the production of ''The Orphans' Home Cycle'' that will be staged in the fall and was Mr. Foote's lifelong dream.
Mr. Foote had all but completed work on adapting those plays at his death. Only a week ago, he had seen a preview performance of the stage version of ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' at the Hartford Stage Company and had been anticipating the staging of ''Dividing the Estate'' there in April.
''I don't think I'll ever stop writing,'' he said in a 1999 interview. ''I write almost every day. I'd write plays even if they were never done again. You're at the mercy of whatever talent you have.''
Correction: March 19, 2009, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An obituary on March 5 about the playwright Horton Foote misstated the Broadway performance history of the actress Kim Stanley. She appeared in ''The House of Bernarda Alba,'' by Federico Garcia Lorca, at the ANTA Theater in 1951. The 1952 production of Mr. Foote's play ''The Chase,'' at the Playhouse Theater, did not introduce her to Broadway.

HEADLINE: Speculation About China Lifts Shares

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Financial markets around the world snapped back after a week of relentless losses as investors speculated that China would increase its stimulus spending beyond the $585 billion plan it had already proposed. 
Companies as diverse as financial institutions, retailers and utilities pared their losses from previous sessions. Energy shares also climbed as crude oil rose $3.73, to $45.38 a barrel, and mining corporations rallied.
But shares of General Electric briefly fell below $6 a share Wednesday as the company tried to deflect speculation that it would need more equity. G.E. said that it had no such plans. Shares closed down about 4.56 percent, to $6.69, after falling 7.8 percent on Tuesday.
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was 149.82 points or 2.2 percent higher, to 6,875.84, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.3 percent, or 16.54 points, closing at 712.87. The Nasdaq rose 2.5 percent, or 32.73 points, to 1,353.74.
The day's gains came as bargain hunters descended onto the markets, paring two days of losses that dragged two major stock indexes to their lowest levels since 1997.
On Monday, the Dow fell below 7,000. A day later, the S.& P. 500 fell 0.6 percent to dip below 700.
''It's oversold to the extreme,'' said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company. ''We're down hard now, three months in a row, and pessimism has gotten very pervasive. I think it's excessive.''
In Europe, the FTSE 100 index in London increased 3.8 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris was up 4.7 percent and the DAX in Frankfurt 5.4 percent.
Most Asian markets were higher on Wednesday, breaking a three-day losing streak. The Tokyo benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average rose 0.9 percent, while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong rose 2.5 percent.
Prices of commodities like oil, copper and zinc rose, as did shares of producers of basic materials like steel. Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold jumped more than 12 percent on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
Investors seemed to shrug off some reports showing continuing troubles in the American economy.
The Federal Reserve, in its monthly survey known as the beige book, said that economic conditions worsened in January and February and that businesses did not expect improvement until late this year or early 2010. ''The deterioration was broad-based,'' the Fed said.
A report by ADP Employer Services said that private sector job losses increased in February. Index futures fell slightly after the report, but eventually came back. Investors were bracing for another bleak monthly unemployment report to be released on Friday. The national unemployment rate has climbed to 7.6 percent since the recession began in December 2007, and some economists say they believe the rate reached 7.9 percent for February.
Prices of most government bonds slipped. The Treasury's 10-year note fell 27/32, to 98 2/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, rose to 2.97 percent, from 2.88 late Tuesday.
Following are the results of Wednesday's Treasury auction of 63-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Federal Reserve Beige Book Paints a Broadly Pessimistic Picture

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
From Boston to Atlanta to San Francisco, the economy has gotten worse in the last two months, and in a snapshot of economic conditions released Wednesday, business executives were pessimistic about the chances for a near-term recovery.
''The deterioration was broad based,'' with only a few exceptions, the Federal Reserve said in its beige book, a regular sketch of economic conditions in 12 Fed districts nationwide. Many do not expect a recovery until late 2009 or early next year.
The report said that ''with rising layoffs and hiring freezes, unemployment has risen in all areas,'' a point underscored by a new index that showed private sector job loss increased in February. 
ADP Employer Services said that employers cut 697,000 jobs in February compared with a revised 614,000 jobs lost in January.
The government releases its unemployment report for February on Friday.
In the beige book, the Fed said that manufacturing fell, companies earned less and credit remained tight. Fewer tourists visited popular destinations, airline traffic fell and the demand for commercial real estate ''weakened significantly.''
There were a few, faint silver linings: Philadelphia and Chicago reported that their regional economies ''remained weak'' but did not get weaker. Consumer spending picked up slightly after a dismal holiday shopping season, and prices eased because of weakened demand. Some information technology companies reported a rise in business as other companies looked to cut costs through the use of technology.
Residential real estate offered ''minimal and scattered'' signs of stabilization in some regions, although the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index data show that prices nationwide are still falling. Single-family home prices tumbled 18.5 percent in December from the previous year, and real estate agents say that nonforeclosure sales are still stagnant.
''House prices continued to decline, reportedly at double-digit paces in some areas, with little or no signs of a deceleration evident,'' the beige book said. ''Builders in various districts generally remain pessimistic regarding recovery prospects this year, and consequently the pace of new home construction declined further in most areas.''
Real estate sales in Manhattan, where prices have remained high despite the economic crisis, fell 60 to 65 percent from last year.
Consumers changed their spending habits as they worried about losing their jobs, turning to discount chains instead of traditional department stores and specialized retailers, the report said.
Sales of jewelry, electronics and other luxury goods declined sharply in the Philadelphia, Richmond and Chicago districts of the Fed, and other areas reported that the demand for furniture and appliances also decreased.
Automakers continued to languish, with sales of new cars and light trucks ''exceptionally sluggish,'' but there were some signs of life in used-car sales, according to the beige book.
On Tuesday, major automakers reported that their vehicle sales continued to slide in February, and were down 4.9 percent from January and 41 percent from February 2008.
Consumers were not cutting back just on sweaters, stereos and sport utility vehicles. Health care providers reported seeing fewer patients as people chose to put off elective procedures. Demand for legal services, accounting and consulting fell in several Fed districts.
In another report released Wednesday, the service sector shrank further in February but by less than expected.
The Institute for Supply Management said that its nonmanufacturing index was 41.6 in February compared with 42.9 in January. The level of 50 separates expansion from contraction in the index.

HEADLINE: Phish's Breakup? That Was Then. But Tough Times Call for a Reunion.

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
HAMPTON, Va. -- Onstage at the Hampton Coliseum, Phish was rehearsing for its resurrection: its first shows since it announced it was breaking up forever. That was in 2004, when the jam band played one last summer tour that ended with a marathon weekend festival for 65,000 people on a farm in Coventry, Vt. At the time the band's guitarist and main songwriter, Trey Anastasio, had announced, with purposeful finality, ''We're done.''
Final wasn't final. Now, with three shows here this weekend and a summer tour -- all sold out -- and recording sessions next month for a new album, Phish is gearing up not for a brief, grudging reunion or a second farewell tour, but for a sustainable Phase 2 in the band's peculiar career. ''We're trying to create a format to keep playing for a long time,'' Mr. Anastasio said backstage.
He also has another mission in mind. As a longtime fan of Depression-era swing bands, he has been thinking about Phish's role in the current recession. ''For people in hard times, we can play long shows of pure physical pleasure,'' he said. ''They come to dance and forget their troubles. It's like a service commitment.'' 
The demand is there. When seats went on sale for the first announced concerts through Live Nation Ticketing, 10 million requests -- from both rabid Phish fans and brokers' automated Web bots -- overwhelmed the relatively new Web site (livenation.com), which nonetheless sold more than 250,000 tickets over a weekend. ''This was like a tsunami that they weren't expecting,'' said Coran Capshaw, Phish's manager who runs Red Light Management.
The tour includes amphitheater-scale shows, like those at Jones Beach Theater in Wantagh, N.Y., on June 4 and 5 and two nights headlining the Bonnaroo music festival in Tennessee.
Tickets for Phish's return concert on Friday night sold initially for $49.50, but are being resold for $1,000 and up. For those who can't attend Phish plans to post recordings of all three Hampton Coliseum shows as high-quality MP3 files for free downloading at livephish.com.
In rehearsal the band plunged into its most complicated music: long, mostly instrumental excursions that segue between contrapuntal, key-changing composed passages and quick-fingered group improvisations. One of them, ''Stash,'' breezed from a Latin-jazz-tinged melody to busy cacophony, and the band members grinned wider and wider as it ascended. Afterward the keyboardist Page McConnell exulted, ''That's the best jam in five years.''
Possibly longer. Phish was not playing its best before the breakup. The Coventry shows in particular had both Phish's longtime fans -- possibly the most detail-oriented and judgmental cult in rock -- and the band members themselves calling the performance sloppy, as Mr. Anastasio did. ''If there was ever a concert that represented a band smacking into a wall, that was it,'' Phish's drummer, Jon Fishman, said. ''I think that was one of the great train wrecks in live concert history.''
What broke up Phish was pressure: emotional, physical and chemical. ''We were just exhausted on every level,'' Mr. Anastasio said. The band that was formed at the University of Vermont in 1983 and settled its longtime lineup -- which also includes Mike Gordon on bass -- in 1986 was predicated on youthful energy and a full-time commitment.
''Our dream, our manuscript, the architecture of our career was written when we were 18 years old,'' Mr. Anastasio said. ''We're never going to stop! Three hundred shows a year forever!'' Alert to detail, he immediately added that 300 shows was an exaggeration.
Still, the band typically hit the road for three and a half months at a time, often twice a year. As a jam band following the example of the Grateful Dead, Phish got a major-label recording contract but built its career around performing. According to Nielsen Soundscan, its best-selling album was 1994's ''Hoist'' (Elektra), at 662,000 copies. Now independent, Phish is still deciding how best to release its next album; live shows from its archives have been appearing on the band's own label, JEMP. ''The Clifford Ball'' (JEMP/Rhino), a two-day 1996 stint at the air force base in Plattsburgh, N.Y., has just been released as a seven-DVD set.
In its first years Phish practiced constantly. Songs were ''pouring out,'' Mr. Anastasio said, and the band took time to perfect every transitional passage and meticulously map every set list, particularly during what many fans consider the band's heyday, the mid-1990s, as Phish moved up to arenas from theaters. Then, as band members started families and Phish's business operation grew, there was less time for the music.
In Burlington, Vt., Phish employed three dozen people in management and merchandising. Knowing that the entire payroll hinged on the group's tours made the band members feel compelled to stay on the road. ''It has the gravity of the Sun,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''Once it's going it's difficult to draw yourself away from it. It's warm and it's wonderful and it's a good thing, but it can easily take over your life.'' The number of hangers-on grew so large, Mr. Anastasio said, that there were 3,500 people on the backstage guest list at Coventry.
Mr. Anastasio also fell into a drug habit that bottomed out, he said, when he was arrested in 2006 in Whitehall, N.Y., on charges including possession of heroin and prescription painkillers. The arrest pushed him into rehab, and he is now sober, he said. ''What I thought at the moment was the worst thing that could happen was absolutely the biggest gift I've received.''
After the Coventry farewell concert Phish lightened its load. Looking back, Mr. Anastasio said, his pronouncement that ''We're done'' was partly about ''telling everybody it was time to go home.'' Phish shut down most of its Burlington operation.
The breakup, all band members insist, was never bitter. While Phish was defunct, members made solo albums and stayed in touch. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Gordon, who still live in Burlington, played regular chess games. On the ever-fluid jam-band circuit various Phish members often turned up together onstage, and Mr. Gordon and Mr. Anastasio toured with the Benevento-Russo Duo.
The idea of reassembling Phish emerged about two years ago and lingered. While Mr. Gordon was making his 2008 album, ''The Green Sparrow,'' Mr. Anastasio was also working in the same studio. The producer Steve Lillywhite stopped by, Mr. McConnell said. ''The conversation moved to, 'What if we did an album?' That may have been the spark.''
Late last year the four band members came together, by themselves, to make music in Mr. Anastasio's Burlington barn and studio. They liked what they heard. And they resolved to be the version of Phish they prized most: the intently practiced, well-prepared Phish from the mid-90s. They started their Vermont rehearsals not with their countryish three-chord songs but with their intricate, suitelike songs that verge on progressive rock, like ''Split Open and Melt'' and ''Foam.'' Although Phish has recorded demo versions of 20 songs for its next album, only one is likely to be heard this weekend: ''Backwards Down the Number Line,'' a fond birthday song that asks, ''Do you know why we're still friends?''
Figuring out what to play for its first three reunion concerts became ''one of those exercises in overthought that Phish is known for,'' Mr. Anastasio said. Band members went in a circle naming the songs they wanted to play, deducted some, consulted a list of every song Phish ever played, did some trading and eventually arrived at about 80 songs. Mr. Anastasio started constructing three nights' sets. ''It's like Tetris,'' he said as he showed a visitor the list, a printout full of handwritten changes from six different pens.
Phish can't be the same band it was. It's no longer the sole outlet or commitment for the band members, who are maintaining solo projects and raising families. But onstage at the coliseum Phish savored the once familiar sound of the band they had grown up in, echoing off arena walls. Hearing those reverberations again, Mr. Gordon said after rehearsal, ''was like a door opening.''

HEADLINE: Unlucky or Unwise, Some Owners Left Out

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND

 BODY:
Chadi Moussa lives in a house valued at more than $1 million in Dublin, Calif., in the desirable East Bay area. Unfortunately, he owes nearly twice that much on his mortgage. Mr. Moussa, who runs a used luxury car dealership, is by any definition a troubled homeowner.
But when he looked at President Obama's housing rescue plan, he saw nothing for him because his mortgage was too high.
''You give $25 billion to a bank, at least they should help people stay in their homes,'' Mr. Moussa said. ''But once you get to big loans, nobody's doing anything about it.''
Administration officials say the plan, the details of which were released Wednesday, is intended to help as many homeowners as possible and could prevent three million to four million foreclosures through loan modifications and help four million to five million through low-cost refinancing. 
But it does little for borrowers who have had significant jolts to their income, or who owe more than their home's value on loans that exceed $729,750. In boom-and-bust housing markets like Florida, Las Vegas, Phoenix or California, where values have fallen 30 percent to 40 percent, the plan leaves many in homes they cannot afford -- some because they borrowed recklessly, others because they were buffeted by the market swings.
About 20 percent of the country's 50 million mortgage holders owe more than 105 percent of their house's value, and so do not qualify for refinancing under the plan, according to J.P. Morgan.
''The refinance portion of the plan is set up so it provides the least help for the people who need it most,'' said Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at the Columbia Business School. ''We're missing an opportunity to help many more Americans.''
Refinancing is only for loans owned or backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or roughly half of all homes. Homeowners can tell whether the agencies back their loan by calling their mortgage companies.
For other borrowers, the government plan subsidizes lenders who modify loan payments, but only on loans below $729,750.
Mr. Moussa missed out on both counts.
The Treasury Department estimates that 2 percent of mortgages exceed these limits; the figure approaches 6 percent in California.
''The program made choices,'' said Bill Apgar, a senior adviser at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. ''In order to have the resources available to help the most people, it was decided to put limits on the help to the folks who have better than average capacity to adjust.'' The planners expect 20 percent to 30 percent of people who receive modifications to default again, which is about half the rate for previous loan modifications.
Homeowners with more modest mortgages may also fall through the cracks. Tracy Frazier, 33, has a first mortgage of $325,000 on his house in Phoenix. But the county recorder valued it at $177,000, making him ineligible for refinancing and unlikely to get a loan modification because he is a poor risk.
''The situation we're in, it stinks,'' said Mr. Frazier, whose income has fallen to $42,000 from $80,000. ''But I want to keep this home. Why get us out of it? If it goes to auction, you'll get half the value.''
J.P. Morgan estimates that the loan modification plan will prevent 600,000 to 2.6 million foreclosures, depending on how liberally banks modify mortgages and how many borrowers default again.
Paul Willen, a senior economic adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, cited another group not helped by the plan: the newly unemployed.
''Cutting my payment by 20 percent isn't going to help me if I have no income,'' Mr. Willen said. ''And often these people have gotten a new job offer but they can't move because their house is under water.''
Because house prices often stay low even after the economy recovers, he said, high foreclosure rates are likely to continue after the banks and employment stabilize.
Even with refinancing and loan modifications, many borrowers will still end up in foreclosure, said Christopher A. Viale, president of the Cambridge Credit Counseling Corporation, a nonprofit agency in Agawam, Mass.
''There's 10 million households that aren't being talked about, and they aren't going to be helped at all,'' Mr. Viale said. ''They aren't behind on their mortgages, but they're putting everything on their credit cards, they're making minimum payments and paying penalty rates, and there's no way they can pay off the interest.''
In the past, these homeowners might have refinanced their homes to pay down this debt, but that is no longer an option. ''They need reductions of 30 or 40 percent'' on their mortgage payments, Mr. Viale said.
For Mr. Moussa, the road toward foreclosure has been precipitous. He bought his home in 2005 for $2.24 million, with a down payment of more than $500,000, and monthly payments of $4,000 for the first year. But as California real estate prices plummeted, his house's value fell to about $1.1 million, he said. Then his income dropped by half.
After he defaulted on his mortgage five months ago, Mr. Moussa said he asked his lender, Countrywide Financial, to change the term of his loan to 40 years and to lower the interest to 4 percent until the car business revived.
''Two days ago I got the answer that at this point they can't do anything,'' he said.
Mr. Moussa now has monthly mortgage payments of $8,700 and a home that may never recover its equity. The stress has eroded his marriage, and his wife and daughter are now with her family in Beirut.
His frustration was evident in his voice. ''I can make $5,000 payments per month. Why not do that for me for a couple years? Why take it away, sell it'' for a huge loss, he asked. ''In my area, half the houses are in foreclosure or short sales. And some of them have been stripped down, everything torn out.''
The president has called for legislation empowering bankruptcy court judges to lower the principal on mortgages to reflect fallen home values. This legislation has met strong resistance from the lending industry and many lawmakers.
For Mark Klepper, 50, who lives in Miami, buying a big house was a way to establish credit to start a business. In 2004 he bought a home for $585,000, and watched its value rise to $1.4 million. After refinancing twice, he owes $1,064,000. But the home is now worth a little more than he paid for it, and his income has fallen by 40 percent. He stopped paying his mortgage in January. If he were to continue paying, he said, the drain would crush his business. The government's plan does not help him.
''I feel if there's a plan out there, there shouldn't be a limit,'' Mr. Klepper said. ''If the government is helping these lenders, they need to take some principal write-downs.''
He asked his lender to reduce his balance to $600,000 and his rate to 4 percent, but so far has made no headway.
''I'm saying I can afford to pay, just not what I did in the past,'' he said. ''I wouldn't be asking for it if everything was fine, but it's not.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Sets Big Incentives To Head Off Foreclosures

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS; Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration on Wednesday began the most ambitious effort since the 1930s to help troubled homeowners, offering lenders and borrowers big incentives and subsidies to try to stem the wave of foreclosures.
People with mortgages as high as $729,750 could qualify for help, and there is no ceiling on how high their income can be as long as they are in danger of losing their homes. Interest rates on loans could go as low as 2 percent for some. Many homeowners could see their mortgage payments drop by several hundred dollars a month, and some could save more than $1,000 a month.
Administration officials estimate that the plan will help as many as four million people avoid foreclosure, at a cost to taxpayers of about $75 billion. In addition, the Treasury Department said it intended to follow up with a plan to help troubled borrowers with second mortgages, which many homebuyers used as ''piggyback'' loans to buy houses with no money down.
The plan is bolder and more expensive than any of the Bush administration's programs, which were based almost entirely on coaxing lenders to voluntarily modify loans. While the number of loan modifications has climbed sharply, the number of foreclosures skyrocketed to 2.2 million at the end of 2008, a record. 
The new plan, which takes effect immediately, is intended to win much bigger concessions from lenders by offering a mix of generous financial incentives and regulatory arm-twisting. The final impact will depend on how both lenders and the investors who own mortgages respond, but housing experts said the administration had a good chance of achieving its goal.
The eagerness with which lenders agree to modify loans is likely to be affected by a bill that the House is expected to take up on Thursday.
It would give bankruptcy judges the power to order changes in mortgages on primary residences and would protect loan-servicing companies from lawsuits by investors.
Several of the nation's biggest mortgage-servicing companies, overseeing two-thirds of all home loans in the country -- Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo & Co. are expected to participate in the plan.
In addition, any bank that receives additional federal money under the Treasury Department's $700 billion financial rescue program will be required to take part. But many lenders are expected to participate voluntarily, because the government would be absorbing much of the cost of resolving their bad loans.
''I predict this program will be extremely effective at reducing foreclosures,'' said Eric Stein, senior vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit advocacy group for homeowners.
Administration officials have similar expectations.
''It is imperative that we continue to move with speed to help make housing more affordable and help arrest the damaging spiral in our housing markets,'' said Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary.
In releasing detailed guidelines on the plan, first unveiled Feb. 17, the Treasury Department made it clear that the program would not help every homeowner in trouble. It will do little to help families whose income has evaporated because one or more breadwinners have lost their jobs, nor will it save those swamped by big debts beyond their mortgages. It will not do much for homeowners who are current on their loans but ''upside down'' -- owing more than their houses are worth.
Still, the program, when combined with a separate effort to help homeowners refinance their loans even if they are not in distress, could help put a floor under home prices.
The Treasury has instructed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-controlled mortgage-finance companies, to refinance homeowners at today's low market rates even if the owners have less than the standard 20 percent equity that is usually required.
This second program applies to about 30 million people with mortgages owned or guaranteed by Fannie or Freddie, but will not be available to people whose mortgages are much higher than their home's market value.
Administration officials said it could lower monthly payments for as many as five million homeowners. To finance that effort, the Treasury is providing the two companies with up to $200 billion in additional capital, on top of $200 billion that it had already pledged to them.
Under the new loan modification guidelines, the Treasury will offer mortgage-servicing companies upfront incentive payments of $1,000 for every loan they modify and additional payments of $1,000 a year for the first three years if the borrower remains current. The Treasury will also chip in $1,000 a year to directly reduce the borrower's loan amount, if the borrower stays up to date on payments.
But the biggest subsidies are in reducing the size of a person's monthly payment. If the lender reduced the borrower's monthly housing payment to 38 percent of the household's gross monthly income, the Treasury Department would match, dollar for dollar, the lender's cost in reducing payments down to 31 percent of monthly household income.
The program calls on lenders first to reduce interest rates to as low at 2 percent for the next five years to hit the monthly income target. After five years, some borrowers would start to pay gradually higher rates, but their rates could not exceed the market rate at the time they renegotiated.
That would be a favorable deal for many people. At the moment, the market rate for such loans is just over 5 percent -- very low by historical standards.
The key to determining whether a person receives help will be a so-called net present value calculation by the mortgage company.
In essence, a lender will first have to calculate how much it would cost to reduce a person's monthly payments to an ''affordable'' range, 31 to 38 percent of the borrower's monthly income.
If the calculation shows that the lender's cost in modifying the loan, after receiving the taxpayer subsidy, would be lower than the cost of foreclosing, the lender would be required to offer a borrower the new deal. If the estimated cost of the concessions appeared to be higher than the cost of foreclosure, the decision would be voluntary.
Housing experts estimate that lenders lose about half the outstanding loan amount if they pursue foreclosure, and those losses are climbing as the resale value of houses continues to fall. As a result, the program could lead to millions of loan modifications.
Borrowers cannot be charged any modification fees, the Treasury Department said. Lenders will have to bear the administrative expense of reviewing the loans and making their cost estimates. Treasury officials said they were trying to warn consumers against fraud artists and consultants who are seeking to collect fees for helping homeowners negotiate with lenders.
There is no ceiling on how much a person can earn and still qualify for help, but the size of the mortgage to be modified cannot be higher than $729,750 for a single-family home, or $1.4 million for the mortgage on a four-unit condominium or cooperative.
The program is open only to borrowers who live in the homes at issue, and not to investors or people with mortgages on second or third homes. It is open to people who obtained a mortgage before Jan. 1, 2009. Borrowers can apply for loan modifications until the end of 2012.

HEADLINE: In an Auto Industry Hometown, a Familiar Financial Road

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

DATELINE: PONTIAC, Mich. 

 BODY:
For the past few days, Tristan Williams has spent part of every afternoon at the Blue Note Cafe here, not only for the chicken wings but also for the warmth, electricity and hot water in the men's room. He has none of those where he lives in a row house not far from this city's modest business district, about 30 miles northwest of Detroit.
 For several hours on Monday, Mr. Williams, a college student and janitor, was the cafe's lone customer, charging his cellphone and using the free computer. He searched the Internet for a battery-operated home heater and a better job. He could not find either. 
 ''So many things are closing because of the economy, even the schools,'' said Mr. Williams, 19, who helps support his two unemployed parents as the city seems to be crumbling all around them. ''We want something better, you know. At home, our food is spoiled.''
 On Wednesday, some people like Mr. Williams may have found a small ray of hope here in what is arguably another depressing development for Pontiac, with its population of 70,000, 2008 annual budget of $52 million and an outsize accumulated budget deficit of $12 million. Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm has previously stated that the city is in economic crisis, and at a hearing in Lansing on Wednesday she allowed the city to present its case. 
 She is likely to appoint an emergency manager to take over the municipal finances in the next several days. Pontiac would be Michigan's fifth city in 20 years to undergo a state take-over. Flint had an emergency manager for two years, ending in 2004. Two other municipalities have them now -- Highland Park and Three Oaks -- three would be more than the state has ever had at one time, yet another signal of how entrenched Michigan's long recession has become.
 As its name suggests, Pontiac is inextricably tied to the flailing auto industry, with General Motors being its largest employer. G.M. still makes Chevrolet trucks and has its global engine design team based here. (The car named for the city was first manufactured here in 1927, but production here stopped in the late 1980s.)
 As G.M. shed more than 3,000 jobs in Pontiac over the last two years, it compounded more than a decade's worth of job and population loss. 
 ''The mayor's office and the City Council have exhibited an ongoing inability to resolve the city's budget issues,'' Ms. Granholm said last week in a letter to the mayor, Clarence E. Phillips. 
 She cited what a state review team found to be ''a lack of urgency on the part of city officials,'' in addition to the city's inability to monitor itself, cash flow shortages, unauthorized borrowing, personnel shortages and managerial control issues.
 The state's intervention began almost two years ago with the review, which led to the signing of a consent agreement between the city and the state, outlining a path for the city to get back to financial stability.
 But the city did not uphold the terms of the agreement, state officials say. Furthermore, Mayor Phillips and the City Council have not had a good working relationship for months, several local officials say. A state-appointed manager would have the authority to bring the city's expenditures in line with revenues, superseding the mayor and Council on financial matters. 
 Mayor Phillips did not respond to requests for comment. In the local news media, he has expressed surprise about the city's predicament. ''We weren't aware we were in any special trouble,'' he told The Detroit Free Press last week.
 Some city officials were shocked at the mayor's assertion. 
 ''He insists that we're not in that bad a condition -- yes we are,'' said Councilman Kone Bowman. ''Before you even begin to address a problem, you've got to acknowledge it.''
 Councilman Lee A. Jones added, ''All we're doing now is going through daily survival mode of business, keeping up with needs.''
 Some residents would say that is not really going so well.
 ''Our neighborhoods are going down, the streets are terrible, and jobs are disappearing,'' said Andrea Manley, 31. ''My take on the economy is: I'm ready to leave.'' 
 The local public transportation system is notoriously unreliable, eight public schools are closing this year because of falling enrollment and budget shortfalls, layoffs are rampant and small businesses are shutting down.
 Only 73 city police officers remain, down from a high of almost 200 several years ago.
 ''If I had any money, I'd move away,'' Mr. Williams, the college student, said wistfully. ''The bus comes once an hour, maybe. If you miss it, you're really messed up.''
 The city's outdated Web site boasts about a new steakhouse on its main strip as an example of rebirth, but a visit reveals that it is closed and up for sale. 
 ''I'm glad somebody's taking over, because what's happening now is it's being run into the ground,'' said Jeremy Williams, 26, owner of a downtown music production studio. ''The city's resources aren't managed well. And there's a lot of potential here.''
 There is one bright spot on the horizon: a movie studio has announced plans to move into one of G.M.'s old facilities, possibly creating 3,500 jobs. 
 But for now, people can only dream of those positions.
 Kay Stevens, 33, sleeps in a church basement with other homeless women and men. Ms. Stevens moved to Pontiac from a neighboring county two years ago. ''I was told there would be more opportunities here,'' she said over a free dinner in a Salvation Army kitchen. ''I haven't run into a blessing yet, and I'd do anything.''

HEADLINE: The Crisis at Home and Abroad

 BODY:
The economic news is so frighteningly bad here, it has all but squeezed out reports of the turmoil wrecking the developing world. The news there, if possible, is even more frightening. And in a globalized economy there is no insulation for anyone. 
 The emergency spreading through Eastern Europe has sent currencies plunging in financially stretched nations like Hungary and solid economies like Poland. The crisis threatens political stability along the European Union's eastern border. The government in Latvia fell last week following protests. Ukraine is on the brink. 
 Over the weekend, the European Union's wealthy members rejected calls for a bailout of its poorer members. Collapsing economies in Eastern Europe -- including inside the European Union -- could bring down the banks in the West that lent to the East.
 Such turmoil should serve as a warning about the perils of ignoring the disasters unfolding across the developing world -- and the need for a global response. 
 Poor countries remain the world's only hope for economic growth this year, but that's dimming as they are walloped by collapsing exports and the shutdown of foreign finance. Currencies are plunging from Mexico to Malaysia as lenders and investors pull money out to park it in United States Treasury bonds. Pakistan, Iceland, Turkey and El Salvador, along with several Eastern European countries, have already asked the International Monetary Fund for help to pay foreign creditors. 
 Starved of new credit, companies and consumers across the developing world are struggling desperately to pay loans coming due. And cash-strapped governments in many poorer countries have been unable to implement fiscal stimulus packages or even reduce interest rates for fear of their currencies taking a further hit.
 The International Monetary Fund estimates that the crisis will cost developing countries $1 trillion in lost growth. The World Bank warned that it would add more than 50 million people to those living on less than $2 a day across the globe.
 As they prepare for the summit of the group of the world's 20 biggest economies in London on April 2, leaders of industrial nations must quickly work on a plan to provide large-scale financial assistance to avert an economic catastrophe in the developing world. 
 The International Monetary Fund needs a lot more money. The call by its chief, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, to double its financial war chest to $500 billion is a first step. We welcome Japan's offer of $100 billion and urge other donors -- namely the United States and the European Union -- to step up to the plate. More must be done. 
 The World Bank's president, Robert Zoellick, has called on developed countries to deposit 0.7 percent of their fiscal stimulus money into a fund to aid the world's neediest populations. The World Bank and other multinational development banks could use new capital to increase lending to public and private-sector entities in the developing world, which have been shut out of capital markets. 
 Helping the developing world is within reach, but it will require capital and concessions from rich countries. The United States and Europe should drop their resistance to a vast new issue of special drawing rights -- which like newly printed dollars by the Federal Reserve act as the International Monetary Fund's own currency. 
 The United States and Europe also must give more voting power to up-and-coming players. China, in particular, has the financial firepower to become an important contributor to the global effort, yet it will expect more say in the fund's business. 
 As the credit crunch spreads, the whole world stands in need of economic stimulus. Poor countries, however, do not have the resources to neither pay for their own fiscal pump-priming nor to recapitalize foundering banks and reignite the lending to their private sectors. They need outside help. For their own sake, developed countries should provide it. Quickly.

HEADLINE: Abruptly, Expatriate Bankers Are Cut Loose

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and JULIA WERDIGIER; Keith Bradsher reported from Singapore and Hong Kong, and Julia Werdigier from London. Bettina Wassener contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: SINGAPORE 

 BODY:
Losing your job anywhere is disorienting, but imagine being laid off when you work in a foreign country. Not only is your source of income, and perhaps a good part of your identity, suddenly yanked away, but often you lose your right to remain in the country. 
 Add to that urgent disruption the calamity of a collapsing industry and you have the life more or less of thousands of American expatriates in banking and finance. 
 The archetype of the young international banker cut one of the most dashing figures of the age of globalization. Well-educated and well-connected, able to take their pick of jobs, they skipped across employers like they did countries for weekend getaways.
 As recently as last fall, financial professionals who lost their jobs as Wall Street bled could hope for new positions overseas. But layoffs have spread quickly from New York to Europe and now to the Mideast and Asia, leaving a growing number of jobless expats, as they are known, with few places to turn and either stranded or forced to return home.
 A rhyming refrain among laid-off bankers a few months ago -- ''Try Dubai, Mumbai and Shanghai'' -- now seems hopelessly dated. Financial markets in all three cities have crashed.
 Also out of date, the acronym ''filth,'' which long stood for ''Failed in London? Try Hong Kong.'' Many American and European investment banks have been trimming staff in Hong Kong as well. About 325,000 financial services jobs have been cut worldwide since August 2007, according to the International Labor Organization. Many banks have reduced bonuses by as much as 80 percent or cut them completely.
 Because times were so good -- during all or almost all of many of their careers -- the weight of the current malaise is that much greater. The layoffs are affecting local bankers for multinationals as well as expats.
 ''I didn't think it was possible,'' said Marco Wong, a Singaporean who speaks both Chinese and English and has a master's degree in wealth management. He was laid off from Citibank in January, just months after being courted by recruiters from Citibank, HSBC and Credit Suisse. ''It was quite shocking,'' he said.
 While there are no reliable figures on the number of expatriate bankers who have been laid off, the cuts have been widespread. Even in the Middle East, where banks like Merrill Lynch and Citibank had hired dozens of investment bankers late last year to build large offices, expats are having to pack their bags.
 How these newly unemployed will fare will depend on a combination of personal and family resources, networks and that intangible factor, resilience. 
 Asia was one of the last places to be affected by layoffs. Most economies here remained strong until exports began to plunge late last year and investor confidence crumbled. Big financial institutions like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and others have each laid off more than 100 employees in Asia this winter.
 More layoffs are likely. ''When you need to reduce costs quickly, you just take out 10 percent and that's it, boom,'' said one investment bank official who asked for anonymity because the subject was delicate. 
 Now some Hong Kong landlords are demanding three months' security from bankers instead of the usual two, because of the risk the prospective tenants may be laid off. Since business is so slow, financial sector recruiters have begun scheduling long vacations.
 Local banks in Asia, unlike European banks, have had fewer layoffs as a percentage of total employment because they largely avoided buying American securities in the last few years. But they have never employed large numbers of expatriates.
 Many expats return home after losing their jobs. Some, seeing the writing on the wall, are even walking away from high-paying, high-pressure jobs.
 When David Flynn, for example, moved to London from Australia four years ago, he loved being part of a bustling financial center ripe with career opportunities and fat bonuses. But as the recession set in, the excitement and work ebbed, and Mr. Flynn, 28, left his job at Union Bancaire Privee at the end of last year and moved back to Perth. Now he uses his overseas experience to advise clients on investments.
 ''I thought I could either sit in London and sit through this downturn or go back and live on my own terms,'' Mr. Flynn said. ''London is a great place, but if you don't have the money to enjoy all the things that are good, you struggle.''
 For bankers still trying to cling to their overseas perches, career counselors are generally telling them not to move, and to use their networks to look for jobs locally instead of sending resumes halfway around the world.
 ''Stay put,'' said Paul Heng, the managing director of Next Career Consulting Group Asia, in Singapore. ''I don't think there is a refuge anywhere in this world,'' he said.
 In Asia, many of those losing their jobs seem to be following Mr. Heng's advice for now. James E. Thompson, the chairman of Crown Worldwide Group, a large Hong Kong-based mover catering to expatriates, said there was no sign of an exodus.
 London is different. Sandra Johnson, president of the Kensington and Chelsea Women's Club in London, which provides social networking opportunities for Americans in London, said many families were leaving and fewer arriving. Membership in the club has dropped 10 percent from two years ago, to 1,100.
 ''It's really difficult,'' said Ms. Johnson, who moved to London with her family from Westchester County near New York City more than four years ago. ''Some people just try to make it until the end of the year.''
 Mr. Heng, the career consultant, said that he was encouraging some high-fliers to consider completely new careers. He cited a chief information officer of a technology company who just found a job he loves as a high school teacher. The pay is a lot lower, he said, but the job security is hard to beat.
