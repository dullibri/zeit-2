HEADLINE: Who Will Safeguard Children of Divorce?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As a practicing Manhattan divorce lawyer with more than 30 years in the trenches, and scores of prenuptial agreements under my belt, I read ''Preparing for a Broken Home,'' by James Andrew Miller (Op-Ed, July 16), with interest. 
 While Mr. Miller puts his finger on one of the most frustrating and difficult aspects of our profession -- custody battles that all too often devastate the financial and emotional lives of divorcing families -- a prenuptial agreement is an ineffectual vehicle to remedy such situations. 
 Nobody can quibble with Mr. Miller's major thrust that parents should avoid putting their children in the middle of a custody fight. But contractually committing to a custodial arrangement before children are even born is an exercise in legal futility. 
 But Mr. Miller has it right when he observes that ''pre-arranged custody schedules might not hold up in court'' on account of changed circumstances, because all custody disputes rise and fall on determining what is in a child's best interests. 
 As couples navigate through life, their relationship with their kids remains malleable and unpredictable. That is why the law holds that custody agreements -- even after divorce -- are not necessarily binding. 
 Prenuptial agreements are a solid way to resolve economic issues. On the other hand, parents can cogently address what is in their children's best interests only when they know who their children are and what it means to be a parent.

 To the Editor:
 The Children's Rights Council has offered post-divorce parenting plans since 1985, but few parents have seemed interested in them.
 The parents we have talked to never think that they will be the ones to get divorced, or, even if they contemplate the possibility, they often feel they do not need education or instruction on how to divide the children after divorce. 
 Also, women know that they are the ones more likely to obtain sole custody, especially in a primarily sole mother custody state like New York. So where is the incentive for them to consider sharing the children after divorce?

HEADLINE: A Godsend for Darfur, or a Curse?

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
DAKAR, Senegal
 THE announcement by researchers at Boston University last week that a vast underground lake the size of Lake Erie had been discovered beneath the barren soil of northern Darfur, a blood-soaked but otherwise parched land racked by war for the past four years, was greeted by rapturous hopes. Could this, at last, bring deliverance from a cataclysmic conflict that has killed at least 200,000 people and pushed more than 2.5 million from their homes? 
 That hope is built upon an argument, advanced by a United Nations report released last month and an opinion article in The Washington Post by Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary general, that environmental degradation and the symptoms of a warming planet are at the root of the Darfur crisis. 
 ''There is a very strong link between land degradation, desertification and conflict in Darfur,'' said the United Nations Environmental Program report, which noted that rainfall in northern Darfur has decreased by a third over the last 80 years. ''Exponential population growth and related environmental stress have created the conditions for conflicts to be triggered and sustained by political, tribal or ethnic differences,'' the report said, adding that Darfur ''can be considered a tragic example of the social breakdown that can result from ecological collapse.'' 
 The idea that more water -- unearthed through a thousand wells sunk into the underground lake -- could neatly defuse the crisis is seductive. Messy African conflicts, from Congo to Liberia, from northern Uganda to Angola, have a way of defying all efforts to solve them. Instead, they seem to become hopelessly more complex as they drag on, year after agonizing year. A scientific explanation for the problem (environmental degradation) along with a tidy technological solution (irrigation) gratifies the modern humanitarian impulse. 
 But the history of Sudan, a grim chronicle of civil war, famine, coups and despotism, gives ample reason to be skeptical. 
 ''Like all resources water can be used for good or ill,'' said Alex de Waal, a scholar who has studied the impact of climate variation in Sudan and who witnessed the 1984-85 famine that is often cited as the beginning of the ecological crisis gripping Darfur. ''It can be a blessing or also a curse. If the government acts true to form and tries to create some sort of oasis in the desert and control who settles there, that would simply be an extension of the crisis, not a solution.'' 
 The droughts that gripped Sudan in the 1980s, and the migrations and other social changes they forced, have doubtless played a role in the conflict by increasing competition for water and land between farmers, who tend to be non-Arab, and herders, many of whom are Arabs. But an environmental catastrophe cannot become a violent cataclysm without a powerful human hand to guide it in that direction. 
 ''These wider environmental factors don't have impact in and of themselves'' in terms of fomenting conflict, Mr. de Waal said. ''The question is how they are managed.'' 
 In fact, while different regions and social groups suffer severely, Sudan as a whole has riches to spare, in oil, fertile soil, and even water. Indeed, history suggests that this newly discovered lake is just as likely to become a source of conflict as a solution to the bloodshed. 
 Successive Sudanese governments and their colonial precursors have adopted agricultural policies that have almost inevitably led to conflict. They have favored large mechanized farms and complex irrigation schemes, controlled by the government and its allies, over the small, rain-fed farms that are the backbone of the rural economy in much of Sudan. 
 In eastern Sudan, where a rebellion has been brewing for years, the Beja people have nursed grievances since Britain and Egypt ruled Sudan jointly during the first half of the 20th century. Under their rule, irrigation programs for commercial farming deprived the Beja of their prime grazing land. 
 Post-colonial governments, which in the early years had the blessing of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, took vast tracts of land in the name of agricultural development, turning farmers who worked their own land into wage laborers for the state and its allies. 
 Some Sudanese have even been pushed off their land entirely. In the early 1990s the Nuba people were forced into ''peace villages,'' where they provided a steady supply of cheap, captive labor to mechanized farms. In other areas, including parts of Darfur, intensive mechanized farming by the government and investors who were heedless to the need to protect the fertility of the land left large tracts barren. 
 A vast new agricultural scheme in a largely uninhabited swath of northern Darfur is more likely to fit into this destructive pattern than not, said John Prendergast, a founder of the Enough Project, an initiative of the Center for American Progress and the International Crisis Group to abolish genocide and mass atrocities.
 ''Climate change and the lack of rain are much less important than the land-use patterns promoted by the government of Sudan and the development policies of World Bank and I.M.F., which were focused on intensive agricultural expansion that really mined the soils and left a lot of land unusable,'' said Mr. Prendergast, who has been studying Sudan for 20 years. ''That was probably the principal impetus for a lot of intra-Darfur migration in the decades leading up to the conflict in Darfur.'' 
 During those years, the government exploited tensions over water and land to achieve its own aims, putting down a rebellion among the non-Arab tribes, who rose up because they wanted a greater share of Sudan's wealth and power. It armed tribal militias to fight the rebels, and these militias unleashed a tide of violence that ultimately would become, according to the Bush administration and many others, the 21st century's first genocide. 
 A report released last year by the Coalition for International Justice on the role that oil and mechanized farming have played in human rights abuses in Sudan concluded: ''The predominant root of conflict in Sudan is the instability that results from the systemic abuse of the rural (and recently urbanized) poor at the hands of the economic and political elites of central Sudan.'' 
 In this analysis, the heart of the Darfur conflict, as in all conflicts in Sudan, is the battle for control of resources and riches, but not between farmers and herders, northerners and southerners, Christians and Muslims, or Arabs and non-Arabs. 
 It is a conflict between those at the center of the country, the elites who have controlled Sudan and its wealth for the past century and a half, and the desperately poor people who beg for scraps from the periphery. 
 Until that equation changes, many analysts argue, nothing else will.

HEADLINE: Letters The Poverty Trap

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Niall Ferguson, with whom I have differed repeatedly over his defense of imperialism, needlessly tries to start a fight between Paul Collier and me in his review of Collier's ''Bottom Billion'' (July 1). I applaud Collier's excellent new book and thank him for including kind references to my own work therein. The very idea of the poverty trap as being critical in Africa, a concept at the core of ''The Bottom Billion,'' has likewise been a core theme of my own writings on Africa, indeed a central theme of my book ''The End of Poverty.'' The notion of different factors contributing to the poverty trap is also a theme common to both our research efforts. For my part, I have worked hard to introduce in the academic literature and policy discussions the idea that poverty is involved in vicious circles related to violence, natural resources, landlockedness and other geographic factors, and poor governance. 
 In its prescriptions, ''The Bottom Billion'' argues for major increases in aid to African countries with governments that are making determined efforts to achieve economic development. It emphasizes support for rural development in countries with few other prospects for economic growth, and underscores the overstated nature of ''good governance'' policy prescriptions that ignore underlying economic realities in the poorest countries. It argues for practical measures to boost exports and promote trade. These are just a few of the many issues on which Collier and I have found our work to be mutually reinforcing. 
 While Collier and I might reasonably debate some points of detail, we are in agreement on a vast majority of issues, and I have enormous respect for his continuing contributions. It's unfortunate that Ferguson, for unknown reasons of his own, tries to contort the literature and evidence into a false debate, rather than focusing on the practical issues needed to tackle the scourge of extreme poverty.

HEADLINE: New Leaders Say Pensive French Think Too Much

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO

DATELINE: PARIS, July 21 

 BODY:
France is the country that produced the Enlightenment, Descartes's one-liner, ''I think, therefore I am,'' and the solemn pontifications of Jean-Paul Sartre and other celebrity philosophers. 
 But in the government of President Nicolas Sarkozy, thinking has lost its cachet.
 In proposing a tax-cut law last week, Finance Minister Christine Lagarde bluntly advised the French people to abandon their ''old national habit.''
 ''France is a country that thinks,'' she told the National Assembly. ''There is hardly an ideology that we haven't turned into a theory. We have in our libraries enough to talk about for centuries to come. This is why I would like to tell you: Enough thinking, already. Roll up your sleeves.''
 Citing Alexis de Tocqueville's ''Democracy in America,'' she said the French should work harder, earn more and be rewarded with lower taxes if they get rich. 
 Ms. Lagarde knows well the Horatio Alger story of making money through hard work. She looked west to make her fortune, spending much of her career as a lawyer at the firm of Baker & McKenzie, based in the American city identified by its broad shoulders and work ethic: Chicago. She rose to become the first woman to head the firm's executive committee and was named one of the world's most powerful women by Forbes magazine.
 So now, two years back in France, she is a natural to promote the program of Mr. Sarkozy, whose driving force is doing rather than musing, and whose mantra is ''work more to earn more.'' 
 Certainly, the new president himself has cultivated his image as a nonintellectual. ''I am not a theoretician,'' he told a television interviewer last month. ''I am not an ideologue. Oh, I am not an intellectual! I am someone concrete!''
 But the disdain for reflection may be going a bit too far. It certainly has set the French intellectual class on edge. 
 ''How absurd to say we should think less!'' said Alain Finkielkraut, the philosopher, writer, professor and radio show host. ''If you have the chance to consecrate your life to thinking, you work all the time, even in your sleep. Thinking requires setbacks, suffering, a lot of sweat.''
 Bernard-Henri Levy, the much more splashy philosopher-journalist who wrote a book retracing Tocqueville's 19th-century travels throughout the United States, is similarly appalled by Ms. Lagarde's comments.
 ''This is the sort of thing you can hear in cafe conversations from morons who drink too much,'' said Mr. Levy, who is so well-known in French that he is known simply by his initials B.H.L. ''To my knowledge this is the first time in modern French history that a minister dares to utter such phrases. I'm pro-American and pro-market, so I could have voted for Nicolas Sarkozy, but this anti-intellectual tendency is one of the reasons that I did not.'' 
 Mr. Levy, who ultimately endorsed Mr. Sarkozy's Socialist rival, Segolene Royal, said that Ms. Lagarde was much too selective in quoting Tocqueville and suggested that she read his complete works. In her leisure time.
 The satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine, meanwhile, mocked Ms. Lagarde for praising the sheer joy of work and quoting Confucius's oft-cited line, ''Choose a work that you love and you won't have to work another day.'' 
 Such ''subtleties have escaped the cleaning lady or the supermarket checkout clerk,'' a commentary in the newspaper said Wednesday.
 The government's call to work is crucial to its ambitious campaign to revitalize the French economy by increasing both employment and consumer buying power. Somehow Mr. Sarkozy and his team hope to persuade the French that it is in their interest to abandon what some commentators call a nationwide ''laziness'' and to work longer and harder, and maybe even get rich. 
 France's legally mandated 35-hour work week gives workers a lot of leisure time but not necessarily the means to enjoy it. Taxes on high-wage earners are so burdensome that hordes have fled abroad. (Mr. Sarkozy cites the case of one of his stepdaughters, who works in an investment-banking firm in London.) 
 In her National Assembly speech, Ms. Lagarde said that there should be no shame in personal wealth and that the country needed tax breaks to lure the rich back. 
 ''All these French bankers'' working in London and ''all these fiscal exiles'' taking refuge from French taxes in Belgium ''want one thing: to come back to France,'' she said. ''To them, as well as to all our compatriots who are looking for the keys to fiscal paradise, we open our doors.'' 
 Indeed, the idea of admitting one's wealth, once considered declasse, is becoming more acceptable. A cover story in the popular weekly magazine VSD this month included revelations that just a few years ago would have been unthinkable: the 2006 income of leading French personalities ($18 million for soccer star Zinedine Zidane, $12.1 million for rock star Johnny Hallyday, $334,000 for Prime Minister Francois Fillon, $109,000 for Mr. Sarkozy). 
 ''We are seeing an important cultural change,'' said Eric Chaney, chief economist for Europe for Morgan Stanley. ''Working families in France want to be richer. Wealth is no longer a taboo. There's a strong sentiment in France that people think prices are too high and need more money. It's not a question of thinking or not thinking.'' 
 Still, the French seem to be divided about the best way to get rich. On Thursday, a widely reported TNS-Sofres poll of more than 1,000 people concluded that 39 percent of the French think that it is possible to get rich by winning the lottery; only 40 percent believe that getting rich can happen through work.
 Certainly, the veneration of money more than ideas is new to French politics. 
 Other French presidents flaunted their intellectual sides. Georges Pompidou was a teacher and author of a widely read anthology of poetry still used in French schools. Francois Mitterrand was a literature buff who collected rare books. 
 Valery Giscard d'Estaing, now a member of the Academie Francaise, has written important political tomes. Even Jacques Chirac, who liked to drink beer and eat bratwurst, was acknowledged as an expert on Asian culture and art.
 Mr. Sarkozy is by no means an intellectual dwarf. His campaign speeches were filled with allusions to weighty French thinkers. He wrote a book more than a decade ago about one of his heroes, George Mandel, a Jewish government minister before World War II who opposed the collaborationist Vichy government and was arrested and eventually executed by the Nazis.
 Still, Mr. Sarkozy likes to boast that, unlike Mr. Giscard D'Estaing, Mr. Chirac and legions of ministers and senior civil servants, he did not attend France's finishing school for the political elite, the Ecole Nationale d'Administration. (Only one of his cabinet members is ''Enarque,'' as the school's graduates are called, but nine of the 16 either practice law, like Mr. Sarkozy, or studied it.)
 Some intellectuals find aspects of his man-of-the-people style a bit declasse.
 In an after-midnight round table on French television this month, Mr. Finkielkraut, the philosopher and a Sarkozy supporter, called on him to abandon what he called an ''undignified'' pursuit.
 ''Western civilization, in its best sense, was born with the promenade,'' Mr. Finkielkraut said, noting that thinkers like Aristotle, Heidegger and Rimbaud all were walkers. ''Walking is a sensitive, spiritual act. Jogging -- it is management of the body.''
 His fellow guests agreed. ''It is a change of rhythm -- it's called Jimmy Carter,'' said one, reminding viewers of the American president who brought jogging into the White House. 
 ''And Bill Clinton,'' said another.

HEADLINE: In a Volatile City, a Stern Line On Race and Politics

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL

 BODY:
Those were grim days for race relations in New York City, the early 1990s. There were nearly 2,000 murders each year, blacks and whites died in high-profile racial killings, and a riot held a divided Brooklyn neighborhood in thrall for three dangerous nights.
 On Jan. 9, 1994, another match landed in this tinderbox: a caller reported a burglary at a Harlem mosque. The police ran in, and Nation of Islam guards threw punches and broke an officer's nose.
 The mosque's minister, accompanied by the Rev. Al Sharpton, drove downtown to register their outrage with the police commissioner, a street theater ritual grudgingly tolerated by past mayors. 
 Except the new mayor -- Rudolph W. Giuliani, fresh off his November victory over the city's first black mayor, David N. Dinkins -- decreed that no one would meet with Mr. Sharpton. No more antics, no more provocations. 
 ''I've taken a golden opportunity to act like a sensible mayor rather than a mayor who will be moved in any direction,'' he said. ''I'm an observer of the last 10 years of this city, and I hope to God we don't continue in that direction.''
 More than any other Republican running for president, Mr. Giuliani has confronted the question of race, that most torturous of American legacies. 
 His 1993 mayoral campaign slogan, often repeated, of ''one city, one standard,'' emphasized his view that no ethnic or racial group should expect special treatment. And he spoke with a stunning bluntness about what he saw as the failings of the city's black leadership.
 His handling of the mosque fracas set the tone. In the years to come, Mr. Giuliani would rebuff not just the histrionic Mr. Sharpton but nearly every high-ranking black official in the city, even those of moderate politics: congressmen, a state comptroller, influential ministers.
 But grabbing hold of the race dial proved easier than turning it to his will. 
 ''I never thought Rudy Giuliani was a racist,'' said Fran Reiter, one of Mr. Giuliani's deputy mayors. ''But he was obsessed with the notion there were certain groups he couldn't win over. And he wasn't even going to try.''
 Black leaders, Mr. Giuliani said in 1994, had to ''learn how to discipline themselves in the way in which they speak'' if they expected to chat with him. The city's welfare-state philosophy, he said later, was racist and ''enslaved'' black New Yorkers.
 ''We in this city went through years and years of subdividing people, and that became the most important thing, the subdivision people belonged to,'' Mr. Giuliani said. 
 Certainly he knew such words resonated with white voters who formed the backbone of his electoral coalition. What is less certain is whether a man raised and schooled in a white world understood the force with which his harshest words rained down on black New Yorkers.
 New York City is 45 percent white and 27 percent black, according to 2000 Census figures.
 ''He was not patronizing, he was not naive and I admired that,'' said Michael Meyers, president of the New York Civil Rights Coalition, who once advised him. ''But he could play on the edge of old racial antipathies.''
 Mr. Giuliani's policies, too, stirred anger. His decision to drive down the welfare rolls by cutting benefits and tightening eligibility standards and his deep cuts in social agencies infuriated many. Black voters applauded the drop in crime, but rough police tactics often inflamed tensions.
 Mr. Giuliani did not respond to repeated requests made in the last few weeks to discuss his views on race.
 Mr. Giuliani, aides say, found a city in the early 1990s where most of the departments affecting the lives of black New Yorkers from schools to welfare to public safety were dysfunctional. Too many citizens expected government to coddle them, and too many black leaders, said Peter Powers, one of Mr. Giuliani's oldest friends and his first deputy mayor, were afraid to work publicly with a white Republican mayor.
 So Mr. Giuliani was intent on marginalizing these critics -- even if he had to shun much of the black establishment. Mr. Powers said: ''You are talking about some of the people who had been around for a while. Maybe we thought someone else deserved that role.''
 Perhaps. But black leaders say Mr. Giuliani, in declining to talk with them, succeeded in isolating himself.
 ''He just drew a line and said, 'Anyone who represents the black community, all of the elected officials, are irresponsible and I won't meet with you,' '' said former State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a black Democrat who had a long record of building alliances with whites. ''If you're the leader of the city, you really can't justify that.''
 Good Will, Evaporated
 It is one of the more intriguing ''what ifs'' in city politics. In 1989, a Republican adviser leaned across a lunch table and put this proposition to Bill Lynch, a liberal graybeard: Would Mr. Lynch, who is black, consider working in the mayoral campaign of Rudolph W. Giuliani?
 That was not so incongruous an offer as it sounds now. Many saw the incumbent, Mayor Edward I. Koch, then seeking a fourth term, as a racially divisive figure.
 ''They thought Rudy could form a winning black-white Catholic coalition,'' Mr. Lynch recalled. ''They figured if they could attract someone like me, they could pull African-American voters because Koch was anathema to blacks.''
 Mr. Lynch instead managed the campaign of Mr. Dinkins, who upset Mr. Koch in the 1989 Democratic primary. 
 The Giuliani of this period was longer on ambition than fixed views. He was liberal on homelessness and attacked Mr. Koch for calling Mr. Dinkins ''a Jesse Jackson Democrat.'' These, he said, were racial ''code words.'' 
 Some nights Mr. Giuliani went to Bushwick and Brownsville, neighborhoods ravaged by crack, talking to men and women trapped behind triple-locked apartment doors. 
 ''He was trying to learn, in a very linear way, the way that poor people live,'' recalled one guide, Michael Gecan, an organizer with East Brooklyn Congregations, a church-based community organizing group.
 Mr. Giuliani was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, on May 28, 1944. When he was 7, his family became part of the postwar migration to Long Island, eventually settling in North Bellmore, which was 99.7 percent white. He would return to the city to attend Bishop Loughlin High School and Manhattan College, schools that were 99 percent white. He became a passionate Democrat, devoted to John and Robert Kennedy as the civil rights struggle dominated the news. 
 ''What we saw on television horrified us,'' Mr. Powers recalled of the battle against Jim Crow laws. ''When people kind of suggest, 'You're a bunch of white guys,' it's as if we didn't live through America at that time. That's ludicrous.''
 As a federal prosecutor in the 1980s, Mr. Giuliani worked with black ministers to jail corrupt police officers and invited Mr. Sharpton to talk about the plague of crack. ''He was not an ideologue, and he had no problem meeting,'' Mr. Sharpton said. ''Let me tell you, I was a lot more radical then.''
 By early 1989, New York magazine wrote of Mr. Giuliani, ''He is perhaps the only white politician in town who draws a positive emotional response -- hugs and cheers -- in Harlem.''
 Most of that good will evaporated in the heat of the campaign. Mr. Dinkins became the Democratic nominee; his candidacy was laden with black aspiration and the promise of racial peace. Mr. Giuliani steered right and attacked hard. 
 When Mr. Dinkins called Mr. Giuliani, who served in the Justice Department, a ''Reagan Republican,'' he fired back. His campaign ran an ad in a Jewish newspaper with a photo of Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Jackson, a year after Mr. Jackson made a comment widely seen as anti-Semitic. Mr. Giuliani began calling Mr. Dinkins ''a Jesse Jackson Democrat.''
 Mr. Giuliani lost in 1989 and did not stop running until the next election was over. His political task seemed clear. He could not count on peeling black votes from a black mayor. So he cultivated Jews, ethnic whites and the Hispanic middle class.
 With New York pitched into deep recession, its descent hastened by crack and racial disturbances, a campaign riven by race seemed inevitable. ''There were people in his camp pushing him hard to tie race to crime,'' said Fred Siegel, a historian at Cooper Union who once advised Mr. Giuliani. ''I don't know if this was moral or practical, but Giuliani was having none of it,'' Mr. Siegal recalled. ''He was insistent that crime was about behavior, not race.'' 
 Still, Mr. Giuliani took a fateful step that would for years prompt questions about his racial sensitivities. In September 1992, he spoke to a rally of police officers protesting Mr. Dinkins's proposal for a civilian board to review police misconduct.
 It was a rowdy, often threatening, crowd. Hundreds of white off-duty officers drank heavily, and a few waved signs like ''Dump the Washroom Attendant,'' a reference to Mr. Dinkins. A block away from City Hall, Mr. Giuliani gave a fiery address, twice calling Mr. Dinkins's proposal ''bullshit.'' The crowd cheered. Mr. Giuliani was jubilant. 
 ''If you're acculturated to like cops, you don't necessarily see 10,000 white guys who don't vote in the city, don't write political checks and love you for the wrong reason,'' an aide said. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is working with the Giuliani presidential campaign.
 Mr. Dinkins has not forgotten that sea of angry cops. ''Rudy was out there inciting white cops to riot,'' Mr. Dinkins said in a recent interview. 
 Mr. Giuliani said he never saw racist signs. ''One of the reasons those police officers might have lost control is that we have a mayor who invites riots,'' he said at the time. The Giuliani campaign later conducted a ''vulnerability study'' to identify their candidate's weaknesses in 1993. This study, obtained by Wayne Barrett, author of ''Rudy!'' -- an investigative biography -- offers an unsparing critique: ''Giuliani's shrieking performance at the cop rally may be his greatest political liability this year. Giuliani has yet to admonish those who attacked the mayor with racist code words on signs and banners. Why not?''
 Tough Approach on Crime
 Determined to assault the liberal trenches, Mr. Giuliani never blanched at giving offense. He lopped the welfare rolls by 500,000, laid off thousands of black political appointees seen as too liberal and hired hundreds of more conservative whites seen as loyal to his political agenda. And he sent two schools chancellors -- one black, one Hispanic -- spinning out of town.
 In 1995, he proposed cutting welfare benefits, and suggested that many of the poor might profitably leave town. ''A natural consequence of a reduction in benefits might very well be that that would happen,'' Mr. Giuliani said, adding, ''That would be a good thing.'' 
 Mr. Giuliani has written in his book ''Leadership'' about his belief in the cleansing power of confrontational words. Nor is he enamored of compromise. Asked in 2000 about reaching out to black leaders, he shook his head and said, ''What happens when you engage in the dialogue is, you compromise.''
 Yet at first, he made inroads into the black community. He endorsed Democratic Gov. Mario M. Cuomo in 1994, which won him applause in black churches. He tackled the sensitive business of removing from 125th Street, Harlem's shopping strip, the street peddlers who drove many black merchants to distraction.
 Izak-El M. Pasha, the imam of the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque, ignored other black leaders and helped the mayor with the peddlers.
 ''Church leaders tried to tell me 'Man, you can't be meeting with Giuliani!' '' said Mr. Pasha, who struck up a friendship with the mayor. ''I didn't care. If you're not willing to accept he has a strong personality, you have a problem.''
 A record plunge in homicides earned the mayor a larger measure of good will. Black New Yorkers appreciated safer neighborhoods and applauded that thousands more of their young men remained alive.
 ''Rudy's gift is that he could identify with people who felt trapped by crime,'' Mr. Meyers said.
 By 1997, Mr. Giuliani's job approval rating in the black community stood at 42 percent, according to a New York Times poll.
 But within these victories lay the seed of a problem. Even as crime dropped by 60 percent, officers with the street crime unit stopped and frisked 16 black males for every one who was arrested, according to a report by the state attorney general. Then came three terrible episodes that raised a pointed question for black New Yorkers: Was crime reduction worth any cost? 
 One hot night in August 1997, police officers grabbed Abner Louima, a black security guard, during a tussle in Flatbush. Mr. Louima exited a precinct house bleeding after officers jammed a broken broomstick into his rectum and his mouth.
 Mr. Giuliani, who was running for re-election, was eloquent in his disgust. ''These charges are shocking to any decent human being,'' he said.
 He created a task force to examine police-community relations, and invited adversaries to join. But Mr. Giuliani swamped his Democratic opponent that November. When his task force released a report the next March, Mr. Giuliani belittled its findings as ''making very little sense.''
 He endorsed just one suggestion, to change a deputy commissioner's title. ''We can change it from 'affairs' to 'relations,' '' Mr. Giuliani said.
 Two police shootings of unarmed black men followed, one death upon another. In February 1999, the police fired 41 bullets at Amadou Diallo, an African immigrant. They said they thought he was reaching for a gun; he was trying to pull out his wallet. A year later, an undercover officer sidled up to Patrick Dorismond, an off-duty security guard, and asked to buy marijuana. Mr. Dorismond took offense; punches flew. Another undercover officer shot him.
 Mayor Giuliani released the dead man's juvenile arrest record. Mr. Dorismond, he said, was no ''altar boy.'' In fact, he had been an altar boy at a Brooklyn church.
 There were marches and a civil disobedience campaign -- Mr. Dinkins and Representative Charles B. Rangel were arrested. Mr. Powers, the mayor's friend, said Mr. Giuliani fell victim to racial provocateurs and an amnesiac city. ''A lot of the people in the minority community forgot all the good he did in lowering crime,'' he said. ''Rudy got demonized.''
 With the city perched on edge, the mayor asked to meet with the Rev. Johnny Ray Youngblood of St. Paul Community Baptist Church. Once they had talked often; Mr. Youngblood, who is black, accompanied Mr. Giuliani on those long-ago trips to Bushwick apartments. But Mr. Giuliani had not taken his calls in years.
 Mr. Youngblood is a leader in East Brooklyn Congregations, an organizing group that prides itself on a cool-eyed view of power. Unhappy with Mr. Giuliani but willing to talk, a half-dozen ministers trooped to City Hall, where they found an angry but chastened mayor. 
 ''We said: 'We don't do photo ops,' '' Mr. Youngblood recalled. '' 'You must apologize to the Dorismond family.' ''
 Mr. Giuliani turned sharply. 
 ''You don't understand,'' two ministers recall Mr. Giuliani saying. ''I have to visit the families of police officers whoare shot.''
 A minister replied: ''Yes, Mr. Mayor, but we have to funeralize the people they shoot. You are not alone, O.K.?'' 
 Mr. Giuliani later expressed regret without precisely apologizing. His approval rating among blacks had fallen to 7 percent by April 2000, according to a New York Times/CBS News poll. 
 A Damaged Agenda
 The question lingers in conversation with black officials: Did Mr. Giuliani have a black problem, or did blacks just not get him? 
 He dueled with no end of white officials. Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a fellow Republican? He's ''running a protection racket.'' Gov. George E. Pataki? ''Needs his head examined.'' The Manhattan borough president, Ruth W. Messinger? She has ''really jerky'' ideas.
 But Ms. Reiter, the former deputy mayor, said a mayor could not assume words register the same for every group. ''One city, one standard is fine but unrealistic,'' she said. ''There are groups, for reasons of history, treated differently, and it happens every day.'' Ignore that, she says, and a leader risks tone-deafness.
 In the summer of 1999, Mr. Giuliani attended an Urban League fund-raiser at the Sheraton in Manhattan. He strode through the ballroom as though leaning into a strong wind. 
 ''I want to apologize for leaving early,'' he said. ''It's very, very hard for me to get a cab.'' The ballroom fell silent. Then he went fishing for laughs, and found none. ''You think I'm kidding? Have you ever tried to hail a cab in New York?'' 
 He seemed unaware that many in this audience knew perfectly well what it was to hail a taxi that would not stop. 
 The city did not boil over on Mr. Giuliani's watch; neither did it unite behind him.
 But Mr. Sharpton, whose hand was behind most anti-Giuliani demonstrations, boycotts and attempted embarrassments, said Mr. Giuliani damaged his own agenda by failing to cultivate black allies. 
 ''Rudy wanted to send a message that he wasn't going to talk with the bad guys,'' he said, referring to himself. ''Well, guess what? The good guys couldn't emerge because he wouldn't talk to them either.''
 Save for immigration, Mr. Giuliani rarely fields questions about race on the campaign trail. Republican voters, who are overwhelmingly white, have clamored to hear about 9/11 and terror; a few of Mr. Giuliani's supporters discuss Mr. Sharpton, mainly as a punch line.
 But in a general election, Mr. Giuliani might have to answer questions about his ability to work with black leaders. ''His old racial rhetoric could turn off suburban voters,'' notes Henry Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant. 
 Mr. Giuliani asserts that black people are not mysterious to him, even if they find him a puzzle.
 ''In the case of the African-American community, I understand it really well,'' he told a black editorial writer at The Daily News in 1999. ''There's no point trying to educate people that I'm not a racist any more than I'm not a criminal.''
 If people can't figure me out, he added, ''that's their problem.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday about the racial politics of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the Republican presidential candidate, during his tenure as mayor of New York referred incorrectly in some copies to the object that white police officers used to sodomize a black man, Abner Louima, in a station house bathroom in 1997. It was a broomstick, not a toilet plunger. The article also gave an incorrect spelling at one point for the surname of a historian at Cooper Union who said Mr. Giuliani believed that crime was ''about behavior, not race.'' He is Fred Siegel, not Siegal. The article also referred incorrectly in some copies to Mr. Giuliani's approval rating of 7 percent among blacks after the shooting death of Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed black security guard killed by the police. That statistic was recorded in April 2000, not at year's end.

HEADLINE: Debut More About Money Than Payoff

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Carson, Calif. 

 BODY:
 Yes, gentle reader, I am under no commercial restraints and can freely reveal to you that the other British import, David Beckham, did indeed play the last 12-plus minutes last night and that nobody died. Beckham's gimpy ankle even survived a crushing tackle by the evil Lord Spoilsport, otherwise known as Steve Sidwell, a late Chelsea sub.
 In his debut as the man who brought Posh Spice to America, Beckham skipped around after entering in the 78th minute and even took a game-ending corner kick that seemed to have been ordered up in the game room of Major League Soccer. The Los Angeles Galaxy lost to the perennial English power by a 1-0 score on John Terry's close-range goal in the 49th minute. 
 ''It was nice to be out there with the lads,'' said Beckham, who admitted he was drained by the past 10 emotional days. He also praised the effort by his teammates who had been ridiculed as a pub team in a loss earlier in the week.
 It took that one aching ankle to demonstrate what a healthy economy we have here in North America. Great batches of money were already in the till from all those sold tickets and all those sold Beckham 23 jerseys, before the great one even touched the ball in the 80th minute. 
 Master Beckham made his jog onto the field to justify all those television cameras trucked in just for the occasion of his debut, but also to satisfy the competitive urges of a world-class athlete. 
 His inconvenient sprained ankle -- sustained late in the season with England and Real Madrid -- seemed to indicate what a dicey business it is to sign any athlete, since they have a tendency to get hurt. 
 In a way, though, it didn't matter, since people from Southern California to Toronto had already bought Beckham gear, lured by the whiff of some presumed glamour beyond talent, the same way Americans seem besotted by Paris Hilton perhaps, or Donald Trump. We don't know exactly what they produce, but it sounds exciting. 
 In Beckham's case, he has come to the New World to demonstrate certain ball-thumping skills. He never was a Pele, a Maradona, a Baggio, a Zidane, a Ronaldinho, etc. etc., but he has been a very good player, rejuvenated this past spring at the age of 32. 
 Spending at least $32.5 million over five years on Beckham is not that much of an economic gamble, given the discretionary cash that people have already spent, but is his singular talent enough to transform Major League Soccer and the downtrodden Galaxy?
 In its first 11 seasons, the league had already imported a few aging stars, including Roberto Donadoni, in the early days of the MetroStars, a team so bad that its name was mercifully changed to the Red Bulls under new ownership. Donadoni was not much of a gate attraction in the swamplands of New Jersey, but he was an Italian World Cup regular.
 The selfless Donadoni used to receive the ball in the middle of what passed for the MetroStars' offense. He would look left and hesitate at the wretched options on that side. Then he would look right and deliberate what calamity might occur if he swung the ball over in that direction. By that time the moment had passed. Donadoni went back to Italy and is now the national team coach; there is presumably a moral to that story. 
 The same thing happened with glorious elders like Lothar Matthaus of Germany and Youri Djorkaeff of France, a couple of World Cup winners who came to New York, and transformed nothing. Jurgen Klinsmann, who lives out here, wisely resisted the temptation to play here, ultimately guiding Germany to a third-place finish in last year's World Cup. 
 Beckham may very well have watched the Galaxy offense mill around last night and wondered, ''To whom exactly am I supposed to give the ball?'' Landon Donovan, the previous highest-paid Galaxy star, made one move in each half but otherwise drifted around like a human screensaver. 
 In the weeks or years to come, Beckham may actually connect with a rocket or two from a free kick, when the ball is dead and everybody is watching the bloke with the golden hair and the Jordanian number on his jersey. 
 Beckham was also a brilliant passer with a live ball, when he had folks named Yorke and Giggs and van Nistelrooy up front for Manchester United. He could put the ball near the net, and they would meet up with it like seltzer meeting chocolate syrup.
 Ah, soccer alchemy. The old Cosmos had it because they had achieved critical mass with elders at virtually every position. Those days are not coming back any time soon. 
 M.L.S. was tottering along nicely with a low-budget plan, but maybe the ticket money and the jersey money will bring in a striker who knows what to do with a Beckham parabola.

HEADLINE: Letters Dissenting Opinion

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 One can agree or disagree with the criticism of Clarence Thomas both in Orlando Peterson's review of ''Supreme Discomfort'' (June 17) and in the book itself. However, as a resident of Savannah, I object to the disservice done to the low-income but quite safe and respectable community of Pin Point, Ga., by calling it ''a scene of rural desolation,'' ''black life in the rural South at its bleakest'' and ''this sociological nightmare.'' By the way, the crab factory is long gone, but it provided a living for some when few other opportunities were available. The owner kept it operating as long as possible for the sake of the employees, but eventually succumbed to economics. I am sure the good citizens of Pin Point feel fortunate in comparison with residents of the ghettos of large cities, especially in the North.

HEADLINE: Brazil's Objections Slow Chavez's Plan for Regional Bank

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Alexei Barrionuevo contributed reporting from Rio de Janeiro.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela, July 21 

 BODY:
President Hugo Chavez's efforts to curb the influence of the United States in the developing world range from creating a leftist television network for Latin America to selling cheap oil to his allies, but few of his projects were begun as enthusiastically as the Bank of the South. 
 Now the fervor surrounding the Bank of the South, a project heralded here as a regional financing alternative to Washington-based institutions like the World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank, has cooled as Brazil seeks to diminish the new bank's clout. 
 Ahead of a meeting in Rio de Janeiro set for August, at which the bank's creation is expected to be formally announced, Venezuela and Brazil have diverged on its base of operations, size, startup capital and mission, according to people briefed on the negotiations.
 The diverging views of the project point to contrasts between Brazil's president, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, a longtime socialist who embraced market-friendly policies once in power in Latin America's largest country, and Mr. Chavez, who favors a more assertive role for Venezuela's government in guiding economic policy here and elsewhere in the region. 
 Some sectors in Brazil are chafing at Mr. Chavez's ambitions to lead integration efforts. At the same time, tension persists over a spat between Mr. Chavez and Brazil's Senate over Venezuela's pushing a critical television network off its public airwaves -- a move many in Brasilia saw as stifling dissent -- and Mr. Chavez's recent criticism of the use of food crops to produce automotive fuels, a cornerstone of Brazil's economy.
 ''Brazil has demonstrated its conservatism in relation to Venezuela's thinking,'' said Vince McElhinny, a Latin America analyst at the Bank Information Center, a Washington group that tracks development banks. ''A project that began with enthusiasm over egalitarian principles is dealing with Brazil's decisiveness in trying to limit its scope.''
 Venezuelan officials, who want the Bank of the South to be based in Caracas, have had to deal with Brazilian proposals to have it function from a smaller South American capital like Montevideo, Uruguay, or Asuncion, Paraguay. Also, earlier Venezuelan ambitions for the bank to start operations with $7 billion in capital have been countered by Brazil's more modest suggestion of $3 billion.
 Discussions around forming the bank have also focused on how many technical employees each country can nominate, whether financing should come from each country's foreign currency reserves and how transparent the bank's lending policies should be.
 In addition, Brazil would prefer to limit membership to South American countries, while Venezuela wants to include Central America and the Caribbean, which would allow staunch Chavez allies like Nicaragua and Cuba to become shareholders.
 ''We want the bank to be tied to Unasur,'' Marco Aurelio Garcia, the international affairs adviser to Brazil's president, said in a telephone interview, referring to a fledgling intergovernmental union whose structure has yet to be determined. ''The negotiations involve the question of pace.''
 Some governments, especially in pro-Chavez countries like Bolivia and Ecuador, see the Bank of the South as a way to dilute the influence of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund. Those institutions, with close political and economic ties to the United States, tried over recent decades to force developing Latin American economies to adopt free-market capitalism and curtail social spending. 
 But while some economies stabilized, anger was widespread over what was broadly seen as outside interference that enriched foreign companies. That groundswell helped sweep left-leaning leaders like Mr. Chavez into power. 
 The new conflict between Brazil and Venezuela over the bank is just one level of its obstacles. There are also critics of Mr. Chavez who note that Latin America already has native development banks that are flourishing. One is the Corporacion Andina de Fomento, based in Caracas and created here in the 1970s. It has grown beyond its original focus on Andean countries, adding as shareholders Brazil and Spain and more than a dozen private banks in the region. Another is BNDES, the Brazilian development bank, whose lending already dwarfs that of the Inter-American Development Bank.
 ''There's the concern that this project will be a sham if its lending policies are driven by politics and personal loyalty, particularly when there are institutions indigenous to the region that are functioning well,'' said Michael Shifter, vice president for policy at the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, a research group focusing on Latin America. 
 Despite surging trade between Venezuela and Brazil, with some of Brazil's largest construction companies winning lucrative infrastructure contracts here in recent years, there are also signs that Mr. Chavez may be growing impatient with his largest neighbor's relatively conservative bent.
 For instance, he skipped the meeting last month of Mercosur, the regional trade alliance Venezuela has applied to join, instead visiting Belarus, Iran and Russia, countries where he was received warmly and with scant criticism of his policies toward the news media and political opponents.
 Supporters of Mr. Chavez's concept for the Bank of South, viewed as part of a project that includes plans for a regional stabilization fund to function as an alternative to the I.M.F., remain optimistic that the institution will materialize.
 ''The process of European integration took 50 years,'' said Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, who added that Mr. da Silva could still endorse the project in an effort to ease tension with Mr. Chavez, as he has done in past rows.
 Pointing to Venezuela's recent role in providing an alternative source to countries like Argentina and Bolivia, thus loosening the I.M.F.'s influence in Latin America, Mr. Weisbrot said ''permanent structural changes'' in the region's economy were under way that would be deepened by the Bank of the South's formation.
 That view, of course, contrasts with how some in Brazil see the project. ''Having a pocketful of money, Chavez thought he could create an institution that could be a supplier of certain long-term projects,'' said Roberto Teixeira da Costa, who serves on the board of the private equity arm of Brazil's development bank. ''Everyone knows that he is pushing this, and not everyone wants to help him.''

HEADLINE: A Day in the Sun for Mr. Cord's Classics

BYLINE: By ROB SASS

 BODY:
THE Great Depression hit the United States auto industry like the comet that wiped out the dinosaurs. Production fell to just 1.1 million in 1933, from 4.5 million in 1929, leading to the mass extinction of automobile marques.
The weak and the undercapitalized were the first to succumb, but eventually the Depression would claim nearly half of the 40 or so American automakers that existed before 1929. By the summer of 1937, the grim reaper had come for the Indiana-based automotive empire assembled by the industrialist E. L. Cord. 
 Mr. Cord's empire, consisting of the Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg (A-C-D) marques, is mostly remembered by the dwindling World War II generation and by connoisseurs of prewar classics who mark the demise of Duesenberg as the moment the American auto industry began its long slide to also-ran status.
 Next month, Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg will be featured marques at the Pebble Beach Concours d' Elegance in California, and the 70th anniversary of their demise will be marked at the annual A-C-D festival in Auburn, Ind. 
 Coincidentally, the A-C-D companies died in alphabetical order. Auburn was the first to go, in 1936, victim of the Depression, undercapitalization and bad management. In today's terms, Auburn would be known as a near-luxury brand. It shared a stylist, Alan Leamy, with the ultraluxury Duesenberg, and Auburns mimicked some of the Duesenberg's styling cues, much the way a Jaguar XK8 resembles an Aston Martin. 
 At the start of the Depression, Auburn looked as though it would be one of the survivors. Mr. Cord had bought the bankrupt Auburn company in 1924 and turned it around. In 1931, the second full year of the Depression, Auburn had its best year with more than 33,000 cars sold.
 But, according to Jon M. Bill, director of education and archives at the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Museum in Auburn, Ind., Mr. Cord was fond of saying that ''a conquered challenge is no longer fun.'' After 1931, he left the management of Auburn to far less capable managers. 
 There were numerous turf battles, and in spite of the introduction of the 851/852 Boattail Speedster, sales evaporated. By 1934, Auburn sales had shrunk to just 4,400 cars. The company decided to stop production in 1934 at the Auburn plant. By 1936, the Connersville, Ind. plant where Auburn and Cord production had been consolidated was producing only Cords. This final home of the Auburn and Cord automobiles has since been razed, but the lovely Art Deco Auburn administration building and showroom survives as one of the country's finest automotive museums, the Auburn-Cord-Duesenberg Museum. 
 In the 1930s, Cord occupied a position similar to that of BMW today. Cords were well-built and had a reputation as a driver's car. Stylish, brimming with technology and rather expensive at around $2,500, they were more costly than a contemporary Cadillac. Of the three A-C-D marques, Cord arguably had the best chance of survival because it had a truly revolutionary product, the 1936 Model 810. 
 The Cord 810 was the brainchild of the designer Gordon Buehrig. The 810 was like nothing else produced before the war. When most cars sat high up enough to require running boards to step in, the 810 was low and dispensed with this holdover from the buckboard days. 
 The Cord 810 also did not have the Parthenonlike stand-up grille shells of its contemporaries, featuring a coffin nose with wrap-around vents for cooling as well as the first use of retractable headlamps in a production car. The engineering piece de resistance, however, was the front-wheel-drive system that put the engine behind the transmission. Front-wheel-drive would not be seen again on a mass-produced American car until the striking 1966 Oldsmobile Toronado.
 The 810 caused a sensation at the 1935 Los Angeles auto show. But lovely as it was, it was rushed to market and was underdeveloped. Early models had problems with the preselector transmissions, vapor lock and on convertibles, bodies that flexed terribly. 
 Under normal circumstances, these would have been quickly corrected. But there was little development money left, and Cord designers and engineers (including Mr. Buehrig) had begun to leave. When word began to circulate about the 810's problems, Cord's death spiral accelerated. Its dealer base, which by 1936 had dwindled to a little more than 400, shrank further. And even though production of the 810/812 was fewer than 3,000 units, the remaining dealers were developing a surplus of cars. The factory's solution seems unthinkable today -- about 150 leftover 1936 Model 810s were simply renamed and became 1937 Model 812s. 
 There was one final misstep for Cord. National unemployment shrank from 20.1 percent in 1935 to 16.9 percent in 1936, so Cord decided the time was ripe to go upmarket with a car for the emerging less-impoverished class. However, in 1937, the nation entered a recession and, predictably, these Custom Series Cords failed. By August 1937, Mr. Cord had sold his stock and moved to California. 
 Strange things happened after Cord production ended in August 1937, especially regarding the fate of the Cord 810/812 body dies. The tooling to produce the car was sold as part of the liquidation of the manufacturing arm of the Auburn-Cord company. Huppmobile, yet another moribund automaker, purchased it and reintroduced the 810 -- minus the front-wheel drive and retractable headlights -- as the Hupp Skylark and the Graham Hollywood. It was a short-lived enterprise as the Depression claimed Huppmobile and Graham. 
 There was never any ambiguity about the position occupied by Duesenberg. Duesenbergs were the cars of America's new money royalty -- entrepreneurs, industrialists and movie stars like Clark Gable and Gary Cooper. It was the Maybach or Rolls-Royce Phantom of its day. But unlike today's Maybach or Rolls-Royce, every customer did not have to settle for the same graceless body. 
 Typically, a customer would purchase a bare chassis and engine with radiator shell and fenders for about $10,000. Then, coachbuilders and interior trimmers would complete the cars to the owner's specifications. Finished, a Duesenberg could cost more than $20,000 -- quite a statement at a time when per capita income was less than $1,000 a year.
 Comparing the supercharged Model J Duesenberg with other prewar automobiles was pointless. With 320 horsepower and a top speed of nearly 140 miles an hour, other American cars would not eclipse its performance until the muscle car era of the 1960s.
 According to Mr. Bill, the museum director, the original plan was to produce 500 Model J's. Only 481 were actually built, and by the end of the run, the design was getting dated. Production, which was in Indianapolis, gradually faded out during 1937. The last Model J chassis was not mated with a body until 1940. This final Duesenberg recently sold at a collector auction for $2.8 million. 
 At least the Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg went out on top. Rather than exiting the stage like Packard and Hudson a generation later in unsympathetic hands and with last gasps unworthy of their names, the final models from Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg were uniformly magnificent. They will always be remembered at their best. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 29, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on the Collecting page last Sunday about the final years of Auburn, Cord and Duesenberg referred incorrectly to the use of the tooling for the Cord 810 and 812 after those cars ceased production. The Hupp Motor Car Corporation, which bought the tooling, agreed to let another automaker, Graham-Paige, use it for a car called the Graham Hollywood; Hupp did not introduce the Hollywood. (Hupp did sell a similar car called the Skylark, which was manufactured by Graham-Paige.) In addition, the article misspelled the name of the car line that sold the Skylark. It was Hupmobile, not Huppmobile.

HEADLINE: The C.E.O., Off the Pedestal

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
CORPORATE capitalism is in grave danger, and the threat does not come from without: state-run communism is all but extinct, with the notable exceptions of North Korea, Cuba and China-in-transition. Instead, it is the corporation itself -- the institution that rose up to dominate the world economy in the 20th century -- that threatens to cause its own demise in the 21st.
 That is the warning issued by Alan Murray in ''Revolt in the Boardroom: The New Rules of Power in Corporate America'' (HarperCollins, $25.95). Mr. Murray, an assistant managing editor and columnist at The Wall Street Journal, says public corporations are ''in the midst of radical change,'' prompted by a revolt against the once-unchallenged dominance of chief executives. 
 ''The media still portrays the chief executive as the center of the corporate universe,'' Mr. Murray writes. ''In fact, the C.E.O. has been greatly diminished and now shares power with an array of others -- boards of directors, regulators, pension fund managers, hedge fund managers, accountants, lawyers, nongovernmental organizations -- all of whom are eager to have their say in the corporation's affairs.'' 
 He makes note of a ''remarkable string'' of C.E.O. departures since 2004. The fallen mighty include Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard, Maurice R. Greenberg of the American International Group, Jeffrey W. Greenberg of Marsh & McLennan, Harry C. Stonecipher of Boeing, Raymond V. Gilmartin of Merck and Hank McKinnell of Pfizer.
 The reasons differed -- from an affair with an executive in Mr. Stonecipher's case to the Vioxx fiasco in Mr. Gilmartin's -- but in each the departure was a sign that the board was no longer willing to turn a blind eye to a chief's failings, whether fiscal, managerial or personal. Mr. Murray cites statistics showing that the above half-dozen C.E.O.'s are part of a pervasive trend. 
 A study by Burson-Marsteller found that C.E.O. turnover in 2005 was up 126 percent from 2000. A survey by Booz Allen Hamilton found that 35 percent of North American chief executives who left their jobs in 2005 were forced out, versus 12 percent in 1995.
 Mr. Murray says the revolt against chief executives was prompted by the bursting of the high-tech stock market bubble, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the accounting scandals at Enron, WorldCom and Tyco. 
 During that time, Mr. Murray was host of ''Capital Report,'' a nightly television program on CNBC, ''and the e-mail from viewers each night overflowed with contempt for their onetime business heroes,'' Mr. Murray recalls.
 ''They felt betrayed,'' he added, ''both by the disappearance of their own stock market wealth, and the almost-daily reports of perfidy by executives.''
 As investors became outraged, corporate directors revolted, and they were prompted by personal considerations -- specifically, the realization that they could be held personally liable for misdeeds of C.E.O.'s. ''Directors were being forced to wake up,'' Mr. Murray says, '' and to recognize that board membership wasn't just a cushy honor -- it was a heavy responsibility.''
 According to Mr. Murray, this seemingly sudden corporate crisis had deep historical roots. In 1932, in a landmark book called ''The Modern Corporation and Private Property,'' Adolf Berle and Gardiner Means described how corporations had ceded control of their vast pools of wealth to hired managers whose interests often diverged from those of the shareholders, who theoretically own the corporations. 
 This separation of ownership and control was reinforced in favor of the hired managers at a vast majority of corporations as the chief executive assumed the title of chairman. ''While the C.E.O. technically reported to the board, the board, in the case of most American companies, was chaired by the chief executive -- creating an odd, circular structure of accountability,'' Mr. Murray observes.
 He says that successful executives in the 21st century act less like autocrats and more like populist politicians answering to diverse constituencies. In that context, he offers thumbnail profiles of a ''new power elite'' that includes a union executive like Richard Ferlauto of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees; Patricia Daly, a nun who represents her religious order at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, and the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman, who brought about a change in McDonald's management strategy.
 ''Revolt in the Boardroom'' raises -- but fails to answer -- a burning question: whether the revolt against the C.E.O.-centric corporation will become a true revolution. According to Mr. Murray, ''the evidence is mixed.''
 He says that outrage over excessive pay to C.E.O.'s, particularly those who fail, is surging among the middle class. ''Median wages have stagnated over the last two decades, even as wealth at the top has accumulated, testing Americans' traditional tolerance for an unequal distribution of riches, '' he says, adding, ''The attack on C.E.O.'s could be the leading edge of a much bigger and broader middle-class revolt that is only now rearing its head.'' 
 One recent response to the furor has been a flight to private equity, to avoid the reporting requirements demanded by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. But this cannot be a long-term solution: after all, to whom can private equity firms ultimately sell their assets if not to public companies? 
 Then there is the view that the boards of public companies can be unwieldy and ineffective. Mr. Murray quotes Mr. Greenberg's assertion that ''boards can't run companies.'' 
 Mr. Murray's recounting of Hewlett-Packard's experience after the overthrow of Ms. Fiorina supports the Greenberg view. Upon becoming non-executive chairwoman of the board, Patricia C. Dunn sparked yet another crisis by authorizing an investigation that led to spying on directors. 
 Mr. Murray notes that after Ms. Dunn resigned, Mark V. Hurd, the chief executive, was given the additional title of chairman, ''ending H.P.'s experiment with a new governance structure.''
 WHAT will ultimately happen to the modern corporation? ''Optimists see a more responsive, more democratic, more socially responsible institution emerging from the upheaval,'' Mr. Murray writes. ''Pessimists fear that the very same ills that plague modern-day politics -- polarization, divisiveness and stalemate -- may come to hobble corporations.'' 
 In the end, though he presents a wide-ranging view of the issues, we are left with a cliched observation that ''much is at stake.''
 Although he is a professional commentator, he is maddeningly reluctant to offer his opinion on what changes corporations ought to make in order to endure as viable institutions.

HEADLINE: Cut-and-Paste History

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
MORE than any other genre or medium, photomontage was the pre-eminent symbol of Modernity in the 1920s and '30s, according to Matthew S. Witkovsky, the curator of ''Foto: Modernity in Central Europe, 1918-1945'' at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. ''It was the ultimate symbol in the play between the singular artist and mass media that defines the times, in terms of photography,'' he explained. 
Using newspapers, magazines, advertising and books, artists in Austria, Czechoslovakia, Germany, Hungary and Poland turned to cutting and pasting to forge an art that helped explain the crumbling of Central Europe's four great empires and the new society that was evolving after the devastation of World War I.
 Few wielded scissors more effectively than the German artist Marianne Brandt (1893-1983). ''Brandt is a technological genius with photomontage,'' Mr. Witkovsky said. 
 In 1923 she enrolled in the Bauhaus, where she studied under the great Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. His ideal for a photomontage composition was one of unity, legibility and ''organic super-reality.'' He especially liked blank space and narrative clarity, characteristics that Brandt, who ran the Bauhaus metal shop and produced some of the movement's best-known designs, applied to nearly 50 known photomontages that she assembled in her spare time but never exhibited.
 In 1926 she moved to Paris for a nine-month sabbatical and immersed herself in photomontage. She returned to the metal workshop, but she left in 1929 for design work in Berlin. 
 In 1933 she moved to her parents' home in Chemnitz and fell into obscurity. Her work enjoyed a slight revival in the 1960s and '70s, but her ''glory years were unfortunately in a brief moment of time,'' Mr. Witkovsky said.
 While Brandt's early photomontages depicted somewhat private dramas, her later ones tended toward a more critical commentary on politics and the public welfare. In one of her last photomontages, an untitled work from around 1930, she muses on Germany's growing embrace of Naziism and Hitler's designs on the Rhineland through a wry juxtaposition of cinematic and apocalyptic images. 
 ''Brandt's 'Untitled' invests this turbulent history with Dickensian pathos, keeping the viewer at a safe remove while tugging at his heartstrings: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times,'' Mr. Witkovsky writes in the exhibition catalog. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

GRAPHIC: Photo: NEW YORK SKYLINE ''These are undoubtedly from a movie magazine,'' he said. ''It's an incredible thing, formally, because this work is quite large -- 65 by 50 centimeters -- and yet she has cut out this thing in one large piece. Look at how she cuts around the plumes of smoke.'' Both skylines include the Woolworth Building.
ESCAPE ARTIST The Houdini-like figure suggests a story of entrapment and escape. ''He's an escape artist, and he is managing to walk away from the conflagration,'' Mr. Witkovsky said. ''Look at his shoe. Brandt has cut a shadow that gives a 3-D sense of him lifting out of the piece.''
10-PFENNIG COIN Mr. Witkovsky said: ''This work is a mix of German apocalypse and U.S. apocalypse
1930 is the first year of the Great Depression, and the 10-pfennig coin is the symbol of bankruptcy and inflation.''
ZEPPELINS The Zeppelins and the fighter planes crossing a dangerously tilted sky suggest the clandestine German rearmament campaign, pursued in violation of the Versailles peace accords yet with some public support.
MAN WITH CIGARETTE ''This is a picture by Paul Wolff, who was the most talented salesman of the Leica camera,'' Mr. Witkovsky said of this image, titled ''First Puff on a Cigarette.'' ''Paul Wolff was also a Nazi, and he took great propaganda pictures, although he never joined the party. The first puff on a cigarette becomes the puff that ignites the whole world.''
YOUNG woman ''She may be Jewish, she may be Romany, she may be Gypsy -- we don't know,'' Mr. Witkovsky said. ''And yet she's smiling like Marlene Dietrich, almost exuberant amid scenes of utter disaster'' -- perhaps expectant that she will survive.
MOTORCYCLIST ''The motorcyclist is probably a policeman,'' he said. ''He does have what appears to be a uniform on, but not a military uniform.''
 MARLENE DIETRICH On April 1, 1930, the Dietrich film ''The Blue Angel'' had its premiere, making her an international film star. The next day she set sail for the United States. ''She was invited personally by Joseph Goebbels time and again to come back and entertain the German troops, and she always refused,'' Mr. Witkovsky said. ''The scene of this goodbye is: 'I'm leaving Germany. Germany is going under.' ''

POP!
 Why Bubbles Are Great for the Economy.
 By Daniel Gross.
 232 pp. Collins/HarperCollins Publishers.
 $22.95.
Every cloud has a silver lining. It's an ill wind that blows no good. The bigger the bubble, the more useful soapsuds it leaves behind when it bursts.
 That, more or less, is the thesis of Daniel Gross's frothy book ''Pop!'' Contrary to conventional wisdom of a few years back, he argues, the mad rush to invest in Internet companies, whether dot-coms or telecom providers, wasn't altogether bad. All that crazy investment led to the cheap servers and broadband connections that let us enjoy services like Google, MySpace and YouTube today. 
 ''The tales of short-term woe experienced by bubble-burned investors, who constitute a minority of the population, frequently overlook the substantial long-term benefits that accrue to everyone, and to the economy at large, in the years after,'' writes Gross, a business columnist for Newsweek and Slate and a frequent contributor to The New York Times Sunday Business section.
 His book is a romp through a series of American bubbles, beginning with the telegraph boom of the 1840s. Samuel Morse wanted the federal government to take charge of building a national telegraph system. But after financing a demonstration line from Washington to Baltimore, Congress declined to go further. In 1845, Morse and his partners leased back the original line and went after local investors to patch together a national system. Holders of competing telegraph patents set out to construct their own systems.
 ''Within a matter of months, the nation was seized by telegraph fever,'' Gross writes. ''And not for the first time, an exciting new technology attracted some entrepreneurs who were, well, a little nuts. Manic, undeterred by failure, heedless of practicalities, eager to spend other people's money, armed with unrealistic forecasts, they threw up wires on poles the way kids spray Silly String at birthday parties, fell flat on their face and built again.'' (Gross's exuberant style often leads to mixed metaphors.)
 Investors lost gobs of money, but the United States soon had the world's most extensive telegraph system: more than 23,000 miles by 1852, with an additional 10,000 under construction, compared with just 750 miles in France. Rate wars drove down prices, spurring new telegraph-dependent businesses, including brokerage houses and The Associated Press. Western Union eventually consolidated most of the independent telegraph providers, building a profitable, long-lived enterprise from other people's losses.
 If the telegraph was like the Internet, Gross suggests, the railroads were even more so. There, ''the blowout came in the 1880s, a decade in which the United States enjoyed a long economic expansion and elected as president a Democratic governor around whom sexual rumors swirled,'' he writes. It was ''like the fiber-optic boom, except with handlebar mustaches.'' Like cheap broadband, excess railroad capacity lost money for investors but spurred economic growth. ''The entire population grew richer as a result of the enormously powerful new commercial and consumer platform built over the iron rails,'' Gross declares. 
 It's all plausible, but what's the counterfactual? What would have happened without the railroads? Suppose Congress hadn't made the massive land grants that subsidized rapid railroad expansion. Or suppose investors hadn't been so taken with the new technology. Would America not have enjoyed its 19th-century growth spurt?
 The economic historian Robert Fogel asked that question in his 1964 classic ''Railroads and American Economic Growth.'' Gross quotes Fogel in his text and cites the book in his extensive bibliography. But he completely ignores both Fogel's empirical conclusions and his intellectual agenda.
 ''To establish the proposition that railroads substantially altered the course of economic growth,'' Fogel wrote, ''one must do more than provide information on the services of railroads. It must also be shown that substitutes for railroads could not (or would not) have performed essentially the same role.'' Growth required ''cheap inland transportation,'' he concluded, but canals and roads could have had the same effect. 
 Fogel, who won the 1993 Nobel in economic science, revolutionized economic history by posing counterfactuals and assembling data to statistically test the kinds of glib narratives that make up much of ''Pop!'' If Gross is going to quote Fogel, he owes it to his readers to address -- or at least present -- Fogel's arguments. 
 Amid the comic anachronisms and wise-guy smirking, Gross introduces some interesting ideas, notably that bubbles give the public a chance to develop the ''mental infrastructure'' needed to turn a new technology into viable new businesses and new ways of life. And he is surely right that bubbles are a small price to pay for the economic dynamism of America's entrepreneurial culture.
 But the book is deeply unsatisfying. Its good ideas are underdeveloped and its history often sloppy. As befits its title, ''Pop!'' is as airy as cappuccino foam. It tickles the intellectual palate but provides no real nourishment.

HEADLINE: A Plan for Luxury Elder Condos

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
SAYING that it is responding to a growing demand for lavish housing for older residents, North Street Community, a limited development partnership, plans to break ground here this fall on a $150 million project that will include 335 luxury condominiums on the 23-acre grounds of the former St. Agnes Hospital. 
The project, as approved by the City Council earlier this month, consists of studio, one- and two-bedroom condos selling for $400,000 to $900,000. The units are to be marketed to people 60 and over who want to maintain an ''upscale lifestyle'' in a setting offering many amenities of the sort that are found in hotels, said C. J. Follini, a managing partner in North Street Community. 
 ''The traditional retirement home -- the cold, institutional nursing-home model -- is not what older people will accept anymore,'' said Mr. Follini, who is also a managing partner of Noyack Medical Partners, a company that acquires, develops and manages health-care real estate. 
 In addition to building the condos, which will be in four new buildings, each four to six stories high, North Street Community will provide 92 assisted-living units and 20 beds for Alzheimer's patients in the 150,000-square-foot former hospital building. The hospital was owned by the Archdiocese of New York from 1988 until 2003, when it closed.
 A 72,000-square-foot medical services building on the grounds, acquired by the developer from New York Medical College, will continue as an office building for doctors and other medical providers, providing an additional convenience for residents of North Street Community, Mr. Follini said.
 Hotel-style amenities will include housekeeping services, a formal dining room, valet parking and concierge services. The fees for amenities -- like weekly house cleaning, linen service and meal plans -- have not yet been established. Residents will also have access to a 28,000-square-foot club building offering social activities, a wellness center with a whirlpool and a lap pool, and an exercise area.
 In addition, the complex will provide shuttle service during the day and evening to White Plains' fast-growing downtown business district, less than 10 minutes away.
 ''That is another difference,'' Mr. Follini said, observing that retirement homes in the past were often built on the cheapest land available, which meant they were usually in remote places and their residents were isolated. ''Now we're seeing such housing built closer to hubs, so that residents can easily get to the movies, the library and restaurants.''
 The project has taken two years to win City Council approval. While neighbors supported the idea of such a complex in principle, they opposed it as originally designed with seven stories, seeing that as too high for a residential neighborhood. They also feared that the developer's plans for 390 units would overwhelm the landscape.
 The reductions in height and density have satisfied those concerns, said Menelaos G. Rizoulis, a retired business executive and the leader of a residents' group in Wyndham Close, a 13-year-old development of town houses near the St. Agnes property. ''If it's done right, there's a lot of merit to using the old hospital like this,'' Mr. Rizoulis said.
 White Plains does not currently have this type of development for older residents, but demographic studies indicate that it is ripe for one. Three years from now, when the project is ready for occupancy, 15 percent of the White Plains' population will be 65 or older, according to city projections. By 2025, the number of residents over 65 will increase countywide by almost 44 percent, to 185,685, from 129,116 in 2005, according to projections by the Westchester County Department of Planning.
 Already, the demand in Westchester for retirement housing has outstripped supply, said Michael Bialek, senior vice president for real estate at the not-for-profit Beth Abraham Family of Health Services in the Bronx, a large provider of long-term care for the elderly. ''As you can see from the long waiting lists,'' he added, ''the need for this kind of product is very strong.'' 
 Existing options in the county include continuing-care communities like Kendal on Hudson, a 600,000-square-foot development for about 350 residents on the grounds of Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, and Westchester Meadows Life Care Retirement Community for 120 residents in Valhalla. In these developments, residents buy their apartments.
 Another facility, the Woodlands at Ardsley, offers 100 independent-living units in a five-story apartment building and, in a separate building, 50 assisted-living units and 25 units for Alzheimer's patients. All of its units are offered on a rental basis.
 On the surface, the physical models for North Street Community and the Woodlands resemble continuing-care complexes, Mr. Bialek said. ''They're look-alikes,'' he said, noting that in both cases, the housing is on a campus alongside assisted-living and Alzheimer's care facilities.
 But residents in continuing-care communities generally make a large up-front payment that guarantees them the full spectrum of care for the duration of their lives. By contrast, homeowners at North Street Community will buy their units and pay a common charge as they would in any condominium complex. Residents are not guaranteed placement in the assisted-living unit on the property at a later date, although they will be given first priority. 
 The construction will incorporate ''green'' building technologies in both the existing buildings and the new structures, according to Mitchell Levy, project manager at North Street Community for Perkins Eastman, the architecture firm designing the development.
 The plans, Mr. Levy explained, call for catching rainwater in a holding tank and recycling it for outdoor sprinkler systems and decorative water features. ''We're doing this instead of drawing city water for those purposes,'' Mr. Levy said. 
 The site was acquired by Noyack Equity Group for $21.4 million at a state-run auction of the St. Agnes Hospital property in December 2004. (The closing of the bankrupt 184-bed hospital had left the state with an outstanding debt that included $36 million in bonds.)
 At the auction, Noyack outbid six other groups, including 311 North Street Associates, an alliance of three prominent developers: the Simone Development Companies of New Rochelle, Fisher Brothers of Manhattan and the Pirro Group of White Plains. 
 North Street Community, whose principals were less widely known, was formed soon after the auction to develop the property. Besides Mr. Follini, the partnership consists of Andrew Greene, a White Plains lawyer and Mr. Follini's business partner; and three New York area residential developers: Alfred Caiola, Benny Caiola and Steve Rosenthal.

HEADLINE: Around the World, With Borderless Investing

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a financial writer at U.S. News & World Report. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THANKS to hot markets in Europe, Asia and Latin America -- as well as the surprisingly strong global economy -- the idea of investing abroad is no longer foreign to many investors. In fact, for the typical retirement plan investor, the stake in foreign equities has more than tripled over the past five years.
 But in addition to investing internationally, have you considered investing globally? There's a difference. 
 Since 2003, when foreign stocks came into vogue, the bulk of mutual fund investors used a foreign-only approach to buying them. In other words, investors who already had meaningful domestic exposure have been putting new money to work in separate portfolios dedicated to overseas stocks. And the two sides of their investment strategy -- the domestic portion and the foreign allocation -- generally operate independently.
 But with globalization upon us, some people wonder whether it's time to stop segmenting investment portfolios along regional lines.
 After all, with the exception of parts of Asia and the emerging markets, global stocks are moving much more in sync with domestic equities than they did a decade ago. ''As things have gotten more globally correlated, sectors have become almost more significant than regions,'' said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla.
 How would borderless investing work? Well, instead of putting some money into a domestic fund that seeks out the best energy, technology, health care and financial companies based in the United States, then investing in a separate fund that looks for the best stocks in those same sectors overseas, an individual investor might look to a globally oriented fund that scours the world for the best opportunities in each sector. 
 For instance, while a domestic fund manager might feel compelled to invest in General Motors or Ford Motor to gain exposure to the auto sector, the manager of a borderless fund ''might decide not to own any auto companies in the U.S. or in Europe -- just to own them in Japan,'' said Shigeki Makino, chief investment officer of the Putnam Global Equity fund.
 In theory, this approach allows fund managers to adhere to a very Warren Buffett-like principle: to concentrate your bets only in your top ideas, rather than watering them down through your second- and third-choice picks.
 There may be something to this approach. T. Rowe Price, the asset management firm, recently crunched some numbers and discovered that actively managed global funds earned a median annual return of 10.9 percent over the past decade, through April. That compares favorably with the 9.2 percent annualized gain you would have enjoyed in a divided portfolio consisting of 40 percent domestic stocks (represented by the Russell 3000 index of domestic shares) and 60 percent foreign stocks (as measured by the MSCI All Country World Index, excluding the United States). 
 The notion of borderless investing appears to be taking hold among institutional investors. Through the first half of this year, institutional funds placed $18.7 billion into globally oriented strategies that permit managers to invest anywhere in the world, according to Eager, Davis & Holmes, a consultant to institutional managers that is based in Louisville, Ky. That is a huge jump from the $1.4 billion that was invested in this strategy in all of 2006. ''The question is: Is this an anomaly, or is it something that will continue to develop going forward?'' said David F. Holmes, a partner at the consultancy. 
 An even bigger question is whether individual investors will follow institutional investors to this go-anywhere approach.
 Morningstar currently tracks a ''world stock'' fund category, which represents portfolios that are allowed to invest both inside and outside the United States. The category attracted $13.8 billion in net new money, or about 15 percent of all foreign-related flows, from January to May, according to the Financial Research Corporation, which tracks fund flow data.
 But many people don't understand the distinction between a global or world stock fund and a basic foreign-only stock portfolio. Moreover, fitting a globally oriented portfolio into an existing mix of domestic and foreign holdings can be challenging. Yes, you could take small slices from both your domestic and foreign portfolios and replace them with a global fund. Yet because you will never know with absolute certainty how much money your fund manager is deploying here and abroad, such a move can add a level of complexity to creating an overall asset allocation strategy.
 Adding to the confusion is the fact that this category of funds is still evolving. 
 ''This category has really changed,'' said Bridget B. Hughes, a senior analyst for world stock funds at Morningstar. In the past, she noted, many world stock funds were really multimanager portfolios, with part of the assets handed to a domestically minded manager and the rest going to a foreign-stock team. 
 But in recent years, she said, ''newer funds have been introduced that are truly globally minded and view things with a single lens.'' 
 FOR instance, two years ago, when T. Rowe Price installed Robert N. Gensler as manager, it shifted its strategy for the T. Rowe Price Global Stock fund to this single-lens approach.
 Mr. Gensler was allowed to pick only his favorite stocks within each global sector -- without strict regard to where the companies were domiciled. He quickly took the fund from around 200 holdings down to about 70. And after trailing its peer group average in 2002, 2003 and 2004, T. Rowe Price Global has ranked in the top 11 percent of its category over the three-year period through Thursday, according to Morningstar.
 When you think about it, borderless investing is similar to the way consumers make their buying decisions, said David A. Antonelli, chief investment officer for non-United States equity investments at MFS Investment Management, whose MFS Global Equity fund also invests in this borderless style. 
 ''When you're buying a TV, you might look for a model with the best picture quality, or you might look to what Consumer Reports said was is the most reliable television,'' he said. ''That TV might end up being a Japanese TV, but you're not buying it because the company that made it was headquartered in Japan.''
 He added that ''over time, this will be the same way people invest.''

HEADLINE: Safety First? True Once, but U. S. Now Lags in Road Deaths

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
DRIVING has never been safer. Cars, which once had just one air bag, can now have six or more, and there are crumple zones to protect occupants in a crash and electronic stability control to avoid crashes in the first place. There are run-flat tires and antilock brakes. The rate of highway fatalities has plummeted since 1970, when the United States led the world in road safety.
Still, despite its head start and that cocoon of technology, the nation has steadily slipped behind other countries, becoming comparatively one of the most dangerous places to drive in the industrialized world.
 The United States ranks 42nd of the 48 countries measured in the number of fatalities per capita, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the International Transport Forum. Australia, Britain, France, Germany and Japan all did significantly better. 
 And in what many safety experts consider a more precise measure, fatalities per distance driven, the United States was No. 1 in 1970 with the lowest death rate among industrialized countries reporting data. It now ranks 11th, with some countries reporting rates that are 25 percent lower.
 ''Here we are, probably the richest country in the world,'' said Barbara L. Harsha, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association, which represents state highway safety offices. ''Why are other countries doing a better job than we are?''
 Safety experts said the reasons were many. One, they said, was inadequate driver training. Some countries require that teenagers have 100 hours behind the wheel before they receive a license, compared to about 6 in the United States.
 But expert after expert said the real problem was one of culture. With personal freedom being a cornerstone of the United States, many states are loath to pass legislation that curtails them, even when it comes to road safety. So while the governments of other countries can easily pass laws to make driving safer, like a national ban on hand-held cellphone use, those laws here are left up to the states to impose, and that is often not so easy.
 New Hampshire, for example, is the only state with no seat belt law for adults, and in May its state Senate rejected a bill that would have mandated the use of belts. 
 ''The citizens of New Hampshire don't like to be told by anyone else what to do,'' said State Senator Robert E. Clegg Jr. 
 Fred Wegman, managing director of the National Institute for Road Safety Research in the Netherlands, said attitudes were different in Europe. There, he said, safety is not just about the individual, but is the responsibility of society as a whole. ''European countries fundamentally pay more political attention to road safety,'' he said.
 Allan F. Williams, a road safety consultant who had been the chief scientist at the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, compared the United States with Australia. ''Here there is not a lot of attention or money'' paid to road safety, Dr. Williams said. ''We don't see it as a national priority.''
 In Australia, ''the government is more willing to intervene to protect the health and safety of the community,'' he said. 
 Peter Sweatman, who is Australian and director of the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, said Australians were willing to give up a little freedom in exchange for better safety.
 ''There is a willingness to have strong and targeted enforcement, therefore a little bit of pain is justified,'' he said. ''It's a business management approach to saving lives. It's a relentless focus. I don't see the same kind of commitment here.''
 Bella Dinh-Zarr, the North American director of Make Roads Safe, a nonprofit organization based in London, said other countries had stricter laws, better enforcement, more accessible public transportation, greater awareness, public support and more rigorous training and licensing standards.
 ''We're moving in the right direction, but other countries have moved even further,'' she said.
 Statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a research organization financed by industrialized nations based in Paris, show that while the United States reduced road deaths from 1970 to 2005, the latest year the numbers were available, deaths fell even more in Western Europe. Sweden and Britain each reported about 35 deaths for every billion kilometers driven in 1970, more than the 30 in the United States. But in 2005 both European countries reported about 6 deaths for every billion kilometers, compared with 9 in the United States. 
 Seat belt laws are one example of the different approaches. About half the states do not allow the police to stop drivers solely for not using them. 
 ''The U.S. is the only country in the world that has a secondary seat belt law,'' said Dr. Dinh-Zarr of Make Roads Safe.
 Training and licensing standards overseas also reflect some major differences.
 ''The standards of both training and testing are far below acceptable levels in this country,'' said Eddie Wren, president of Advanced Drivers of America, a company based in Williamsville, N.Y.
 ''In some states the driver being tested does not even leave the parking lot and averages about eight minutes; in Britain the road test is 40 to 50 minutes, occurs on different types of roads, and has more complex tasks,'' said Mr. Wren, who was a traffic police officer in England.
 But experts agree that education is not the most effective way to reduce traffic injuries among teenagers. 
 ''There is a gap between what we know and what we do,'' said Dr. Williams, the safety consultant. ''Driver education and training do not work by themselves, but have a role when coupled with hands-on, supervised driving time and strong graduated driver licensing laws.''
 Almost all state programs could benefit from strengthening their requirements, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, because most driver education programs require only about six hours of on-road driving experience.
 ''Some other countries require 100 hours of behind-the-wheel experience,'' said David A. Sleet, associate director for science at the centers' Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention. He said that most experts agreed that behind-the-wheel training should be a minimum of 30 hours.But one area where the United States continues to excel is in vehicle design. 
 David Ward, director general of the FIA Foundation for the Automobile and Society, a nonprofit based in London, said the United States had taken the lead in installing electronic stability control, a technology invented in Europe that helps prevent skids. It is considered by some to be the greatest life-saving technology since the seat belt and is expected to reduce single-vehicle crashes of cars by 34 percent and sport utility vehicles by 59 percent, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. It will be mandatory in all passenger cars in the United States by model year 2012. 
 ''The U.S. has been instrumental in establishing a global standard,'' Mr. Ward said. ''We're pushing Europe to match what the Americans are doing.'' 
 The United States once had the lowest number of traffic deaths in the world, as measured by kilometers driven, but that was more than 35 years ago. Since then, while the nation's death rate has fallen even more, the rates in other countries have declined so much that the United States does not even make the top 10. As measured by traffic fatalities per 100,000 population, the United States ranks 42nd of the 48 countries reporting data. Graph shows the fatalities per 100,000 population in 2005 and 1970 for selected countries. A second graph shows the fatalities per billion kilometers driven from 1970 to 2005 for selected countries.

HEADLINE: A Surge of Development in a Quiet Beach Community

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: NEW BUFFALO, Mich. 

 BODY:
GREAT beaches, a booming regional economy in Chicago and a new casino have brought a surge of residential construction to this southern Lake Michigan village 70 miles east of Chicago. And already, builders say, most of the developments completed in the last year have sold more than half of their units. 
This sliver of Berrien County, which has called itself Harbor Country since a 1981 marketing campaign, is the strongest new housing and real estate market in Michigan, a state battered by a 7.2 percent unemployment rate, the highest in the nation. 
 For most of its history, this 135-year-old town has endured long periods of economic dormancy broken only by the annual migration of summertime visitors, some of whom kept simple beachside cottages. 
 Now, developers are building an array of condominiums, town houses and detached houses, steadily turning this working-class, mid-20th-century beach culture into a faster-paced scene.
 The Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians is building a 220,000-square-foot casino, including a 163-room hotel and six restaurants. The Four Winds Casino Resort, set to open next month, occupies 50 of 675 tribal acres off Interstate 94, which runs east and west from Detroit to Chicago just beyond New Buffalo's town line.
 Property tax records show that around 400 residential units, much of it near the harbor, have been built since 2005, with a total value of $245 million, and that 80 percent are being used as second homes. Prices range from $350,000 for a 2,000-square-foot three-bedroom detached home to nearly $2 million for a 6,000-square-foot town house, real estate agents say. The majority of homes in New Buffalo sell for $450,000 to $600,000, they say. 
 Residential construction is also taking place in neighboring beachfront communities on Lake Michigan north and south of here. 
 The surge of development in New Buffalo -- which has a population of around 2,200, according to data in a 2000 census report -- has prompted nearly equal measures of giddiness and lingering worries up and down Whittaker Street, the center of commercial activity. 
 ''You either have to accept it or you don't,'' said Louise Sockness, a resident since 1989 and owner of L & M Framing and Gallery on Whittaker Street. ''It's changing this small town. That's what I hear from my customers.'' 
 There is also some anxiety about the glut of new homes to hit the market. Tom Johnson, the New Buffalo city manager, who spent part of his career as an appraiser in the area, said: ''We've never had this many units on sale at one time. It's going to take awhile for them to be absorbed.''
 Real estate brokers and developers agree that market saturation is an issue, but they point out that new home sales have increased after dwindling last year. Dan Coffey, a broker at Re/Max Harbor Country, noted that his firm is now selling around seven homes a month, on average, up from an average of six a month last year and around four in 2005.
 Jim Oselka, whose family business developed the $18 million 85,000-square-foot Marina Grand Resort on New Buffalo's busy harbor, said that 32 of the 44 units had been sold so far. The fully furnished one-, two-, and three-bedroom condos, which buyers can also rent out as hotel rooms to earn income, sell for $350,000 to $575,000, Mr. Oselka said.
 ''We're comfortable with the pace of sales,'' he said. ''Things are picking up.''
 Housing markets in much of the rest of the state, meanwhile, remain soft. For example, in Birmingham, Bloomfield Hills, and Bloomfield Township, where sales prices are in the same range as those in New Buffalo, home sales have plummeted nearly 40 percent over the last three years. 
 During the first half of 2007 in those three communities, which span a 36-square-mile suburban area outside Detroit and are home to 65,000 residents, just 279 homes were sold -- fewer than 50 per month -- at an average price of $611,000. Homes were on the market for an average of 175 days, according to research compiled by Robert E. Taylor Jr., a real estate broker and researcher based in Birmingham. 
 In 2004, a peak year in the market, nearly 80 homes were sold each month in the same Bloomfield/Birmingham area at an average price of $551,000, after staying on the market an average of 69 days, Mr. Taylor said. 
 ''You've got a lot of things working in your favor over on that side of the state,'' said Mr. Taylor, referring to the New Buffalo area. ''You've got that Chicago economy, which is based on multiple industries and has really taken off. You've got a fair amount of money as people seek recreation property. You've got that beautiful lake front.'' 
 Home buyers can choose from an ample assortment of developments and designs in New Buffalo. 
 Last year, Karen Conner and Javier DeLaRosa, partners in the Esperanza Development Group, completed the infrastructure at Walden, a 12-acre project set in the woods, though within walking distance of the beach and the center of town. The 2,000-square-foot, three-bedroom homes are built beneath tall pines and are designed to resemble country cottages of the 1920s with large screened porches. The homes come with two or two and a half baths and sell for $350,000 to $399,000.
 Ms. Conner said 11 of the 22 homes planned for Walden had been completed and sold. Most of the buyers, she said, are baby boomers looking for second homes. ''Every person that I deal with has a home in Chicago that's paid for,'' she said. ''They are going to be retired and want to buy now. And this is close.'' 
 One of New Buffalo's most active builders is James P. Gierczyk, a 55-year-old developer from suburban Chicago. In the last three years, he says, he has put up four projects here that span 305,000 square feet, encompass 112 condominiums, 26 detached homes and 36 retail storefronts, and cost $71.5 million to build.
 ''I came here like everybody else to buy a vacation home,'' Mr. Gierczyk said. He lives part of the time with his wife and four children in one of the 6,000-square-foot, four-story Light Harbor Moorings town homes he built near the harbor in 2004. Two of the 10 fully furnished, $1.8 million town homes are still on the market. 
 Mr. Gierczyk's three other projects in New Buffalo are Fountain Square on Whittaker Street, which has 61 condominiums priced from $395,000 to $550,000; Light Harbor Preserve, a 41-unit condominium with prices ranging from $450,000 to $550,000; and the Cottages of Light Harbor, a 16-acre development where 2,400-square-foot single-family homes range from $450,000 to $595,000. 
 David Nocera, a 51-year-old manager of a Mercedes Benz and BMW dealership in Orland Park, a Chicago suburb, recently paid $600,000 for a 1,900-square-foot, three-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium in Light Harbor Preserve. His wife and young daughter are spending much of the summer in their new vacation home, and he is commuting to the office an hour or so away. 
 ''It's working out well,'' Mr. Nocera said. ''The commute is easy. When I'm here, it's paradise. And I'm selling cars here. I sold cars to three people who I met here.''
 Ms. Sockness of L & M Framing and Gallery said: ''Some people think maybe we're getting too commercialized. But it's not going to hurt my business. I don't have trouble with the casino coming in or the new homes. That's progress.''

HEADLINE: Deserved Attention For a Fading Monument

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''A Revolutionary Gem, Neglected'' echoes the sentiments of the faithful Friends of Fort Griswold, which has almost single-handedly championed the effort to restore the monument and raise funds for a visitors center worthy of the sacrifice of those massacred in defense of their home and country. 
 I am pleased to join my colleagues in working toward a speedy release of the long-requested funds for the monument's restoration. As the years-old $350,000 request is barely sufficient to do the necessary restorative work, I have requested an additional $150,000 for urgently needed restoration of the bronze plaque honoring the victims of the battle at the entrance gates and for additional repairs to the walls and walkways. 
 The Times is correct in its assertion that the state must do a better job in maintaining and promoting its historic treasures both for the educational and economic benefits. One simple measure would be to link the twin forts that guard the Port of New London by water taxi at piers already constructed for that purpose. Additional stops at the New London River Walk and the Nautilus Submarine Museum would greatly enhance the visitor experience and provide an economic boost to shops and restaurants on both sides.

HEADLINE: Two Sides Of Economic Growth

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
THE initial snapshot this week of the nation's economic output in the second quarter may offer two surprises for the price of one. It may be stronger than expected and weaker than it seems. 
 A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that the economy will have grown at a 3.2 percent annual rate in the quarter, after a tepid rate of 0.7 percent in the first three months of the year. Maury Harris, chief United States economist at UBS Securities, expects 3.8 percent growth but cautions that there is less to that number than meets the eye.
 Much of the strength in the second quarter was attributable to businesses rebuilding inventory after they failed to replace enough of the items they sold earlier in the year. Lately they have erred on the side of excess, stocking their shelves too high, and that could lead to subdued growth later in the year, he said.
 ''The kick you got from a pickup in inventory buying was a one-quarter phenomenon,'' Mr. Harris said. ''Once you're back to more orderly inventory replacement, you don't get good growth in industrial production.''
 If consumer spending holds up, it may cushion a decline in inventory building and underpin growth in gross domestic product. But a different component of the report on Friday may suggest that shoppers are taking a bit of a rest.
 Real personal consumption, which measures sales after subtracting the impact of inflation, rose at a robust annual rate of 4.2 percent in the fourth quarter and again in the first. Mr. Harris expects a decline to 1.2 percent annual growth in the latest period.
 If the figure comes in close to what he expects, the bond market should take the news better than the stock market, he predicted. He asserted, however, that any stock market decline would probably be short-lived.
 For Mr. Harris, a softening in consumer spending would confirm an observation made last week by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the housing market slump was affecting the broader economy.. 
 ''If consumer spending continues to go up at just a 1 percent to 1.5 percent annual rate, you've got to blame something,'' Mr. Harris said. ''It's not jobs or the stock market, so it must be housing by a process of elimination.''
 DATA WATCH No respite for the housing market is anticipated this week. The Bloomberg poll forecasts sales of existing homes to have fallen to an annual rate of 5.87 million units in June from 5.99 million in May; that report is due Wednesday.
 A decline is also expected when data on sales of new homes are announced the next day. An annual sales rate of 900,000 is estimated for June, down from 915,000 for May.
 One of the more volatile and unpredictable items on the economic calendar each month is orders for durable goods -- large household or industrial items with long useful lives. The Bloomberg poll calls for an increase of 1.9 percent for June when the report is released Thursday, compared with a 2.8 percent decline for May. Mr. Harris expects a gain of 2.0 percent.

HEADLINE: Plenty of Music, But Not to Soothe A Savage Breast

BYLINE: By David J. Kilcullen. 
David J. Kilcullen, writing in the State Department's eJournal USA about the challenges for future wars:

 BODY:
At present, the U.S. defense budget accounts for approximately half of total global defense spending, while the U.S. armed forces employ about 1.68 million uniformed members. By comparison, the State Department employs about 6,000 foreign service officers, while the U.S. Agency for International Development has about 2,000. In other words, the Department of Defense is about 210 times larger than USAID and State combined -- there are substantially more people employed as musicians in Defense bands than in the entire foreign service.

The Rich and Income Taxes
 To the Editor: 
 Claims like mine that middle-income workers now pay a larger share of their incomes than people at or near the top ''don't hold up under close examination,'' says N. Gregory Mankiw in ''Fair Taxes? Depends on What You Mean by Fair'' (Economic View, July 15).
 His column relies on a study by the Congressional Budget Office that finds the top 1 percent paying 31.1 percent of their income in federal taxes while the middle fifth pay 13.9 percent. But three important things are not noted: 
 First, though the column acknowledges the existence of people like Warren Buffett, who by his own affirmation pays only 17.7 percent of his income in taxes, it attributes this to the fact that his earnings are largely from dividends and capital gains, taxed at 15 percent. But isn't this also true for a large portion of the very wealthy?
 Second, the C.B.O. analysis assumes that corporate taxes are borne by shareholders. But shareholders don't carry all the burden. Some is passed along to consumers in higher prices and some to employees in lower wages.
 Finally, the column does not figure in state and local taxes, notably sales taxes and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, both of which eat up a far higher share of the incomes of middle-class and poor families.
 Robert B. Reich
 Berkeley, Calif., July 15
 The writer, who was secretary of labor in the Clinton administration, is a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley.
 To the Editor:
 When looking at the percentage of income that the rich pay in taxes, remember that the numbers are averages, that plenty of rich people pay much less, and that the data are based on stated income and available deductions.
 Hedge fund managers, for example, can often defer declaring earnings as income, allowing them to earn compound interest on what an ordinary person would have to pay in taxes, until they're ready to repatriate such funds. Similarly, those who are compensated with stock options can put off taking the money.
 In addition, I doubt whether many people in the bottom 20 percent of income benefit from tax breaks like the deduction of mortgage interest or business travel that's combined with a vacation. They also can't take a deeply discounted ride on the corporate jet or enjoy other perks available to the rich and superrich.
 Shaun Breidbart
 Pelham, N.Y., July 17
 To the Editor:
 In his look at current tax rates, Mr. Mankiw says: ''None of these calculations, however, say whether the rich are paying their fair share. Fairness is not an economic concept. If you want to talk fairness you have to leave the department of economics and head over to philosophy.''
 There's no question that philosophy is superior to the ''dismal science'' in solving human problems, but taxes are a political, not a philosophical, problem.
 That's why Democrats tax the rich and Republicans repeal those taxes. So what's new? Warner B. Huck
 Hilton Head Island, S.C., July 15
 To the Editor:
 Tax rates aren't a goal -- they are a means to an end. Taxes pay for what we, through our democratic processes, decide are our national priorities.
 Mr. Mankiw approvingly quotes President Bush's ''principle'' that ''no one in America should have to pay more than a third of their income to the federal government.'' But this formula has left the nation hopelessly in debt.
 The only sensible discussion to have about tax rates is to decide what we want to achieve as a nation. Then we should adjust tax rates accordingly

HEADLINE: Africa, Offline: Waiting for the Web

BYLINE: By RON NIXON. 
Magnus K. Mazimpaka contributed reporting from Rwanda.

 BODY:
ON a muggy day in Kigali in 2003, some of the highest-ranking officials in the Rwandan government, including President Paul Kagame, flanked an American businessman, Greg Wyler, as he boldly described how he could help turn their small country into a hub of Internet activity.
 Mr. Wyler, an executive based in Boston who made his fortune during the tech boom, said he would lace Rwanda with fiber optic cables, connecting schools, government institutions and homes with low-cost, high-speed Internet service. Until that point, Mr. Wyler, 37, had never set foot in Africa -- he was invited by a Rwandan government official he had met at a wedding. Mr. Wyler never expected to start a business there; he simply wanted to try to help the war-torn country. 
 Even so, Mr. Wyler's company, Terracom, was granted a contract to connect 300 schools to the Internet. Later, the company would buy 99 percent of the shares in Rwandatel, the country's national telecommunications company, for $20 million. 
 But after nearly four years, most of the benefits hailed by him and his company have failed to materialize, Rwandan officials say. ''The bottom line is that he promised many things and didn't deliver,'' said Albert Butare, the country's telecommunications minister. 
 Mr. Wyler says he sees things quite differently, and he and Rwandan officials will probably never agree on why their joint venture has been so slow to get off the ground. But Terracom's tale is more than a story about a business dispute in Rwanda. It is also emblematic of what can happen when good intentions run into the technical, political and business realities of Africa. 
 Attempts to bring affordable high-speed Internet service to the masses have made little headway on the continent. Less than 4 percent of Africa's population is connected to the Web; most subscribers are in North African countries and the republic of South Africa.
 A lack of infrastructure is the biggest problem. In many countries, communications networks were destroyed during years of civil conflict, and continuing political instability deters governments or companies from investing in new systems. E-mail messages and phone calls sent from some African countries have to be routed through Britain, or even the United States, increasing expenses and delivery times. About 75 percent of African Internet traffic is routed this way and costs African countries billions of extra dollars each year that they would not incur if their infrastructure was up to speed.
 ''Most African governments haven't paid much attention to their infrastructure,'' said Vincent Oria, an associate professor of computer science at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and a native of the Ivory Coast. ''In places where hunger, AIDS and poverty are rampant, they didn't see it as critical until now.''
 Africa's only connection to the network of computers and fiber optic cables that are the Internet's backbone is a $600 million undersea cable running from Portugal down the west coast of Africa. Built in 2002, the cable was supposed to provide cheaper and faster Web access, but so far that has not happened. 
 Prices remain high because the national telecommunications linked to the cable maintain a monopoly over access, squeezing out potential competitors. And plans for a fiber optic cable along the East African coast have stalled over similar access issues. Most countries in Eastern Africa, like Rwanda, depend on slower satellite technology for Internet service. 
 The result is that Africa remains the least connected region in the world, and the digital gap between it and the developed world is widening rapidly. ''Unless you can offer Internet access that is the same as the rest of the world, Africa can't be part of the global economy or academic environment,'' said Lawrence H. Landweber, professor emeritus of computer science at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, who was also part of an early effort to bring the Web to Africa in the mid-1990s. ''The benefits of the Internet age will bypass the continent.''
 RWANDAN officials were especially interested in wiring primary and secondary schools, seeing information technology as crucial to modernizing the country's rural economy. Some 90 percent of the country's eight million people work in agriculture. 
 But as of mid-July, only one-third of the 300 schools covered in Terracom's contract had high-speed Internet service. All 300 were supposed to have been connected by 2006. 
 Over all, less than 1 percent of the population is connected to the Internet. Rwandan officials say the company seems more interested in tapping the more lucrative cellphone market than in being an Internet service provider. (In November, Mr. Wyler stepped down as chief executive of Terracom, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family; he still serves on the board.)
 In a telephone interview from his home in Boston, Mr. Wyler said he would not address the government's criticism, saying he did not want to be quoted as saying anything negative. But he said there were some things he had not anticipated, particularly the technical challenges of linking Rwanda's Internet network to the rest of the world. The only way to do it is to buy bandwidth capacity on satellites, but there are not enough satellites to meet demand.
 Mr. Wyler also says he believes that Terracom suffers from unrealistic expectations. ''Terracom has done everything it can, '' he said. ''Because of the technical challenges, the Internet service is as good as it's going to get. But given what we started from, I still think we have accomplished a lot. In the beginning there were a few people with Internet service; now there are thousands.''
 The Rwandan government had hoped that the number of Web surfers would be much higher by now. Rwanda, which is about the size of Maryland, has little industry, and its infrastructure is still being rebuilt after being left in shambles by a 1994 genocide in which 800,000 to a million people were killed. 
 ''We have almost no natural resources and no seaports in Rwanda, which leaves us only with trying to become a knowledge-based society,'' said Romain Murenzi, the minister of science, technology and scientific research.
 Officials saw Terracom's investment as crucial to its transformation. Unlike many African governments, Rwanda's was eager to privatize the national telecommunications company, which had outdated equipment, high prices and few subscribers. 
 But from the start, government officials say, there were problems with Terracom. Mr. Butare, the telecommunications minister, said the government had trouble getting basic information from the company. 
 Complicating the situation, Mr. Butare said, was that Mr. Wyler tried to run Terracom from the United States, visiting Rwanda just a few weeks at a time. He left day-to-day management to a poorly trained staff, Mr. Butare said. 
 ''There were spots where they did some things here and there,'' Mr. Butare said. ''But over all they have failed to do what they promised.'' 
 Internet rates have been lowered, from about $1,000 a month when Terracom arrived in 2003, but most people still can't afford it. The average Rwandan makes about $220 a year, and a fixed-line Internet hookup costs about $90 a month. Basic wireless Internet is about $63 a month. Those rich enough to pay the fees complain about poor service. 
 Government officials say the company has spent more time marketing and signing up cellphone customers than on expanding Internet service. According to government figures, Terracom has 30,000 to 40,000 mobile phone subscribers and about 20,000 Internet customers.
 The situation came to a head late last year, when government officials contended that Terracom secretly tried to trade its shares in the Rwandan telecom to GV Telecom, a regional African telecommunications company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. Rwandan officials were furious, saying this was a violation of the contract signed by the two parties.
 The plan was scrapped and Mr. Wyler was widely criticized. In June, the government fined Terracom nearly $400,000 for failing to comply with its licensing obligations, failing to provide information about its operations and failing to pay several fees.
 ''We decided to penalize Terracom after they failed to fulfill their obligations for a long time,'' said Beatha Mukangabo, legal officer for the Rwanda Utilities Regulatory Agency. Terracom said it has paid the fines and is working with the government to meet all of its obligations.
 Mr. Wyler said he has not been involved in Terracom for nearly 10 months and could not comment on its current operations.
 Christopher Lundh, Terracom's new chief executive and a former executive of Gateway Communications in London, has worked in several African countries. He now lives and works full time in Rwanda, and many government officials say Terracom's performance has improved under his leadership. 
 Mr. Lundh acknowledged that there were problems with the company's operations in the past. ''The former management did make some promises that they were not able to keep,'' he said. ''That's why I was brought in to professionalize things.'' He also said that the company could have better handled the matter with GV Telecom but that he thinks the government overreacted.
 He said the Rwandan government is to blame for some of the delays. ''We would get to schools that don't even have electricity or computers,'' he said. ''That is not our fault.'' In addition, he said that many of the complaints about the company concerned things beyond its ability to control. Getting adequate bandwidth remains a constant challenge.
 Like most telecommunications companies in eastern Africa, Terracom depends on satellites for Internet service. Satellite service is much slower than cable because of delays in the signals. Satellites also provide less bandwidth than cable. 
 Adding to the problem is that most of the satellites serving Africa were launched nearly 20 years ago and are aging or going out of commission. A satellite set to go into service last year blew up on the launching pad. Power is also an issue, as intermittent power failures in Rwanda hamper efforts to provide a steady electricity source.
 DESPITE these limitations and earlier setbacks, Mr. Lundh says Terracom is moving ahead with plans to give Rwanda the most advanced Internet infrastructure in Africa. A nationwide wireless connection should begin operating near year-end, he said, about the time a nonprofit group, One Laptop Per Child, based in Boston, is to introduce a $100 laptop in the country. 
 And Terracom is continuing to lay fiber optic cables to connect Rwanda to several other African countries, eliminating a need for phone calls and Internet traffic to be routed via European or American networks.
 The government, meanwhile, is moving forward with its own plans to build a fiber optic network. It also has granted Internet service licenses to South African companies and plans to issue several more. ''We think we are going to have a healthier market pretty soon,'' said Nkubito Bakuramutsa, director general of the Rwanda Information Technology Authority. ''We have learned from past experience.'' 
 Mr. Bakuramutsa said he hopes to bring the price of Internet service down to about $10 a month.
 Mr. Lundh said his company welcomes the competition. But, he added, getting necessary bandwidth remains an issue and no matter what company supplies Internet service, speed will be a problem. ''Eventually you reach a point of diminishing returns,'' he said. ''Unless there is a new undersea fiber optic cable built or a new satellite launched, it's going to be difficult.''

HEADLINE: When Mobile Phones Aren't Truly Mobile

BYLINE: By RANDALL STROSS. 
Randall Stross is an author based in Silicon Valley and a professor of business at San Jose State University. E-mail: stross@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WIRELESS carriers in the United States are spiritual descendants of dear Ma Bell: they view total control over customers as their inherited birthright.
 The younger generation -- Verizon Wireless, Sprint Nextel, T-Mobile and the namesake child AT&T -- would make their hallowed matriarch proud. They do everything they can to keep power firmly in their own hands. It is entirely at the carriers' discretion to permit, or disable, the features that a factory loads into the newest phones. They also decide which software can be installed and how it may be used. Many wireless subscribers have ruefully become acquainted with gotcha clauses in their contracts. 
 In most European and Asian countries, a customer can switch carriers in a few seconds by removing a smart card from a cellphone and inserting a different one from a new provider. In the United States, wireless carriers have deliberately hobbled their phones to make flight to a competitor difficult, if not impossible. 
 If you, the long-suffering subscriber, decide that you have had enough and wish to try your luck with another company, you're free to pay your early-termination fee and go. But you most likely will have to abandon the phone you've already paid for, even when the technology is shared by the two carriers. (Sprint, for example, whose network is based on the CDMA standard, forbids the use of CDMA-based cellphones obtained from Verizon.) The odds are better than even that your cellphone is either locked by your incumbent carrier or forbidden for use on the network by your new one.
 In the days when cellphones were inexpensive and could perform only one or two functions, they could be treated as disposable. When smart phones like the Palm Treo arrived, however, the cellphones became too pricey to abandon lightly when switching companies. Now the iPhone is here -- if you're willing to pony up $500 or $600. AT&T has received an exclusive contract from Apple, so iPhone buyers have no alternative carrier. But the lack of choices rankles and is drawing more scrutiny than ever.
 Two weeks ago, Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, led a House hearing on ''wireless innovation and consumer protection'' and held up an iPhone as Exhibit A in his assessment that the industry exerted ''far too much control over the features, functions and applications that wireless gadget makers and content entrepreneurs can offer directly to consumers.'' Why is it, he asked, that AT&T imposes a two-year contract with a $175 early-termination fee ''even though the phone cost wasn't subsidized and a consumer can't even take it to use with another network provider?''
 Wireless customers may soon have a few more options. In a coming auction for wireless spectrum that will be available in 2009, the Federal Communications Commission is preparing to set aside a third of the new capacity for bidders who agree to operate wireless services in a more open fashion.
 Kevin J. Martin, the F.C.C. chairman, said in an interview last week that he had circulated a draft proposal among his fellow commissioners that would require the winning bidders to be receptive ''to all kinds of devices and applications'' provided by independent consumer electronics makers and third-party software providers.
 Subscribers of the new services would even be permitted to take their phones with them, freely, from one carrier to another. Imagine: a genuinely mobile phone.
 The pressure to provide consumers with more cellphone and software choices has been building for some time. In January, the F.C.C. took another step to loosen the exclusive grip of the cable operators' control over the set-top box that feeds the cable signal to the TV, a move that showed that the commission is open to changes that give consumers more equipment choices. 
 Then, in February, Timothy Wu, a law professor at Columbia University, published an influential paper, ''Wireless Net Neutrality,'' which made a well-supported case that the government should compel wireless carriers to open their networks to equipment and software applications that the carriers did not control. Mr. Wu called his proposition a call for ''Cellular Carterfone,'' referring to the 1968 Carterfone ruling by the F.C.C. The Carterfone was a speakerphone-like gadget that permitted a phone sitting in a cradle to be connected with a two-way radio. Over the objections of AT&T, the F.C.C. ruled that consumers could plug it or any phone or accessory into the network so long as doing so did no harm to the network. The ruling set in motion the changes that provided consumers with a cornucopia of equipment choices like answering machines, fax machines, modems and cordless phones. Among Mr. Wu's readers was Mr. Martin of the F.C.C.
 The wireless carriers are fighting a cellular version of the Carterfone decision. They contend that they must exert control over all equipment used on their networks in order to protect the networks' operations. AT&T says in an F.C.C. filing that only the carrier has the incentive to oversee ''the integrity, security and efficient and economical use'' of the network.
 MR. WU'S paper, however, shows that the landline telephone industry used identical arguments, predicting dire consequences were its customers permitted to use equipment from unknown sources. In 1955, when AT&T was fighting to exclude a gadget called the Hush-A-Phone, the company solemnly argued, ''It would be extremely difficult to furnish 'good' telephone service if telephone users were free to attach to the equipment, or use with it, all of the numerous kinds of foreign attachments, which are marketed by persons who have no responsibility for the quality of telephone service.'' 
 As a postscript to the landline industry's resistance to opening its networks, Mr. Wu said in an interview last week, ''Things turned out not just O.K., but great.''
 Companies like Google and Skype have called on the F.C.C. to open up more equipment and software options in the wireless industry. Google said on Friday that it would participate in the spectrum auction, committing a minimum of $4.6 billion, if the F.C.C. put into effect its ''open access'' proposals submitted earlier. Verizon Wireless, however, contended that Google's proposals would open its network to phones that Verizon had not approved and ''that cannot reliably communicate with law enforcement,'' a grave problem ''in an era of heightened national security concerns.''
 In other words, stick with Verizon-certified phones, or the terrorists win.
 The wireless industry is being dragged, ever so slowly and gently, into a scary new age -- one that began in 1968 with Carterfone -- that will require adjustment to reduced control. The industry can never credibly contend that its business practices foster competition and innovation as long as its customers are prevented from moving easily from one carrier to another. Last week, Representative Markey said: ''How crazy is this? You can take your number with you, but you can't take your new $500 phone with you.''

HEADLINE: Markets Love Him

BYLINE: By Lawrence Kudlow. 
Lawrence Kudlow, writing on the Web site RealClearPolitics:

 BODY:
Despite the criticism President Bush has received over his Iraq War policies, isn't it interesting that stock markets have been booming since early 2003, when Saddam was overthrown and the president signed his supply-side tax cuts into law? (Bush, of course, never gets any credit on either of these points.) 
In just the past year alone, the Dow has gained a remarkable 30 percent. Meanwhile, Europe and Asia are up about 30 percent, Japan 23 percent, and emerging markets more than 60 percent. Clearly, the world is voting -- with real money -- for the American system of free-market capitalism. And it's my strong suspicion that the majority of the global investing community supports the Iraq War and a steadfast U.S. commitment to stop terrorism. They seem to know that if the United States doesn't do it, no one else will.
 I have long believed that stock markets are the best barometer of the health, wealth and security of a nation. And today's stock market message is an unmistakable vote of confidence for the president. Even the best low-tax, limited-government economic policies can be thwarted if the men and women going to work in the morning can't get safely back to their homes and families at night.
 And the fact that the world economy is experiencing the greatest economic boom in history is a direct rebuke to jihadists everywhere.

HEADLINE: A Billion Bucks for the Cubs? It's Only Money

 BODY:
WHAT makes a man so desperate to own a sports team that he would be willing to pay a billion dollars for it? And not just one man, but a whole lot of men, each bidding against the others for the right to buy the team.
 Fans of the Chicago Cubs, who have been without a World Series winner for a long, long time, were asking that question last week as Mark Cuban, the Internet billionaire and owner of the Dallas Mavericks, announced that he had submitted a bid for the team. Others had already joined the fray, and the competition may well mean that the final price could reach $1 billion. (The current owner, theTribune Company, is selling the team as part of an effort to shed noncore assets as the Chicago real estate investor Samuel Zell takes the company private.) 
 There is, perhaps, no better place to ponder the issue of motivation than in the seats behind third base at Wrigley Field, the Cubs' venerable home. Just ahead is the third base coach Mike Quade, waving instructions to the base runners. And it's easy to see from there why insiders say Wrigley has the worst infield in baseball. There's basically a little hill right on the third base path (among other problems). That hill makes for a lively game, of course -- weird hops of the ball, puzzled shortstops. 
 Wrigley also has a terrible infield drainage problem that needs to be fixed. But not long ago, the Cubs announced that they were putting the repair project on hold. They don't want to spend the $1 million before they sell the team. They want to leave that problem for the new guy.
 And yet, in the off-season, they signed a series of expensive contracts with players including Alfonso Soriano ($136 million). And rumors continue to swirl in Chicago about whether the Cubs may try to get Alex Rodriguez from the Yankees. 
 What sense does it make to postpone improvements in the field, but spend lavishly on players before selling the team?
 Well, it makes sense, for one, if you think that owners buy teams for vanity, rather than as an investment. No one's ego is massaged by owning a team of losers.
 Answering why people buy teams turns out to be important to more than just sports fans. There is big money at stake.
 After owners indulge their childhood fantasy of buying a team, they tend to switch to an adult perspective and start viewing the team as a business.
 And they typically conclude that it's a bad business. 
 Consider the Seattle SuperSonics basketball franchise. The Starbucks mogul Howard Schultz sold the team to an Oklahoma businessman, Clayton Bennett, last year. Evidently, the Sonics lost about $60 million in the five years that Mr. Schultz owned the team. Mr. Bennett now wants a big subsidy from the city of Seattle to build a new arena, or else he may move the team to Oklahoma City. Other team owners use large losses to force tough salary caps and other restrictions on the pay of the athletes during labor negotiations. If teams can't make money, they reason, the business can't survive.
 But if this is such a bad business, we are back to the same questions: Why do these guys line up to buy the teams? Should we really care that it's a bad business? If a billionaire throws a lavish 60th birthday party, it costs a lot of money. But that doesn't make it a bad business. It's a party. It's not supposed to make money. 
 Is a sports team really that different?
 Owners' complaints about losses leave out the basic fact that capital gains are profits, too. And when scores of grown men desperately want to buy sports teams, there tend to be big capital gains. 
 Take the Sonics. The team may have lost $60 million while Mr. Schultz owned it. But he bought it for $200 million in 2001 and sold it for $350 million five years later. So he ended up making something like $90 million (taxed at the favorable capital gains tax rate, no less) on top of the fame, prestige and free tickets he got while he was owner.
 If the Cubs do, indeed, sell for $1 billion, Tribune will have earned an annual return of almost 15 percent since it bought the team for around $20 million in 1981. Given the company's recent problems, it's probably the best investment it ever made.
 SO owning a sports team gives budding billionaires local stardom and a big return -- no wonder that they are lining up to buy these teams. The only question that remains, I suppose, is why the vanity value of teams keeps climbing. You might have thought that this value would be about the same whenever there's a sale, so that the capital gain wouldn't be such a big component. But because ever-richer guys are bidding against one another, there has been persistent inflation in team values. 
 Back in Cubland, we wait for news about who will buy the team, praying that it's someone who will build a World Series winner. As for me, I have decided that I don't care who it is, as long as the new owner doesn't ask the city for money. I will still go to the games and will happily contribute to the buzz. 
 But Mr. Whoever You Are, do me one favor. Just fix the infield already.

HEADLINE: Office Space Is Tripled In New Rochelle Proposal

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
To meet the demand for more office space in Westchester near train stations, Cappelli Enterprises has redrawn its plans for LeCount Square, a proposed mixed-used development in downtown New Rochelle. 
The new plan triples the amount of office space to almost 400,000 square feet and reduces the number of residential units in two towers to 258.
 The project is within walking distance of New Rochelle's transportation center, where train, bus and taxi service are available for commuters. In June, Louis R. Cappelli, the president of the company, also proposed an office complex built around a renovated train station in White Plains.
 But that city's common council failed to endorse the project as Mr. Cappelli proposed it, prompting him to withdraw the proposal altogether. Both Mr. Cappelli and White Plains officials, however, have suggested that his idea is not dead. 
 While vacancy rates for Class A office space in Manhattan are in the single digits, and rents there are edging close to $100 per square foot, a strong demand for comparable but less expensive office space has developed in suburban areas like Westchester and Fairfield Counties. 
 Under the proposal for the $400 million LeCount Square, two towers would rise from a three-level retail base, with the north tower containing only offices -- and the first two floors of that tower offering 40,000-square-foot floor plates, especially suited for trading floors. The south tower would include a 209-room hotel on the lower 13 floors with residences above and in an adjacent loft building. 
 Mr. Cappelli recently joined with Donald Trump to build Trump Plaza in New Rochelle, a high-rise luxury condo tower that is nearing completion and is almost 70 percent sold out.
 With the development of LeCount Square, Cappelli's total investment in downtown New Rochelle will exceed $1 billion. His first project in the city, New Roc City, a $180 million sports, entertainment and retail complex, opened in 1999.

NOT REMOTELY CONTROLLED
 Notes on Television.
 By Lee Siegel.
 353 pp. Basic Books. Paper, $15.95.
Who is the audience for not-quite-current television reviews, none old enough to be historical and few new enough to seem fresh? We can leave that little problem to Lee Siegel's publisher, and note what this collection makes emphatically clear: Siegel's valuable role as a cultural provocateur, tossing off intellectual grenades about the social tyranny of money or the failures of the Bush administration while ostensibly defending the dumb sitcom ''Joey'' or skewering the hit ''My Name Is Earl.'' 
 Written between 2003 and 2006, when Siegel was the television critic and a cultural blogger for The New Republic, the essays in ''Not Remotely Controlled: Notes on Television'' are not meant to be intellectually rigorous, as the book's expectation-lowering subtitle makes plain. They don't begin to approach a sustained argument about the complex way television both shapes and reflects society. 
 But at their best, Siegel's scattershot observations offer a kind of drive-by brilliance. Writing about ''Extras,'' the smart Ricky Gervais comedy about would-be stars, he accounts for the rise of celebrity do-gooders who meddle in world events: they are filling a void left by ''Bush's fraudulence and incompetence,'' he says. (He doesn't mention the celebrities' names; would ''Bono'' have taken too much space?) 
 Siegel is shrewd about the way the ''CSI'' franchise ''represents the triumph of the money culture.'' If you can afford all those high-tech forensic gizmos, you can buy your way to crime solving. 
 And an essay about ''Thirty Days'' -- Morgan Spurlock's series inspired by his film ''Super Size Me,'' about how unhealthy it is to live on a diet of McDonald's -- describes Spurlock and his role model, Michael Moore, so astutely that they are decimated with a couple of withering phrases. They use ''the old fig-leaf-of-virtue gambit,'' Siegel says, hiding ''a conniving ego behind an oozing conscience.'' 
 Often, though, he wildly overstates his case or ignores inconvenient evidence. He attacks Steven Bochco's Iraq drama, ''Over There,'' for its graphic violence, offering the stock response that Americans are so overwhelmed by ''all this carnage'' in ''relentless dispatches from Iraq'' that they're not ready to be entertained by more. But television news presents such tentative, skittish images of the war that the public can hardly be overwhelmed by them; ''Over There'' was more detailed, maybe more realistic. (Siegel was right about one thing: the series was a huge flop.) 
 He can be savvy about television's economic motives and obsession with demographics but doesn't bother with those practicalities when they'd undercut some high-blown theory. He makes a murky argument that ''the chief cause of reality television'' is a cynical public that has ''come to associate artistic pretense with entrepreneurial misrepresentation.'' This is not only clunky writing; it's a ridiculously blinkered conclusion. The chief cause of reality programming could be Mark Burnett, the man behind ''Survivor,'' something to consider even if you're mining television for cultural significance. 
 And Siegel presses too hard, and unconvincingly, on the idea that the culture is in revolt against images of perfection. He uses the obsessive-compulsive detective hero of ''Monk'' as an example, quickly brushing aside an entire industry of self-help, get-rich and makeover television gurus. Yet even in the midst of this wrongheaded argument he can drop in a dazzling aside, writing that George W. Bush was elected not despite but because of his bumbling, displayed with a regular guy's ''conspiratorial wink'' that made him ''the antidote to sizzle and buzz'' and plastic candidate clones. 
 Given his many strengths, it's too bad Siegel is tone-deaf about Jon Stewart. In a 2004 essay included here, he is cranky about comedians' shaping the political conversation, and condescending about Stewart's humor. The book doesn't include the 2006 piece that briefly dragged Siegel into the news. That essay, an open letter to Stewart, berates him for being less a comedian than ''a conduit'' to a young audience and asks, ''Has being Mr. Civic-Minded Serious Satirist of Our Debased Public Life merely become a successful shtick for you?'' The article provoked many online attacks and a passionate defense from a poster called ''Sprezzatura'' -- a name that turned out to be a false identity (a ''sock puppet'') for Siegel himself, who was suspended from the magazine for the ruse. The fuss shouldn't obscure a different problem. Siegel never grapples with the essential questions: Why is Stewart so popular, and what does that mean? 
 Complaining about Stewart's now-established influence instead of analyzing it is just one reason these essays sometimes seem creaky. Siegel's argument that a glut of comedies about actors demonstrates ''a rising suspicion of art'' loses all urgency when you know that four of the five shows he mentions died fast. (And the hit, ''Entourage,'' is less about art than about being a Hollywood insider.) That's the problem with collecting the recent work of a provocateur: It lands in a curious time warp, addressing cultural moments even as they slip away.

HEADLINE: Vetoing Children's Health

 BODY:
President Bush is threatening to veto any substantial increase in spending for a highly successful children's health program on the bizarre theory that expanding it would be the ''beginning salvo'' in establishing a government-run health care system. His shortsighted ideological opposition would leave millions of children without health insurance at a time when medical costs are soaring.
The president's ire was provoked by a bipartisan bill approved by the Senate Finance Committee last week that would expand the so-called State Children's Health Insurance Program, a joint federal-state effort that, over the last decade, has substantially reduced the number of uninsured children in the country. The program, known as S-chip, seeks to cover children whose family income is too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to afford costly private coverage. It is due to expire on Sept. 30 unless Congress reauthorizes it. 
 The program now gets $5 billion a year in federal money to match state contributions, and the Bush administration has proposed a meager increase of $5 billion spread over the next five years. With health care costs escalating, that would not even be enough to cover all of the 6.6 million children who were enrolled at some time during the last year. Hundreds of thousands of children would likely fall off the rolls. And there would be no help for some eight to nine million children who now have no health coverage at all. 
 The Finance Committee rightly rejected that false economy. By a hefty 17-to-4 margin, it voted to authorize a $35 billion increase for S-chip spread over five years. Instead of reducing the number of children enrolled, the Senate bill would provide coverage for an additional 3.2 million children who are uninsured now. And in another boon for American health, the costs would be paid for by a steep increase in taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products -- a further disincentive for smokers. 
 Mr. Bush's objections are primarily philosophical: that the bill would move more people into a government-run program while he would prefer to entice them into buying private insurance with the help of tax deductions, his favored approach for all uninsured Americans. Tax deductions will not make much of a dent in the ranks of the uninsured. And it seems wrongheaded to impose collateral damage on a successful children's health insurance program while waging that broader ideological battle. 
 The administration argues that S-chip should be mainly for children in families with incomes no higher than twice the poverty level, or $41,300 for a family of four. But that hardly suffices in states where medical costs are high and private policies can cost the average family $10,000 to $12,000 a year. At least 18 states now cover children in families with higher incomes, and some also cover pregnant women, parents and some childless adults. 
 Now the administration wants to reduce matching money for these added categories and push more of the burden onto financially strapped states. It worries that any more generous coverage would lead many families or small employers to drop private policies. That is bound to happen, but it would seem a plus if those families could get better or cheaper coverage through S-chip.
 The Senate would still leave millions of children uninsured and would discourage any additional states from covering low-income parents -- reducing the likelihood that they would enroll their children. Senate Democrats believe this is the best that could be achieved. Now it will be up to the full Senate to approve the bill by a veto-proof margin. Meanwhile, House Democrats have their sights on a bigger increase -- some $50 billion over five years to cover even more uninsured children. 
 If more revenue sources are needed, the House should consider a new tax on alcohol, which would also have health benefits, or a reduction in the large subsidies paid to private health plans to participate in Medicare. The important thing is to cover as many uninsured children as politically feasible, and hang the ideological warfare.

HEADLINE: Is G.E. Too Big for Its Own Good?

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
EVEN by the standards of a company that builds everything from light bulbs to power plants and straddles markets as varied as prime-time TV and commercial finance, General Electric's mammoth project along the Hudson River north of Albany is staggering. The company plans to lay down more than 28,000 feet of rail and 267,000 square yards of plastic beside the river's edge -- all to haul nearly 400,000 tons of sediment from the bottom of the Hudson beginning in 2009, seven years and $500 million after G.E. agreed to undertake the job.
 Except this isn't one of the huge infrastructure projects that's driving G.E.'s bottom line these days; it's a government-mandated cleanup of pollutants the company dumped in the river long ago. It's also a task that G.E. routinely resisted for decades until Jeffrey R. Immelt, then the rookie chief executive, succumbed to federal pressure and abandoned the combative stance of his predecessor, John F. Welch Jr., and pledged to dredge the Hudson. 
 Toxic mud wasn't the only mess Mr. Immelt had to clean up when he took the reins from the legendary Mr. Welch in 2001. Along with dealing with a struggling reinsurance unit that forced G.E. to take billions in write-offs, a power turbine business poised to collapse and an overvalued stock, Mr. Immelt had the misfortune to move into the corner office just four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks altered the political landscape and the outlook for core G.E. franchises like jet engines and aircraft leasing.
 A cooler, humbler and more reserved chief executive than Mr. Welch, Mr. Immelt readily acknowledges that the last several years have not been easy.
 ''We've had to re-earn the respect of investors,'' he said in an interview in G.E.'s Manhattan offices atop 30 Rockefeller Center, home of the company's troubled NBC Universal franchise. But that's what happens ''when you write off $3 billion on reinsurance, sell stuff, buy things, and the earnings growth rate is 11 percent and it should be 15 percent.''
 Even so, the clock is ticking. There is growing pressure on Mr. Immelt to do something -- anything -- to get G.E.'s stock moving after six years of stagnation. Despite a 15 percent rally over the last two months, G.E. shares are still down 30 percent from their Welch-era peak. And in April, the analyst Jeffrey T. Sprague of Citigroup Investment Research stunned Wall Street by calling for a breakup of the company, urging Mr. Immelt to sell off NBC Universal, as well as the consumer finance and real estate units.
 Mr. Sprague's call was the equivalent of breaking china in G.E.'s executive dining room, and the company's top brass took it as a sign that Wall Street was running out of patience. Although NBC looks safe until after the broadcast of the Summer Olympics next year, Mr. Immelt is vowing to be ''tough-minded and investor-friendly'' in evaluating G.E.'s myriad holdings, while swearing off big acquisitions for the rest of this year. 
 No one expects Mr. Immelt, 51, to be forced out of the top job, but the longer the stock stays underwater the greater the likelihood that he will have to take the kind of drastic action that analysts like Mr. Sprague are urging. 
 All of which is reasonable: corporations hire C.E.O.s to make both prescient and hard choices. But Mr. Immelt faces a more complex challenge than his predecessors. Whereas Mr. Welch took over a company vulnerable to foreign competition and hamstrung by a bloated work force (and cut so many jobs that he earned the unwelcome sobriquet Neutron Jack), Mr. Immelt took over a giant that had been successful but wasn't growing as fast as smaller, more agile companies -- and which had a number of financial and operational time bombs in its portfolio. 
 ''Five years ago, we had troubled franchises and no liquidity,'' Mr. Immelt says. ''Think about being in the aircraft leasing and aircraft engine business on September 12.''
 To reinvigorate the corporate behemoth that is G.E., Mr. Immelt has made more than $75 billion worth of acquisitions in sectors like energy, aviation, water treatment and health care while selling off the division where he and Mr. Welch both began their careers, GE Plastics, for $11.6 billion in May. The result, says Mr. Immelt, ''is that the company in every way is different than it was in 2001.'' 
 Maybe so, but investors don't seem especially grateful. Even worse, shares of its archrival and Connecticut neighbor United Technologies have nearly doubled over the same period. So while the environmentalists who panned his predecessor -- not to mention the employees who feared Mr. Welch -- might vastly prefer Mr. Immelt, there is one group that still longs for the days of Neutron Jack: Wall Street analysts and institutional investors whose respect Mr. Immelt is desperately seeking before the calls for a breakup become too loud to ignore. 
 ''There's no drop-dead date, but he's going to hit his six-year anniversary,'' says Mr. Sprague, the Citigroup analyst. ''If the stock doesn't move, people will get more agitated.''
 For his part, Mr. Immelt is either too smart or too loyal to blame Mr. Welch for his troubles. ''It is what it is,'' he says. ''He couldn't have seen 9/11 coming.'' Mr. Immelt has spent almost his entire 25-year career at G.E. and Mr. Welch's legacy has clearly left an impression. 
 ''Jack Welch's track record was phenomenal,'' says Mr. Immelt, his voice slowing and growing deeper with emotion. ''I've had the opportunity to know hundreds of C.E.O.'s, and there's still not one I admire more than him.''
 Although Mr. Welch proclaims himself ''totally satisfied'' with Mr. Immelt's performance, he doesn't hide his feelings about G.E.'s slumbering stock. ''It's disappointing to all of us -- 'frustrated' is the word I'd use,'' he says in his trademark Boston rasp. ''It's below where it was when I left, but I haven't sold.'' 
 Mr. Welch vehemently disputes the notion that Mr. Immelt has been forced to clean up a financial mess, and he is equally adamant in his critique of calls to break up the company.
 ''It would be a tragedy of enormous proportions,'' he says. ''When you start talking like that, it's surrender.''
 OFFICIALLY, the Welch era at G.E. lasted 20 years, from the April day in 1981 when Mr. Welch took over from his predecessor, Reginald H. Jones, until he retired on Sept. 6, 2001. In reality, however, General Electric and Jeffrey Immelt are only now emerging from both Mr. Welch's shadow as well as what some people call the perfect storm that enveloped the 129-year-old company during the first half of this decade.
 Last week, after a solid second-quarter earnings report, G.E. shares hit a five-year high of $40.95, though still a far cry from the $60 level reached in 2000. Revenues came in at $42 billion, $1 billion higher than some analysts expected, enough to deliver the mid-teens percentage earnings growth Mr. Immelt has been promising Wall Street but failed to deliver last year. And environment-focused investors who wouldn't dream of buying G.E. stock under Mr. Welch are full of praise for Mr. Immelt's new ''Ecomagination'' initiative and are now eyeing it as a suitable investment. 
 ''I feel like we now have control over our own destiny for the first time in the last few years,'' Mr. Immelt says. ''There's no headwind.''
 Whether Mr. Immelt can keep his company's rebound on course has consequences that will extend far beyond 30 Rock or G.E.'s headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. That's because G.E. has always been more than just another company in the Fortune 500, where it ranked sixth last year after earning $20.8 billion on revenue of $168 billion. With six main divisions -- commercial finance, infrastructure, industrial, consumer finance, health care, and entertainment and media -- G.E. has long been a proxy for the overall health of corporate America. 
 And anything that hurts the nation's economy usually takes its toll on G.E. as well. The current crisis in subprime mortgages, for example, is underscored by a $500 million hit to earnings G.E. absorbed in the first half of the year.
 The company has long served as a C.E.O. boot camp and fertile territory for executive recruiters. Among headhunters, snaring a top G.E. name is akin to winning an Oscar; the runner-up to succeed Mr. Welch, W. James McNerney Jr., left G.E. to take over 3M and is now the chief executive of Boeing. (Robert L. Nardelli, another former G.E. star, went on to run Home Depot, but that's another story.)
 G.E.'s raw scale and visibility, and the regal status accorded to past holders of the top job, put Mr. Immelt into a very exclusive club. He's only the 12th man to hold the position since Thomas Edison founded G.E. Indeed, it can be lonely at the top, but Mr. Immelt has sought advice from Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He says he also regularly dines with fellow C.E.O.'s like Kenneth Chenault of American Express, Samuel Palmisano of I.B.M. and William Weldon of Johnson & Johnson.
 Unlike Mr. Buffett, though, Mr. Immelt isn't a hero to investors these days. And while Mr. Welch says ''my anticipation when I recommended Jeff for the job is that it would be 20 years and I see nothing that would change it,'' the reality is that things have changed. 
 The rise of hedge funds as well as activist investors and private-equity buyers all mean that even the likes of Jeffrey Immelt have to worry more about the next quarter rather than the next quarter-century. ''If it weren't for its size, you'd have to consider G.E. a premier go-private candidate,'' says one top banker who requested anonymity because he works closely with G.E.
 Unlike Mr. Welch, Mr. Immelt acknowledges that time isn't unlimited. ''Nobody is guaranteed 20 years,'' he says. ''Not me. Not anyone else.''
 So if the heat is on, why not break up the company? Or at least sell off noncore units like NBC Universal or the consumer finance unit, GE Money, which would not only raise billions but also make this colossus a heck of a lot easier for one man to manage? After all, Mr. Sprague says, ''when you visualize G.E., you're thinking about the meat and potatoes: power, aircraft engines, energy. You might get comfortable with GE Money, but hardly anyone is buying the stock because of GE Money.''
 In defending their stance, Mr. Immelt and other current executives don't fall back on Mr. Welch's no-surrender, last-man-standing rhetoric. Instead, they make a more subtle argument against breaking up the company: Not only does being a conglomerate help G.E. ride out the inevitable ups and downs of the economic cycle, it also creates those elusive synergies that most other companies only talk about. 
 For example, G.E.'s sponsorship of the Summer Olympics in Beijing next year has given G.E.'s infrastructure unit a leg up in winning lucrative orders for locomotives and power turbines from Chinese buyers, according to G.E. executives. What's more, says John G. Rice, the head of G.E.'s infrastructure division, managers are expected to reach across and work with colleagues in far-flung parts of the company. In fact, they don't have much of a choice.
 ''If you're reluctant to do it,'' Mr. Rice says, ''we're going to have a sit-down.''
 IN his understated way, Mr. Immelt is emphatic about G.E's strength as a conglomerate, underscoring the long-term thinking that's made G.E. the only original member of the Dow Jones industrials to retain its place in the index. But in the end, the only way for Mr. Immelt to win the argument and keep both his job and the company whole is for G.E.'s shares to move higher. As Steve Tusa, who covers G.E. for JPMorgan Chase, says: ''The bottom line in this business is stock price performance.''
 Short of a breakup, observers like Mr. Tusa say Mr. Immelt has to focus on the company's huge infrastructure business, G.E.'s largest division in terms of revenue. ''Infrastructure is carrying the company and that's a good thing,'' says Mr. Tusa, citing surging orders for locomotives, power turbines, jet engines and other big-iron products that boast fat margins and lucrative long-term service contracts. ''That's why you buy G.E., and he needs to keep that up.'' 
 At the same time, G.E. must continue to cut costs at struggling divisions like NBC, which remains stuck in last place among the big four networks in prime time. And with consumer finance showing earnings growth of less than 10 percent, shedding it might not be such a bad idea. ''It has limited synergies with the rest of the portfolio,'' Mr. Tusa says.
 Mr. Immelt must also demonstrate what analysts politely term ''disciplined capital allocation'' -- that is, not overpaying for acquisitions. In the two months after G.E.'s announcement in January that it was spending $8.1 billion for Abbott Laboratories' diagnostic unit, G.E. shares fell 10 percent, causing $40 billion worth of market capitalization to evaporate. In mid-July, Mr. Immelt abandoned the Abbott deal and appeased investors with an expanded $14 billion share buyback. 
 Analysts say that's the kind of shareholder-friendly approach that enabled Mr. Welch to reign for 20 years at G.E., and they say it's something Mr. Immelt needs to emulate if he is to repeat that run. 
 ONE of the perks of retirement for C.E.O.'s is not having to court -- or bully -- Wall Street analysts. So when the subject of Mr. Sprague's report about breaking up G.E. is raised, Mr. Welch dismisses it outright. ''That talk is short-term analyst talk,'' he barks. ''I heard it from 1981 on, when I first got in there.''
 Not one to bark, the 6-foot-4 Mr. Immelt is preternaturally relaxed and affable. He has always been like that, acquaintances say. Mr. Immelt played intramural basketball with another future chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, at Harvard Business School and he jokes that Mr. Dimon was the one who yelled during hoop games. Longtime associates can't recall Mr. Immelt ever raising his voice, unlike the famously temperamental Mr. Welch.
 Although no one disputes Mr. Welch's success as a manager -- G.E. shares rose a stunning 4,000 percent over the course of his 20-year tenure -- working for him could be brutal. Jerome L. Dodson, president of Parnassus Investments, a money management firm that screens for socially responsible stocks, even cites Mr. Welch's hard-nosed management style as one of the reasons his firm wouldn't invest in G.E. ''The company wasn't a good place to work in our opinion,'' Mr. Dodson says. (He is now eyeing the shares.)
 While Mr. Welch was obsessed with internal productivity gains, Mr. Immelt is more focused on sales and marketing, says one former associate.
 ''He puts a bigger spotlight on a different crowd,'' says David Calhoun, who ran G.E.'s infrastructure business before leaving last September to run Nielsen, the market research giant. ''With Jeff, the worst possible thing is if you lose a sale and you don't feel bad about it.''
 Even so, it's clear that the new regime is kinder and gentler. ''Jeff probably lets the conversation go on longer then Jack did,'' says Lorraine Bolsinger, a 26-year company veteran who heads G.E.'s new Ecomagination project, which seeks to develop more efficient products that will both help the environment and better serve customers. ''You always feel it's worth a shot to make your point. There's no fear that if I suggest something or take a risk, I'll be ridiculed.''
 Given his stance on cleaning up the Hudson and on other environmental hot buttons, it's hard to conceive of Ecomagination under Mr. Welch. It has its roots in a 2004 ''growth playbook'' session, the annual ritual in which G.E. managers outline a three- to five-year growth strategy. Customers were concerned about global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, and also eager to save money on energy costs, Ms. Bolsinger recalls. 
 ''Jeff's view was that we could use this to our advantage or be at the mercy of it,'' she says. ''And that's a place we never want to be.''
 The Ecomagination line now features 45 products with $12 billion in sales. Although skeptics might look upon Ecomagination as the latest version of corporate ''greenwashing,'' it has impressed socially conscious investors with memories of Mr. Welch.
 ''G.E. used to be stuck in the past,'' says Bennett Freeman, senior vice president for social research and policy at the Calvert Group, an investment company. ''But the effect of G.E. and Ecomagination is huge. When G.E. commits to renewable energy, the argument is over in corporate America.''
 Mr. Immelt and Ms. Bolsinger say that the point of Ecomagination isn't to save the planet but to make money. And the best evidence that G.E. can do both lies in a windowless Greenville, S.C., plant that is the largest gas turbine factory in the world. 
 Alongside huge gas-fired turbines destined for Saudi Arabia -- half of G.E.'s overall revenue comes from overseas customers, and the Middle East in particular is booming -- workers are busy assembling ultra-efficient wind turbines as quickly as they can get the components. Since G.E. acquired the wind unit from Enron after it went bankrupt in 2001, annual sales have grown to more than $4 billion from $500 million, and the $2 million machines are nearly sold out until late 2009. The wind turbines contain some 8,000 different parts, says Frank Ferraro, a manager at the plant, ''but we can do the final assembly in less than a week.''
 G.E.'s success in Greenville is an impressive example of its prowess when it comes to sophisticated manufacturing, as well as a sign that Ecomagination is more than just another slogan.
 Ultimately, however, the kind of green initiative that Wall Street cares about most can't be measured in carbon emissions or employee accolades, but in dollar signs. If Mr. Immelt has any doubt about that, all he has to do is consult the first of Mr. Welch's six rules for successful leadership: ''Control your destiny, or someone else will.''

HEADLINE: The Antiwar, Anti-Abortion, Anti-Drug-Enforcement-Administration, Anti-Medicare Candidacy Of Dr. Ron Paul

BYLINE: By Christopher Caldwell. 
Christopher Caldwell, a contributing writer, last wrote for the magazine about Turkish immigrants in Germany.

 BODY:
Whipping westward across Manhattan in a limousine sent by Comedy Central's ''Daily Show,'' Ron Paul, the 10-term Texas congressman and long-shot Republican presidential candidate, is being briefed. Paul has only the most tenuous familiarity with Comedy Central. He has never heard of ''The Daily Show.'' His press secretary, Jesse Benton, is trying to explain who its host, Jon Stewart, is. ''He's an affable gentleman,'' Benton says, ''and he's very smart. What I'm getting from the pre-interview is, he's sympathetic.''
Paul nods.
 ''GQ wants to profile you on Thursday,'' Benton continues. ''I think it's worth doing.'' 
 ''GTU?'' the candidate replies.
 ''GQ. It's a men's magazine.''
 ''Don't know much about that,'' Paul says. 
 Thin to the point of gauntness, polite to the point of daintiness, Ron Paul is a 71-year-old great-grandfather, a small-town doctor, a self-educated policy intellectual and a formidable stander on constitutional principle. In normal times, Paul might be -- indeed, has been -- the kind of person who is summoned onto cable television around April 15 to ventilate about whether the federal income tax violates the Constitution. But Paul has in recent weeks become a sensation in magazines he doesn't read, on Web sites he has never visited and on television shows he has never watched. 
 Alone among Republican candidates for the presidency, Paul has always opposed the Iraq war. He blames ''a dozen or two neocons who got control of our foreign policy,'' chief among them Vice President Dick Cheney and the former Bush advisers Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle, for the debacle. On the assumption that a bad situation could get worse if the war spreads into Iran, he has a simple plan. It is: ''Just leave.'' During a May debate in South Carolina, he suggested the 9/11 attacks could be attributed to United States policy. ''Have you ever read about the reasons they attacked us?'' he asked, referring to one of Osama bin Laden's communiques. ''They attack us because we've been over there. We've been bombing Iraq for 10 years.'' Rudolph Giuliani reacted by demanding a retraction, drawing gales of applause from the audience. But the incident helped Paul too. Overnight, he became the country's most conspicuous antiwar Republican.
 Paul's opposition to the war in Iraq did not come out of nowhere. He was against the first gulf war, the war in Kosovo and the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which he called a ''declaration of virtual war.'' Although he voted after Sept. 11 to approve the use of force in Afghanistan and spend $40 billion in emergency appropriations, he has sounded less thrilled with those votes as time has passed. ''I voted for the authority and the money,'' he now says. ''I thought it was misused.''
 There is something homespun about Paul, reminiscent of ''Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.'' He communicates with his constituents through birthday cards, August barbecues and the cookbooks his wife puts together every election season, which mix photos of grandchildren, Gospel passages and neighbors' recipes for Velveeta cheese fudge and Cherry Coke salad. He is listed in the phone book, and his constituents call him at home. But there is also something cosmopolitan and radical about him; his speeches can bring to mind the World Social Forum or the French international-affairs periodical Le Monde Diplomatique. Paul is surely the only congressman who would cite the assertion of the left-leaning Chennai-based daily The Hindu that ''the world is being asked today, in reality, to side with the U.S. as it seeks to strengthen its economic hegemony.'' The word ''empire'' crops up a lot in his speeches. 
 This side of Paul has made him the candidate of many people, on both the right and the left, who hope that something more consequential than a mere change of party will come out of the 2008 elections. He is particularly popular among the young and the wired. Except for Barack Obama, he is the most-viewed candidate on YouTube. He is the most ''friended'' Republican on MySpace.com. Paul understands that his chances of winning the presidency are infinitesimally slim. He is simultaneously planning his next Congressional race. But in Paul's idea of politics, spreading a message has always been just as important as seizing office. ''Politicians don't amount to much,'' he says, ''but ideas do.'' Although he is still in the low single digits in polls, he says he has raised $2.4 million in the second quarter, enough to broaden the four-state campaign he originally planned into a national one. 
 Paul represents a different Republican Party from the one that Iraq, deficits and corruption have soured the country on. In late June, despite a life of antitax agitation and churchgoing, he was excluded from a Republican forum sponsored by Iowa antitax and Christian groups. His school of Republicanism, which had its last serious national airing in the Goldwater campaign of 1964, stands for a certain idea of the Constitution -- the idea that much of the power asserted by modern presidents has been usurped from Congress, and that much of the power asserted by Congress has been usurped from the states. Though Paul acknowledges flaws in both the Constitution (it included slavery) and the Bill of Rights (it doesn't go far enough), he still thinks a comprehensive array of positions can be drawn from them: Against gun control. For the sovereignty of states. And against foreign-policy adventures. Paul was the Libertarian Party's presidential candidate in 1988. But his is a less exuberant libertarianism than you find, say, in the pages of Reason magazine.
 Over the years, this vision has won most favor from those convinced the country is going to hell in a handbasket. The attention Paul has captured tells us a lot about the prevalence of such pessimism today, about the instability of partisan allegiances and about the seldom-avowed common ground between the hard right and the hard left. His message draws on the noblest traditions of American decency and patriotism; it also draws on what the historian Richard Hofstadter called the paranoid style in American politics.
 Financial Armageddon
 Paul grew up in the western Pennsylvania town of Green Tree. His father, the son of a German immigrant, ran a small dairy company. Sports were big around there -- one of the customers on the milk route Paul worked as a teenager was the retired baseball Hall of Famer Honus Wagner -- and Paul was a terrific athlete, winning a state track meet in the 220 and excelling at football and baseball. But knee injuries had ended his sports career by the time he went off to Gettysburg College in 1953. After medical school at Duke, Paul joined the Air Force, where he served as a flight surgeon, tending to the ear, nose and throat ailments of pilots, and traveling to Iran, Ethiopia and elsewhere. ''I recall doing a lot of physicals on Army warrant officers who wanted to become helicopter pilots and go to Vietnam,'' he told me. ''They were gung-ho. I've often thought about how many of those people never came back.'' 
 Paul is given to mulling things over morally. His family was pious and Lutheran; two of his brothers became ministers. Paul's five children were baptized in the Episcopal church, but he now attends a Baptist one. He doesn't travel alone with women and once dressed down an aide for using the expression ''red-light district'' in front of a female colleague. As a young man, though, he did not protest the Vietnam War, which he now calls ''totally unnecessary'' and ''illegal.'' Much later, after the United States invaded Iraq in 2003, he began reading St. Augustine. ''I was annoyed by the evangelicals' being so supportive of pre-emptive war, which seems to contradict everything that I was taught as a Christian,'' he recalls. ''The religion is based on somebody who's referred to as the Prince of Peace.'' 
 In 1968, Paul settled in southern Texas, where he had been stationed. He recalls that he was for a while the only obstetrician -- ''a very delightful part of medicine,'' he says -- in Brazoria County. He was already immersed in reading the economics books that would change his life. Americans know the ''Austrian school,'' if at all, from the work of Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig von Mises, two economists who fled the Nazis in the 1930s and whose free-market doctrines helped inspire the conservative movement in the 1950s. The laws of economics don't admit exceptions, say the Austrians. You cannot fake out markets, no matter how surreptitiously you expand the money supply. Spend more than you earn, and you are on the road to inflation and tyranny. 
 Such views are not always Republican orthodoxy. Paul is a harsh critic of the Federal Reserve, both for its policies and its unaccountability. ''We first bonded,'' recalls Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, ''because we were both conspicuous nonworshipers at the Temple of the Fed and of the High Priest Greenspan.'' In recent weeks, Paul's airport reading has been a book called ''Financial Armageddon.'' He is obsessed with sound money, which he considers -- along with the related phenomena of credit excess, bubbles and uncollateralized assets of all kinds -- a ''sleeper issue.'' The United States ought to link its currency to gold or silver again, Paul says. He puts his money where his mouth is. According to Federal Election Commission documents, most of his investments are in gold and silver and are worth between $1.5 and $3.5 million. It's a modest sum by the standards of major presidential candidates but impressive for someone who put five children through college on a doctor's (and later a congressman's) earnings. 
 For Paul, everything comes back to money, including Iraq. ''No matter how much you love the empire,'' he says, ''it's unaffordable.'' Wars are expensive, and there has been a tendency throughout history to pay for them by borrowing. A day of reckoning always comes, says Paul, and one will come for us. Speaking this spring before the libertarian Future of Freedom Foundation in Reston, Va., he warned of a dollar crisis. ''That's usually the way empires end,'' he said. ''It wasn't us forcing the Soviets to build missiles that brought them down. It was the fact that socialism doesn't work. Our system doesn't work much better.'' 
 Under the banner of ''Freedom, Honesty and Sound Money,'' Paul ran for Congress in 1974. He lost -- but took the seat in a special election in April 1976. He lost again in November of that year, then won in 1978. On two big issues, he stood on principle and was vindicated: He was one of very few Republicans in Congress to back Ronald Reagan against Gerald Ford for the 1976 Republican nomination. He was also one of the representatives who warned against the rewriting of banking rules that laid the groundwork for the savings-and-loan collapse of the 1980s. Paul served three terms before losing to Phil Gramm in the Republican primary for Senate in 1984. Tom DeLay took over his seat.
 Paul would not come back to Washington for another dozen years. But in the time he could spare from delivering babies in Brazoria County, he remained a mighty presence in the out-of-the-limelight world of those old-line libertarians who had never made their peace with the steady growth of federal power in the 20th century. Paul got the Libertarian Party nomination for president in 1988, defeating the Indian activist Russell Means in a tough race. He finished third behind Bush and Dukakis, winning nearly half a million votes. He tended his own Foundation for Rational Economics and Education (FREE) and kept up his contacts with other market-oriented organizations. What resulted was a network of true believers who would be his political base in one of the stranger Congressional elections of modern times.
 A Lone Wolf
 In the first days of 1995, just weeks after the Republican landslide, Paul traveled to Washington and, through DeLay, made contact with the Texas Republican delegation. He told them he could beat the Democratic incumbent Greg Laughlin in the reconfigured Gulf Coast district that now included his home. Republicans had their own ideas. In June 1995, Laughlin announced he would run in the next election as a Republican. Laughlin says he had discussed switching parties with Newt Gingrich, the next speaker, before the Republicans even took power. Paul suspects to this day that the Republicans wooed Laughlin to head off his candidacy. Whatever happened, it didn't work. Paul challenged Laughlin in the primary.
 ''At first, we kind of blew him off,'' recalls the longtime Texas political consultant Royal Masset. '' 'Oh, there's Ron Paul!' But very quickly, we realized he was getting far more money than anybody.'' Much of it came from out of state, from the free-market network Paul built up while far from Congress. His candidacy was a problem not just for Laughlin. It also threatened to halt the stream of prominent Democrats then switching parties -- for what sane incumbent would switch if he couldn't be assured the Republican nomination? The result was a heavily funded effort by the National Republican Congressional Committee to defeat Paul in the primary. The National Rifle Association made an independent expenditure against him. Former President George H.W. Bush, Gov. George W. Bush and both Republican senators endorsed Laughlin. Paul had only two prominent backers: the tax activist Steve Forbes and the pitcher Nolan Ryan, Paul's constituent and old friend, who cut a number of ads for him. They were enough. Paul edged Laughlin in a runoff and won an equally narrow general election. 
 Republican opposition may not have made Paul distrust the party, but beating its network with his own homemade one revealed that he didn't necessarily need the party either. Paul looks back on that race and sees something in common with his quixotic bid for the presidency. ''I always think that if I do things like that and get clobbered, I can excuse myself,'' he says.
 Anyone who is elected to Congress three times as a nonincumbent, as Paul has been, is a politician of prodigious gifts. Especially since Paul has real vulnerabilities in his district. For Eric Dondero, who plans to challenge him in the Republican Congressional primary next fall, foreign policy is Paul's central failing. Dondero, who is 44, was Paul's aide and sometime spokesman for more than a decade. According to Dondero, ''When 9/11 happened, he just completely changed. One of the first things he said was not how awful the tragedy was . . . it was, 'Now we're gonna get big government.' '' 
 Dondero claims that Paul's vote to authorize force in Afghanistan was made only after warnings from a longtime staffer that voting otherwise would cost him Victoria, a pivotal city in his district. (''Completely false,'' Paul says.) One day just after the Iraq invasion, when Dondero was driving Paul around the district, the two had words. ''He said he did not want to have someone on staff who did not support him 100 percent on foreign policy,'' Dondero recalls. Paul says Dondero's outspoken enthusiasm for the military's ''shock and awe'' strategy made him an awkward spokesman for an antiwar congressman. The two parted on bad terms.
 A larger vulnerability may be that voters want more pork-barrel spending than Paul is willing to countenance. In a rice-growing, cattle-ranching district, Paul consistently votes against farm subsidies. In the very district where, on the night of Sept. 8, 1900, a storm destroyed the city of Galveston, leaving 6,000 dead, and where repairs from Hurricane Rita and refugees from Hurricane Katrina continue to exact a toll, he votes against FEMA and flood aid. In a district that is home to many employees of the Johnson Space Center, he votes against financing NASA.
 The Victoria Advocate, an influential newspaper in the district, has generally opposed Paul for re-election, on the grounds that a ''lone wolf'' cannot get the highway and homeland-security financing the district needs. So how does he get re-elected? Tim Delaney, the paper's editorial-page editor, says: ''Ron Paul is a very charismatic person. He has charm. He does not alter his position ever. His ideals are high. If a little old man calls up from the farm and says, 'I need a wheelchair,' he'll get the damn wheelchair for him.''
 Paul may have refused on principle to accept Medicare when he practiced medicine. He may return a portion of his Congressional office budget every year. But his staff has the reputation of fighting doggedly to collect Social Security checks, passports, military decorations, immigrant-visa extensions and any emolument to which constituents are entitled by law. According to Jackie Gloor, who runs Paul's Victoria office: ''So many times, people say to us, 'We don't like his vote.' But they trust his heart.''
 In Congress, Paul is generally admired for his fidelity to principle and lack of ego. ''He is one of the easiest people in Congress to work with, because he bases his positions on the merits of issues,'' says Barney Frank, who has worked with Paul on efforts to ease the regulation of gambling and medical marijuana. ''He is independent but not ornery.'' Paul has made a habit of objecting to things that no one else objects to. In October 2001, he was one of three House Republicans to vote against the USA Patriot Act. He was the sole House member of either party to vote against the Financial Antiterrorism Act (final tally: 412-1). In 1999, he was the only naysayer in a 424-1 vote in favor of casting a medal to honor Rosa Parks. Nothing against Rosa Parks: Paul voted against similar medals for Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II. He routinely opposes resolutions that presume to advise foreign governments how to run their affairs: He has refused to condemn Robert Mugabe's violence against Zimbabwean citizens (421-1), to call on Vietnam to release political prisoners (425-1) or to ask the League of Arab States to help stop the killing in Darfur (425-1).
 Every Thursday, Paul is the host of a luncheon for a circle of conservative Republicans that he calls the Liberty Caucus. It has become the epicenter of antiwar Republicanism in Washington. One stalwart member is Walter Jones, the North Carolina Republican who during the debate over Iraq suggested renaming French fries ''freedom fries'' in the House dining room, but who has passed the years since in vocal opposition to the war. Another is John (Jimmy) Duncan of Tennessee, the only Republican besides Paul who voted against the war and remains in the House. Other regulars include Virgil Goode of Virginia, Roscoe Bartlett of Maryland and Scott Garrett of New Jersey. Zach Wamp of Tennessee and Jeff Flake, the Arizonan scourge of pork-barrel spending, visit occasionally. Not all are antiwar, but many of the speakers Paul invites are: the former C.I.A. analyst Michael Scheuer, the intelligence-world journalist James Bamford and such disillusioned United States Army officers as William Odom, Gregory Newbold and Lawrence Wilkerson (Colin Powell's former chief of staff), among others.
 In today's Washington, Paul's combination of radical libertarianism and conservatism is unusual. Sometimes the first impulse predominates. He was the only Texas Republican to vote against last year's Federal Marriage Amendment, meant to stymie gay marriage. He detests the federal war on drugs; the LSD guru Timothy Leary held a fundraiser for him in 1988. Sometimes he is more conservative. He opposed the recent immigration bill on the grounds that it constituted amnesty. At a breakfast for conservative journalists in the offices of Americans for Tax Reform this May, he spoke resentfully of being required to treat penurious immigrants in emergency rooms -- ''patients who were more likely to sue you than anybody else,'' having children ''who became automatic citizens the next day.'' (Paul champions a constitutional amendment to end birthright citizenship.) While he backs free trade in theory, he opposes many of the institutions and arrangements -- from the World Trade Organization to Nafta -- that promote it in practice.
 Paul also opposes abortion, which he believes should be addressed at the state level, not the national one. He remembers seeing a late abortion performed during his residency, years before Roe v. Wade, and he maintains it left an impression on him. ''It was pretty dramatic for me,'' he says, ''to see a two-and-a-half-pound baby taken out crying and breathing and put in a bucket.''
 The Owl-God Moloch
 Paul's message is not new. You could have heard it in 1964 or 1975 or 1991 at the conclaves of those conservatives who were considered outside the mainstream of the Republican Party. Back then, most Republicans appeared reconciled to a strong federal government, if only to do the expensive job of defending the country against Communism. But when the Berlin Wall fell, the dormant institutions and ideologies of pre-cold-war conservatism began to stir. In his 1992 and 1996 campaigns, Pat Buchanan was the first politician to express and exploit this change, breathing life into the motto ''America First'' (if not the organization of that name, which opposed entry into World War II). 
 Like Buchanan, Paul draws on forgotten traditions. His top aides are unimpeachably Republican but stand at a distance from the party as it has evolved over the decades. His chief of staff, Tom Lizardo, worked for Pat Robertson and Bill Miller Jr. (the son of Barry Goldwater's vice-presidential nominee). His national campaign organizer, Lew Moore, worked for the late congressman Jack Metcalf of Washington State, another Goldwaterite. At the grass roots, Paul's New Hampshire primary campaign stresses gun rights and relies on anti-abortion and tax activists from the organizations of Buchanan and the state's former maverick senator, Bob Smith.
 Paul admires Robert Taft, the isolationist Ohio senator known during the Truman administration as Mr. Republican, who tried to rally Republicans against United States participation in NATO. Taft lost the Republican nomination in 1952 to Dwight Eisenhower and died the following year. ''Now, of course,'' Paul says, ''I quote Eisenhower when he talks about the military-industrial complex. But I quote Taft when he suits my purposes too.'' Particularly on NATO, from which Paul, too, would like to withdraw.
 The question is whether the old ideologies being resurrected are neglected wisdom or discredited nonsense. In the 1996 general election, Paul's Democratic opponent Lefty Morris held a press conference to air several shocking quotes from a newsletter that Paul published during his decade away from Washington. Passages described the black male population of Washington as ''semi-criminal or entirely criminal'' and stated that ''by far the most powerful lobby in Washington of the bad sort is the Israeli government.'' Morris noted that a Canadian neo-Nazi Web site had listed Paul's newsletter as a laudably ''racialist'' publication.
 Paul survived these revelations. He later explained that he had not written the passages himself -- quite believably, since the style diverges widely from his own. But his response to the accusations was not transparent. When Morris called on him to release the rest of his newsletters, he would not. He remains touchy about it. ''Even the fact that you're asking this question infers, 'Oh, you're an anti-Semite,' '' he told me in June. Actually, it doesn't. Paul was in Congress when Israel bombed Iraq's Osirak nuclear plant in 1981 and -- unlike the United Nations and the Reagan administration -- defended its right to do so. He says Saudi Arabia has an influence on Washington equal to Israel's. His votes against support for Israel follow quite naturally from his opposition to all foreign aid. There is no sign that they reflect any special animus against the Jewish state.
 What is interesting is Paul's idea that the identity of the person who did write those lines is ''of no importance.'' Paul never deals in disavowals or renunciations or distancings, as other politicians do. In his office one afternoon in June, I asked about his connections to the John Birch Society. ''Oh, my goodness, the John Birch Society!'' he said in mock horror. ''Is that bad? I have a lot of friends in the John Birch Society. They're generally well educated, and they understand the Constitution. I don't know how many positions they would have that I don't agree with. Because they're real strict constitutionalists, they don't like the war, they're hard-money people. . . . '' 
 Paul's ideological easygoingness is like a black hole that attracts the whole universe of individuals and groups who don't recognize themselves in the politics they see on TV. To hang around with his impressively large crowd of supporters before and after the CNN debate in Manchester, N.H., in June, was to be showered with privately printed newsletters full of exclamation points and capital letters, scribbled-down U.R.L.'s for Web sites about the Free State Project, which aims to turn New Hampshire into a libertarian enclave, and copies of the cult DVD ''America: Freedom to Fascism.'' 
 Victor Carey, a 45-year-old, muscular, mustachioed self-described ''patriot'' who wears a black baseball cap with a skull and crossbones on it, drove up from Sykesville, Md., to show his support for Paul. He laid out some of his concerns. ''The people who own the Federal Reserve own the oil companies, they own the mass media, they own the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, they're part of the Bilderbergers, and unfortunately their spiritual practices are very wicked and diabolical as well,'' Carey said. ''They go to a place out in California known as the Bohemian Grove, and there's been footage obtained by infiltration of what their practices are. And they do mock human sacrifices to an owl-god called Moloch. This is true. Go research it yourself.''
 Two grandmothers from North Carolina who painted a Winnebago red, white and blue were traveling around the country, stumping for Ron Paul, defending the Constitution and warning about the new ''North American Union.'' Asked whether this is something that would arise out of Nafta, Betty Smith of Chapel Hill, N.C., replied: ''It's already arisen. They're building the highway. Guess what! The Spanish company building the highway -- they're gonna get the tolls. Giuliani's law firm represents that Spanish company. Giuliani's been anointed a knight by the Queen. Guess what! Read the Constitution. That's not allowed!''
 Paul is not a conspiracy theorist, but he has a tendency to talk in that idiom. In a floor speech shortly after the toppling of the Taliban in Afghanistan, he mentioned Unocal's desire to tap the region's energy and concluded, ''We should not be surprised now that many contend that the plan for the U.N. to 'nation-build' in Afghanistan is a logical and important consequence of this desire.'' But when push comes to shove, Paul is not among the ''many'' who ''contend'' this. ''I think oil and gas is part of it,'' he explains. ''But it's not the issue. If that were the only issue, it wouldn't have happened. The main reason was to get the Taliban out.''
 Last winter at a meet-the-candidate house party in New Hampshire, students representing a group called Student Scholars for 9/11 Truth asked Paul whether he believed the official investigation into the Sept. 11 attacks was credible. ''I never automatically trust anything the government does when they do an investigation,'' Paul replied, ''because too often I think there's an area that the government covered up, whether it's the Kennedy assassination or whatever.'' The exchange was videotaped and ricocheted around the Internet for a while. But Paul's patience with the ''Truthers,'' as they call themselves, does not make him one himself. ''Even at the time it happened, I believe the information was fairly clear that Al Qaeda was involved,'' he told me.
 ''Every Wacko Fringe Group
 In the Country''
 One evening in mid-June, 86 members of a newly formed Ron Paul Meetup group gathered in a room in the Pasadena convention center. It was a varied crowd, preoccupied by the war, including many disaffected Democrats. Via video link from Virginia, Paul's campaign chairman, Kent Snyder, spoke to the group ''of a coming-together of the old guard and the new.'' Then Connie Ruffley, co-chairwoman of United Republicans of California (UROC), addressed the crowd. UROC was founded during the 1964 presidential campaign to fight off challenges to Goldwater from Rockefeller Republicanism. Since then it has lain dormant but not dead -- waiting, like so many other old right-wing groups, for someone or something to kiss it back to life. UROC endorsed Paul at its spring convention. 
 That night, Ruffley spoke about her past with the John Birch Society and asked how many in the room were members (quite a few, as it turned out). She referred to the California senator Dianne Feinstein as ''Fine-Swine,'' and got quickly to Israel, raising the Israeli attack on the American Naval signals ship Liberty during the Six-Day War. Some people were pleased. Others walked out. Others sent angry e-mails that night. Several said they would not return. The head of the Pasadena Meetup group, Bill Dumas, sent a desperate letter to Paul headquarters asking for guidance: 
 ''We're in a difficult position of working on a campaign that draws supporters from laterally opposing points of view, and we have the added bonus of attracting every wacko fringe group in the country. And in a Ron Paul Meetup many people will consider each other 'wackos' for their beliefs whether that is simply because they're liberal, conspiracy theorists, neo-Nazis, evangelical Christian, etc. . . . We absolutely must focus on Ron's message only and put aside all other agendas, which anyone can save for the next 'Star Trek' convention or whatever.''
 But what is ''Ron's message''? Whatever the campaign purports to be about, the main thing it has done thus far is to serve as a clearinghouse for voters who feel unrepresented by mainstream Republicans and Democrats. The antigovernment activists of the right and the antiwar activists of the left have many differences, maybe irreconcilable ones. But they have a lot of common beliefs too, and their numbers -- and anger -- are of a considerable magnitude. Ron Paul will not be the next president of the United States. But his candidacy gives us a good hint about the country the next president is going to have to knit back together.

HEADLINE: Flood-Damaged Souls Finding Opportunity

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
In his latest novel James Lee Burke bears witness to ''all the events that had turned a gingerbread Caribbean city into food for every kind of jackal in the book'': the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Few writers are as expertly equipped for this task. Mr. Burke has long celebrated the rollicking joys of New Orleans, a city he has described as ''the Great Whore of Babylon'' in homage to its wild side. He was full of allusions about his beloved city long before a link to Atlantis became one of them. 
 In the aftermath of the destruction, he wrote eloquent, hyperbolic nonfiction in New Orleans's honor. ''New Orleans isn't a city,'' he said in an op-ed article for The Los Angeles Times. ''It's a Petrarchan sonnet.'' At that time he presented the same basic analysis of the city's troubles that shapes his latest novel, ''The Tin Roof Blowdown.'' Even before the tidal surge hit, thanks to cuts in federal aid and an influx of crack cocaine, Mr. Burke's New Orleans was an accident waiting to happen. 
 Although ''The Tin Roof Blowdown'' describes the storm and its horrors, Mr. Burke does not dwell on their shock value. He leaves that to others and moves on to tell his own kind of story. 
 Like the novelists who have most effectively captured the impact on New York of the World Trade Center collapse, he concentrates more intensely on his characters' inner lives than on the havoc around them. In Mr. Burke's universe of knights and grifters the post-Hurricane Katrina days are full of opportunity. The chaos tears off the veneers of civilized character to show what these people are really made of.
 The illusion of safety is at the heart of this book. The story includes a white couple, Otis and Melanie Baylor, who go to bed in a warm, dry house with a generator while their fellow citizens are drowning. And the Baylors feel perfectly entitled to their good fortune. Otis is a decent insurance man; he will help claimants get around the semantics that could allow insurers to dodge payment for flood damage. That Otis grew up in Alabama watching his father and uncle attend Ku Klux Klan cross lightings has not intruded upon the Baylors' cocoon.
 But something changed horribly after Otis's teenage daughter (and Melanie's stepdaughter) was abducted and raped by a group of black men two years ago. So when, during the storm, he looks outside his well-lighted home to see black looters boating through his neighborhood, Otis snaps. He makes a racist remark that startles even his most boorish rich neighbors. But when shots are fired at the looters, killing one and gravely wounding another, Otis claims innocent bystander status.
 The looters literally strip away at the Baylors' kind of world. They take a crowbar to a grand old house nearby that is full of flowers. ''What kind of people put flower vases in every room in the house right before a hurricane?'' wonders Eddy Melancon, one of the hapless criminals who figure even more importantly in the novel than the Baylors do. Answer: People who own a flower shop but mostly use it as a front. The florist, Sidney Kovick, is the most vengeful and vicious mobster in town.
 The looters have ripped some improbable contraband out of Sidney's walls before Eddy is shot and wounded. This leaves Eddy's brother, Bertrand, in a hopeless bind. How can he save his brother from both a gunshot wound and the many-tentacled gangster who has set his henchmen on the Melancons' trail? 
 ''Hey, kid, if you stole anything from Sidney Kovick, mail it to him COD from Alaska, then buy a gun and shoot yourself,'' says Clete Purcel, who plays Sancho Panza to the series's main character, Dave Robicheaux. ''With luck, he won't find your grave.'' 
 Wherever Clete appears, spouting choice examples of the local lingo (''Nobody jacks the Big Sleazy when the Bobbsey Twins from Homicide are on the job''), Dave, is seldom far away. Dave is Mr. Burke's sage detective with a long, checkered history of both bravery and trouble. ''He said the policeman was a drunk but he was a good man who tried to help people who didn't have no power,'' one flood victim says to Dave (now sober enough to invoke the precepts of Alcoholics Anonymous frequently). ''Isn't that you he was talking about?'' 
 Indeed it is. And now that Dave has been sent from his home base in New Iberia to take on emergency duty in New Orleans, his wisdom and spiritual generosity are much in demand. It takes Dave to penetrate the racial and economic barriers that separate this book's characters and assess the mettle of each individual. 
 In Mr. Burke's universe, some of the saddest storm victims are those who committed terrible sins in a time of crisis and wish they could undo the transgressions. But like George Pelecanos's Washington, Mr. Burke's New Orleans is a place where the destinies of ghetto-bred young black men are all but determined at birth. 
 Mr. Burke sometimes shows an overheated, lyrical bent, and the extremes of Hurricane Katrina make it especially pronounced. ''Perhaps it was my imagination,'' Dave thinks, ''but I could almost feel a great weight oppressing the land, a darkness stealing across its surface, a theft of light that seemed to have no origin.'' 
 Whether invoking William Blake's tiger or Voltaire's Candide, Dave thinks big. He reaches for literary as well as biblical terms to convey the apocalyptic magnitude of New Orleans's collapse. Never does he put it more succinctly than this: ''We saw an American city turned into Baghdad.'' 
 A Harry Potter footnote: The Potter books are so ubiquitous that they even turn up inside this one. One of Mr. Burke's miscreants craftily claims to have been ''reading a Harry Potter book aloud to a roomful of Alzheimer patients.'' They can't vouch for that alibi.

HEADLINE: The French Connections

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
There was a time when everyone thought that the Europeans and the Japanese were better at business than we were. In the early 1990s airport bookstores were full of volumes with samurai warriors on their covers, promising to teach you the secrets of Japanese business success. Lester Thurow's 1992 book, ''Head to Head: The Coming Economic Battle Among Japan, Europe and America,'' which spent more than six months on the Times best-seller list, predicted that Europe would win.
 Then it all changed, and American despondency turned into triumphalism. Partly this was because the Clinton boom contrasted so sharply with Europe's slow growth and Japan's decade-long slump. Above all, however, our new confidence reflected the rise of the Internet. Jacques Chirac complained that the Internet was an ''Anglo-Saxon network,'' and he had a point -- France, like most of Europe except Scandinavia, lagged far behind the U.S. when it came to getting online. 
 What most Americans probably don't know is that over the last few years the situation has totally reversed. As the Internet has evolved -- in particular, as dial-up has given way to broadband connections using DSL, cable and other high-speed links -- it's the United States that has fallen behind.
 The numbers are startling. As recently as 2001, the percentage of the population with high-speed access in Japan and Germany was only half that in the United States. In France it was less than a quarter. By the end of 2006, however, all three countries had more broadband subscribers per 100 people than we did.
 Even more striking is the fact that our ''high speed'' connections are painfully slow by other countries' standards. According to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, French broadband connections are, on average, more than three times as fast as ours. Japanese connections are a dozen times faster. Oh, and access is much cheaper in both countries than it is here.
 As a result, we're lagging in new applications of the Internet that depend on high speed. France leads the world in the number of subscribers to Internet TV; the United States isn't even in the top 10.
 What happened to America's Internet lead? Bad policy. Specifically, the United States made the same mistake in Internet policy that California made in energy policy: it forgot -- or was persuaded by special interests to ignore -- the reality that sometimes you can't have effective market competition without effective regulation.
 You see, the world may look flat once you're in cyberspace -- but to get there you need to go through a narrow passageway, down your phone line or down your TV cable. And if the companies controlling these passageways can behave like the robber barons of yore, levying whatever tolls they like on those who pass by, commerce suffers.
 America's Internet flourished in the dial-up era because federal regulators didn't let that happen -- they forced local phone companies to act as common carriers, allowing competing service providers to use their lines. Clinton administration officials, including Al Gore and Reed Hundt, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, tried to ensure that this open competition would continue -- but the telecommunications giants sabotaged their efforts, while The Wall Street Journal's editorial page ridiculed them as people with the minds of French bureaucrats. 
 And when the Bush administration put Michael Powell in charge of the F.C.C., the digital robber barons were basically set free to do whatever they liked. As a result, there's little competition in U.S. broadband -- if you're lucky, you have a choice between the services offered by the local cable monopoly and the local phone monopoly. The price is high and the service is poor, but there's nowhere else to go.
 Meanwhile, as a recent article in Business Week explains, the real French bureaucrats used judicious regulation to promote competition. As a result, French consumers get to choose from a variety of service providers who offer reasonably priced Internet access that's much faster than anything I can get, and comes with free voice calls, TV and Wi-Fi.
 It's too early to say how much harm the broadband lag will do to the U.S. economy as a whole. But it's interesting to learn that health care isn't the only area in which the French, who can take a pragmatic approach because they aren't prisoners of free-market ideology, simply do things better.

HEADLINE: Governing Party Scores Big Victory in Turkish Vote

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE; Sebnem Arsu contributed reporting.

DATELINE: ISTANBUL, Monday, July 23 

 BODY:
The Islamic-inspired governing party of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan won a larger-than-expected victory in nationwide parliamentary elections on Sunday, taking close to half the total vote in a stinging rebuke to Turkey's old guard.
 With nearly all the votes counted, the Justice and Development Party led by Mr. Erdogan won 46.6 percent of the vote, according to Turkish election officials, far more than the 34 percent the party garnered in the last election, in 2002. 
 The secular state establishment had expected that voters would punish Mr. Erdogan's party for promoting an Islamic agenda. But the main secular party, the Republican People's Party, received just 20.9 percent, compared with 19 percent in the last election. The Nationalist Action Party, which played on fears of ethnic Kurdish separatism, won 14.3 percent, officials said. 
 The results were a mandate for Mr. Erdogan's party, with large numbers of voters sending the message that they did not feel it is a threat to Turkish democracy. It fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to amend the Constitution, a blank check that secular Turks fear. According to the preliminary results, Mr. Erdogan's party will have at least 340 seats in the 550-seat Parliament. The main secular party will have at least 111; the nationalists at least 71, and independents an unusually large 28 or more. 
 Turkey is a NATO member and a strong American ally, positions Mr. Erdogan has emphatically affirmed, and its stability is crucial in a troubled region. Its current political soul searching tries to find answers to the questions that Americans have been asking since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001: Can an Islamic-oriented government that is popularly elected be democratic and aligned with the West? 
 Speaking to supporters at his party headquarters in Ankara, Mr. Erdogan, whose party is known by its Turkish initials, AK, savored the victory. But he struck a conciliatory tone, trying to soothe divisions with secular Turks. ''Our nation certified the AK Party as the central power of the society,'' he said in the nationally televised speech to a crowd that was waving flags and dancing. 
 ''I'm calling on our other citizens who didn't make their choices in support of AK,'' he added. ''I also understand the message you sent in ballot boxes. We respect your choices. We consider your different choices as the richness of your democratic life.''
 It was unclear how Turkey's powerful military would react, if at all. It issued a sharp warning to Mr. Erdogan's party in April, saying it had strayed from secularism. It has deposed four elected governments since Turkey was founded in 1923.
 The deputy chairman of the Republican People's Party, Onur Oymen, said by telephone that he had spoken to many farmers who had complaints about the economy, and that the results were baffling. ''There must be something beyond reason that make these people vote for AKP despite their disappointments,'' he said. ''AKP has been trading on religion and manipulating people's sentiments.''
 Mr. Erdogan's party has pushed for European Union membership, rewriting laws to meet European standards and meeting requirements in an International Monetary Fund economic program. It has improved economic ties with Israel, and broached the topic of Turkey's problems with its Kurdish minority.
 But secular, urban Turks are suspicious. The party comes from a religious, merchant class in rural Turkey, and the view of the senior leaders differs substantially from their own. . ''The community that made Tayyip Erdogan who he is, is the Islamic community,'' said Nuri Guvenmez, a gas industry employee who had just cast his vote for the secular party in an upscale neighborhood in Istanbul. ''He hasn't broken ties. He can't leave it.''
 Mr. Erdogan took pains to allay those fears in his speech. ''We will never compromise on the basic principles of the republic,'' he said. ''Our joy should never be the sorrow of those who do not think like us.''
 Secular concerns stem, in part, from a deep-rooted class divide. Traditional, rural, religious Turks have long been an underclass. One Turkish poet, Necip Fazil Kisakurek, called them ''the blacks of Turkey.'' 
 But since an economic boom in the 1980s, large numbers of rural Turks moved to the cities, forming a new Islamic middle class with its own wealthy elite. That religious class, in the form of Mr. Erdogan's party, pushed to the upper reaches of the state's power in April, when it tried to capture the presidency, a post that is at the very heart of the network of judges, military officers and bureaucrats that form the state elite. The party proposed Turkey's affable foreign minister, Abdullah Gul, whose wife wears a head scarf. 
 In an affluent neighborhood in Istanbul on Sunday, Semra Kara, 36, a businesswoman, said it was the image of the wives of political leaders in head scarves that she most disliked. ''I don't believe the look of the Turkish government reflects the look of a democracy,'' she said, standing in a strapless dress on a tree-lined street after voting. ''People are aware of the fact that the country is moving backward, not forward.''
 But many Turkish voters seemed to reject that assessment. ''For me, we have to be democratic, I don't care what his wife wears,'' said Latif Ererli, a 38-year old textile worker who said he had cast his vote for the AK Party in sympathy for the episode over the presidency this spring. 
 In his speech, Mr. Erdogan promised to continue the changes his party had begun after it was first elected in 2002. Foreign policy will remain unchanged. ''Standing firm without confrontation, winning friends rather than producing enemies will be again our determining principles,'' he said.
 Another distinguishing feature of the vote was the broad array of independent candidates, many of them Kurds, who will enter Parliament for the first time in more than a decade. Turkey has been fighting a war with Kurdish separatists in the southeastern part of the country for more than 20 years, and ejected representatives of Kurdish political parties from Parliament in the mid-1990s after one tried to speak Kurdish in Parliament. 
 In the heavily Kurdish neighborhood of Gazi Osman Pasa, men served tea and handed out yogurt as Kurdish families streamed through the doors of a polling place. ''When we go anywhere, people tell us to speak in Turkish,'' Selahat Turgay, a 43-year-old mother whose fringed scarf framed her face, said in Kurdish. ''I want to speak my language.''
 For many who voted for Mr. Erdogan's party, the election was a referendum on the party's economic performance. ''I'm not that conservative, but I voted for them because of the economy,'' said Refik Akin, a 27-year-old catering company worker. ''We're happy with the situation.''
 Mr. Erdogan called for restraint from his supporters. ''Beware that your happiness -- I want you to follow this very carefully -- does not overshadow the happiness of others,'' he said. ''I'm sure all members of AKP will welcome this success maturely and in a dignified manner.''

HEADLINE: The Many Flavors of Entrepreneurship

BYLINE: By MARCI ALBOHER

 BODY:
SHIFTING CAREERS
 These days, entrepreneurship comes in many flavors, from solo workers and freelancers to consultants and venture-backed small businesses. And even within those groups, there are niches. This week we'll highlight three books, each focusing on one breed of entrepreneur. These books also have value to those outside their prime readership, so have a look even if you don't recognize yourself in the title.
 ''The Anti 9 to 5 Guide: Practical Career Advice for Women Who Think Outside the Cube'' (Seal Press: 2007) by Michelle Goodman. 
 TARGET READER 
 Women in their 20s and 30s looking for a more self-styled, authentic and creative life than what Ms. Goodman calls the ''corporate hamster wheel.'' 
 WHO ELSE SHOULD READ IT
 Though clearly focused on younger women (including a chapter about starting careers in male-dominated fields, ''I want to fly a plane, build a house, or fight wildfires), men who can handle a dose of girl power with their self-help would be wise to pick it up if they want more flexibility than a rigid nine to five. It would also be useful for anyone past their 30s seeking part-time, virtual, home-based or other flexible kinds of work.
 FORMAT
 Ms. Goodman delivers vivid stories and solid advice in a tone that is lighthearted, hip and funny, with a sprinkling of activism about the rights of part-time workers. Snappy sidebars like ''8 Simple Rules for Negotiating Flex Work,'' and quizzes like ''Do you have the autonomy gene?'' dot the chapters.
 WHY I LIKE IT
 It feels like a long chat with a perky girlfriend who spurs you to reinvention with useful tips, resources and innovative ideas. Ms. Goodman also covers a wide variety of jobs and life situations, profiling bus drivers and firefighters alongside physicians, personal trainers and engineers, often mentioning whether they are single, coupled, parenting alone or with a partner. 
 TASTE OF THE AUTHOR'S VOICE
 ''... The mommy track isn't just for moms anymore, it's for anyone who picks quality of life over wage slavedom.'' 
 WHY THE AUTHOR IS CREDIBLE
 Even as an established freelancer, Ms. Goodman follows her own advice, taking the occasional long-term temp assignment to meet a big financial goal. We did our interview while she was stealing a few moments from what she called a ''a temporary, part-time, ultra-flexible'' day job that allowed for furtive cellphone use. 
 CAVEAT
 The author assumes the reader has an artistic, entrepreneurial or social justice bent. If you don't, this might not be the book for you. Ms. Goodman lives in Seattle, so it is heavy on rock climbers, tech workers and alternative types (e.g. a the owner of a ''women-positive sex shop.'')
 ''The Parentpreneur Edge: What Parenting Teaches About Building A Successful Business'' (Wiley: 2007) by Julie Lenzer Kirk
 TARGET READER
 Parents who are entrepreneurs or considering becoming entrepreneurs. Parents with other jobs.
 WHO ELSE SHOULD READ IT
 The book should also resonate with nonparents who have passions and responsibilities outside of their businesses. 
 FORMAT
 Part memoir, part entrepreneurial handbook, the book toggles between the story of Ms. Lenzer Kirk's early years as mother and her journey as a small business founder. Chapters and sections begin with a parent-focused anecdote, followed by a discussion of the issue -- ''picking your battles,'' ''teaching your baby to feed herself,'' ''surviving the terrible twos'' -- from the business perspective.
 WHY I LIKE IT
 Ms. Lenzer Kirk includes as many fathers (including her husband) who altered their careers around parenthood as mothers. Plus, it is filled with juicy nuggets, like the parent who makes creative use of a banana to coax an infant out of a locked car door or the renegade office manager who hacks into the company e-mail system to figure out who was first choice for her job.
 TASTE OF THE AUTHOR'S VOICE
 ''Our children do come first, just not every single time. We are actually teaching them that life is about balancing priorities and give and take.'' 
 WHY THE AUTHOR IS CREDIBLE
 She founded, built and sold a multimillion-dollar software business while raising two small children. 
 CAVEAT 
 You'll need to get used to sentences like this, that blur the language of family and business: ''She purposely held off on having children until she felt her oldest child -- her company -- was in a position for her to be away for a period of time.'' 
 ''Grindhopping: Building a Rewarding Career Without Paying Your Dues'' (McGraw Hill: 2007) by Laura Vanderkam
 (Full disclosure: I met Laura Vanderkam when she was researching this book. I liked the idea from the start and even gave her a few people to interview. She acknowledged me in the book.)
 TARGET READER
 Young people who would rather strike out on their own than work their way up any kind of ladder, if such a thing even exists anymore.
 WHO ELSE SHOULD READ THIS
 Gen Xers and boomers who have already put in their time on the grind and yearn to hop off, and anyone who wants to pose like a Gen Y entrepreneur.
 FORMAT
 Ms. Vanderkam pays long visits with her ''grindhopper'' subjects, then makes an appearance, often offering studies and statistics to frame her narratives. Though she mocks business trend articles (''If this were 1997, I'd now write a transition paragraph about how the Oral Fix guys are showing that the old work rules have changed. Employees are finished! It's all about Brand You'') her tone and format are quite like the faux Fast Company article she spoofs.
 WHY I LIKE IT 
 It is loaded with smart observations like this: ''Grindhoppers in this new economy have projects, not jobs. They are always chasing a dream project, and they are always thinking of the next dream project while they're working on the current one.'' It also recognizes that many budding entrepreneurs have no desire to be the next Bill Gates; often they just want to avoid being Dilbert.
 TASTE OF THE AUTHOR'S VOICE 
 ''Grindhoppers understand that the lower levels of most big companies are just toxic places for talented ambitious young people to languish.'' 
 WHY THE AUTHOR IS CREDIBLE 
 Ms. Vanderkam worked for USA Today for one year out of college, jumped off the grind and never returned. A card-carrying member of Gen Y, she interviewed scores of grindhoppers and backs up many of her assertions with data. Today, she is forging her own path as a new mom and author, and she is currently grappling with the fact that playing by your own rules means no maternity leave, something she recently blogged about (to much controversy) in this post on Huffingtonpost.com. 
 CAVEAT
 Ms. Vanderkam, only 28, hasn't been working that long herself so it's unclear whether her predictions about the wisdom of this career path will hold up. Still, it is hard to question her advice when her own grindhopping has led her to contributing editorships with USA Today and Reader's Digest, two fairly establishment organizations.

HEADLINE: Low-Key Recall of AIDS Drug Hits World's Poor

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: ROME, July 21 

 BODY:
A total recall of an important AIDS drug widely used in developing countries has disrupted treatment for tens of thousands of the world's poorest patients, with no clear word from the manufacturer on when shipments will resume. 
 The recall of the drug, Viracept, by Roche Pharmaceuticals of Switzerland, went largely unnoticed in the developed world when it was announced in early June, after the company had discovered that some batches made at its Swiss plant contained a dangerous chemical. But the recall has caused growing concern among global health officials and in AIDS programs in many poor nations. They say the company did an inadequate job of informing patients and officials about the potential risks and helping them find affordable access to newer alternative drugs. 
 Roche said that it had been actively working with health officials across the globe and that the risk from the affected batches was low. 
 The scope of Roche's recall is extraordinary, if not unprecedented, in the battle against the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, global health officials say. Dr. Lembit Rago, an official at the World Health Organization, said tens of thousands of people take Viracept worldwide, many of them poor people with H.I.V. in developing countries. The recall has left those patients with the painful choice of discontinuing a lifesaving medicine, or using a drug that might contain a dangerous contaminant. 
 Officials at the W.H.O. in Geneva and the European Medicines Agency in London said Roche had not provided information they consider essential for safeguarding public health: which countries the tainted medicine was shipped to, the concentration of the contaminant and what the company will do for its patients. The European agency, which regulates drugs for the European Union, has canceled Roche's license to market the drug.
 Dr. Rago called the recall ''sort of a disaster'' for patients in very poor countries. He said of Roche, ''They failed in communication.'' Roche has denied the accusation. The company, which had revenue of $35 billion last year, said it promptly notified health providers in the affected countries to discontinue use of the drug, which is dispensed in both pill and powder form. It also said it would cover the ''reasonable costs'' of the recall. It did not define ''reasonable costs.''
 So far, in some countries like Panama, patients or treatment programs have had to make up the difference in cost between Viracept and far more expensive alternatives. For some patients in other countries, like Venezuela, alternatives to Viracept are unavailable.
 Roche said the recall affected ''Europe and some other world regions'' but has not been more specific. The recall does not affect the United States, Canada or Japan, where a version of Viracept is made by Pfizer. Roche has been in discussions with Pfizer about supplying Pfizer's version to some affected countries, but regulatory and licensing issues could take ''some time,'' said Martina Rupp, a Roche spokeswoman.
 Roche sells Viracept for use in low-income countries at the discounted median price of about 28 cents a dose, according to the W.H.O.'s 2006 global price reporting system for AIDS medicine. The drug, also known as nelfinavir, is a member of the class of AIDS drugs known as protease inhibitors. It is considered an important defense against H.I.V., but it has fallen out of favor in Europe in recent years compared with newer medicines that are more convenient and cause fewer side effects. 
 In some places, newer substitutes are not available to patients, either because they are not licensed or are much more expensive, said people with H.I.V. and international health experts. In Panama, for example, a substitute drug, Kaletra, costs three times as much as Viracept.
 ''Roche has provided information, but there has been much less support in terms of who is going to pay the additional cost,'' said Dr. Cesar Nunez, the United Nations AIDS program's coordinator for Latin America, who is based in Panama.
 A more limited recall might have been possible had Roche been more forthcoming about the countries affected and the lots that were suspect, said Dr. Rago, the W.H.O. coordinator of quality assurance and safety for medicines. ''It's fine for Roche to say 'withdraw and replace,' but there may not be much else at hand to substitute'' in many places, he said. ''This is not just about Europe.''
 In response to questions sent by e-mail, Ms. Rupp said Roche had shipped ''at least one packet of Viracept with high levels of the impurity to 35 countries.'' But she declined to say which countries because Roche regards such information as proprietary. High levels of the contaminant ''were observed in batches of Viracept that had been released to countries since March 2007,'' she said.
 The company made the recall worldwide ''in order to avoid confusion,'' she said. Roche estimates that about 45,000 patients were affected by the recall. Ms. Rupp said the toxic substance, ethyl mesylate, should be called an ''impurity'' rather than a contaminant because it was created in the manufacturing process and because that type of chemical can be found in very low levels in other medicines, although it was not supposed to be present in Viracept.
 The company was performing studies on the issue, but the results would not be available for ''some months,'' she said. At high doses, ethyl mesylate has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and at lower levels it can cause genetic mutations, which means children and fetuses are particularly vulnerable.
 Asia Russell, the coordinator of international advocacy for Health Gap, a nongovernmental organization based in New York and Philadelphia that focuses on medical care in the developing world, said, ''It seems that Roche has abandoned these patients, since in many places there aren't ready alternatives.''
 In Venezuela, 3,000 people were on Viracept, paid for by the national health service, and the effect of the recall was ''severe,'' because many had no other options, said Edgar Carrasco, an advocate on issues relating to AIDS in Caracas.
 Alberto Nieve, another advocate, said Roche had promised to make a donation of another medicine. ''Most people are still waiting,'' he said. ''They have not switched yet, especially outside Caracas.'' 
 In the month since the recall, officials at the European Medicines Agency and the W.H.O. said that they, too, would like more information from Roche about the dose of the contaminant and where exactly the medicine was sent.
 ''We have not gotten information, not even an order of magnitude,'' said Martin Harvey-Allchurch, a spokesman for the European agency. ''I understand sales figures are confidential, but I would have thought by now we would have this information.''
 Viracept was sold in 49 countries since 2004, according to the W.H.O., with more than 12 million units sold in 2006 and 2 million in 2007. Tido Von Schoen-Angerer, director of the essential medicines campaign at Doctors Without Borders, said about half of the 400 patients who received therapy supplied by the group in Africa were on Viracept. The alternate from Abbott is not yet available, he said.

HEADLINE: What Would a Diplomat Do?

 BODY:
When Condoleezza Rice took over as secretary of state, the (wishful) thinking was that the Bush administration would finally get into the business of diplomacy. Ms. Rice can be as bullying and ad hominem as her boss, but she's also an achiever and trying her hand at persuasion was probably the only hope for salvaging the administration's failed foreign policies and her reputation. 
 Two and a half years later we're pleased to note a preliminary success for the new era: North Korea's decision to shut down its plutonium-producing nuclear reactor in exchange for economic and eventual diplomatic payoffs. Ms. Rice managed to hold back the spoilers in the vice president's office long enough for her negotiator, Christopher Hill, to do the deal the old-fashioned way: countless hours of negotiations and a willingness to compromise with a leader President Bush once famously said he ''loathed.''
 Unfortunately, in most every other area ad hominem and loathing still dominate. And there is still a perplexing refusal to do the tedious but absolutely essential diplomatic prep work. 
 Consider Mr. Bush's announcement last week that Ms. Rice will preside over a Middle East peace meeting this fall. That might seem a breakthrough for a White House that started out claiming that too much diplomacy -- by Bill Clinton -- unleashed the second Palestinian uprising. And we're being told that Ms. Rice considers an Israeli-Palestinian peace her last, best chance for a legacy. Still, there's no sign that either she or Mr. Bush has grasped the lesson of Mr. Hill's North Korea breakthrough.
 They are still refusing to talk to people they loathe. The militant Palestinian movement Hamas is definitely not invited to their meeting, even though it controls a large swath of Palestinian territory and psyche. And Syria probably won't make the list. Both deserve loathing but also have the ability to shatter any peace effort, and further isolating them will only give them further incentive to try. 
 Beyond that, the administration can't answer the most basic questions, like when and where the meeting will take place, what friendly Arab states will be coming and what the agenda is. The Palestinians want to talk about all the big things, like borders, Jerusalem and when they get the independent state Mr. Bush committed himself to five years ago. The Israelis say they can't discuss these issues as long as Palestinian attacks on Israel continue.
 All of which leads back to that perplexing refusal to do the diplomatic preparation. Officials say that Ms. Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates will start filling in the blanks when they visit the region at the end of this month. But it took former Secretary of State James Baker (no slouch as a negotiator) eight grueling shuttle trips to set the stage for the 1991 Madrid peace conference. 
 With time so short, Ms. Rice should either be shuttling full time or sending out a legion of diplomats to try to ensure that there are enough heavy hitters at the table and enough they're willing to talk about to make all sides want to keep talking. She could start by asking, what would Chris Hill do?

 BODY:
Kabul, Afghanistan
 AMERICA and its allies are in danger of repeating the mistakes of Iraq in Afghanistan. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and even some Republicans are insisting on withdrawing from Iraq and sending more troops and resources to southern Afghanistan. The Bush administration's gloomy National Intelligence Estimate last week on the fight against Al Qaeda will only lead others to make such calls. 
 But they should think again. The intervention in Afghanistan has gone far better than that in Iraq largely because the American-led coalition has limited its ambitions and kept a light footprint, leaving the Afghans to run their own affairs. 
 Much has been made lately of setbacks and the resilience of the Taliban. But given its history, Afghanistan is doing relatively well. International terrorist training camps have been eliminated (or at least pushed across the border to Pakistan); national wealth has nearly doubled in the last five years; Kabul's population has expanded from less than a million in 2001 to almost four million today. 
 It seems ground is broken on another huge blue-glass commercial building every week. The wage for an unskilled laborer in Kabul is now $4 a day, four times that in neighboring Pakistan and Uzbekistan. Millions of Afghan refugees have returned home at a time when Iraqis are fleeing Iraq. The central regions of Afghanistan are safe enough for foreigners to travel alone unharmed. 
 There are, however, serious problems in the south and east of the country. Taliban forces raid villages and military posts before retreating to safety across the Pakistan border. In Helmand Province, the government is associated with kidnapping, murder and theft. Thirty-five highway policemen were arrested this month, accused of robbing vehicles. This province alone produces 50 percent of Europe's heroin. Afghans in such areas are justifiably angry. 
 NATO has tried to solve the problems of the south with more troops. This has only added to the problem. For example, Britain decided in 2005 to bring good government, security, rule of law and economic growth to Helmand Province. At the time, there were few Taliban attacks in the area. The British deployed some 4,000 soldiers last year and more civilian advisers to replace a few hundred international troops who had been in the province since the fall of the Taliban.
 The British effort failed. A year and a half later, with 7,000 British troops in Helmand, the provincial government is more corrupt, the streets less safe for citizens, the poppy crop larger and the legal economy and infrastructure more eroded. Worst of all, the foreign presence has provoked a wide Taliban insurgency. Dutch troops in Uruzgan Province and the Canadians in Kandahar have had similar experiences.
 NATO's failures in the south should serve as warnings to those who would intensify Western efforts here; the results were inevitable for fundamental structural reasons. Many Afghan officials are simply not committed to state-building in southern Afghanistan, and many are connected to the drug trade. Narcotics makes up more than half of Afghanistan's gross domestic product and there is no sufficiently appealing alternative crop for farmers. 
 Most important, none of the factors that led to success in history's classic counterinsurgency campaigns are present in the fight against the Taliban. In British Malaya in the 1950s, for example, success depended on direct imperial control of the government, a powerful and cooperative local administration, large numbers of troops, active support from much of the population, a detailed understanding of local culture and politics, control of the borders and strong political support at home. 
 In Afghanistan, by contrast, the American-led coalition is not the government and has to operate in tandem with an Afghan civil service, military and police force that are at best ineffective and at worst actively undermine coalition operations. 
 The dominant Pashtun tribes in the south and east are suspicious of foreign troops and are reluctant to side with them against the Taliban, who are from their own ethnic group. Coalition-backed governments have been unable to prevent the insurgents from taking sanctuary and receiving armaments and money from across the porous borders with Pakistan and Iran. American and European voters will not send the hundreds of thousands of troops the counterinsurgency textbooks recommend, and have no wish to support decades of fighting. 
 Worst of all, an increased foreign troop presence will help the Taliban, who are unable to deliver government services and often live parasitically off the people, and whose best selling point is that they are fighting for Afghanistan and Islam against a foreign occupation. If we commit more troops we will find it very difficult to withdraw them later without losing credibility. 
 Our best hope in Afghanistan is to continue to manage the country through a light civil and military presence. Southern Afghanistan will remain unstable for some time to come. Although we cannot change this, we can contain the situation. We can prevent Qaeda units from using the area as a base from which to attack the United States, and we can prevent the Taliban from again mobilizing conventional forces or capturing major northern cities like Kabul and Mazar-i-Sharif. 
 This will not require large numbers of troops. If the Taliban tried to raise another conventional army, it would be an easy target for coalition forces and air power. The most efficient and sustainable way to protect American soil from a terrorist attack is not to deploy tens of thousands of troops to occupy rural areas of Afghanistan, but to invest in intelligence to identify the few radicals who want to attack Western targets, and use special forces operations to eliminate them. 
 We can do much more to show people the benefit of cooperating with the coalition. Projects in hostile areas, where the local population is not working with us and where a minority wants to attack us, are not a constructive use of our limited resources. Our best hope is rather to focus on the many secure and welcoming parts of Afghanistan's center and north. Efforts to jumpstart local economies led by members of those communities are more effective, more relevant and more sustainable than those dictated by outsiders. We have a great opportunity in the north, center and west of Afghanistan to lead development projects for which Afghans will still be grateful 50 years from now. 
 This does not mean that we should withdraw and partition the country, or that the Pashtun south is doomed. But only the Afghans have the power to end the insurgency and create a stable and democratic south. It will not be easy. Residents have not yet mobilized effectively against the Taliban. Other Afghan ethnic groups still see the insurgency as a Pashtun problem and would rather not be involved. Twenty-five years of war has left a power vacuum. Politicians concerned with Afghanistan continue to underestimate the power and autonomy of provincial groups and the appeal of tribe and religion. 
 Stabilizing southern Afghanistan will require uncomfortable compromises. It will certainly take 20 years for Afghanistan to develop an economy to match even Bangladesh, or a civil service or military to match that of Pakistan. In the meantime, the Pashtun areas may remain as wild and unstable as the tribal areas of Pakistan. But Afghanistan on the whole can become more stable, more humane and more prosperous than it is today.
 American-led military occupations and counterinsurgency campaigns are unsustainable and counterproductive, not just in Iraq or Afghanistan but in all nationalist Muslim countries. But this is not a call for disengagement. 
 We need a new strategy that can be applied not only in Iraq but also in Pakistan and wherever else these threats emerge. It should not rely on large amounts of troops and money but on intelligence, pragmatic politics, savvy use of our development assistance and on special forces operations. Rather than throwing more troops at Afghanistan and turning it into a second Iraq, we should use it as a model for a lighter, smarter approach.

HEADLINE: The Populism Of the Democrats

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''A New Populism Spurs Democrats on the Economy'' (front page, July 16), you are right to point out that economic insecurity is driving many Democrats to take a more populist tone this year. But those fears -- stemming from the challenges of global interdependence -- are nothing new. 
 In 1992, Gov. Bill Clinton promised to put people first by helping Americans win in the global economy. If Democrats long to bring back the prosperity of the 1990s, we can't lose sight of the fundamentals that produced the growth and opportunity in that decade -- or the need to apply them to the economic havoc the last six years have produced. 
 This means restoring fiscal discipline, lowering health care costs and expanding coverage, giving Americans the tools to compete, and enforcing trade laws the Bush administration has ignored while expanding trade -- not restricting it -- by opening markets abroad.
 To be successful today, Democrats once again need to heed the aspirations and address the fears of the middle class. That's a proven New Democratic formula to helping ordinary Americans get ahead.
 Al From Founder and Chief Executive Democratic Leadership Council Washington, July 17, 2007
 To the Editor:
 It is encouraging to read about the suggestion from Democratic leaders that ''another progressive era is -- and ought to -- be at hand.'' The concern about inequity in our economy and the plight of the middle class is well founded and long overdue.
 But programs to remedy this problem will not be effective until the pervasive cynicism about government and public service is addressed. And it can only be addressed when candidates remember that the Progressive Era of the last century was marked by systematic attacks on privilege and corruption in the political establishment, as well as programs to take on exploitation and abuse by the economic elite. 
 Indeed, progress on the latter front cannot occur without action on the former. For example, the entire structure that supports ''safe incumbents'' must be torn down because such a structure creates a privileged political oligarchy. 
 Is there a progressive leader out there who will take on the critical issue of the integrity of our democratic institutions and those who have forgotten why they ran for political office because they now consider winning elections their life's work?
 Mark P. Widoff Camp Hill, Pa., July 16, 2007 The writer is the chairman of Democracy Rising Pennsylvania, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization working for integrity, value, transparency and citizen confidence in government.

HEADLINE: Time to Go Easy on the Sushi? Study Finds High Mercury Levels Among New Yorkers

BYLINE: SEWELL CHAN


HIGHLIGHT: One in four New York City residents has elevated blood mercury levels, according to new Health Department survey findings. Most city residents don't need to be alarmed, officials say, but pregnant and breastfeeding women should watch their consumption of fish. 

 BODY:
One quarter of New York City adults have elevated blood mercury levels, and the problem -- closely tied to fish consumption -- is most acute among Asians, women and higher-income New Yorkers, according to findings released this morning by the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. For most adults, the higher levels do not pose a health risk, but children born to mothers with very high mercury levels during pregnancy are at greater risk of cognitive delays. 
The city says it is conducting follow-up studies of fish sold in local markets, but in the meantime, has urged pregnant and breastfeeding women to moderate their consumption of mercury-rich fish.
The findings are likely to stir what is already a contentious debate over sushi. On The Times's Op-Ed page last week, the author Steven A. Shaw argued that alarm over mercury levels in sushi has been vastly overblown and that there is too much empty speculation over food-borne illnesses, while another author, Trevor Corson, contended that the much-hyped depletion of bluefin tuna is not as much of a problem as it is made out to be.
"No one needs to stop eating fish, but some people may need to change the type and amount they eat," said Daniel Kass, the Health Department's assistant commissioner for environmental surveillance and policy. "Young children, breastfeeding mothers, and women who are pregnant or planning pregnancy should eat fish that are lower in mercury and limit fish that are higher in mercury."
Mercury levels remain the same whether a fish is cooked or served raw. "The reason pregnant women should avoid raw fish is not because they're more susceptible to food-borne illness (they're not), but because many antibiotics to treat food-borne illness are contraindicated during pregnancy because of risks to the fetus," a spokesperson for the Health Department wrote in an e-mail message to The Times. 
These are the major findings released by the Health Department: 

        
Among women 20-49 years old in New York City, the average blood mercury level is 2.64 g/L (micrograms per liter), three times that of similarly-aged women nationally (0.83 g/L)
        
Approximately one quarter of New York City women in this age group have a blood mercury level at or above 5 g/L, the New York State reportable level.
        
People who eat fish three or fewer times each week have, on average, levels of mercury below the reportable level, while average readings exceed the reportable level among those who eat fish four or more times.
        
Higher-income New Yorkers have higher mercury levels; New Yorkers in the highest income bracket average 3.6 g/L, compared to 2.4 g/L among the lowest income group.
        
Average blood mercury levels are considerably higher among New York City Asian women (4.1 g/L); nearly half (45 percent) have blood mercury levels at or above the State reportable level.
        
Among Asians, foreign-born Chinese women have particularly high levels compared to the rest of New York City. Two thirds (66 percent) have mercury at or above the reportable level.
        
Foreign-born Chinese New Yorkers eat an average of three fish meals per week, compared to about one among New Yorkers over all. About one quarter of Chinese New Yorkers eat fish five or more times each week, compared to fewer than one in 15 overall.
The Health Department has prepared a brochure [pdf] in English, Spanish and Chinese that urges New Yorkers to eat fish in moderation and a fact sheet on mercury. High-mercury fish include Chilean sea bass, grouper, king mackerel, marlin, orange roughy, shark, swordfish, tilefish, tuna steaks and sushi grade tuna.

HEADLINE: Merger Activity Helps Shares Bounce Back

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rebounded yesterday after a fresh round of buyout news offered evidence that Wall Street's penchant for deal making had not disappeared.
 Better-than-expected profit news from Merck also raised the mood on Wall Street, helping shares partly recover from a steep sell-off Friday that was initiated by some weak earnings reports and worries about souring subprime loans.
 The stock market pushed those concerns aside yesterday after Transocean, the world's largest offshore drilling contractor, and a rival, GlobalSantaFe, said they had agreed to merge. Transocean rose $5.99, or 5.5 percent, to $115.96 a share, while GlobalSantaFe rose $3.59, or 4.8 percent, to $78.33. 
 In addition, the equipment rental company United Rentals agreed to be taken private by affiliates of Cerberus Capital Management for about $4 billion in cash, while the British bank Barclays said it would raise its offer for ABN Amro Holding to $93.2 billion to fight a rival bid. United Rentals rose 61 cents to $32.98.
 The turnaround from Friday's retrenchment demonstrates the market's resiliency but also raises questions of whether the short-lived nature of most of this year's pullbacks means stocks are rising on a rickety foundation, said Theodore R. Aronson, a partner at Aronson Johnson Ortiz in Philadelphia. Like many investors, he sees retreats as a healthy break for ascendant markets.
 ''We had a correction for a day. It's amazing,'' Mr. Aronson said. ''I think the market has gone too far, too fast. With that said, there is no doubt that the market is just amazingly strong.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.34 points, or 0.67 percent, to 13,943.42, in large part because of a 6.75 percent rise in Merck's shares. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.47 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,541.57. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index showed more modest gains, rising 2.98 points, or 0.11 percent, to 2,690.58. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.82, or 0.10 percent, to 835.62 points.
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was unchanged at 96 17/32, with the yield at 4.95 percent. 
 The dollar was mixed against other major currencies after hitting a record low against the euro and a 26-year low against the British pound.
 The euro fell to $1.3802 in late New York trading from $1.3822 on Friday. It reached $1.3844 earlier, just above its previous high of $1.3843, before slipping back. The dollar weakened further against the British pound, which climbed as high as $2.0603 yesterday before pulling back to $2.0579 in late New York trading.
 Light sweet crude fell 90 cents to $74.89 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange on suggestions that OPEC may increase its output.
 The resumption of the market's climb came on a day without any major economic news and appeared to at least temporarily quiet some concerns that a souring of subprime loans, those made to borrowers with poor credit, will upend the market's advance.
 Merck reported a 12 percent increase in its second-quarter earnings. Merck, the best performer yesterday among the 30 stocks that make up the Dow, rose $3.31 to $52.33.
 Another component of the Dow, American Express, the credit card issuer, reported a stronger-than-expected second-quarter profit. The company ended the regular session up 15 cents at $64.66 but slipped in after-hours trading as revenue fell short of Wall Street's forecast.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about eight to seven on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 3.09 billion shares, down from 3.65 billion on Friday.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: U.S. SEEN IN IRAQ UNTIL AT LEAST '09

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, July 23 

 BODY:
While Washington is mired in political debate over the future of Iraq, the American command here has prepared a detailed plan that foresees a significant American role for the next two years. 
 The classified plan, which represents the coordinated strategy of the top American commander and the American ambassador, calls for restoring security in local areas, including Baghdad, by the summer of 2008. ''Sustainable security'' is to be established on a nationwide basis by the summer of 2009, according to American officials familiar with the document. 
 The detailed document, known as the Joint Campaign Plan, is an elaboration of the new strategy President Bush signaled in January when he decided to send five additional American combat brigades and other units to Iraq. That signaled a shift from the previous strategy, which emphasized transferring to Iraqis the responsibility for safeguarding their security. 
 That new approach put a premium on protecting the Iraqi population in Baghdad, on the theory that improved security would provide Iraqi political leaders with the breathing space they needed to try political reconciliation. 
 The latest plan, which covers a two-year period, does not explicitly address troop levels or withdrawal schedules. It anticipates a decline in American forces as the ''surge'' in troops runs its course later this year or in early 2008. But it nonetheless assumes continued American involvement to train soldiers, act as partners with Iraqi forces and fight terrorist groups in Iraq, American officials said. 
 The goals in the document appear ambitious, given the immensity of the challenge of dealing with die-hard Sunni insurgents, renegade Shiite militias, Iraqi leaders who have made only fitful progress toward political reconciliation, as well as Iranian and Syrian neighbors who have not hesitated to interfere in Iraq's affairs. And the White House's interim assessment of progress, issued n July 12, is mixed.
 But at a time when critics at home are defining patience in terms of weeks, the strategy may run into the expectations of many lawmakers for an early end to the American mission here.
 The plan, developed by Gen. David H. Petraeus, the senior American commander, and Ryan C. Crocker, the American ambassador, has been briefed to Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Adm. William J. Fallon, the head of the Central Command. It is expected to be formally issued to officials here this week. 
 The plan envisions two phases. The ''near-term'' goal is to achieve ''localized security'' in Baghdad and other areas no later than June 2008. It envisions encouraging political accommodations at the local level, including with former insurgents, while pressing Iraq's leaders to make headway on their program of national reconciliation.
 The ''intermediate'' goal is to stitch together such local arrangements to establish a broader sense of security on a nationwide basis no later than June 2009. 
 ''The coalition, in partnership with the government of Iraq, employs integrated political, security, economic and diplomatic means, to help the people of Iraq achieve sustainable security by the summer of 2009,'' a summary of the campaign plan states.
 Military officials here have been careful not to guarantee success, and recognized they may need to revise the plan if some assumptions were not met. 
 ''The idea behind the surge was to bring stability and security to the Iraqi people, primarily in Baghdad because it is the political heart of the country, and by so doing give the Iraqis the time and space needed to come to grips with the tough issues they face and enable reconciliation to take place,'' said Col. Peter Mansoor, the executive officer to General Petraeus. 
 ''If eventually the Iraqi government and the various sects and groups do not come to some sort of agreement on how to share power, on how to divide resources and on how to reconcile and stop the violence, then the assumption on which the surge strategy was based is invalid, and we would have to re-look the strategy,'' Colonel Mansoor added. 
 General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will provide an assessment in September on trends in Iraq and whether the strategy is viable or needs to be changed. 
 The previous plan, developed by Gen. George W. Casey Jr., who served as General Petraeus's predecessor before being appointed as chief of staff of the Army, was aimed at prompting the Iraqis to take more responsibility for security by reducing American forces. 
 That approach faltered when the Iraqi security forces showed themselves unprepared to carry out their expanded duties, and sectarian killings soared. 
 In contrast, the new approach reflects the counterinsurgency precept that protection of the population is best way to isolate insurgents, encourage political accommodations and gain intelligence on numerous threats. A core assumption of the plan is that American troops cannot impose a military solution, but that the United States can use force to create the conditions in which political reconciliation is possible. 
 To develop the plan, General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker assembled a Joint Strategic Assessment Team, which sought to define the conflict and outline the elements of a new strategy. It included officers like Col. H. R. McMaster, the field commander who carried out the successful ''clear, hold and build'' operation in Tal Afar and who wrote a critical account of the Joint Chiefs of Staff role during the Vietnam War; Col. John R. Martin, who teaches at the Army War College and was a West Point classmate of General Petraeus; and David Kilcullen, an Australian counterinsurgency expert who has a degree in anthropology. 
 State Department officials, including Robert Ford, an Arab expert and the American ambassador to Algeria, were also involved. So were a British officer and experts outside government like Stephen D. Biddle, a military expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
 The team determined that Iraq was in a ''communal struggle for power,'' in the words of one senior officer who participated in the effort. Adding to the problem, the new Iraqi government was struggling to unite its disparate factions and to develop the capability to deliver basic services and provide security.
 Extremists were fueling the violence, as were nations like Iran, which they concluded was arming and equipping Shiite militant groups, and Syria, which was allowing suicide bombers to cross into Iraq. 
 Like the Baker-Hamilton commission, which issued its report last year, the team believed that political, military and economic efforts were needed, including diplomatic discussions with Iran, officials said. There were different views about how aggressive to be in pressing for the removal of overtly sectarian officials, and several officials said that theme was toned down somewhat in the final plan. 
 The plan itself was written by the Joint Campaign Redesign Team, an allusion to the fact that the plan inherited from General Casey was being reworked. Much of the redesign has already been put into effect, including the decision to move troops out of large bases and to act as partners more fully with the Iraqi security forces. 
 The overarching goal, an American official said, is to advance political accommodation and avoid undercutting the authority of the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki. While the plan seeks to achieve stability, several officials said it anticipates that less will be accomplished in terms of national reconciliation by the end of 2009 than did the plan developed by General Casey. 
 The plan also emphasizes encouraging political accommodation at the local level. The command has established a team to oversee efforts to reach out to former insurgents and tribal leaders. It is dubbed the Force Strategic Engagement Cell, and is overseen by a British general. In the terminology of the plan, the aim is to identify potentially ''reconcilable'' groups and encourage them to move away from violence. 
 However, groups like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a Sunni Arab extremist group that American intelligence officials say has foreign leadership, and cells backed by Iran are seen as implacable foes. 
 ''You are not out there trying to defeat your enemies wholesale,'' said one military official who is knowledgeable about the plan. ''You are out there trying to draw them into a negotiated power-sharing agreement where they decide to quit fighting you. They don't decide that their conflict is over. The reasons for conflict remain, but they quit trying to address it through violence. In the end, we hope that that alliance of convenience to fight with Al Qaeda becomes a connection to the central government as well.''
 The hope is that sufficient progress might be made at the local level to encourage accommodation at the national level, and vice versa. The plan also calls for efforts to encourage the rule of law, such as the establishment of secure zones in Baghdad and other cities to promote criminal trials and process detainee cases.
 To help measure progress in tamping down civil strife, Col. William Rapp, a senior aide to General Petraeus, oversaw an effort to develop a standardized measure of sectarian violence. One result was a method that went beyond the attacks noted in American military reports and which incorporated Iraqi data.
 ''We are going to try a dozen different things,'' said one senior officer. ''Maybe one of them will flatline. One of them will do this much. One of them will do this much more. After a while, we believe there is chance you will head into success. I am not saying that we are absolutely headed for success.''

HEADLINE: A Genetically Modified Potato, Not for Eating, Is Stirring Some Opposition in Europe

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: LIMBURGERHOF, Germany 

 BODY:
When Timo Bohme, a plant scientist, pulls up the cluster of dirt-encrusted potatoes from a tidy field here, he cradles them like a precious baby. For his employer, the German chemical giant BASF, these unassuming golden orbs, called Amflora potatoes, are the culmination of nearly 20 years of research and hold the promise of immense future profits. But not just yet.
 Amflora potatoes, likely to become the first genetically modified crop in the last decade to be approved for growth in Europe, have become the unlikely lightning rod in the angry debate over such products on the Continent.
 The European Commission now says it will approve the potato ''probably this fall,'' even though European ministers have twice been deadlocked on approval over the last eight months, with only a minority voting in favor. According to European Union procedures, ''the ministers have not been able to take a decision, so we will have to reaffirm our earlier opinion to recommend it,'' said Barbara Helferrich, spokeswoman for the European Commission's Environment Directorate. 
 But European environmental groups are critical of Amflora potatoes, saying they could release dangerous genes into the environment. Approving Amflora would make ''a mockery of E.U. law,'' said Marco Contiero, an expert on genetically modified organisms at Greenpeace in Brussels.
 Still, perhaps the biggest hurdle for Amflora is the visceral popular reaction against genetically modified crops on a continent whose food culture is ancient and treasured.
 ''I just don't like the idea,'' said Monika Stahl, 31, waiting for a bus with a sack of fresh vegetables in Mannheim, just 12 miles from the Amflora field. ''I worry about safe food and about the environment. I have children and worry about them.''
 In one sense, the irony is that Amflora is not a food at all. Although it looks, feels and smells like any other potato, each one is actually a genetically engineered factory for amylopectin, a starch used to make glossy paper coatings, clothing finishes and adhesive cement.
 Normal potatoes combine amylopectin and amylose; the gene for amylose is turned off in Amflora potatoes, which taste terrible, and will never be turned into French fries or a potato salad.
 ''You would think that this approval would have been easy since this potato has no seeds, no wild relatives to cross with in Europe, and only industrial use,'' said Ralf-Michael Schmidt, vice president of BASF. ''But it didn't turn out that way.''
 Only 1 percent of the world's genetically modified food is grown in Europe. In contrast, 55 percent of the world's acreage in genetically modified crops is in the United States. From 1998 to 2004, the European Union had a moratorium on the approval of new genetically modified crops and food, so experts could study the risks involved. Under pressure from the World Trade Organization and the United States, that was lifted.
 The European Commission has been under enormous pressure to open its doors to crops like this ever since a W.T.O. decision in 2006 that made banning genetically modified crops tantamount to an illegal trade barrier.
 But if the approval process for industrial Amflora has proved a challenge -- BASF first filed an application to grow the potatoes in 1994 -- the road will certainly be far more arduous for other planned genetically modified crops because they do involve plants intended for food or animal feed. ''That will be a much tougher sell,'' Ms. Helferrich said. Indeed, BASF has a second application for Amflora pending that would allow the potato residue after starch extraction to be used as animal feed.
 Even Germany, which has favored the approval of Amflora for industrial use, would not support that application, said Wolfgang Kohler, head of the unit for gene technology at the German Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection. He said: ''I'm very doubtful we could vote in favor for food and feed because of fears about transmission'' of genes into the environment or food supply.
 He noted that more than 70 percent of Germans say they do not want genetically modified organisms, or G.M.O.'s, in their food and the German food industry ''does everything it can to avoid using this stuff.''
 Polls by the European Commission have shown that 80 percent to 90 percent of Europeans distrust genetically modified plants. ''We can authorize as many crops as we want, but the bigger problem is to convince people they are safe,'' Ms. Helferrich said.
 In the United States, where genetically modified crops have been grown widely for more than a decade, approvals are left to expert agencies. But in the European Union -- where voters and politicians are more passionate about food -- such approvals involve a more democratic process.
 On a crop-by-crop basis, the scientific recommendations of the European Food Safety Agency are voted on by ministers from the 27 member states. Approvals bounce back and forth and ultimately arrive at the European Commission in Brussels when member states cannot agree.
 ''As a scientist I have a hard time understanding it, but this is how Europe has chosen to make these decisions,'' said Susanne Benner, communications director at BASF. ''But it's hard when you see an innovative product go through the loops again and again. These decisions are not about science but about politics.''
 In February 2006, a scientific review by the European Food Safety Agency concluded that planting Amflora to make starch posed no more risk than planting an ordinary potato. Based on that opinion, Europe's administrative governing body, the European Commission, recommended approval and passed the application to the Council of Ministers, where it has been voted on twice, first by a council of experts from member states in December and again on Monday by European agriculture ministers. Approval requires a 74 percent majority.
 But the two votes were inconclusive, with a huge number of countries abstaining on a decision that is a political minefield. The voting is anonymous, but some information leaked out: In the second vote, the agriculture ministers of Italy, Ireland and Austria voted no; Germany and Belgium said yes; and France and Bulgaria abstained.
 ''These are elected politicians and they have to face the general unease at home about G.M.O.'s,'' said a European Union official who asked not to be identified because of the delicacy of the issue. ''They are passing the buck to the commission, which is between a rock and a hard place on this issue.''
 Many experts and even some of Europe's environment ministers continue to dispute the European food agency's scientific opinion that Amflora is safe for cultivation. One concern is that it contains a gene for antibiotic resistance that could get out of the potato and into the environment, making bacteria that infect man and beast more difficult to treat.
 The European Food Safety Agency concluded that this was unlikely given the closed system in which potato-based starch is produced. But a second dossier from BASF -- one that received a positive review from the food safety agency, but has not yet come to a ministers' vote -- involves using leftover Amflora pulp from starch production for animal feed.
 ''It is a fact that there will be contamination, given the volume of the industry,'' said Mr. Contiero of Greenpeace. ''And if animals are eating pulp it certainly will end up in food. This is not just an opinion.''

HEADLINE: A Reality- Based Economy

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
If you've paid attention to the presidential campaign, you've heard the neopopulist story line. C.E.O.'s are seeing their incomes skyrocket while the middle class gets squeezed. The tides of globalization work against average Americans while most of the benefits go to the top 1 percent.
 This story is not entirely wrong, but it is incredibly simple-minded. To believe it, you have to suppress a whole string of complicating facts. 
 The first complicating fact is that after a lag, average wages are rising sharply. Real average wages rose by 2 percent in 2006, the second fastest rise in 30 years.
 The second complicating fact is that according to the Congressional Budget Office, earnings for the poorest fifth of Americans are also on the increase. As Ron Haskins of the Brookings Institution noted recently in The Washington Post, between 1991 and 2005, ''the bottom fifth increased its earnings by 80 percent, compared with around 50 percent for the highest-income group and around 20 percent for each of the other three groups.'' 
 The third complicating fact is that despite years of scare stories, income volatility is probably not trending upward. A study by the C.B.O. has found that incomes are no more unstable now than they were in the 1980s and 1990s.
 The fourth complicating fact is that recent rises in inequality have less to do with the grinding unfairness of globalization than with the reality that the market increasingly rewards education and hard work.
 A few years ago, the rewards for people earning college degrees seemed to flatten out. But more recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the education premium is again on the rise. 
 Fifth, companies are getting more efficient at singling out and rewarding productive workers. A study by the economists Thomas Lemieux, Daniel Parent and W. Bentley MacLeod suggests that as much as 24 percent of the increase in male wage inequality is due to performance pay.
 Sixth, inequality is also rising in part because people up the income scale work longer hours. In 1965, less educated Americans and more educated Americans worked the same number of hours a week. But today, many highly educated people work like dogs while those down the income scale have seen their leisure time increase by a phenomenal 14 hours a week.
 Seventh, it's not at all clear that the big winners in this economy are self-dealing corporate greedheads who are bilking shareholders. A study by Steven N. Kaplan and Joshua Rauh finds that it's not corporate honchos who are filling up the ranks of the filthy rich. It's hedge fund managers. Or, as Kaplan and Rauh put it, ''the top 25 hedge fund managers combined appear to have earned more than all 500 S.&P. 500 C.E.O.'s combined.'' The hedge fund guys are profiting not because there's been a shift in social norms favoring the megarich. It's just that a few superstars are now handling so much capital.
 Eighth, to the extent that C.E.O. pay packets have thickened (and they have), there may be good economic reasons. The bigger a company gets, the more a talented C.E.O. can do to increase earnings. Over the past two and a half decades, the value of top U.S. companies has increased 500 percent, according to Xavier Gabaix and Augustin Landier. The compensation for the C.E.O.'s of those companies has also increased 500 percent. 
 Ninth, we're in the middle of one of the greatest economic eras ever. Global poverty has declined at astounding rates. Globalization boosts each American household's income by about $10,000 a year. The U.S. economy, despite all the bad-mouthing, is chugging along. Thanks to all the growth, tax revenues are at 18.8 percent of G.D.P., higher than the historical average. The deficit is down to about 1.5 percent of G.D.P., below the historical average.
 All of this is not to say everything is hunky-dory. Inequality is obviously increasing. There's evidence that global trade is producing more losers.
 Instead, the main point is that the Democratic campaign rhetoric is taking on a life of its own, and drifting further away from reality. Feeding off pessimism about the war and anger at Washington, candidates now compete to tell dark, angry and conspiratorial stories about the economy. 
 I doubt there's much Republicans can do to salvage their fortunes by 2008. But over the long term a G.O.P. rebound can be built by capturing the Bill Clinton/Democratic Leadership Council ground that the Democrats are now abandoning. Whoever gets globalization right will have a bright future, and in the long run, the facts matter.

HEADLINE: Democracy Affirmed

 BODY:
The impressive re-election victory scored by Turkey's conservative Muslim ruling party is a tribute to the growing maturity of that country's politics and an inspiration for the cause of democracy in the broader Muslim world. 
 Voters rightly rejected the claim asserted by the traditional military-secular establishment that there is any fundamental incompatibility between democracy and Islam. Instead, they rewarded a party that has given the country its most competent and successful government in recent decades. That is exactly how democracy is supposed to work. 
 Since the Justice and Development Party (known by its Turkish initials, AK) came to power almost five years ago, its market-oriented policies have promoted strong economic growth and helped bring runaway inflation back under control. In its pursuit of European Union membership, AK has also pushed through a series of legal reforms that have expanded human rights and brought Turkish law closer to European standards. 
 Those reforms have stalled in the face of opposition from generals and civilian nationalists and discouraging signals from the E.U. about Turkish membership. The Kurdish minority is still subject to discriminatory legal restrictions. So is the ruling party's main constituency, observant Muslims. 
 The AK should use its huge victory to reinvigorate the drive for reforms, and not just for its Muslim supporters. But it still must be careful not to provoke a military leadership that sees itself as the guardian of secular nationalism and has been less than scrupulous about respecting electoral democracy. The AK, in contrast, has broadened its support by moving away from its original, narrowly Islamic roots. It is still a visibly Muslim party, but it is also a visibly democratic and tolerant party. 
 Turkey's generals should heed the voters. Washington should continue to press Turkey's case for E.U. membership. The example of a successful Muslim democracy can be a powerful weapon in the war of ideas against Islamic terrorism.

HEADLINE: Small Carriers Develop Niche Market, and the Big Guys Take Notice

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:
All business class, all the time?
 So it seems as Virgin Atlantic Airways and British Airways are indicating that they may compete with four start-up carriers for a market that no one knew existed just a few years ago: all-business-class flights. The new carriers offer fares far below those for regular business and first-class seats, along with private departure and arrival lounges and a path through the airport past the usual crowds at the gate.
 For now, the four start-ups -- Eos and MAXjet, which began flying in late 2005, and Silverjet and l'Avion, which started flights this year -- are offering only trans-Atlantic service. They chose those routes first because they are the most lucrative in the industry and flying them successfully proves they can compete with the big carriers.
 All four say the demand has exceeded their expectations. In June, for instance, the four reported that they filled 70 percent or more of their seats. And the more established airlines are taking notice. 
 ''There clearly is a demand for a niche for an all-business-class offering,'' said Richard Branson, the president and founder of Virgin Atlantic, whose Upper Class Suite business class is typically rated among the industry's best. 
 Virgin announced last month that, within 18 months, it planned to start flying some international routes using planes configured with all-business-class seating, after the Open Skies international agreement that takes effect in March significantly deregulates trans-Atlantic air travel.
 Mr. Branson said that Virgin's research showed a ''mood change in the last five years'' among business travelers, who ''want to sit in an airplane with people who are also working.''
 ''It's a status thing,'' he added, ''and a psychological thing.'' 
 Willie Walsh, the chief executive of British Airways, said that his airline was also studying routes and fare structures for all-business-class flights.
 Like Virgin, British Air would outfit smaller aircraft with a modified version of its existing and highly regarded business-class service on new routes between the United States and major European cities beyond London.
 ''This is clearly a real opportunity for us,'' Mr. Walsh said.
 Lufthansa dipped its toe in the all-business-class market in 2002 with a single flight in a partnership with the Swiss charter jet company PrivatAir. Lufthansa said recently that it was expanding its all-business-class service with a flight between Newark and Frankfurt beginning in late October. 
 Dodging the masses to travel on a business-class flight has less to do with snobbery than with practicality for business travelers, said Henry H. Harteveldt, a senior analyst at Forrester Research. 
 ''If you tell a business traveler, 'You can get to the airport 35 or 45 minutes before we close the door, and we guarantee you that you and your luggage will get there,' that is worth extra money,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. Many corporate travel managers, he said, are increasingly inclined to approve higher fares in exchange for improved productivity from traveling employees.
 Not that the sky is the limit. Walk-up round-trip business-class fares on major trans-Atlantic carriers can be as high as $10,000. While some travelers pay full fare, most do not. Large corporations that guarantee high volume can negotiate discounts of 40 percent or more off walk-up fares. 
 But even walk-up fares on the start-up business-class airlines typically begin below the corporate discount level. 
 The start-ups say that they attract travelers from small companies or entrepreneurs and others who do not have the clout to negotiate volume discounts from major airlines.
 On Friday, a walk-up round-trip fare to London on Eos (which flies 757s with 44 flat-bed seats) was $5,400.
 The other start-ups, which offer less luxurious but competitive business-class products, have lower fares. On Silverjet, for example, the walk-up round-trip fare to London was $3,254. MAXjet's walk-up fare was $2,600. On l'Avion, which flies between Newark and Orly Airport in Paris, the walk-up round-trip fare was $1,650. 
 Even without corporate discounts, advance bookings on Silverjet are as little as $1,600 round trip; Eos charges as little as $2,549. 
 An entry by Virgin and British Air into an all-business-class market dominated by the start-ups would pose new challenges for major United States carriers that offer trans-Atlantic flights like American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines, Mr. Harteveldt said.
 While some of the United States carriers are upgrading their business-class cabins -- United announced yesterday that it would upgrade its business-class cabins on overseas flights with lie-flat seats, becoming the first American carrier to offer the seats -- the domestic carriers have not yet reacted aggressively to the competition from the all-business-class start-ups.
 ''I'm not surprised that Eos, MAXjet, Silverjet and l'Avion are gaining traction,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. ''I'm not surprised that Virgin and British Airways have taken notice. But I am surprised that American carriers haven't tried to nip this in the bud.'' 
 One logical response, he said, would be for a domestic carrier to convert smaller planes -- perhaps Boeing 737s or Airbus A319s and A320s -- to all-business-class service on some trans-Atlantic routes, including some from busy locations like Hartford, Philadelphia or Raleigh, N.C.
 ''Our research shows that 50 percent of business travelers say they are willing to pay an above-average price for a noticeably better quality travel time,'' Mr. Harteveldt said. Furthermore, only about a third of business travelers describe themselves as ''brand loyal'' to a specific airline, he said. 
 Bill Stockbridge, MAXjet's chief executive, said that his airline had three major markets: entrepreneurs and small-business people who do not have access to big corporate discounts, high-end leisure travelers and international passengers from big companies with travel policies that restrict them to premium economy travel on major airlines.
 The start-ups are all expanding and looking for new aircraft. 
 In September, Eos will add eight weekly flights, for a total of 40, between Kennedy Airport in New York and Stansted Airport in London. MAXjet, which flies to Stansted from New York, Washington and Las Vegas, is adding a route from Los Angeles next month and recently applied for permission to fly between Seattle and Shanghai in 2009.
 Silverjet plans to add a third route between Newark and London Luton Airport by the end of the year. L'Avion plans to add a second flight between Paris and Newark next year. Marc Rochet, the airline's chief executive, said that l'Avion's plans could include adding routes to Paris and other European cities from other American cities.
 All the start-ups are burning cash, though all insist they are sufficiently capitalized. Load factors -- the percentage of available seats sold -- have generally exceeded the airlines' expectations. MAXjet, for example, said its June load factor was 83.1 percent.
 ''Will all four survive?'' Mr. Harteveldt asked. ''I don't know.'' 
 Virgin Atlantic and British Air say they need to tread lightly into the market, being careful not to detract from their existing top-tier (and top-dollar) business-class service.
 ''We now have five people working on the fare structure,'' Paul Charles, a Virgin spokesman, said. Virgin, whose fleet is dominated by wide-body aircraft like 747s and A340s, has said it would need to spend about $700 million to acquire smaller, narrow-body aircraft for all-business-class use.
 British Air already has suitable aircraft that it could readily convert, Mr. Walsh said. ''We have 21 767s and 13 757s,'' he said. ''We could use some of those aircraft and move quickly.'' 
 Like Virgin, British Air would concentrate on trans-Atlantic routes to cities other than London.
 Mr. Rochet of l'Avion said that Virgin and British Airways, saddled with cost structures of major airlines, face a problem setting fares that will compete with the all-business-class start-ups.
 ''L'Avion, MAXjet, Eos and Silverjet are not only all-business-class airlines, but they're also low-fare airlines with lean cost structures,'' he said. 
 Naturally, the market will shake out as more competitors enter. ''Ultimately, you're going to see a large number of business-only carriers,'' Mr. Charles of Virgin said.
 That, he said, is the biggest challenge for the start-ups. ''They certainly paved the way for the second generation in the market to emerge,'' he said. ''But what happens to the first generation?''
 Mr. Rochet said he is betting that most of the first generation will endure.
 ''In my view and in my shareholders' views, because we are always speaking money at the end of the day, we find that Virgin and B.A. joining this model is really proof that this is a very valuable niche market,'' he said. ''But we are already in it.''

HEADLINE: Shuttered Hospitals Ensure Slow Recovery in New Orleans

BYLINE: By LESLIE EATON

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS 

 BODY:
At the tip of Bayou St. John in the Mid-City neighborhood here, the brown and white bulk of Lindy Boggs Medical Center looms behind a chain-link fence. Nineteen people died at the medical center after Hurricane Katrina, and now the hospital itself is dead, sold to developers who plan to replace it with a shopping mall.
 On the surrounding streets -- Bienville and Canal and Jefferson Davis -- lies the wreckage of a once-bustling medical corridor. Doctors' offices sit empty behind five-foot-high water marks, and nearby clinics wait to be demolished. In back of one medical building, a gaping refrigerator still holds jars of mayonnaise and Mt. Olive Dill Relish.
 Harder to see, but just as tangible, people here say, are the other ripple effects of the flood and the closed hospital: workers displaced, houses for sale and, of course, patients forced to seek health care many miles away. If they have returned to New Orleans at all, that is, given the grave wounds to the health care system. 
 ''I've been telling people, don't bring your parents back if they are sick,'' said Dr. David A. Myers, an internist who lived and worked in Mid-City before the flood and has moved his home and practice to the suburbs. 
 Of all the factors blocking the economic revival of New Orleans, the shattered health care system may be the most important -- and perhaps the most intractable.
 Except for tourism and retailing, health care was the city's biggest private employer, and it paid much higher wages than hotels or stores. But there are now 16,800 fewer medical jobs than before the storm, down 27 percent, in part because nurses and other workers are in short supply.
 Only one of the city's seven general hospitals is operating at its pre-hurricane level; two more are partially open, and four remain closed. The number of hospital beds in New Orleans has dropped by two-thirds. In the suburbs, half a dozen hospitals in adjacent Jefferson Parish are open -- but are packed.
 Fixing the city's health care system ''is critical both for the short and the long term,'' said Andy Kopplin, executive director of the Louisiana Recovery Authority. ''Short-term, having confidence that the health care residents need will be available and accessible is vital for folks who are returning,'' Mr. Kopplin said. ''Long-term, it's important for employers -- and health care is a huge business in New Orleans.''
 Studies suggest that hundreds of doctors never returned. And some of those who did, especially specialists and young physicians, are leaving, said Dr. Ricardo Febry, president of the Orleans Parish Medical Society, which has lost more than 200 of its 650 members. The exodus has ''been a steady trickle,'' Dr. Febry said.
 The city's mortality rate appears to have risen sharply in 2006, although state and local officials disagree about the level and persistence of the increase.
 With the stress of life in the flood-ravaged city, the limited health care and insurance, the lingering mold and the discomfort of living in trailers, doctors report that the patients they see are often far sicker than those they treated before the storm. And even residents with health insurance can have a difficult time finding someone to treat them. 
 Government officials and civic leaders are floating plans for the future of the city's medical system, for a state-of-the-art hospital, for a cutting-edge system to cover the uninsured, even for a ''bio-innovation center'' that would be an engine for economic growth. The question is what will happen in the meantime, which is likely to be many years long.
 ''We have to find a way to survive to that point, to provide care, or our city will collapse,'' said John J. Finn, president of the Metropolitan Hospital Council of New Orleans.
 Waiting for Care
 The problems with health care hit hardest on the poor and the newly uninsured, but they also affect doctors and patients, politicians and entrepreneurs, the displaced and the returned -- and everyone at any level who has the misfortune to turn up in a jam-packed emergency room.
 Consider the case of Bernadine R. Fields, 50, who learned firsthand how far people have to go for major medical care. A supervisor of city 911 dispatchers, Ms. Fields was among the many laid off after the storm.
 The money she had saved for her retirement went for repairs to her house in New Orleans East. By last July, she could no longer afford the $367 a month it cost to continue her health insurance, or all the medicines she needed to treat her high blood pressure, or the $250 it would cost to see a doctor. 
 So she kept ending up in one of the few open emergency rooms, waiting for hours. After one of these episodes in April, she was told she needed transfusions to treat anemia -- but there was not a bed available in New Orleans for an uninsured patient.
 Ms. Fields finally got the treatment she needed -- but only after an ambulance took her to the state-run hospital in Baton Rouge, 80 miles from her home and family. She stayed there four days. 
 ''I devoted 15 years of my life to serving the public,'' she said, ''and when I need to be served, there is no one to count on.''
 Ms. Fields's neighborhood in the eastern section of the city, like other stretches of town, cannot recover unless medical care becomes available there, officials say, and neither can large sections of the economy. Doctors and hospitals, though, are reluctant to return unless the population does.
 ''I'm just hoping and praying nobody dies,'' said Frederick C. Young Jr., president of the Methodist Health System Foundation, which is working with the city to try to reopen a hospital there.
 The sharp contraction in the health care industry has economic effects, too, for coffee shops and florists and medical-supply companies. Marshall F. Gerson, whose family has owned the Ellgee Uniform Shop downtown for almost 70 years, said sales of scrubs and other medical uniforms had fallen to about half their pre-storm level. 
 ''At this time of day when times were good, it was bustle-bustle here,'' said Mr. Gerson, 63, standing in his shop late one recent afternoon. Now, ''the foot traffic is almost nil.''
 By working harder and selling more industrial and restaurant uniforms, Mr. Gerson has kept his business going but, he said, ''I'm not a happy person when I get home.''
 An Era's End
 The future of Mr. Gerson's shop -- and in many ways the future of health care in New Orleans -- is bound up in the thorny question of what if anything will replace the hospital known as Big Charity.
 Since it opened in 1939, Charity Hospital's imposing building downtown has provided basically all the medical care -- emergency, acute and basic -- for the city's poor, and served as a training ground for generations of doctors.
 Despite some community protests, Louisiana State University, which ran the hospital, closed it permanently after the storm, saying it was too damaged by basement flooding. The state plans to replace it with a $1.2 billion complex that officials believe will attract insured patients as well as the poor, will also care for veterans and will serve as an economic catalyst for the city. But the hospital's future is now the subject of a debate about the best use of federal health care dollars, even after the state agreed to pay $300 million to get the project off the ground. 
 The federal government would prefer that the state build a small hospital and use its federal dollars to buy private insurance for the poor. Dr. Frederick P. Cerise, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals, said that plan would help less than half of the uninsured.
 On a positive note, the city's trauma center, which treats gunshot wounds and other serious emergencies, reopened in February at University Hospital downtown, which like Charity is part of the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans. But the number of beds at University remains limited, and the building is so outdated that it will eventually have to be replaced, said Dr. Cathi Fontenot, the medical director. 
 In the meantime, the sick have to go somewhere. Often, that somewhere is Ochsner Medical Center, a huge private hospital complex in the western suburb of Metairie that looks like a mall, with a computerized grand piano that entertains patrons in a sunny atrium.
 Before Hurricane Katrina, patients waited just 20 minutes to be seen, said Dr. Joseph Guarisco, chairman of emergency services at Ochsner, and surveys found that 99 percent were satisfied with their care.
 After the storm, the number of people coming to the emergency room jumped, on some days reaching nearly twice the pre-hurricane volume. The number of psychiatric patients soared. 
 The uninsured, who had made up a small percentage of emergency patients at Ochsner, began accounting for more than a quarter of emergency room patients. Waiting times routinely topped an hour. The patient satisfaction rate fell to 34 percent. 
 This year, Dr. Guarisco reorganized the emergency room and cut the waiting time back to about 20 minutes.
 But the other problems remain. ''The hospital, post-Katrina, struggled financially,'' Dr. Guarisco said, ''and it still struggles to this day.''
 Bad Time for a Fracture
 No one thinks that emergency rooms are a good way to provide basic everyday health care, but government efforts to attract doctors and to open more neighborhood clinics have gotten off to a slow start.
 Volunteers and nonprofit groups are trying to fill the breach, treating thousands of patients a month in more than a dozen low-cost clinics in the city. In many ways, the clinics have been a success for their patients, as they are elsewhere in the country, but they represent just a drop in the city's ocean of medical need, health officials say.
 Some were open before the storm but have expanded; others are new, like the Common Ground Health Clinic, which provides free medical care four days a week in an old corner store in the Algiers neighborhood, across the Mississippi from the French Quarter. People wait outside in the heat for the clinic to open, and it is always jammed. 
 One recent Tuesday, the patients included a city employee with a neck problem, a college student with uncontrolled menstrual bleeding, a bartender with high blood pressure and glaucoma, and Nellie M. Lindsey, 54, a scrap hauler who was suffering from what she called ''cancer stones.''
 Before the storm, Ms. Lindsey said, she would have sought treatment at Charity, but she is so happy with the Common Ground clinic -- despite the long waits -- that she took her adult sons and daughter there for checkups.
 Most of the people who come to the clinic hold at least one job, and many are working two, said Anne Mulle, a family nurse practitioner who came from California after the storm to help and ended up staying.
 In addition to longstanding problems like hypertension, diabetes and heart disease, most patients have anxiety, depression and stress, which are even harder to treat, the clinic staff says.
 ''We can take the health piece off your worry list,'' said Dr. Ravi Vadlamudi, a Tulane University doctor who serves as the clinic's volunteer medical director. ''But we can't get you a better job market or housing market; we can't do anything about the schools; we can't do much with police problems. I can't do anything about most of what bothers you.''
 For patients who need more complicated care, including mammograms, stress tests and vision treatments, the clinic can make referrals to St. Thomas Community Health Center, which Dr. Donald T. Erwin founded in 1987. The fact that clinics are now collaborating -- and recently qualified for federal financing -- is a new and welcome development in what can seem like a bleak medical landscape, Dr. Erwin said.
 Another change he has seen, he said, is that even people with insurance are having a hard time finding doctors, getting tests and continuing prescriptions, so are turning up at his clinic, where they now make up about a quarter of the patients.
 ''Before the storm?'' Dr. Erwin continued, and held a thumb and forefinger together to make a zero.
 Counseling and mental health treatment are notoriously hard to find in New Orleans these days, and doctors say this is an especially bad time to break a leg, given the shortage of orthopedists. 
 Even patients with the means to pay and doctors who have returned can face long waits for treatment. Dr. Myers, the internist who used to practice in Mid-City, said recently that a new patient would probably have to wait two months for an appointment, though he would find a way to get existing patients in sooner. He estimates that 80 percent of those patients have returned. 
 Dr. Myers said he had been trying for months to lure another doctor to the area to join his practice.
 ''This is a great opportunity for people who have courage,'' he said.
 So far, he has found no takers.

HEADLINE: Tax Break Used by Drug Makers Failed to Add Jobs as Advertised

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
Two years ago, when companies received a big tax break to bring home their offshore profits, the president and Congress justified it as a one-time tax amnesty that would create American jobs.
 Drug makers were the biggest beneficiaries of the amnesty program, repatriating about $100 billion in foreign profits and paying only minimal taxes. But the companies did not create many jobs in return. Instead, since 2005 the American drug industry has laid off tens of thousands of workers in this country. 
 And now drug companies are once again using complex strategies, many of them demonstrably legal, to shelter billions of dollars in profits in international tax havens, according to their financial statements and independent tax experts.
 In one popular accounting move, companies declare their foreign markets as far more profitable than their American businesses -- even though drug prices are typically higher in the United States than anywhere else in the world. 
 Drug makers are not the only American multinationals using tax loopholes to declare large portions of their income beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service. The Brookings Institution estimates that multinational companies are using overseas tax shelters to lower their payments to the Treasury by about $50 billion a year. 
 But the drug industry accounts for one of the biggest portions of that shortfall, according to the I.R.S. and independent tax experts. And the nature of their business gives drug makers techniques, like sheltering valuable pharmaceutical patents in tax-friendly havens like Ireland, that many other industries cannot use. 
 Moreover, the sheer heft of the American drug industry, which had about $60 billion in pretax profits last year, can give disproportionate weight to the economic impact of its tax sheltering techniques. 
 Even though the tax amnesty legislation has expired, its passage encouraged companies to be even more aggressive about sheltering money, expecting another holiday in the future, said H. David Rosenbloom, director of the international tax program at New York University. Democrats and Republicans supported the legislation, which passed with sizable majorities in October 2004.
 ''Congress can swear on two stacks of Bibles that it'll never do it again,'' Mr. Rosenbloom said, ''but they've lost their virginity.'' 
 With a few narrow exceptions, the drug companies are supposed to be paying as much as 35 percent of their worldwide profits in United States federal taxes. In reality they pay much less. 
 Last year, for example Eli Lilly, the sixth-largest American drug maker, paid less than 6 percent of its profits of $3.4 billion to the United States government, according to its financial statement.
 Amgen, the American biotechnology giant, which reported last year that 80 percent of its $14.3 billion in sales occurred in this country, paid about 22 percent in United States federal tax on its $4 billion in profits. 
 The discrepancy was possible because Amgen claimed a profit margin of almost 100 percent on its foreign sales, but only 15 percent on its American sales. 
 The I.R.S. has recently increased the number of examiners trying to find hidden profits overseas. It has even had some victories, as in February when the drug maker Merck agreed to pay $2.3 billion to the government to settle a claim it had hidden profits in a Bermuda partnership. 
 ''This is really a priority for the service right now -- there's a lot of focus on cross-border transactions,'' said Frank Y. Ng, the I.R.S. deputy commissioner for international tax matters. But even after adding resources, the I.R.S. has only about 500 examiners to review international returns.
 Lilly said in a statement that it complied with the law in taking advantage of the 2005 tax amnesty, which enabled the company to avoid more than $2.3 billion in American taxes. Lilly said it believed that the 2005 tax break had encouraged investment in the United States, noting that the company, which is based in Indianapolis, has invested $1.3 billion in the state of Indiana alone.
 Still, since the beginning of 2005, Lilly has cut its United States work force by more than 8 percent, reducing it to 22,000 jobs by last January. 
 Lilly also noted that its overall reported worldwide tax rate for 2006 -- which includes taxes paid to other countries and taxes that it has deferred but will theoretically pay at some future date -- was about 20 percent in 2006. 
 Pfizer, Merck and Amgen declined requests for comment.
 Tax experts like Michael J. McIntyre, a law professor at Wayne State University in Detroit, say the drug makers are taking advantage of antiquated rules that work better for manufactured products like steel and automobiles. 
 Under this system, when companies transfer products between divisions in different countries, they must account for the sales internally through ''transfer pricing.'' But they have significant discretion in how they set prices for these transactions.
 That turns out to be especially so for high-margin products like drugs, which in pill form cost only a few cents each to make once they have been invented, but can be sold for several dollars apiece. The hefty profit margins result in part from patents that can protect the drugs from competition for years. And by transferring those valuable patents overseas, companies can declare that their profits should follow the patents overseas as well.
 Under the rules of transfer pricing, if a company moves patents or other so-called intangibles from its United States division to a foreign subsidiary, the foreign unit is supposed to pay the American division a fair-market price. But outsiders have a difficult time determining if companies have properly assessed the value of patents, trademarks and other intangible properties.
 To further complicate matters, some corporate subsidiaries in tax-haven countries, like Singapore and the Netherlands, now directly finance research in the United States. So they own the patents without ever having to ''buy'' them from their American parents, Mr. McIntyre said.
 ''They don't even have to push it offshore,'' Mr. McIntyre said. ''It's already offshore. And once it's offshore, they strip the income from the onshore activity.''
 In theory, companies are only deferring taxes on the profits they shelter overseas, not permanently avoiding tax. If they bring the money back to the United States to distribute to their shareholders, they still have to pay American taxes on it.
 But those rules were temporarily suspended when President Bush signed legislation in 2004 to let companies return overseas profits at a rate of 5.25 percent, far below the official tax rate of 35 percent, if they moved the money back by 2006.
 During that period, multinational companies of all stripes moved a total of about $300 billion into the United States, avoiding about $90 billion in taxes. Among them, the pharmaceutical industry was the largest single beneficiary. Leading the pack was Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, which repatriated $36 billion.
 The quid pro quo was supposed to be that the drug industry would invest some of its tax windfall in American operations and jobs. Instead, struggling with a dearth of new blockbuster drugs, they have had mass layoffs. Again, Pfizer has been the leader, reducing its work force by about 8,000 in 2006 and saying early this year that it would lay off an additional 10,000 employees. 
 Some experts now say the current system of taxing overseas profits should be scrapped. Even the companies that take advantage of loopholes might benefit if the system were changed, because they could save money on tax planning and have more certainty that the I.R.S. would accept their returns, said Michael C. Durst, a former I.R.S. official who is now special counsel to the law firm Steptoe & Johnson.
 The simplest solution, Mr. Durst said, would be shifting to a system in which companies would assign a portion of profit to each country where they made a sale, relative to the size of the sale. Instead of trying to tax profits made overseas, the United States government would simply take its share of the profits on American sales. Such a system would be harder for the companies to game, Mr. Durst said.
 But he and other tax experts say that any effort to close loopholes, to be politically viable, might have to be combined with a lowering of the corporate tax rate from its current 35 percent. And no one expects any legislation of that sort, at least not before the next election.

HEADLINE: The Tribe That Earned A Triple-A Bond Rating

BYLINE: By SUSAN MORAN

DATELINE: IGNACIO, Colo. 

 BODY:
Many American Indian tribes count on money-losing casino gamblers to generate most of the income for their members. The Southern Ute tribe, whose 700,000-acre reservation here in the San Juan Basin sits on one of the world's richest deposits of methane found in coal seams, is a lot luckier. 
 After many years of struggling to gain control of its natural resources from big energy companies, the Southern Utes now control the distribution of roughly 1 percent of the nation's natural gas supply. Thanks to high gas prices in recent years and lucrative investments in and beyond the energy sectors, this once-impoverished tribe is now worth about $4 billion. Each of its 1,400 members is a millionaire many times over, on paper anyway. 
 The Southern Utes are not just sitting on their wealth. They have become a model for other resource-based tribes and an energy powerhouse in Colorado. And as gas prices have softened, the tribe has recently sought to diversify by becoming a real estate investor, too, buying up swaths of valuable land and buildings in La Plata County and throughout the West. 
 The local area has benefited from the tribe's largess as the biggest, and, many say, its most generous employer. But some residents are wary and even suspicious of the tribe's newfound clout.
 ''The point is, no one knows what the tribe's plans are,'' said Josh Joshwick, a former county commissioner who currently works for an environmental organization in Durango on oil and gas issues. ''I guarantee, it'll have a bigger impact than any organization on this community and on the whole La Plata County.'' 
 The tribe, which runs its various businesses through an arm known as the Growth Fund, is extending its reach. It recently donated 25 acres on the eastern edge of Durango, the largest town in southern Colorado, so that an old hospital the county had outgrown could be rebuilt and expanded. The giveaway also made good business sense; the hospital, which opened a year ago, is attracting ancillary businesses and employees to a sprawling residential and commercial development called Three Springs that the tribe is building on 1,400 acres it owns.
 ''You'll hear some people say they liked the tribe better when it was poor,'' said a local resident who declined to be identified for fear of jeopardizing relations between the tribe and the county.
 Clement Frost, the Southern Ute chairman, hears that kind of talk often. 
 ''I don't think people outside can accept how quickly the tribe has progressed to where we've become a political and economic force,'' he said in a recent interview in his spacious office in the tribal capital here in Ignacio. 
 As a modern tribal leader, Mr. Frost wears many hats. One morning, he attended a retreat to make decisions about investing millions more of the tribe's funds in new ventures aimed at preserving wealth for future generations long after the last well is pumped dry. As evening approached he delivered the welcoming talk at a powwow. The next day he branded calves and bulls on his 158-acre ranch.
 From his office window he used to look at double-wide trailers. Now he sees a plush $9.4 million recreation and community center built in 2000; a new elementary school; and a three-story, curved-glass building erected in 2005 that houses the tribe's business umbrella. Just up the road is a large construction site where a 150-room casino and conference center is going up to replace the existing 35-room gambling hall. 
 If some neighbors have been reluctant to accept the Southern Utes' newfound financial prowess, Wall Street has not. In 2001, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings issued the tribe its first bond rating: a triple-A. Earlier this year both firms reaffirmed their ratings. 
 ''A big factor was the Southern Ute tribe's tremendous amount of reserves relative to the amount of need,'' said Karl Jacob, an analyst at Standard & Poor's who covers Native American tribes. ''In a normal world, if you have reserves 50 percent of operations you're looking pretty strong. The tribe's reserves in its general fund in 2006 were 21.6 times expenditures.''
 He attributed the tribe's sustained financial strength in part to business executives like Bob Zahradnik, who is a not a Native American. Formerly with Exxon, he went to work for the tribe in 1988 to help monitor energy companies' compliance with leases and to evaluate its mineral assets to bolster its negotiating clout.
 In 1991 Mr. Zahradnik drafted a business plan for the first tribe-owned energy business. Within a year he convinced the tribal council to begin the start-up, called the Red Willow Production Company, with $8 million in seed capital. 
 When the tribe started buying back existing wells and leases, few lenders would shake Mr. Zahradnik's hand, much less extend their wallets. 
 ''We couldn't get any financing,'' Mr. Zahradnik said during a break from a two-day tribal leaders retreat at a golfing resort north of Durango. ''Before we closed our first deal with Conoco and got in trade publications nobody believed we were credible. Now, with substantial assets and a triple-A credit rating, everybody wants to be our friend.''
 Mr. Zahradnik has been the Growth Fund's operating director since its inception in 2000. The fund's executive director is Bruce Valdez, a Southern Ute who was raised on the reservation and worked for Arco before joining the tribal business two years ago.
 ''We've come a long way from the tribe I grew up with to the tribe we are today,'' the soft-spoken Mr. Valdez said in an interview while drinking tea with Mr. Zahradnik.
 Wealth did not come suddenly to the Southern Utes, nor without struggle. Originally they were one of seven bands of the Ute tribe, which occupied nearly one-third of Colorado. In the 1870s the state's governor, Frederick Pitkin, in his drive to open up the Rocky Mountain's western slope to non-Indian settlers, ripped apart a major treaty.
 What became the Southern Ute tribe ended up with a fraction of the original land, and the reservation became a checkerboard of Southern Utes and non-Indians. Some 9,500 non-Indians live on the reservation today, far outnumbering the 1,000 Southern Utes (another 400 members live off the reservation) and 433 Native Americans of other tribes.
 After cutting deals with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, energy companies began drilling in the 1950s for natural gas. The tribe had little say, and received only paltry royalties. By the late 1980s, the energy boom was in full swing. As late as 1990 the Southern Ute tribe was still dirt poor, even though 63 oil and gas companies operated on its land. 
 A major turning point came in 1991, when under the leadership of then-chairman, Leonard Burch, the tribe started buying back drilling rights and hiring its own oilmen to run the wells. Red Willow became the vehicle to manage energy production. 
 ''What tribes have been all about in modern history is taking back their reservations,'' said Charles Wilkinson, a law professor at the University of Colorado specializing in Native American law. ''When the Southern Utes put a hold on oil and gas leasing, that was as powerful a statement as any tribe had made. It has been a signature of economic development for successful tribes, and this tribe has been as successful as they come.''
 Red Willow now has interests in more than 1,000 wells and operates more than 450 on the reservation, making it the second largest here behind only BP. It is the 13th largest privately held energy producer in the United States, according to The Oil & Gas Financial Journal.
 The tribe employs more than 600 people in several states and is adding 10 jobs each month. It manages several subsidiaries, most started since 2000. The energy division owns 3,000 miles of pipelines, and it processes natural gas and delivers it to transmission pipelines and elsewhere. The energy businesses account for 93 percent of the Growth Fund's net income, according to Mr. Zahradnik, who would not disclose absolute figures. 
 With natural gas production now dwindling from its peak in 2004 by 10 percent a year, the Fund's managers are aggressively expanding nonenergy investments, building commercial and residential complexes in Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri and other states. Rent and other income from the properties is growing rapidly but it still generates only about 4 percent of net income.
 Some Southern Ute members have complained that the tribe relies too heavily on whites to run its businesses. Despite a policy to give preference to tribal members, only 61 of the fund's 631 employees are Southern Utes and another 40 are Native Americans of other tribes.
 Mr. Valdez, the only Southern Ute in a major business executive position, said he and others are actively trying to train and hire tribal members. One problem, he said, is that individual tribe members already receive a healthy income from the tribal coffers, diminishing, for some, the motivation to work.
 Years ago, teenagers received a lump sum when they turned 18. Some binged on alcohol and drugs. Some bought fancy race cars. In 1995 a teenage Southern Ute girl, who was Mr. Frost's niece, was killed by robbers after she cashed an ''18 money'' check worth thousands of dollars.
 After that tragedy the tribal council tightened the purse strings. It now distributes trust money in smaller installments to members under 25 and it holds off doling out cash until young members finish high school or get a G.E.D. As adults, tribal members receive a monthly check -- roughly $1,400 at today's prices -- that remains constant in real terms until at age 60 they become eligible for an elder's pension of about $65,000 a year.
 The tribe now offers full scholarships and living stipends for college. Dewayne Evensen is one of the more mature recipients. He entered a community college in New Mexico at age 47 before attending Northeastern State University in Oklahoma, where he earned both an undergraduate and a master's degree in business. He now works for a tribal subsidiary in Tulsa.
 Mr. Dewayne, 52, said he was grateful, but he is exploring other opportunities, including law school.
 ''The tribe has also given me the ability to seek other avenues,'' he said. ''On the other hand, the Growth Fund is so huge right now that it'd be hard to get around it.''

REGISTERED TRAVELER UPDATE The Registered Travel program continues to emerge -- slowly. Verified Identity Pass, which runs Clear, the first version of the program to be in operation, said it would open and market a Clear lane at La Guardia Airport in New York in a partnership with AirTran Airways. Clear, which began operating at the airport in Orlando, Fla., two years ago, also has lanes at Kennedy International Airport and at Newark Liberty International Airport, and at airports in Indianapolis, Cincinnati and San Jose, Calif. It plans to open at the Albany airport next month. Steven Brill, the chief executive, said that Clear has 55,000 members (at $99.95 a year). He said he believed membership would reach 100,000 by September. In an interview last March, Mr. Brill said he expected that Clear could have 200,000 to 400,000 members by the end of the year. 
 REVENUE RISE ON FOREIGN ROUTES Wondering how major airlines justify removing bigger planes from domestic service and shifting them, with their extra seats, onto international routes? Look at the June report of the Air Transport Association on airline yields -- the money collected for each mile flown. Average yields on domestic routes this year through June, compared with the period in 2006, were up a slight 0.9 percent. But yields on the Atlantic routes were up 9.1 percent and up 8.5 percent on Pacific routes.
 AIRLINE EMPLOYMENT INCREASES The seven domestic network airlines employed 266,600 workers in May, an increase of 0.3 percent since May 2006. This was the first increase from the same month of the previous year since August 2001, the Bureau of Transportation Statistics said. 
 FLIGHT CANCELLATIONS RISE There were 342,903 arriving flights in the first two weeks of July, 20 percent more than in the period last summer. But nearly twice as many flights -- 6,960 compared with 3,618 -- were canceled in the first two weeks of July compared with that period last year, according to FlightStats.com. 
 EMIRATES EXPANSION Emirates Airline said it would take delivery of 24 new long-haul Boeing 777s in the next 18 months as it continues to expand and refurbish its existing fleet. Emirates said it is introducing an upgrade to its first-class cabins, which already feature individual suites with doors, to add extra storage room and other improvements. Emirates, which announced its expansion plans yesterday at the annual convention of the National Business Travel Association in Boston, is one of the world's fastest-growing airlines.
 ET CETERA Cathay Pacific Airways will add a second daily nonstop flight between San Francisco and Hong Kong on Oct. 18. ... Microtel Inns & Suites said it had 18 property openings and 10 groundbreakings in the first half of this year, and said that it was the development leader in economy lodging, representing 51 percent of all hotels currently in development in that niche. ... A new wine bar and retail store, Vino Volo, opened at Seattle Tacoma International Airport. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Older Workers, Tired of Routine, Turn to Franchising

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
An increasing number of old geezers are sprouting their 401(k) wings and flying off to quasi-entrepreneurial land of franchising.
 It is a happening place to be. The International Franchise Association (www.franchise.org) in Washington, estimates that the ranks of franchised businesses have increased to 850,000 from 760,000 six years ago, and says that from 2003 to 2005, the number of ''franchise concepts'' shot up by 900, to 2,500. Franchising cuts across 75 industries and generates one out of seven jobs in the private sector, the trade group says.
 For people with long workplace experience and discontent with the tedium of their jobs, or of retirement, plus a nest egg waiting to be raided, it can be a happy hunting ground. 
 The industry is obliging older folks by coming up with ideas that cater to their inclinations, like seasonal businesses. If you buy a location from Rita's Water Ice (www.ritasice.com), a chain based in Trevose, Pa., with 400 stores and plans for 1,500 by 2010, for example, you could sell Italian ices and other cold treats in Boston in the summer and retreat to the golf courses of Florida in the winter.
 On the flip side, a growing number of franchises are filling the needs of really old geezers by offering services like disposing the accumulated possessions of a lifetime when they move from their big houses in the suburbs to assisted-living homes, or sending their staff to help the ones who stay in their big houses with their shopping or medications.
 Franchising is not risk-free, of course. ''There are a lot of bad guys out there,'' says Barney Greenbaum, who runs the Columbus, Ohio, office of FranNet (www.letsfranchise.com), a network of franchise advisers. His counsel to potential franchisees: Hire a local consultant who specializes in the industry (him, for example, if you live in Columbus), actually read the inch-plus-thick and confounding ''offering circulars'' that franchisers are required to send interested parties, sound out existing franchisees about their experience and get the advice of a financial adviser and an accountant and, before you sign on the dotted line, a lawyer.
 If not devoid of perils, however, franchising is generally regarded as a more secure investment than starting a business from scratch -- to say nothing of the greater ease with which you (or your widow) can sell the property when the time comes.
 In fact, it just got a bit more secure. Early this year, in the first overhaul of its rules governing the sector in three decades, the Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov) announced new safeguards for franchisees, like requiring franchisers to disclose any lawsuits they have brought against their franchisees and whether they have confidentiality agreements with franchisees, past or present, to keep their mouths shut about their gripes.
 Some critics say the new regulations don't go far enough. Susan Kezios, president of the American Franchisee Association (www.franchisee.org) in Chicago, for example, called them ''toothless'' in a recent Law Journal newsletter because they deny investors the right to sue ''to obtain normal legal redress.'' But most experts say they are a welcome, if modest, step in the right direction. (They don't become mandatory until July 2008.)
 At least they exist. What attracts the AARP crowd is franchising's safety net, not only of regulatory oversight but also of the administrative and logistical support they know they will get from headquarters.
 ''More older people are starting franchises, definitely,'' says Terry Hill, an I.F.A. spokesman. ''Baby boomers don't want to retire; they want to stay active.''
 Mr. Greenbaum, the consultant, says most of his clients are 45 to 60. Some have been laid off, some have gotten sick of their jobs and some have retired, only to realize they can't live well on their savings.
 Whatever the reason, they share a passion: doing it on their own. One of Mr. Greenbaum's clients, Greek-born Matt Barouh, left the shoe industry to start a staffing franchise in Florida -- and exults in his escape from the frustrations that dogged him throughout his former career.
 Mr. Barouh began working the cash registers at the giant Gilbert Shoe Company department store in Columbus at age 11, and not too many years later, was running it. He started retail chains and ran divisions for the R. G. Barry Corporation, a shoe distributor. He started a shoe-importing operation for the Kobacker Company. He tried unsuccessfully to open a shoe emporium modeled after Toys ''R'' Us. He became a franchisee of several Just for Feet athletic-shoe stores but was forced to liquidate his assets after the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1999. Then, well, you know the routine. He became a consultant.
 He also looked around for a business to buy. It hit him that he could do whatever he wanted -- and what he wanted was to peel off for Florida and leave the shoe trade in the dust.
 ''I wanted a business with no inventory liability,'' he said. ''At one point in the shoe business, I owned $11 million in inventory. Never again. I wanted a pure service industry.
 ''I wanted a minimum number of employees. I once had 700 employees. That kind of payroll is an awesome responsibility. Now I have six.''
 He chose Express Personnel Services and Professional Staffing (www.expresspersonnel.com) and set up shop in St. Petersburg, Fla., in November 2004 at age 58. It is thriving, he says, though in a temporary lull that he attributes to the housing slump. But even that is fine by him. ''In a soft economy, inventory used to go up in the shoe trade,'' he said. ''Accounts payable used to go up. That doesn't happen in this business.''
 Not only that, but Mr. Barouh now works 40-hour weeks instead of 20-hour days, and has the time to poke around for new business opportunities. He is thinking of buying a franchise from a new venture that essentially acts as an intermediary between insurance companies (and other clients plagued by fraudulent claims) and the private investigators they hire.
 Why? Well, why not'' ''People in my age group will never retire,'' he says. ''We'll just change directions.''

HEADLINE: A Movable Beast: Asian Pythons Thrive in Florida

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. 

 BODY:
Skip Snow, a federal biologist in Everglades National Park, would love to spend his days monitoring the dizzying array of native wildlife across this 1.5-million-acre ''river of grass'' west of the ever-expanding Miami metropolis.
 Lately, however, he has been spending ever more time studying the remains of the park's birds and animals, extracted from the stomachs of captured or road-killed Burmese pythons, the latest -- and most spectacular -- addition to Florida's growing list of biological interlopers.
 Opening a packed freezer in a park laboratory, Mr. Snow sifted dated plastic bags containing fur, feathers, bones and other vestiges of recent python prey. 
 ''We've found everything, from very small mammals -- native cotton mice, native cotton rats, rabbits, squirrels, possums, raccoons, even a bobcat, most recently the hooves of a deer,'' Mr. Snow said. ''Wading birds and water birds, pipe-billed grebes, coots, egrets, limpkins and at least one big alligator.'' 
 The South Asian snakes, which can top 200 pounds and 20 feet, probably entered the park as discards or escapees from the bustling global trade in exotic pets. Year-old, footlong pythons are a popular $70 item at reptile fairs and on the Web but in a few years can reach room-spanning, cat-munching size, prompting some owners to abandon them by the roadside. That practice may not pose an ecological problem in Detroit, Mr. Snow said, but in a near-tropical Florida park, it is an unfolding nightmare. 
 Some very rough estimates put the state's pet python population above 5,000. More than 350 have been found in the park since 2002, with others showing up in mangroves along Florida's west coast and farther north in the state. There are perhaps 10 more for every one that is seen, Mr. Snow said.
 In May 2006, biologists confirmed that Everglades pythons were not a transient curiosity when they found the first eggs. ''There were 46 eggs, 44 fertile,'' Mr. Snow said. Shortly afterward, they found another clutch of two dozen, already hatched. 
 Signs abound, he said, that the pythons are still colonizing new terrain. ''This is a species that is really made for invading.''
 Mr. Snow and other wildlife biologists have been on something of a crusade of late, pressing federal and state governments to crack down on the trade in such species, quicken responses when an invader appears in the wild and expand federal preventive screening to identify -- ahead of time -- imported animals and plants that are most apt to spread in this country. 
 While there is a National Invasive Species Council whose membership includes cabinet-level officials, the grunt work of preventive species screening is done by a handful of biologists at the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
 The vast majority of the $1 billion or so the government spends each year on invasive species goes to managing existing problems, with about 10 percent, according to a recent government report, going to prevention. In the meantime, the government estimates that invasive species cost the economy $100 billion a year.
 The python may be a marquee-quality ''spokes-snake'' for invasive species, Mr. Snow said, but it is hardly alone in its potential to disrupt ecosystems and pose a possible threat to people and the economy once established. Along with hundreds of accidental immigrants like zebra mussels, there have been innumerable intentionally imported plants and animals that have become vexing, expensive problems. Once they are noticed, it is almost always too late, or too costly, to eradicate them, experts say.
 Still, such species tend to become a priority only after the fact, biologists say. It was not until this year that a new Florida law established a list of six ''reptiles of concern'' (including the python). The state will soon require $100-a-year owners' permits and the insertion of identifying microchips under the skin of the purchased pets. 
 This year, the South Florida Water Management District petitioned the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to add Burmese pythons to a list of ''injurious wildlife'' maintained under the 107-year-old Lacey Act. 
 Kari Duncan, the director of the service's invasive species program, said it could take a while to make that determination. There is only one federal biologist, Erin Williams, whose job is to do such assessments, and she is already stacked up with years of work, mainly on fast-spreading carp and other aquatic species, Ms. Duncan said.
 In the meantime, the workload has grown. In a 2002 executive order, the Bush administration added a requirement that potential economic effects to small businesses and the like from such listings be studied. Adding to the challenge, Ms. Duncan said, is that the tiny budget for the screening program, essentially Ms. Williams's salary, must be fought for year by year.
 One sign of progress, of a sort, Ms. Duncan said, is that ''this was just 1/32 of a job a few years ago.''
 The reviews are bogging down even as the accelerating globalization of trade and travel has greatly raised the chances of more damaging invasions, experts say. The species are flowing in all directions, with American bullfrogs overrunning local amphibians in France, and Louisiana crayfish spreading in Chinese streams even as Asian snakehead fish advance here. 
 ''This pipeline, it's almost equivalent to a large Russian roulette game,'' Mr. Snow said. ''We're firing this tremendous number of animals, not only individual species, but tremendous quantities of each, coming in the country. As a general rule of thumb, 50 percent of those invasive plants and animals that sort of get out will establish, will be able to reproduce, and about 50 percent of those will spread. We just continue to fire away and never knowing which one is going to be the next Burmese python.''
 David M. Lodge, the director of the Center for Aquatic Conservation at the University of Notre Dame, has been an author on a series of recent studies of the issue, including a position paper last year from the Ecological Society of America pressing for much stronger federal investment and action. 
 ''When it comes to importing live organisms, our policies are entirely reactive,'' Dr. Lodge said. ''It's as if in the drug realm we were to allow any new drug or food product on the market until it kills someone and then consider a regulation to ban it.''
 With invasive species, though, the situation is actually potentially worse, he said, because banning them after the fact does not eliminate the threat. 
 As Mr. Snow put it, ''Invasives are the gift that keeps on giving, because of the biological imperative to reproduce.''
 The benefits of action greatly outweigh the costs, Dr. Lodge said, citing the example of Australia's system for screening imported ornamental plants, with swift initial assessments usually taking just one week.
 Lori Williams, the executive director of the federal invasive species council, said Florida's growing focus on snakes and other terrestrial introduced species could raise the profile of the issue in Congress. 
 Like many preventive efforts, she said, fighting introduced species is a tough sell in the arena of politics. ''This is one of those problems you don't tend to see until it's already out there, that kind of sneaks up on you,'' Ms. Williams said. ''It's also not a terribly fun, sexy problem because you have to go out and kill things to solve it.''
 Mr. Snow, while eager for more prevention, is also spending time in the field eradicating whatever pythons can be found. 
 One method is to turn the python's biology against it. It appears that males seek females in the spring by following scent trails, so park biologists, along with other scientists, are testing whether females -- with radio transmitters inserted into their body cavities -- can serve as ''Judas snakes,'' a living lure for mate-seeking males. 
 The tags are also helping park biologists get a sense of individual snake's habits amid the miles of saw grass, brush-studded ''hammocks,'' old wooded levees and sloughs. 
 On a recent checkup on several tagged females, Mr. Snow and Lori Oberhofer, another park biologist, headed out in Mr. Snow's battered, white S.U.V. with a beeping radio-tracking receiver and ''Python Pete,'' a beagle trained to sniff out pythons.
 The challenge of extirpating such snakes in such a vast place becomes clear up close. Even when the beeps and snuffling dog indicated that a 10-foot python was between Mr. Snow and a reporter 15 feet away, the animal could not be located for a couple of minutes -- until it slid directly past the reporter's soggy shoes.
 While Mr. Snow is hunting whatever pythons he can find and pushing for new laws and more money for preventive programs, he is also working at the grass-roots level. 
 In frequent slide presentations to community groups, he pulls no punches, describing how the snakes seize prey with small sharp teeth and suffocate it with muscular coils. There are several recorded deaths of pet owners in the United States strangled or suffocated by pythons.
 One slide says: ''Do you really want a snake that may grow more than 20 feet long or weigh 200 pounds, urinate and defecate like a horse, live more than 25 years and for whom you will have to kill mice, rats and, eventually, rabbits?''
 But the appeal of the snakes persists in the pet trade, which has seen the number of households with a reptile pet climb to nearly 5 million from fewer than 2.8 million through much of the 1990s, according to industry surveys. 
 Despite his focus on pythons, Mr. Snow's greatest worry remains the next species down the line, whatever that may be. 
 Amid the bags of frozen biological items back in the park laboratory was a coiled eight-foot-long yellow-bellied snake that Mr. Snow received in January. A forestry crew in Big Cypress National Preserve had stumbled on the animal, he said. ''They assumed it was a python, but when I looked at it and saw it had nostrils on top of its head, I said, 'Oops, this is no python.' ''
 It was a yellow anaconda, from South America, not South Asia. 
 ''Is this one individual or a population?'' he mused. ''Do we put a moratorium on sales or do nothing? Is it the new kid on the block? We don't know yet.''

HEADLINE: At Fermilab, the Race Is On for the 'God Particle'

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
In 1977, Steven Weinberg, then two years shy of the Nobel Prize in Physics, decided to do a little of what some theorists call ''ambulance chasing.''
 He heard a rumor, while spending a year at Stanford, that collisions at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory were spitting out weird triplets of particles known as muons, which are sort of fat electrons. Dr. Weinberg canceled reservations at a lodge in Yosemite National Park to spend the weekend with his colleague Benjamin Lee, trying to concoct a theory to explain the trimuons.
 But the only theory he and Dr. Lee could come up with was ugly. A few weeks later it turned out that the triplet effect wasn't true.
 ''I've always been embarrassed that we managed to come up with a theory,'' Dr. Weinberg, now at the University of Texas at Austin, said recently. 
 Dr. Weinberg said that 30 years later, he still has not gotten to Yosemite.
 ''And we never got trimuons either,'' he added.
 And therein lies a lesson -- or not -- for the world's physicists. 
 Earlier this summer, the physics world was jolted by a rumor that a team of scientists from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, or Fermilab, in Batavia, Ill., had found a bump in their data that might be a legendary particle that has haunted physicists for a generation. It is known colloquially as the Higgs boson and sometimes grandly as the ''God particle.'' According to the Standard Model that has ruled physics for 30 years, the Higgs endows elementary particles in the universe with mass.
 The history of physics is full of bumps that could have been revolutionary but have disappeared like ghosts in the night, and this rumor of a possible Higgs sighting was not even the first this year. Most physicists who have heard this rumor think that this bump is likely to be another of those disappearing anomalies, like the trimuons that frustrated Dr. Weinberg. But then these same physicists point out that you never know.
 The team, known as the D Zero collaboration and numbering some 600 physicists from 19 countries and 88 institutions, will not even say whether there is a bump in its data until the scientists have decided for sure that it is nature calling and not just a random statistical fluctuation.
 ''It's a rigorous process; we don't want to make a trivial mistake,'' explained Dmitri Denisov of Fermilab, one of the co-leaders, or spokesmen, of the team, which is named for the giant detector it built to record the remains of smashups of trillion-electron-volt protons and antiprotons in Fermilab's Tevatron particle accelerator.
 D Zero is the younger of two rival detectors at the accelerator. The other, known as the Collider Detector Facility, or C.D.F., was built and staffed by an equally large group that is scouring its own data for the Higgs and other new phenomena.
 As the analyses proceed and the Tevatron hums its trillion-electron-volt tune, this is a summer of rumors, hope and hype. Whatever the outcome for this particular Higgs rumor, the buzz about it illuminates the galloping expectations, tensions and rivalries roiling physicists as they await the inauguration next summer of the Large Hadron Collider, a giant accelerator at CERN, the nuclear laboratory outside Geneva expressly designed to find the Higgs particle and explore new realms of nature. 
 The excitement has been ratcheted up by the speed and ubiquity of information on the Internet. 
 ''It is exciting even if you think the chances of it being true are only 0 or 10 percent,'' said Tommaso Dorigo, from the University of Padua in Italy, who helped spread the D Zero rumor in June on his blog, A Quantum Diaries Survivor (http://dorigo.wordpress.com). ''It's something you were looking for and would be very happy to find.''
 Joe Lykken, a Fermilab theorist who said he first learned of the rumored bump the old-fashioned way, over lunch in the laboratory cafeteria, said: ''Pre-blog, this sort of rumor would have circulated among perhaps a few dozen physicists. Now with blogs even string theorists who can't spell Higgs became immediately aware of inside information about D Zero data.'' 
 Jacobo Konigsberg, of the University of Florida, co-leader of the rival C.D.F. group, grumbled,''These blogs put a powerful loudspeaker in the mouths of a few people.''
 Confirming the rumored bump would confirm a profound conjecture about how nature works, cementing into place the last missing piece of the so-called Standard Model and perhaps pointing the way to a deeper theory that could answer questions the current model leaves open -- such as why the universe is full of matter but not antimatter -- a New World of physics.
 It would also be an enormous coup for American science, a last Hail Mary touchdown before the new European collider fires up its beams of protons, which will collide with seven trillion electron volts of energy apiece.
 The CERN collider is the future of physics, Dr. Konigsberg said: ''But it would be a fantastic feat to add one more jewel to the crown of discoveries from the Tevatron. We have our pride.''
 According to the Standard Model, a suite of equations that describe all the forces but gravity, elementary particles and forces are born equal and without mass. Some then acquire mass by wading through a sort of a cosmic molasses called the Higgs field (named after the physicist Peter Higgs) the way a V.I.P. acquires an entourage pushing through a cocktail party.
 Unfortunately, the model does not say how heavy the Higgs boson itself -- the quantum personification of this field -- should be. And so physicists have to search for it the old-fashioned train-wreck way, by smashing subatomic particles together to create primordial fireballs and then seeing what materializes out.
 The Higgs, if formed, would decay into smaller jets of quarks or other particles, depending on its mass. The heavier it is, the more kinds of particles it can decay into. These would be recorded and counted by the detectors.
 Unfortunately, as Dr. Weinberg pointed out, ordinary collisions also produce showers of the same particles coming out, and so the game has changed.
 Once upon a time, physicists would look for what they called ''a gold-plated event.'' 
 ''You looked at a bubble chamber and saw tracks and decays,'' Dr. Weinberg recalled. ''You knew what you were seeing: 'Aha! This is the omega minus,' '' referring to a famous particle whose discovery clinched the case for quarks in 1964.
 Now, he explained, high-energy physics is all statistical. Out of 100,000 events, are a few more at various energies statistically significant? The job, he said, is to build up statistics to the point where a definite statement can be made.
 That job is further complicated by quantum randomness, the dice-rolling quality of subatomic interactions, which ensures that there will be bumps and fluctuations in the data even in the absence of any unusual physics. ''A bump is going to happen somewhere,'' said Dr. Dorigo, who added that determining the significance of these bumps was the hardest part of the process to explain to the general public. To physicists, the gold standard for a discovery is what they call a ''5-sigma'' bump, where sigma is a measure of bumpiness known as a standard deviation. A bump that high means that the odds are less than 1 in 3.5 million that it was produced by chance.
 The rumored signal from D Zero is said to be in that range, but to some physicists, that only increases its suspiciousness. Since the statistics get better with more measurements, Terry Wyatt, the other co-leader of the D Zero team, said that at a machine like the Tevatron, which is running at constant energy, physicists do not expect to go overnight from seeing nothing to a clear discovery.
 ''It will slowly creep up on us as we get more data,'' Dr. Wyatt said.
 Dr. Konigsberg said the same thing, calling the discovery process ''a bit of a nerve-racking game.''
 ''You can get lucky or not get lucky on an experiment,'' Dr. Konigsberg said.
 The first and most famous bump in the Higgs race happened at CERN's Large Electron-Positron Collider, or L.E.P., just before it was shut down in 2000 to make way for the new collider. It suggested that the Higgs might be waiting to be discovered just above 114 billion electron volts, in the energy-mass units physicists prefer to use. 
 If so, the Tevatron has a good shot at finding it, scientists said.
 ''We certainly have the reach,'' said Dr. Konigsberg. ''For us lighter is better, because we wouldn't see it if it was heavier.''
 Moreover, he said, the CERN collider will likely have a slow start. 
 Dr. Wyatt said: ''It gives us a little window of opportunity. The scientific community has its eyes on the Tevatron.''
 The Tevatron, which began running in its current configuration in 2001, is just entering its prime. It is now slated to run until at least 2009, by which time, if all goes well, the two big experiments will have collected just barely enough data between them to find the Higgs if it lies in the right range of masses.
 Robin Erbacher of the University of California, Davis, said, ''We're absolutely in the game.'' It would be a shame, she added, if a Higgs signal overlooked at Fermilab is discovered and trumpeted at the CERN collider. 
 ''Looking right at it and not reporting it -- that would be very embarrassing,'' Dr. Erbacher said.
 Rather than undercutting the rationale for CERN's collider, finding the Higgs at Fermilab would only whet the world's appetite for the bigger machine, physicists on both sides of the Atlantic said. The best Fermilab can hope for is a glimpse of the Higgs, and probably a hint of new mysteries and discoveries to be made.
 ''It will be the tip of the iceberg if we can say anything at all,'' said Robert Roser of Fermilab, the other co-leader of the C.D.F. team.
 On the other hand, as Judy Jackson, Fermilab's director of public affairs, put it, people remember Columbus, who discovered the New World, more than they do Lewis and Clark, who explored it.
 And so the race is on. It's a funny kind of race because many of the 1,200 or so physicists from dozens of countries who are now working on the two big experiments at Fermilab are also on the teams building the detectors for the CERN collider.
 The race is further complicated on the American side by the rivalry between the C.D.F. and D Zero groups. Earlier this summer, Fermilab had to schedule a pair of back-to-back seminars so each group could announce its own discovery of a new particle, a combination of quarks called the cascade-b. But all the data from both groups will be needed if Fermilab is to win the Higgs race, the scientists said.
 When John Conway, a professor at the University of California, Davis, found a suspicious bump in the data he was analyzing last winter, ''the hair literally rose up on the back of my neck,'' as he later wrote on the blog Cosmic Variance. Dr. Conway, a member of Fermilab's C.D.F. team, had been searching for the Higgs particle for 20 years.
 Was this it?
 He and his colleagues, Amit Lath and Anton Anastassov, from Rutgers University, had found an excess in the number of pairs of taus, which are very heavy relatives of the electron, coming out of the proton collisions. If these were coming from a decaying Higgs particle, it meant that the Higgs mass was about 150 billion electron volts.
 But the bump in the data was not big enough to inspire complete confidence. It was only about 2-sigma -- far below the 5-sigma gold standard -- meaning there was a greater than 2 percent chance that it was caused by random events.
 ''Two-sigma shouldn't get anyone excited,'' said Dr. Conway. He showed the C.D.F. data at a conference in Aspen, Colo., in January, concluding that the bump was probably just a statistical fluctuation and that more data were needed. In fact, he soon learned that the rival D Zero group had a deficit in the same channel where he had a bump, strengthening the idea that his result was a statistical fluke.
 ''So there you go,'' he said. But once his bump was out there, other people talked it up, he said. The result was a flurry of invitations and publicity, including articles in publications like New Scientist and The Economist.
 ''Things got out of hand quickly,'' said Dr. Conway, who expects to have a new analysis with almost twice as much data by the end of the summer. His experience, he said, underscores how excited people are about the Higgs hunt and how important it is for physicists to get their message out clearly if they want to maintain their credibility.
 ''Our only product is our physics result,'' he said. ''Careers are made and broken on how things come out.''
 This was only a warm-up.
 On May 28, an anonymous physicist wrote to the comments section of Dr. Dorigo's blog, asking if it was true that D Zero was seeing an excess of so-called b-quarks spitting from the Tevatron. This excess, or bump, was supposedly at the level of 4-sigma or 5-sigma and thus, if it withstood scrutiny, it would have to be taken seriously as a sign that the Higgs boson was there with a mass of about 180 billion electron volts.
 Dr. Dorigo is in the C.D.F. collaboration and thus had no inside knowledge, but repeated that he had also heard the rumor. The rumor was picked up by the publications Slate and Wired.
 In response, Gordon Watts, a physicist from the University of Washington and longtime member of the D Zero team, scolded Dr. Dorigo for speculating on rumors.
 ''Dude! If you get called by the press to comment on this rumor -- you will be making secondhand comments on rumors!'' Dr. Watts wrote on his blog, Life as a Physicist. 
 Dr. Watts pointed out that until a result had passed several levels of rigorous reviews within the team, including redoing analyses with different computer programs, there was no result, and nothing to say in public. ''I don't think D Zero has ever had an analysis that was given this much external scrutiny before its official release,'' Dr. Watts wrote in an e-mail message, adding that the blogs had already quieted down.
 Dr. Konigsberg, of the rival team, said they had their own analysis of their own b-quark measurements underway. He compared the rumor to a game of telephone that ''starts one way, ends up the other.'' 
 Dr. Dorigo said, ''Right now there is nothing to build a story around.'' Things could heat up again at conferences this summer in Karlsruhe, Germany, and Daegu, South Korea, where particle physics results are traditionally presented -- or never.
 The official silence did not stop speculation. If it is a Higgs, theorists say, it is probably not the one prescribed by the Standard Model, which would not be produced plentifully enough to be seen yet.
 The leading alternative is that it would be one of five Higgs bosons predicted by a theory called supersymmetry, which theorists have been yearning for as the next step toward a more all-embracing, unified theory of nature. One bonus of supersymmetry is that it predicts the existence of more, yet undiscovered elementary particles, one of which might be the mysterious dark matter that binds galaxies together in the universe. All this would fall into the lap of the Large Hadron Collider scientists, if it exists, which is one reason the CERN physicists will be happy no matter what the outcome.
 But if that is the case, the Tevatron should have already seen it, physicists said.
 ''If it's real, it's quite a weird object,'' said Dr. Lykken, who had been discussing possible theoretical models with his Higgs-savvy colleagues just in case the anomaly does not go away. It would be hard to reconcile this result with all the data already collected by Fermilab and the L.E.P. at the European laboratory, he explained. 
 ''I don't know if we pinned down nature, or if nature has pinned us down, but there are many corners you can't get into anymore,'' Dr. Lykken said.
 Dr. Weinberg, who acknowledged his rooting interest in the Higgs discovery, as the particle is at the center of Nobel Prize work, said he had heard the sighting rumor but did not know what to make of it. ''I'm more patient now,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 27, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about the search for a particle known as the Higgs boson misstated part of the name of a particle detector at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. It is the Collider Detector at Fermilab, not the Collider Detector Facility. Also, a picture caption incorrectly described the piece of equipment shown. It is the Compact Muon Solenoid, a particle detector built on the Large Hadron Collider, not the magnet core of the collider.

HEADLINE: A Juke Joint (and Social Glue) in Peril

BYLINE: By WILBORN HAMPTON

 BODY:
If the summer bar scene in Manhattan seems too much of the same old, same old, an antidote might be a night out at the Frog Pad, reputedly the oldest juke joint in Georgia, transported to New York as the setting for ''The People vs. Mona,'' a diverting musical confection by Jim Wann and Patricia Miller at the Abingdon Theater. 
 The Frog Pad is more than a honky-tonk. It is the economic, cultural and political center of Tippo, Ga., and doubles as the courthouse, where the trial of the title takes place after Mona, the owner of the Frog Pad, is accused of bludgeoning her husband of 10 hours, C. C. Katt, to death with an electric guitar.
 Mr. Wann was the main composer of ''Pump Boys and Dinettes,'' a theatrical phenomenon of 1982 that moved from downtown basements to Off Broadway and on to Broadway in one season. ''Pump Boys'' poked genial fun at good ol' boys and gals through a country-pop score that won the hearts of audiences around the world. It also provided a springboard for the cast, including Debra Monk, Mark Hardwick, Cass Morgan and John Foley. 
 If ''The People vs. Mona'' is not quite the caliber of ''Pump Boys,'' it captures the same spirit of good- natured down-home fun. The story becomes rather convoluted, involving a plot in which the victim and the district attorney had been conniving to close the Frog Pad and open casino gambling in Tippo. To add romance to the mystery, Mona's lawyer, engaged to the prosecutor at the start, begins to fall for his client. 
 But the dialogue cues the music, and it is Mr. Wann's songs that provide the real pleasure. There is something for everybody on the Frog Pad jukebox, played live by a trio called the McGnats. Although country is Mr. Wann's forte, he also ventures into old-fashioned rock, blues and gospel. There are even a torch song and a couple of novelty ditties among the dozen and a half numbers. 
 Any weaknesses in the show are masked by an energetic cast, some playing multiple parts, whose exuberance is infectious. Mariand Torres is a fiery and gutsy performer as Mona, especially in ''Lockdown Blues'' in which she laments ''falling in love with your lawyer/And he's never won a case.'' As her defender, Richard Binder is the epitome of a Southern gentleman. 
 Marcie Henderson delivers knockouts in two songs, each as a different character, ranging from a sultry Eartha Kitt delivery in ''The Big Meow'' to a sort of Ray Charles imitation in ''Blind Willy.'' Omri Schein is hilarious in a variety of roles, whether dancing or singing, and Natalie Douglas sounds like Big Maybelle belting gospel in a duet with Karen Culp called ''You Done Forgot Your Bible.'' 
 ''The People vs. Mona'' continues through Aug. 4 at the Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, Manhattan; (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com.

HEADLINE: Gulf Coast Casinos

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Casinos Booming in Katrina's Wake as Cash Pours In'' (front page, July 16) missed the real story. The headline should have read ''Casinos' Revival in Katrina's Wake Drives Economic Recovery of Gulf.'' 
 The economic recovery of the Gulf Coast is further along because our industry is delivering on its promise to come back bigger and better. Our companies have spent close to $1.4 billion to rebuild. And because we are building back better, we anticipate attracting visitors from around the world.
 Even more important is the impact of our recovery on our employees, who lost more than their place of employment in the storm. Thanks to our success, nearly 20,000 men and women in Louisiana and on the Mississippi Gulf Coast once again have jobs and hope, making a combined annual salary of nearly $500 million. 
 The rebuilding has also created tens of thousands of construction jobs, which, when combined with the number of gaming employees and the jobs created to support our employees and facilities, makes the impact on the region obvious and important.
 The industry's tax revenues and community donations have also meant more help for the entire area, including schools, hospitals, shelters and many other public works.

HEADLINE: Welcome to Susanville, Home to Prisons

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
The ''before'' debates tend to get plenty of news coverage: some town in New England or the Midwest or wherever is torn apart over whether to allow a dump or power plant or mega-whatever to come in. Rarely, though, does the ''after'' get much attention. Once the project in question went forward, did the promised economic benefits accrue? Was the social fabric shredded? 
 ''Prison Town, USA,'' a smartly constructed documentary tonight on the PBS series ''P.O.V.,'' explores the ''after'' in Susanville, a small city in Northern California that a decade ago underwent a substantial makeover with the construction of three huge prisons. The hopes were that the complex would take the place of lumber and other major businesses that were fading. The fears were -- well, myriad.
 The film, made by Katie Galloway and Po Kutchins over two years, looks at the big-picture issues Susanville now confronts through a collage of small stories. There are no documentary-style talking heads or charts here, just some very ordinary-looking people trying to find their places in a changed community.
 A man who has lost a good lumber job tries to make it through correctional-officer training. A recently discharged prisoner struggles to find work and support his wife and children. The owner of a local dairy tries to fight a state decision to cancel his prison contract, which he contends would violate a pledge that the prisons would buy locally whenever possible. 
 The film is light on specifics, beyond the intriguing factoids interspersed in stark white-on-black lettering between scenes. (''Nearly half the adults in Susanville, California, work at one of the area's three prisons.'') But the impact of the prisons is more subtle than numbers can capture. It's in how neighborhood dynamics change when the population includes many women and children who have moved to Susanville while Dad does time. (Can the children of prison guards play with the children of inmates?) It's in how domestic life is affected by the militarylike training a corrections officer goes through. 
 ''Be fair, firm, consistent,'' one instructor tells recruits. ''If you're a jerk, be a jerk all the time.'' And one woman comments: ''I think it's hard for you to turn off being in a position of authority all the time. You're coming home and doing the same thing to your families. There's a lot of domestic violence.''
 Those ''before'' debates seldom get to such personal places.

HEADLINE: Blair Takes On New Role as Mideast Envoy, Amid Constraints

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 23 

 BODY:
Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, on Monday plunged into his new role as special envoy of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers, raising many questions about what he can achieve.
 He met with Jordan's foreign minister, Abdelelah al-Khatib, in Amman. He then proceeded to Jerusalem to meet with Israeli leaders, including Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni and Defense Minister Ehud Barak.
 On Tuesday, he was to meet with the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, and Prime Minister Salam Fayyad in Ramallah, in the West Bank, and then return to Jerusalem for a working dinner with Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. 
 His mandate from the quartet -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- is limited to helping to build Palestinian Authority institutions and to promoting the development of the Palestinian economy, with the role of mediator generally reserved for the Americans.
 Nevertheless, the Israeli media quoted unnamed Israeli officials expressing concern that Mr. Blair might try to take on a more political role by mediating and exerting pressure on Israel.
 Mark Regev, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, dismissed the rumblings. ''Obviously we will work with whatever mandate the quartet gives him,'' he said.
 Mr. Regev added that the importance of institution building on the Palestinian side should not be underestimated. ''That has often been the Achilles' heel of the process,'' he said, noting that Mr. Abbas's ''failure to implement his election promise of imposing 'one authority, one law and one gun' in the Palestinian Authority has been a source of many of the problems.''
 After meeting with Mr. Blair, Ms. Livni ''emphasized that building strong, healthy foundations of the future Palestine is essential for the peace process,'' Mr. Regev said.
 But Palestinian expectations regarding the chances of a breakthrough appeared low. ''What I do with the Israelis, what the Israelis do with me, is the main ingredient,'' Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, told The Associated Press. ''The decisions required for peace are not going to come from the envoys.''
 Ghassan Khatib, a Palestinian political analyst, said in a telephone interview that, ''Appointing an envoy means nothing.'' What counts, he said, is the American administration's willingness to get seriously involved in peace efforts. Mr. Khatib said he saw ''no sign'' of that happening right now.
 Though Mr. Blair's first visit was considered to be mainly an exploratory one -- a spokesman for Mr. Blair said the envoy was ''coming very much in listening mode'' -- the agenda was structured to allow for an exchange of ideas or messages between the Israeli and Palestinian sides.
 But Mr. Olmert has said he is not ready to discuss the sensitive core issues of the conflict, like borders, the future of Jerusalem or the fate of the millions of Palestinian refugees and their descendants who fled after the 1948 war.
 And the Palestinians are deeply split, with the politically moderate Mr. Abbas and Mr. Fayyad governing from the West Bank, with Western backing, and the militant Islamic group Hamas in control of the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza after a violent takeover last month.
 Gunmen stormed the offices of a senior Fatah lawmaker in Gaza on Monday, wounding several office workers, Reuters reported. Fatah said the raid had been carried out by members of Hamas's Executive Force. A Hamas spokesman denied the gunmen were Executive Force members.
 Hamas, which defeated Mr. Abbas's Fatah party in elections in early 2006, is still classified as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. Mr. Blair's spokesman said he would not be meeting with Hamas officials.
 Mahmoud Zahar, an influential Hamas leader in Gaza, warned that any attempt to sideline or ignore Hamas would ''cost Blair his credibility'' and ensure the failure of his mission.
 Mr. Blair's predecessor, the former president of the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, lasted 11 months on the job before leaving in April 2006, blaming both sides for frustrating his efforts.
 Mr. Wolfensohn had invested much good will, enthusiasm and even some of his personal wealth in trying to help Gaza's economy after the Israeli withdrawal from the strip in the summer of 2005. But his plans were thwarted when, among other things, American-brokered agreements to ease the traffic of goods through Gaza's border crossings were not carried out.
 Since the Hamas takeover of Gaza, the border crossings have been almost completely sealed, other than for the import of essential goods. Gaza's tiny industrial base is on the verge of collapse, international aid officials and Gaza businessmen say.
 In an interview published in the Israeli daily Haaretz on Friday, Mr. Wolfensohn complained that he had never had enough authority. ''The quartet had the authority, and within the quartet it was the Americans who had the authority,'' he said.
 Mr. Wolfensohn added that in the eyes of certain State Department officials, he doubts he was ''ever anything but a nuisance.''

CORRECTION-DATE: July 28, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Tuesday about Tony Blair's first day as the special envoy of the so-called quartet of Middle East peacemakers referred imprecisely to the population of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, whose fates are a core issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict. Although Palestinians and their descendants who are registered as refugees by the United Nations now number about 4.5 million, only about 700,000 Palestinians -- not ''millions'' -- fled or were forced to flee during the era when the state of Israel was created. Also because of an editing error, the article referred incorrectly to the time frame during which the first Palestinians left their homes. Most left before and during the 1948 war, not afterward.

HEADLINE: Asia Share Prices Fall on Worries Over U.S.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: SINGAPORE, Wednesday, July 25 

 BODY:
Asian shares fell on Wednesday with exporters like Canon hit by the rallying yen and mounting concerns about the health of the American economy, while falling oil prices weighed on energy stocks. 
 The Nikkei of Japan fell 1.1 percent to a six-week low, tracking heavy losses on Wall Street, where poor results of DuPont and a top mortgage lender reignited fears about the broader fall-out from the weak housing sector.
 The Seoul, South Korea, market also fell, with the heavyweight Samsung Electronics down 2.1 percent. But optimism about the South Korean economy after it grew faster than expected in the second quarter helped temper the losses, with the benchmark Kospi index down 0.4 percent.
 MSCI's index of Asia Pacific stocks excluding Japan dipped 0.7 percent after three consecutive record highs, as Wall Street's worst one-day drop since mid-March cast a pall over the region's markets.
 Hong Kong stocks fell 0.7 percent, the Australian benchmark lost 1.2 percent, Taiwan stocks shed 0.5 percent and Singapore fell 0.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Funds Pressure Oil Companies On Iran Links

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
As American and European governments debate how to deal with Iran's nuclear program, some of the nation's largest public pension funds are leaning on European and Asian oil companies to reconsider their investments in Iran. 
 In letters citing the risk that international sanctions might jeopardize their investments, a coalition of funds from New York, California, North Carolina and Illinois has cautioned eight foreign energy companies working in Iran about investing there. 
 These pensions, which include New York City's five main funds and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, hold $3.7 billion worth of shares in energy companies involved in Iran, out of a total $570 billion in assets. 
 The two-page letters were sent to the chief executives of Royal Dutch Shell, Total of France, Repsol of Spain, Eni of Italy and Gazprom of Russia. In Asia, they were sent to the China National Petroleum Corporation, the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation of India and Inpex Corporation of Japan. 
 A growing number of municipalities and legislatures are seeking ways to bar state investments in place like Iran and Sudan. Recently, Florida passed the nation's first such measure and others, like California and Texas, are considering similar ones. 
 Pension funds usually oppose these efforts, which they see as curtailing their ability to invest. They also point out that long-term investors very rarely divest themselves of any of their holdings. But the funds in the coalition are taking their concerns to the companies directly, seeking to reduce their risks.
 ''It is increasingly likely that the worsening situation and tightening economic sanctions will negatively impact companies doing business there,'' the letters said, which referred to Iran as a ''state sponsor of terrorism.'' 
 The companies were asked to respond about their plans by Aug. 31.
 The public strategy recalls a similar campaign a few years ago when shareholders pressured American companies like Halliburton, ConocoPhillips and General Electric to shut down the offices of foreign-owned subsidiaries in Iran. 
 For European companies that have shares traded in American markets, the move by these institutional shareholders is another headache for their Persian Gulf strategy. 
 The Bush administration has warned foreign energy companies and some foreign governments lately that they might incur penalties if they pursued deals in Iran. Given the recent tensions, several European companies have frozen plans to invest billions of dollars in several projects. 
 Iran is the world's second-largest holder of oil and natural gas reserves. American companies are barred from doing business there.
 Kenneth B. Sylvester, assistant comptroller for pension policy at the New York City comptroller's office, denied that the move by the pension funds was a response to pressure from state assemblies. 
 ''We are trying to get the companies to focus on the risks to them and to their investors,'' Mr. Sylvester said.

HEADLINE: I.B.M. Plan Ties Training And Accounts

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In today's economy, corporations freely roam the globe for the most efficient, lowest-cost sources of supplies and labor, while American workers are told that the way to compete is constantly to improve their skills with training and education.
 Paying for it is usually up to beleaguered employees, which only adds to their sense of economic insecurity.
 I.B.M., often a trendsetter in business practices, is taking a step to address the workers' economic problem -- a step it hopes other companies will follow and help encourage a change in tax policy. 
 I.B.M., at a conference in Washington today, is announcing that it will begin offering its employees in the United States specialized savings accounts for training and education. The ''learning accounts'' will be modeled on 401(k) retirement accounts, which began in the late 1970s. Workers will put up to $1,000 a year into the accounts, and I.B.M. will contribute 50 cents for every dollar put in by the employee. 
 Under the I.B.M. plan, the employee decides how and when to spend the money, held in an interest-bearing account. When an employee leaves I.B.M., the individual takes the account.
 Companies have long paid for employee education and training. Indeed, I.B.M. spends more than $600 million a year on worker education programs. Yet such spending is typically to upgrade a person's skills for their next job with the company.
 ''This is truly path breaking,'' said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at the Harvard business school. ''The significance is that it's controlled by the individual. I'm not aware of any other major corporation doing that, as opposed to programs that are part of some career scheme that the company has in mind.''
 The I.B.M. move, Professor Kanter said, is part of a broader evolution in corporate-worker relations. ''This is reinventing how a company develops the social contract with its workers in a highly mobile, global economy,'' she said.
 A key message in that new social contract, I.B.M. executives said, is that whether a person stays with the company for a long career or just for a few years, I.B.M. is a place where people can enhance their skills and be more competitive in a labor market buffeted by globalization and rapid technological change.
 Investing to create that kind of corporate climate, they say, should eventually give the company an edge in attracting and retaining talented workers.
 In an interview, Samuel J. Palmisano, the chief executive, emphasized that the program was inspired in part by corporate self-interest, noting, ''I.B.M. will be more competitive.''
 Mr. Palmisano pushed for the learning accounts and the 401(k)-style arrangement, which he said recognized the ''dual set of responsibilities in today's world'' of both the individual and the corporation. ''It puts the right balance of motivation into the system,'' he said. ''Everyone has some skin in the game.''
 Besides encouraging other corporations, I.B.M. plans to talk with universities, urging them to consider tuition discounts for workers seeking new skills.
 A tax change is needed, according to I.B.M. and some economists, to help workers to invest in their own education in new fields. Currently, workers can deduct the cost of education and training in their own occupation, as defined by government job classifications, but not in new careers.
 For example, if a software engineer wanted to learn a new programming language, the training costs would be tax deductible. But if that person wanted to train to be a business consultant, that would generally not be tax deductible, even though the new job required related technology and skills. If the programmer wanted to become an emergency room nurse, the education expense would not be tax deductible because it is a different line of work.
 Mr. Palmisano would also prefer the law to be changed to allow the new accounts to use pretax dollars, as a 401(k) does.
 I.B.M. is by no means alone in pushing for tax change. A policy paper last month by three academics -- Grant Aldonas of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Robert Z. Lawrence of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, and Matthew J. Slaughter of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth -- recommended, among other measures, that Congress approve full deductibility for training expenses by individuals, ''even when directed at preparation for an entirely new career.''
 The report, ''Succeeding in the Global Economy: A New Policy Agenda for the American Worker,'' was sponsored by the Financial Services Forum, an organization of chief executives of the largest commercial banks, investment banks and insurers.
 The I.B.M. move, said Mr. Slaughter, an economist and a former member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the George W. Bush administration, is ''precisely the kind of policy we'd like to see throughout the economy.'' 
 Many policy groups have recommendations to increase the opportunities for workers to upgrade their skills continually.
 Last month, for example, the Third Way, a research organization aligned with centrist Democrats, called for the federal student loan program to be extended to adults seeking new skills to climb the occupational ladder.
 The I.B.M. learning accounts fit into the larger policy debate about how to cope with an economy of increasing dynamism but one that creates a lot of churn in the labor market. Four million jobs a month, or 25,000 an hour in a business day, are eliminated in the American economy. But more than that are created.
 I.B.M., a classic global enterprise, deals with plenty of job churn itself as its worldwide employment has increased in recent years, American employment has declined slightly, with steady hiring and layoffs. In the second quarter of this year, 3,500 I.B.M. workers worldwide were told their jobs were being eliminated. A third of the displaced employees typically find jobs elsewhere in the company. 
 Steps like the I.B.M. learning accounts could well help some people make transitions to new jobs, but they will do little for many workers, said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal research group.
 ''This is a pretty forward-thinking move, but it's wrong to think that you can always train your way out of the box that globalization puts many of these workers in,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''That larger problem is where the federal government ought to be.'' 
 I.B.M.'s learning accounts will initially be available in 2008 to workers who have been with the company for at least five years in the United States, where the company employed 127,000 people at the end of last year.
 The company has earmarked $40 million over the three years for contributions to the learning accounts, which is in addition to its $600 million training budget. And $20 million will be spent on two other new programs -- one to send employees to developing nations to work on environmental and educational projects, and the other to train people who want second careers in nonprofit organizations, government and schools.

HEADLINE: $58 Billion Shortfall for New Jersey Retiree Care

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
In 1994, New Jersey decided to stop setting aside money in a fund to pay for health care for its retired public workers. The savings paved the way for a big tax cut. 
 Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of public workers were being told that as long as they worked 25 years, the system would provide virtually free health care for them when they retired, often when they were as young as 55.
 No one added up the cost -- until now. 
 It turns out that New Jersey will need about $58 billion, in today's dollars, to provide all the care it has promised its current and future retirees. That's nearly twice the state budget and nearly twice the amount of its outstanding debt. And because of the step it took in 1994, the state has virtually no money in reserve to cover those costs. 
 In addition, New Jersey's towns and other local governments owe about $10 billion for health care for their own retirees.
 Many other states have been promising retiree health care without keeping track of the cost. They, too, are tallying what they owe, to comply with a new accounting rule that applies to all state and local governments. The numbers tend to be big, but so far, New Jersey's obligation, which the state planned to announce tomorrow, appears to be the biggest.
 ''This is a very pressing situation that can't go on much longer without being repaired,'' said Clifford A. Goldman, New Jersey's treasurer from 1976 to 1982. 
 Some governments are responding to the problem by setting aside money in trust funds for retiree health care. Though this requires cash upfront, the investment gains over the years can greatly reduce the cost, said Don Rueckert Jr., a senior vice president at Aon, a national insurance and consulting company. ''For every dollar you put aside, you get four or five back in terms of long-term cost reductions.'' 
 New York City and Duluth, Minn., have created such trust funds. Some other places, like Texas, do not even want to disclose the long-term cost, fearing it will lead to pressure to cut retirees' benefits, and say they will pay as they go. 
 New Jersey officials say the state simply cannot afford to create a reserve at this time, given its debt. Instead, they plan to pay each year's retiree benefits out of revenues and work to control future costs.
 The portion of the $58 billion that they need to come up with each year will rise sharply because of soaring health costs and a burgeoning population of retirees, according to the New Jersey Treasury. The state will spend about $1.1 billion on this year's care, and the figure is expected to double in five years.
 Meanwhile, the state's revenues are largely static. That means that unless something changes, New Jersey will have less money each year to pay for vital services like colleges, hospitals and mass transit. Its popular program to preserve green space just fell victim to the need to devote huge amounts to the retirement plans and debt servicing.
 Word of the amount owed for retiree health care over the long term comes on the heels of revelations that the state's pension fund is woefully short and needs contributions of about $2.2 billion a year to bring it back into balance. 
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine's administration has been making bigger pension contributions than the previous four administrations put together, and the fund has enjoyed strong market returns over the last year, but the payments are still only about half of what is needed. 
 To create a retiree health fund from scratch, Mr. Goldman estimated, New Jersey would need to start by setting aside $6 billion a year to make up for all the years of no contributions. 
 That is on top of the pension fund's pressing needs for new contributions.
 Finding a way to keep these fixed commitments from swamping the state budget ''truly keeps me awake at night,'' Governor Corzine said last month. 
 The Corzine administration has plans to rein in the state's retiree health costs by making more retirees pay for part of their health premiums and by switching retirees into a network of doctors at negotiated fees. Currently, most state retirees can see any doctor. As of 2003, fewer than half the states allowed retirees to do so.
 The switch to a network is set for 2008. But the plan to make more state retirees pay part of their premiums had a setback in June. The government agreed to drop it for retirees who signed up for wellness programs, which are supposed to save money by reducing the incidence of preventable diseases. 
 Meanwhile, retired teachers have dodged the bullet entirely. Their union, the New Jersey Education Association, negotiates contracts with school districts and not with the state, and the state has not asked them to chip in for their premiums. 
 The Corzine administration's third tool, the sale or lease of the New Jersey Turnpike to raise money, has also been postponed. 
 The governor's advisers had hoped to use the turnpike proceeds to pay down debt or fund the state's retirement plans. But in June, Mr. Corzine acknowledged that the effort had become a political lightning rod, with his opponents whipping up fear around predictions that that the turnpike would fall into foreign hands. 
 He said foreign ownership was not in the cards, nor is a sale to a profit-making company. For now, he says he wants more planning and public debate, putting off any way to use the turnpike as a financial resource until after the state legislative elections in November. 
 ''I'm going to fight for it,'' the governor said. ''The status quo is unacceptable.'' 
 State retirees who have watched cutbacks in the private sector wonder if they are next. In the '90s, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, forced companies to begin disclosing their retiree health costs, and many companies responded by cutting benefits.
 In October, New Jersey's Office of Legislative Services, a nonpartisan research body, issued a legal opinion that retirees may not be stripped of their health benefits, but that ''reasonable modifications'' are possible. No one knows what those modifications may be. 
 ''I'm scared; I really am,'' said Pat Provnick, 62, a retired teacher in Hammonton. 
 Ms. Provnick taught grade school for 33 years and retired in 2000. Although she does not have to make contributions to the retired teachers' health plan -- the state covers 100 percent of the premiums -- she does have to make a $5 co-payment every time she sees a doctor, up to a yearly maximum. 
 For now, she can still see any doctor she wants. 
 ''I'm very lucky,'' she said. But there are clouds on the horizon. When Ms. Provnick retired, her maximum out-of-pocket expense each year was $380. Then, in the last two years, it shot to $1,090 -- just when she was undergoing knee surgery and making frequent visits to doctors and physical therapists. 
 Ms. Provnick still requires extensive care. She must also make co-payments for each prescription, and pay for the dental and vision coverage that she had at no cost when working. Recent work on a tooth cost her $500, she said.
 ''I'm a homeowner, sure I am. I pay property taxes, too,'' she said. ''I understand the problem. But you can't wait till I'm 62 to tell me that the benefits that you've promised me are too expensive because somebody made a mistake in 1994. Where does that leave me? I can't go back and earn more money now.''
 When New Jersey stopped funding its retiree health plan 13 years ago, it also stopped trying to keep track of the cost. That created the illusion that the long-term obligation was zero, not billions of dollars, and made it easy for the state to enhance its already rich benefits. 
 Public workers have generally been able to retire at 55, with free health care after 25 years. That is expensive because the state must often provide coverage for as long as 10 years before retirees -- and sometimes their spouses -- can join the federal Medicare program. Then, the state has to pay only for supplementary benefits.
 Since 1994, New Jersey has offered its workers five buyouts, pushing more of them into retirement and raising its costs for those people and their replacements. A State Treasury analysis for legislators showed the buyouts would not increase health care costs. 
 Recently, the Corzine administration raised the normal retirement age for state workers to 62. That will help lower costs, albeit very slowly because it applies only to new hires. 
 Another problem is that for years, New Jersey has allowed towns, school boards and other local governments to set pay and benefits. School districts, which contribute to health care only for active workers, can help their own budgets by negotiating small pay increases and reassuring their employees that the state will retain ample retirement packages. The state then has to come up with the money.
 From 1987 through 1994, New Jersey was one of only a handful of governments that went to the trouble of setting aside money for retiree health care. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman stopped the practice the year she took office, along with cutting back on pension contributions.
 The official explanation was that inflation in health costs had subsided and that setting aside money could create a bigger reserve than was needed. Also, her administration noted, the Clinton White House was working on a national health plan.
 Not long afterward, though, health inflation went to double digits, and the Clinton initiative collapsed. But by then, New Jersey's lawmakers had grown accustomed to using retiree-health dollars to balance the budget, which was required under the State Constitution. 
 The Corzine administration said that if financial flexibility improved, it should consider, with the Legislature, bringing back a retiree health fund, while weighing other budget priorities.
 The imbalance between what is owed and what states can afford has grown so big that some officials in New Jersey, as in many other states, say they now view a national health care plan as the only realistic long-term solution.

HEADLINE: Albert Ellis, Provoker of Change In Psychotherapy, Is Dead at 93

BYLINE: By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Albert Ellis, whose innovative straight-talk approach to psychotherapy made him one of the most influential and provocative figures in modern psychology, died yesterday at his home above the institute he founded in Manhattan. He was 93. 
 The cause, after extended illness, was kidney and heart failure, said a friend and spokeswoman, Gayle Rosellini.
 Dr. Ellis (he had a doctorate but not a medical degree) called his approach rational emotive behavior therapy, or R.E.B.T. Developed in the 1950s, it challenged the deliberate, slow-moving methodology of Sigmund Freud, the prevailing psychotherapeutic treatment at the time.
 Where the Freudians maintained that a painstaking exploration of childhood experience was critical to understanding neurosis and curing it, Dr. Ellis believed in short-term therapy that called on patients to focus on what was happening in their lives at the moment and to take immediate action to change their behavior. ''Neurosis,'' he said, was ''just a high-class word for whining.'' 
 ''The trouble with most therapy is that it helps you to feel better,'' he said in a 2004 article in The New York Times. ''But you don't get better. You have to back it up with action, action, action.'' 
 If his ideas broke with conventions, so did his manner of imparting them. Irreverent, charismatic, he was called the Lenny Bruce of psychotherapy. In popular Friday evening seminars that ran for decades, he counseled, prodded, provoked and entertained groups of 100 or more students, psychologists and others looking for answers, often lacing his comments with obscenities for effect. 
 His basic message was that all people are born with a talent ''for crooked thinking,'' or distortions of perception that sabotage their innate desire for happiness. But he recognized that people also had the capacity to change themselves. The role of therapists, Dr. Ellis argued, is to intervene directly, using strategies and homework exercises to help patients first learn to accept themselves as they are (unconditional self-acceptance, he called it) and then to retrain themselves to avoid destructive emotions -- to ''establish new ways of being and behaving,'' as he put it. 
 His methods, along with those of Dr. Aaron T. Beck, a psychiatrist who was working independently, provided the basis for what is known as cognitive behavior therapy. A form of talk therapy, it has been shown to be at least as effective as drugs for many people in treating anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other conditions.
 His admirers credited Dr. Ellis with adapting the ''talking cure,'' the dominant therapy in extended Freudian sessions, to a pragmatic, stop-complaining-and-get-on-with-your-life form of guidance later popularized by television personalities like Dr. Phil. 
 Dr. Ellis had such an impact that in a 1982 survey, clinical psychologists ranked him ahead of Freud when asked to name the figure who had exerted the greatest influence on their field. (They placed him second behind Carl Rogers, the founder of humanistic psychology.) His reputation grew even more in the next two decades. 
 In 1955, however, when Dr. Ellis introduced his approach, most of the psychological and psychiatric establishment scorned it. His critics said he misunderstood the nature and force of emotions. Classical Freudians also took offense at Dr. Ellis's critical observations about psychoanalysis and its founder. Dr. Ellis contended that Freud ''really knew very little about sex'' and that his view of the Oedipus complex, as suggesting a universal law of human disturbance, was ''foolish.'' 
 A sexual liberationist, Dr. Ellis collaborated with Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey in his taboo-breaking research on sexual behavior, and his writings about sex drew complaints from members of the American Psychological Association. 
 As a base for his work he established the Institute for Rational Living, now the Albert Ellis Institute, in a townhouse on East 65th Street in Manhattan. He lived there on the top floor.
 The article in The Times described Dr. Ellis at 90, hard of hearing and recovering from abdominal surgery, coming downstairs one day in the spring of 2004 to lead one of his Friday sessions, just as he had for 30 years. 
 ''Do you know why your family is trying to control you?'' he asked a volunteer who had joined him in front of the audience. ''Because they are out of their minds!'' he said, inserting an unprintable adjective.
 Another participant recalled the murder of her sister years ago by a drug dealer. ''Why can't you understand that some people are crazy and violent and do all kinds of terrible things?'' Dr. Ellis declared. ''Until you accept it, you're going to be angry, angry, angry.'' 
 Some critics complained that his seminars were more stand-up comedy than serious lecture. Still, despite his iconoclasm, or perhaps because of it, rational emotive behavior therapy became one of the most popular systems of psychotherapy in the 1970s and '80s. In 1985, the American Psychological Association presented Dr. Ellis with its award for ''distinguished professional contributions.''
 Dr. Ellis was the author or co-author of more than 75 books, many of them best sellers. Among them were ''A Guide to Successful Marriage,'' ''Overcoming Procrastination,'' ''How to Live With a Neurotic,'' ''The Art of Erotic Seduction,'' ''Sex Without Guilt,'' ''A Guide to Rational Living,'' and ''How to Stubbornly Refuse to Make Yourself Miserable About Anything -- Yes, Anything.''
 He often went back to his own life experiences to help explain his positive frame of thinking. Albert Ellis was born on Sept. 27, 1913, in Pittsburgh, the oldest of three children. As a child, he wrote, he had a kidney disorder that turned him from sports to books. His parents moved to the Bronx and separated when he was 11. He once wrote that he had limited but amiable contacts with his father, a traveling salesman, and that his mother, an amateur actress, was not interested in domestic life.
 He maintained that the experience had left no scars. ''I took my father's absence and my mother's neglect in stride,'' he wrote, ''and even felt good about being allowed so much autonomy and independence.'' 
 He did well in school, skipped grades, won writing contests and, he said, was pleased with his accomplishments.
 But at 19 he was painfully shy and eager to change his behavior. In one exercise he staked out a bench in a park near his home, determined to talk to every woman who sat there alone. In one month, he said, he approached 130 women.
 ''Thirty walked away immediately,'' he said in the Times article. ''I talked with the other 100, for the first time in my life, no matter how anxious I was. Nobody vomited and ran away. Nobody called the cops.'' 
 Though he got only one date as a result, his shyness disappeared, he said. He similarly overcame a fear of speaking in public by making himself do just that, over and over. He became an accomplished public speaker.
 Dr. Ellis studied accounting at City College during the Depression and took up some entrepreneurial schemes after graduating. In one, he paired used men's jackets and pants of similar colors and sold them as suits. He wrote fiction but found no publishers. He had read a good deal about sex and set up a bureau in which he counseled couples. 
 His first marriage, to Karyl Corper, an actress, in 1938, ended in annulment. His second, in 1956, to Rhoda Winter, a dancer, ended in divorce. For 37 years, from 1966 to 2003, he lived with a companion, Janet L. Wolfe, a psychologist who had been executive director of the institute. More recently he married Debbie Joffe-Ellis, a psychologist and former assistant, who survives him.
 After receiving a doctorate in clinical psychology from Columbia in 1947, Dr. Ellis spent several years undergoing classical psychoanalysis while using its techniques in his job at a state mental hygiene clinic in New Jersey. He quit in 1950 to begin a private practice specializing in sex and marriage therapy and soon started drifting from Freudian orthodoxy, finding it, he said, a waste of time.
 He turned to Greek, Roman and modern philosophers and considered his own experience. Out of this came rational emotive behavioral therapy, which he decided would focus not on excavating childhood but on confronting the irrational thoughts that lead to self-destructive feelings and behavior. He founded his Manhattan institute in 1959.
 ''I was hated by practically all psychologists and psychiatrists,'' he recalled. They thought his approach was ''superficial and stupid,'' he said, and ''they resented that I said therapy doesn't have to take years.'' 
 In 2005, Dr. Ellis sued the institute after it removed him from its board and canceled his Friday seminars. He and his supporters claimed that the institute had fallen into the hands of psychologists who were moving it away from his revolutionary therapy techniques.
 The board said it had acted out of economic necessity, asserting that payouts to Dr. Ellis for medical and other expenses were jeopardizing the institute's tax-exempt status. Dr. Ellis was by then hard of hearing and required daily nursing care. Some board members said they were uncomfortable with his confrontational style and eccentricities and saw him as a liability.
 In January 2006, a State Supreme Court judge ruled that the board had been wrong in ousting Dr. Ellis without proper notice and reinstated him. But his friend Ms. Rosellini said Dr. Ellis's relations with the board had remained strained afterward. 
 Despite his failing health, Dr. Ellis maintained a demanding schedule late into his life. 
 ''I'll retire when I'm dead,'' he said at 90. ''While I'm alive, I want to keep doing what I want to do. See people. Give workshops. Write and preach the gospel according to St. Albert.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 2, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page obituary on July 25 about Albert Ellis, a psychologist who pioneered a straightforward approach to psychotherapy, misstated the period during which he lived with a companion, Janet L. Wolfe, a former executive director of the Albert Ellis Institute in Manhattan. It was 1965 to 2002, not 1966 to 2003. A picture caption with the continuation of the obituary referred incorrectly to the St. John's University students he was shown lecturing to in a nursing home last December. They were graduate students in school counseling, not psychology.

HEADLINE: In Chicago, a Haven For Green Enterprise

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
A landmark brick and concrete factory, used in the first half of the 20th century to manufacture men's underwear and in much of the second half to make fine lamps, is set to serve a 21st-century role. The building, in the city's Logan Square neighborhood, will be the Midwest's first shopping center for environmentally focused stores and services.
 The 250,000-square-foot loft building, now known as Green Exchange, presents itself as a center of product and service innovation for business tenants who view natural products and care of the environment as a marketing opportunity and a way of life. The notion is that different kinds of businesses that subscribe to common principles can benefit from being together in one place, sharing ideas and customers.
 The owner and builder, Baum Development, says it already has commitments for nearly 30 of the 100 Green Exchange spaces. The prospective tenants include an electric vehicle dealer, a green building supply company and a treeless paper packaging company. The rents are expected to be $18 to $35 a square foot annually, in line with market rates for the area. 
 About 20 percent of the business spaces at Green Exchange have been designed so that the tenants can build a bathroom and small kitchen, enabling them to live there. 
 The novel commercial real estate project is part of the expansion of environmentally oriented investments and policies that are reshaping Chicago's economy: office buildings with green roofs, a city-built incubator for green businesses, fleets of ultraclean buses and municipal electric vehicles.
 While other developments have trumpeted their green qualities in recent years, Green Exchange directly tests Chicago's market for products and services intended to produce a cleaner, more natural and healthier way of life. 
 Within the next two months and perhaps as early as August, according to Manuel Flores, the Democratic alderman of the First Ward who represents Logan Square, the Chicago Plan Commission is expected to issue final land use and zoning approvals. 
 Mayor Richard M. Daley vigorously supports the project. ''Green Exchange is a great example of the public-private partnerships that are working together to help make Chicago one of the most environmentally friendly cities in the nation,'' Mayor Daley said in a statement last December. 
 The builders of Green Exchange are David L. Baum, 41, and his brother, Douglas P. Baum, 39, who own and manage a realty and development company that specializes in converting Chicago's old buildings to new residential and commercial uses. 
 In September 2005, just after the four-story Frederick Cooper Lamp factory closed, putting 110 people out of work, Baum Development spent $7.5 million to buy the 93-year-old building, not knowing what they would eventually do with it. At the suggestion of Mr. Flores, who insisted that the building be used to develop new businesses and not condominiums, to replace some of the jobs that were lost, the Baums embraced the idea of a hybrid building -- part market, part business incubator and part professional office complex -- with an eco-friendly twist.
 ''In order to be a tenant in Green Exchange, you must be doing something to advance the green marketplace,'' said David Baum, who started in business with his brother in 1989, when they bought, renovated and sold for a tidy profit an old Chicago home that held two apartments.
 Mr. Baum said his company had invested $1 million on demolition and architectural designs for Green Exchange. Major construction is to begin as soon as the final land use and zoning permits are issued. The building could open by September 2008 at a total project cost of close to $40 million, he said.
 ''We liked the building as soon as we saw it,'' Douglas Baum said. ''It's got great bones. It's a solid structure with high ceilings and big windows. It's in the right place. It had all the markings of something we could work with.''
 Situated on West Diversey Avenue and alongside the Kennedy Expressway about five miles northwest of the downtown Loop business district, Green Exchange is among Chicago's noticeable mercantile landmarks. An ornamented four-sided water tower graces the building's roof.
 The Baums hired Hartshorne Plunkard Architecture to produce a design that makes use of the tower and the building's other architectural details, including a horseshoe footprint that allows natural light to penetrate from banks of big windows. The first and second floors are to provide space for retail outlets and showrooms. Offices and the live-work spaces will occupy the third and fourth floors.
 The building will have an open design to encourage an almost dormlike informality enabling tenants to learn from one another. 
 Among other features that the Baums say will make Green Exchange one of the most environmentally sensitive and energy-efficient buildings in Chicago is a 60,000-gallon cistern on the ground floor to store rainwater to irrigate plants and grasses on the green roof and to use in an energy-efficient heating and cooling system. 
 Green Exchange will have escalators that use 30 percent less energy than conventional models because they will slow down when nobody is using them. Nontoxic construction materials and coatings will be used to improve the quality of the indoor air. It also will have a 9,000-square-foot garden courtyard and parking spaces with outlets to recharge electric vehicles. It is on a busy Chicago Transit Authority bus route and close to a Blue Line subway stop. 
 Just one other market in the United States, the Jean Vollum Natural Capital Center in Portland, Ore., is similar to Green Exchange, environmental specialists say. That 70,000-square-foot center, owned by Ecotrust, a nonprofit environmental organization, is housed in a 112-year-old warehouse close to downtown. Its 19 tenants include an organic coffee shop and an organic pizza restaurant, an environmental bank, an investment firm that specializes in sustainable companies, and several nonprofit environmental groups and foundations. 
 Green Exchange is nearly four times that size and will have a broader mix of tenants, executives at Baum Development say. One tenant is Rick Sbragia, a veteran car dealership manager and now the owner of Electric Avenue Auto Mall in Oak Forest, Ill., which sells electric vehicles and hybrid cars. Mr. Sbragia is negotiating with the Baums for space on the first floor of Green Exchange to showcase three- and four-wheel electric vehicles made by Myers Motors of Ohio, vehicles made by the Zenn Motor Company of Toronto, and Chinese made ZAP electric vehicles. 
 Other Green Exchange tenants are I-GO Car Sharing; the Consolidated Printing Company, a commercial printer that uses all-vegetable ink and recycled paper; and Distant Village Packaging, which sells hand-produced packaging for the specialty gift industry made from wild grass, banana fiber and other ''tree free'' paper.
 Ori Sivan plans to move his company into Green Exchange because he wants a larger space. ''We can't wait,'' said Mr. Sivan, an environmental engineer and the co-founder with his partner, Joe Silver, of Greenmaker Building Supply, a two-year-old company that sells nontoxic construction materials in a 5,000-square-foot storefront on North Pulaski Road.
 ''Everything you can think of in green business is in one place: health, food, building supply, transportation, paper, paint, furniture, clothing, investment,'' Mr. Sivan said. ''It's going to be like a big family.''

HEADLINE: Challenging a Rosy Yesterday By Confronting a Thorny Today

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
In ''The Sugar Curtain,'' Camila Guzman Urzua (the daughter of the filmmaker Patricio Guzman) returns to Cuba to confront the possibility of a misremembered past. Armed with a hand-held camera and idyllic childhood memories, Ms. Guzman Urzua, a Chilean-born filmmaker who arrived in Cuba in 1973 at the age of 2 and left in 1990, strives to align her rosy recollections with the deprivation and decay of modern Havana. 
 ''We didn't feel like a Soviet satellite,'' she says, remembering a ''paradise'' free of unemployment, religion, advertising or materialism. Yet as she reconnects with the few friends who remain and listens to their part-wistful, part-bitter reminiscences of a time filled with handsome martyrs and endless possibilities, a portrait emerges that's less of a paradise lost than of a complex, unsustainable dream.
 Opening and closing with scenes of happy schoolchildren, ''The Sugar Curtain'' is a pensive valentine to literacy programs and childhood idealism left in the ashes of broken families and an economically bifurcated society. ''Only the slogans remain,'' mourns Ms. Guzman Urzua, whose deliberately raw technique -- a distracted camera that often captures its own image in mirrors and shadows -- underscores her reluctant tilt toward disillusion. ''I had idealized something that maybe never was,'' she concludes, though neither she nor her film seem completely convinced. 
 THE SUGAR CURTAIN
 Opens today in Manhattan. 
 Directed by Camila Guzman Urzua (in Spanish, with English subtitles); director of photography, Ms. Guzman Urzua; edited by Claudio Martinez and Ms. Guzman Urzua; music by Omar Sosa; produced by Ms. Guzman Urzua and Nathalie Trafford; released by First Run/Icarus Films. At the Two Boots Pioneer Theater, 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, East Village. Running time: 80 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Taxes in the Global Economy

 BODY:
As Americans grapple with the impact of trade and globalization, the government should be trying to ensure that America's multinational corporations -- and by extension, their shareholders -- pay a fair share in taxes on the profits from globalization. Unfortunately, policy makers have moved in the opposite direction, dishing out excessive corporate tax breaks that have done little for workers and have served mainly to concentrate wealth among the few. 
 The corrosive effects of that trend were detailed in The Times yesterday by Alex Berenson, who examined the fallout of the Orwellian-named American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. Pitched by tax-axing lawmakers as a way to generate cash for new hiring, it allowed American companies to bring foreign-held profits back to the United States in 2005 at a discount of up to 85 percent off the normal tax rate. Some 100 companies repatriated about $300 billion, avoiding about $90 billion in taxes.
 But instead of hiring more workers, many of the participating multinationals had mass layoffs, especially drug companies. Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, repatriated $36 billion at the discounted rate, while laying off 8,000 employees in 2006 and announcing layoffs of 10,000 more. Eli Lilly and Schering-Plough also repatriated billions while laying off thousands. Technology companies did the same. Hewlett-Packard, for example, repatriated $14.5 billion in 2005 and laid off 14,500 workers. In some instances, the corporate tax savings were more than enough to cover the severance costs and other expenses of the layoffs. 
 And in a final twist, the law has encouraged the use of offshore tax havens by American corporations, which are once again piling up their profits beyond the reach of the Internal Revenue Service in anticipation of the next tax holiday. 
 Among other things, $90 billion could provide a lot of health care and bolster unemployment compensation for American workers. Instead, that sum has gone mainly into the pockets of the already rich. Where is the politician who will take an over-my-dead-body approach to future tax holidays and who will broach the need for new corporate taxes?

HEADLINE: Dow Tumbles 226 Points on Weak Profits

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Wall Street pulled back sharply yesterday as investors dealt with disappointing earnings reports and rising concerns about the mortgage market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points.
 DuPont was the Dow's biggest loser after the company reported flat second-quarter profit, as improving sales abroad balanced continuing weakness in the United States housing and automotive markets.
 A fellow Dow component, American Express, said Monday its quarterly profit climbed 12 percent on record cardholder spending. The company said, however, that cardholders were shirking more payments. 
 DuPont fell $3.36, or 6.3 percent, to $49.90. American Express dropped $3.49, or 5.4 percent, to $61.17.
 A profit warning from the mortgage lender Countrywide Financial yesterday reminded investors that troubles persist in the subprime loan market. Its shares declined $3.56, or 10.5 percent, to $30.50.
 The Dow gave up 226.47 points, or 1.6 percent, closing at 13,716.95.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index shed 30.53 points, or 2 percent, to 1,511.04. The Nasdaq composite index lost 50.72 points, or 1.9 percent, closing at 2,639.86. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies dipped 23.76 points, or 2.8 percent, to 811.86.
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 10 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to a heavy 4.06 billion shares, compared with 3.09 billion shares on Monday.
 After the Dow's move last week over 14,000 for the first time, it ''seems logically like the market needs to have some profit-taking,'' said Joseph Ranieri, managing director of United States equity trading at Canaccord Adams. The stock market will very likely be driven again by company earnings reports over the next two weeks, he said.
 Yesterday's decline kept up a pattern of back-and-forth finishes. For six consecutive sessions, the market has risen one day and fallen the next.
 McDonald's posted a loss after taking a charge for the sale of its Latin American outlets. McDonald's, a Dow stock, fell 95 cents to $51.55.
 Another Dow component, AT&T, reported a 61 percent increase in second-quarter earnings, lifted primarily by its buyout of BellSouth. At the same time, the company reported fewer activations of Apple's iPhone than analysts had expected.
 AT&T shares fell 35 cents to $39.68, while Apple's stock dropped $8.81, or 6.1 percent, to $134.89. Apple is to report quarterly results today. 
 After the market close, Amazon.com said second-quarter profit more than tripled. The stock ended the regular session down $2.49, or 3.5 percent, at $69.25, then jumped in after-hours trading as much as $14.79 to $84.04.
 Oil prices receded further from last week's 11-month highs. Light, sweet crude gave up $1.33 to end at $73.56 on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gasoline futures fell.
 The 10-year Treasury note was up 10/32, to 96 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.91 percent from 4.95 percent.
 Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills and 20-year inflation-protected bonds.

HEADLINE: Law Firms From U.S. Invade Paris

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE

DATELINE: PARIS, July 23 

 BODY:
Jean-Pierre Martel says his most memorable experience with American lawyers came a few years ago when his firm, Rambaud Martel, joined an American law firm to represent a European company preparing to sell shares on the stock exchange.
 Every morning the phone rang, said Mr. Martel, 63, a founder of the French firm. A partner at the American firm would shout over the line, ''Run to court, Jean-Pierre! Run to court!'' Mr. Martel recounted. ''And I would say, 'No, that's not the way we do that.' ''
 Mr. Martel won the case anyway, using softer legal tactics more common to Paris than New York. ''In the office,'' he said with a laugh, ''we called him Mr. Run-to-Court.''
 The discordance is part of a quiet revolution among European law firms struggling to adapt to successive waves of British and American law firms as Europe opens its market for legal services. 
 Last year, Mr. Martel's firm split in two, with half the lawyers joining with the Paris office of Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe, of San Francisco.
 One year later, the merged firms field about 100 lawyers in Paris, though Ralph Baxter, Orrick's chairman, says the next 18 months will bring ''more dramatic growth than in the past year.'' When Orrick moves to new premises later this year, he adds, there will be room for at least 150 lawyers.
 A decade ago, British firms like Freshfields and Linklaters changed some of the European landscape for lawyers. But the smaller, more nimble American firms have taken the lead in recent years. 
 The growth has been driven by the boom in corporate law accompanying waves of mergers and acquisitions. As of July, the value of European mergers and acquisitions totaled $1.38 trillion, according to Thomson Financial, compared with $1.58 trillion for all 2006. The 10 leading law firms consisted of five from the United States, headed by Sullivan & Cromwell and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and five British firms, led by Allen & Overy and Clifford Chance. 
 Not surprisingly, these inroads are sowing tensions among local firms, as the Americans with their deep pockets and aggressive plans have sought to merge with local firms or, failing that, buy away top partners. Last year, Reed Smith of Pittsburgh merged with Richards Butler of Britain; in 2004, Piper Rudnick of the United States merged with DLA of Britain.
 Some governments are troubled by the incursion of American firms, the English they speak and the practices of common law they bring. Three years ago, the French government organized a series of discussions in Paris and Washington on the value of the Napoleonic Code, after the Harvard economist Andrei Schleifer argued in a study that the language of finance was increasingly becoming English, and the legal backbone of finance was increasingly the common law.
 The next jolt to Europe's legal system may come from Britain, where Parliament is expected to enact a law this year enabling law firms to sell shares on the stock market. Australia has already taken the step, and in May, Slater & Gordon, in Melbourne, became the first law firm to be listed on the Australian stock exchange. 
 ''The jury is out on what will happen,'' to the legal industry, said Jeremy Black, who follows law firms at Deloitte & Touche in London. ''There is a wall of money in the investment community,'' he added, ''and law firms are intelligent people.'' 
 Firms with sizable war chests, he said, could drive aggressively overseas, though some countries on the Continent, most notably Germany, have already said they would not welcome such listed firms.
 Some European law firms have reached out to American partners for financial expertise. When the British firm Rowe & Maw merged in 2002 with Mayer Brown & Platt of Chicago, it gave Rowe access to the Continent, since one year earlier Mayer Brown had acquired the law firms Lambert & Lee, of Paris, and Gaedertz of Frankfurt. 
 ''But it also gave us a financial practice of some 250 to 280 lawyers,'' said Paul Maher, a former partner at Rowe & Maw who is now vice chairman of Mayer Brown. ''If you decide to be a big beast in the jungle,'' he said, ''you are constantly seeking to find economies of scale.''
 To grow, some American firms are stalking prey in France. In 2003, the San Francisco firm Paul Hastings reinforced its position in Paris by acquiring Moquet Borde & Associes, a French firm with 55 lawyers.
 Others seek organic growth. Davis Polk of New York has been in Paris for decades, and by the late '80s had about 30 lawyers in Paris, mostly Americans. Five years ago the number had dwindled to three or four, but by this year it had climbed back to 14, mostly French. Margaret E. Tahyar, a Davis Polk partner, says the firm ''is in a growth phase,'' hiring mainly French lawyers, though she will not say how many. ''It's a big market, a global market, and there are global companies here,'' she said. ''So we will be expanding.''
 French law practice has been by tradition modest and discreet. Even some of the larger firms, like Darrois Villey, have no Web site, considering it unprofessional. The reaction to the Americans and British has been varied.
 Some French firms have sought ''best friends'' relationships with British or American firms. For a decade, Bredin Prat, a leading firm in Paris, has had such a link with the British firm Slaughter & May, which in turn has best friends across the Continent, preferring them to mergers or acquisitions. ''It's a question of getting the plumbing right,'' said Andrew McClean, 41, a Slaughter & May partner in Paris.
 The partners are part of a vast European network. When Bredin Prat recently advised Danone on its $17 billion offer for the Dutch baby food group Royal Numico, it worked with its best friend in the Netherlands, De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek.
 ''France has the highest concentration of British and American firms in Europe,'' said Patrick Dziewolski, 37, a partner at Bredin Prat. ''But to practice French law, they hire French lawyers.''
 Perhaps the most aggressive hunter has been Latham & Watkins, of San Francisco, which devised an international expansion strategy with McKinsey in the late 1990s, then began talks in 2002 with Ashurst of Britain about a merger, which failed. Hardly had the dust settled on those talks when Latham hired away Ashurst's entire private equity team in Paris, then it proceeded the following year to raid Ashurst's Munich office. Last year, Latham snatched up Gaby Eickstadt of Ashurst, one of Germany's leading antitrust experts. Earlier, the firm pulled off perhaps its biggest coup, hiring 95 lawyers from the Paris office of Stibbe, a law firm based in Amsterdam. 
 Did French lawyers joining Latham suffer culture shock? ''I don't think so,'' said Olivier Delattre, a former Stibbe lawyer who is now a Latham partner. ''Most were with American experience, everyone knew that Americans work hard, and about time sheets, but there were no major problems.''
 Asked to cite deals that Latham could not have handled without its French lawyers, John D. Watson Jr., a Latham partner who engineered much of the growth, said that Latham had advised KB Home, from its own California backyard, when KB sold its French subsidiary, Kaufman & Broad, to a French buyout firm for $812 million in May. In June, he said, Latham advised the British private equity firm BC Partners when it acquired Intelsat, the world's biggest commercial satellite operator, in a deal worth about $5 billion. Latham's role would have been ''unimaginable,'' he said, without its French presence.
 Mr. Martel of Orrick agreed that local law continued to be critical. ''French law is going to matter -- corporate law, right of ownership,'' he said. ''You need experienced French lawyers who are prepared to deliver the law as the client needs it.''
 David Leonhardt's weekly Economic Scene column returns next Wednesday. 

CORRECTION-DATE: July 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on Wednesday about American law firms in France misstated the headquarters of the law firm Latham & Watkins, which has expanded to Paris, and for the firm Paul Hastings. Both are based in Los Angeles, not San Francisco. Also, a picture caption misstated the surname of a partner in Latham & Watkins. He is John Watson, not Watkins.

HEADLINE: Brothers And Sisters

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
Washington 
 W.'s odyssey is one of the oddest in history, a black sheep who leapt above expectations and then crashed back down. It must be a crushing burden for President Bush to have wrought the opposite of what he intended in so many profound ways.
 For me, one of the most amazing reversals brought about by W.'s reign of error is this: He may have turned my sister into a Democrat. 
 As a girl, Peggy shivered in the bitter cold through a coatless John Kennedy's inaugural speech, and when she saw W. ''debone'' Ann Richards in a Texas debate in '94, she thought: ''This guy will be the greatest president since J.F.K. He's so good looking, bright. He's got everything going for him.''
 She volunteered at the Republican convention in 2000, toting a ''W Stands for Women'' sign. I snuck her into the press pen at a breakfast with George and Laura and had to tackle her when, to the consternation of reporters, she began cheering as if at a Redskins game. She flew to West Virginia to work a phone bank for W. She sat up all night election night (in vain). She cut back on Christmas presents to give him money, and proudly displayed pictures of herself at fund-raisers, one with W., one with Dick Cheney. She canceled her Times subscription when I wrote about the rigged buildup to the Iraq war, and called ''Bushworld'' (my chronicle of W.'s warped reality) ''that silly book.''
 She once told a reporter that she couldn't totally choose W. over me because she knew if she were dying ''he won't come and hold my hand, and I know Maureen will.'' So imagine my surprise when she started talking about voting for Barack Obama or John Edwards, if they stop ''pussyfooting'' around Hillary.
 ''W.'s loyalty to Cheney has hurt his presidency,'' she says sadly. ''When Cheney picked himself as vice president, W. should have said, 'Bug off.' He could have made his own banquet instead of choosing leftovers. If only he had dialed his father or listened to Powell instead of Cheney and Rumsfeld on Iraq. Not only has W. brought himself down, he's brought down John McCain, who I wanted to support but can't because of the war.
 ''I grew up in the shadow of Walter Reed and was used to seeing servicemen without limbs. But recently after watching a special on soldiers coming home from Iraq with brain injuries, I picked up a picture of my four nephews and I know how I would feel if they had fought in Iraq and came home without limbs or in body bags. 
 ''We are spending billions on this war, and yet veterans and their children are practically getting nothing. I'm no longer a Republican. I'm an American, and I will cast my vote for the person I believe will start the process to get out of Iraq -- unless, of course, it's Hillary.''
 I knew my family's cocky red state of mind had changed when one of my O'Reillyesque brothers used a mocking nickname for W., and expressed disgust about Iraq.
 Another, Kevin, praises W. on the economy but not on immigration, noting that our father, who came from Ireland in steerage at 19, had to fight in World War I to win citizenship: ''The secret key to the puzzle is the word illegal.''
 He supports W. on Iraq but agrees that ''one of the president's greatest assets, loyalty, has turned into his Achilles' heel. When I started my sales career, an older rep advised me: 'Stay away from the mean drinkers in the bar. They start the fight but someone else always gets hit.' George Bush is getting hit because he won't move away from 'the mean drinkers.' ''
 ''The word neocon bothered me because I have an aversion to zealotry,'' he continues. ''An uncomfortable visual of Cheney, Wolfowitz and Rumsfeld manning the Situation Room in a scene reminiscent of Dr. Strangelove and Gen. Buck Turgidson -- 'No more than 10 to 20 million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks' -- began to haunt me. How could we have underestimated the postwar situation in Iraq so badly? Is our intelligence that poor, or did the people making the decisions even care?
 ''The Republicans got exactly what they deserved in the last election. They fell on the same sword they had brilliantly wielded to gain power. Tom DeLay was as corrupt as Jim Wright, Dennis Hastert as inept as Tom Foley.''
 Even in his demoralized state, Kevin warns Democrats: ''Memo to Nancy and Harry -- a default blind date to the prom is not the basis for a long-term relationship.''
 My sister still has her picture of W. up. But Cheney is face down in the laundry room.

HEADLINE: Libya Frees 6, Opening Doors but Raising Criticism

BYLINE: By MATTHEW BRUNWASSER and ELAINE SCIOLINO; Dan Bilefsky contributed reporting from Brussels, Ariane Bernard from Paris and Jad Mouawad from New York.. 
Matthew Brunwasser reported from Sofia, and Elaine Sciolino from Paris.

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, July 24 

 BODY:
After more than eight years in a Libyan prison, convicted of deliberately infecting children with the virus that causes AIDS, five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor stepped off a French presidential plane to freedom here on Tuesday. 
 The charge had been widely dismissed abroad as absurd. The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, had accused the six medical workers, who were said to have been tortured, of acting on the orders of American and Israeli intelligence agencies to destabilize the Libyan state. 
 Their liberation, through French intervention and payments of hundreds of millions of dollars in total to the families of the infected children, brings to an end a bizarre and tortuous episode that opens the way for Libya to improved political ties and lucrative trade deals with Europe.
 Human rights groups assailed the bargain, saying Libya should not be rewarded for taking hostages and releasing them for a price. 
 ''This is really an outrageous case in which the lives of these nurses and medic were literally ransomed for $400 million,'' said Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, a group based in Boston. ''The charges were fabricated; the nurses were tortured into confessing; there was no due process.''
 Indeed, after their arrival in Sofia, their stories of torture, beatings and rape began pouring out. One of the nurses said she tried to commit suicide.
 ''I still can't believe that I am standing on Bulgarian soil,'' Kristiana Valcheva, 48, one of the five nurses, told the state Channel 1 television, as the medical workers embraced their families.
 The freed medical workers were accompanied Tuesday by the two women who reached the final breakthrough: the French first lady, Cecilia Sarkozy, and the European Union's foreign affairs commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner.
 The liberation of the six is a result of a three-year diplomatic process started by the European Union, advanced by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Germany and clinched by the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, and his wife.
 In the end, the personal rapport that Mrs. Sarkozy established with Colonel Qaddafi, his wife and daughter played a crucial role in arriving at an agreement, French and European officials involved in the initiative said. 
 The agreement follows the breakthroughs that brought Libya in from the diplomatic cold when it acknowledged responsibility for the 1988 Pan Am 103 jetliner bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 2002, and formally abandoned its nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs in 2003. 
 At a news conference in Paris, Mr. Sarkozy said, ''It is first and foremost a nightmare that is ending for these women and this man, whose innocence is obvious for everyone in Europe.''
 In Sofia on Tuesday, Ms. Ferrero-Waldner of the European Union said the decision to free the six medical workers ''will open the way for a new and enhanced relationship between the E.U. and Libya and reinforce our ties with the Mediterranean region and the whole of Africa.''
 Not all of the terms of the deal were clear. Last week, Libya's highest court commuted the death sentences of the six to life imprisonment, after each of the 460 families of the infected children was told it would receive $1 million in compensation in exchange for dropping their demands for the medical workers to be executed.
 Colonel Qaddafi's son, Seif al-Islam, who heads a foundation that led negotiations between the families and the Libyan state, said in an interview with Le Figaro that Libya was dispensing the funds, but that Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia and the Czech Republic had also contributed by forgiving Libya's debt. A senior French official said that at least one country had already forgiven several tens of millions of dollars of Libya's debt and that others were considering following suit. 
 Ms. Ferrero-Waldner said the 27-country European Union would encourage member governments to pay voluntarily into an umbrella international fund that would help compensate the families and finance medical treatment and hospital projects in Libya.
 Under the terms of the agreement, which must be approved by European Union governments, Libya and the Union would develop a full partnership, with the Europeans promising a package of aid to develop Libyan hospitals and other infrastructure. 
 The Union has also promised a wide range of incentives, including a regional trade agreement that would ease access to Libyan agricultural goods in Europe; the financing of restoration of Libyan antiquities; the offer of scholarships for Libyan students; and the granting of visas to Libyan citizens for travel in Europe.
 Idriss Lagha, the head of the Libyan Union for Children Infected With H.I.V., said in a telephone interview from Tripoli that financial compensation for the families, mandated by Islamic law, and promises of medical support for the infected children and for Libya's hospital in Benghazi were critically important to reaching a breakthrough. 
 ''This release was finally expected after the negotiations and was in accordance with Islamic law after the payments were made,'' Mr. Lagha said. 
 The release of the medical workers is a diplomatic coup for Mr. Sarkozy, who will visit Libya on Wednesday during a previously planned trip to Senegal and Gabon. 
 In addition to freeing the medical workers, Mr. Sarkozy wanted to replicate for France Mr. Blair's success with Libya. In May, Mr. Blair, then the British prime minister, visited Libya and announced a $900 million oil exploration contract that returned BP, the British oil company, to the country after more than three decades. He predicted that British companies would enjoy ''huge'' new contracts because Colonel Qaddafi had joined the global fight against terrorism.
 Freeing the medical workers was one of Mr. Sarkozy's campaign promises. After his election as president of France in May, Mr. Sarkozy, who had visited Libya when he was interior minister, promised Colonel Qaddafi in telephone conversations that he would go back as soon as the medical workers were freed. It was then that Colonel Qaddafi invited Mrs. Sarkozy.
 Mrs. Sarkozy apparently charmed the colonel during a first encounter in Libya earlier this month, conducted without the presence of aides. She also met with Mr. Qaddafi's wife, his daughter, the families of the infected children and the medical workers. Upon her return to France, Mrs. Sarkozy described forging ''a real relationship of trust'' with Colonel Qaddafi. 
 During her second trip to Libya -- this time with Ms. Ferrero-Waldner of the European Union -- Mrs. Sarkozy asked Colonel Qaddafi to be magnanimous. A European official briefed on the meeting paraphrased Mrs. Sarkozy as saying: ''My husband will come tomorrow if you do this deal, but will not come if you do not. You are going to release them anyway, so get on with it. This is your chance to come back into the international fold.''
 French and European officials spoke anonymously, citing normal diplomatic strictures.
 At the airport in Sofia, Mrs. Sarkozy waved as she descended from the plane, putting her hand over her heart and mouthing the word ''Merci.'' 
 Mr. Sarkozy, who conducted much of the diplomacy himself without turning to his own Foreign Ministry for backup, last Friday even put the visiting emir of Qatar to work, arranging for him to call Colonel Qaddafi and promote the French initiative, a European official said. 
 Mr. Sarkozy's success positions France to forge a new economic relationship with Libya. 
 France, a major supplier to the Libyan Air Force in the 1970s before Libya's military intervention in Chad chilled French-Libyan relations, resumed military cooperation with Libya in 2005. France is well-placed to provide Libya with much-needed help in building superhighways, trains, satellite systems and civil engineering, aerospace and defense projects. 
 The French diplomatic coup has rankled some of the country's European partners, particularly Germany, whose foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, hammered out the contours of a deal with Colonel Qaddafi during Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union that ended a few weeks ago. 
 ''The hyperactive French President Nicolas Sarkozy threatened to blow the entire deal with his unstoppable urge to get involved in the affair,'' said a lengthy article in the magazine Der Spiegel this week that reconstructed Germany's own diplomatic efforts. It added, ''New to international diplomacy, he first sent his wife Cecilia on a conciliatory visit to the nurses and infected children -- in her official capacity as a 'mother.' ''

HEADLINE: Paulson Says U.S. Is Hurt by High Tax Rates

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. wants people to know that the corporate tax code is hurting American competitiveness. But corporate lobbyists are not expecting him to do anything about it.
 On Thursday, Mr. Paulson will convene a conference to drive home the point that American corporate tax rates are higher and more complex than in Europe, Japan and most industrialized countries.
 Participants will include Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve; Martin Feldstein, president of the National Bureau of Economic Research; and Frederick W. Smith, chairman of the FedEx Corporation. 
 In a report prepared for the conference, the Treasury Department said that American companies are hobbled by high tax rates, instances of double taxation and a bewildering patchwork of rules for special interests. 
 ''Our tax system disrupts and distorts a vast array of business and investment decisions,'' the Treasury Department said. That, it said, ''lowers the productive capacity of the economy and reduces living standards.''
 But Treasury officials say they are not planning any legislation. Indeed, tax reform disappeared from President Bush's agenda almost two years ago, after he became bogged down in a failed campaign to overhaul Social Security.
 In October 2005, after months of work, Mr. Bush's handpicked advisory panel delivered two comprehensive proposals to make the entire tax code simpler, fairer and more efficient. But administration officials immediately buried the recommendations, and Mr. Bush never came out with a plan of his own. 
 Corporate tax lobbyists say the prospects for action are far lower today, given Mr. Bush's low popularity, the Democratic majorities in Congress and the fact that none of Mr. Bush's tax cuts expire until 2010. 
 ''Given the environment we're operating in, and given the fact that the only real deadline for action on a broad basis is the end of 2009, it's inconceivable that anything could be enacted between now and the end of the administration,'' said Kenneth Kies, a corporate tax lobbyist and former Republican staff director on the House Ways and Means Committee. 
 Treasury officials say their immediate goal is simply to highlight the need for change and set the stage for future debates. 
 ''The conference is focused on examining business taxes and how they affect competitiveness,'' said Andrew DeSouza, a Treasury spokesman. ''If there are next steps, that would come after the conference.''
 Some Republicans theorize Mr. Paulson may be trying to head off Democratic attempts to raise taxes on private equity funds, oil companies and other businesses. ''I think he's pushing back against the Democrats,'' said Pat Toomey, president of the Club for Growth, a conservative advocacy group. 
 But others say Mr. Paulson is simply trying to look busy.
 Mr. Paulson has already lowered his ambitions on a range of other issues. When he took office in June 2006, he talked about working with Democratic lawmakers to address looming shortfalls in entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. 
 But his discussions with Democrats, though cordial, went nowhere. The White House squelched any talk of tax increases to fill the shortfalls and ignored Democrats' demands that Mr. Bush abandon his push for letting people put some of their Social Security taxes into private investment accounts.
 Earlier this year, Mr. Paulson admitted that making progress on entitlement programs was more difficult than he had expected.
 Nor did Mr. Paulson have much success on an initiative to relax securities regulations that Wall Street firms said were making it harder for American stock exchanges to compete with foreign stock exchanges.
 Under the circumstances, veterans of past tax battles in Congress say Mr. Paulson is doing as much as he can.
 ''Put yourself in the shoes of someone like Paulson -- what are you going to do?'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who worked on tax policy at the Treasury Department under President Ronald Reagan. ''They're not getting any traction on health. They're not getting any traction on Social Security. The best thing they can do is go ahead with studying the issues in a bipartisan way.''
 Mr. Paulson's conference will have a bipartisan feel. Though many participants are well-known Republicans, like Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Feldstein, the list also includes prominent critics of Mr. Bush's tax policies like William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution and Alan J. Auerbach, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. 
 ''I don't know what they want from me, but I expect they want it to be short,'' Mr. Auerbach said in a telephone interview. ''There are a lot of speakers.''
 In its background report for the conference, the Treasury Department noted that the top corporate tax rate, including state taxes, is 39 percent -- significantly higher than the average of 31 percent for other industrialized nations. 
 If Congress were to strip out the thousands of special tax breaks for everything from domestic manufacturing and oil drilling to technology research, Treasury officials estimated that the top rate could be reduced to just 27 percent.
 But Congress has shown little appetite for that kind of trade-off, which was at the heart of the last major tax overhaul in 1986. 
 It is not clear how long Mr. Paulson will dwell on the issue. The day after his conference, he heads to China for more talks about currency flexibility.

HEADLINE: A TV Contest Sets Off a Furor Over Portugal's Ex-Dictator

BYLINE: By DAN BILEFSKY

DATELINE: SANTA COMBA DAO, Portugal 

 BODY:
When Portuguese television viewers recently voted the former dictator Antonio de Oliveira Salazar ''the greatest Portuguese who ever lived'' -- passing over the most celebrated kings, poets and explorers in the nation's thousand-year history -- the broadcaster RTP braced itself for a strong reaction. But what ensued resembled a national identity crisis.
 First the left howled in protest, demanding to know how a man who had sent his enemies to concentration camps in Africa could be revered by a modern European nation. Then the Socialist government spun into denial, saying the vote was unrepresentative because viewers could vote multiple times from different phone lines -- as many did.
 One irate viewer wrote to the channel's Web site, saying, ''Only masochists, imbeciles or the insane could have voted for this executioner.'' Others said the tally was a fitting rebuke from a country lagging behind the rest of the continent. 
 The show ''Great Portuguese,'' in which Salazar received 41 percent of the 159,245 votes cast, was based on the BBC show ''Great Britons,'' which has spawned imitators around the world. Churchill won on the British version of the show, while in the United States, Reagan edged out Lincoln.
 But no country experienced the frenzy of recrimination that engulfed Portugal, where Salazar beat nine finalists, including the explorer Vasco da Gama, who discovered the sea route to India, and Aristides de Sousa Mendes, a diplomat who saved thousands of Jews during World War II.
 Salazar's prospects may have been helped by RTP's initially having omitted his name from the contest, a move that provoked a massive pro-Salazar campaign in the blogosphere.
 Whatever the intrigue behind the voting, Fernando Dacosta, a biographer of Salazar, calls his victory the ''Portuguese revenge'' for disillusionment with the revolution of April 25, 1974, which overthrew the dictatorship but failed to deliver on its own promises. Today, Portugal is the poorest country in Western Europe, and its recent history is marred by corruption scandals.
 ''The Portuguese don't want to have Salazar back from the dead,'' said Mr. Dacosta, who was jailed several times as a student during the Salazar dictatorship. ''But they miss the dream they had in the past about a future that never came.''
 He said nostalgia for Salazar also reflected the ''saudade,'' or longing, of the Portuguese soul, a melancholy, he noted, that is present in most things Portuguese like the existential angst of fado music.
 Salazar's ghost is everywhere here in the dictator's birthplace, a dusty agricultural town about 125 miles north of Lisbon, though there are few visible signs of the town's most famous son.
 The modest house where he lived sits crumbling and empty, with a tiny plaque on the facade saying, ''A gentle man who governed and never robbed.''
 ''It is shame that such a great man is treated like this,'' Idalina Da Conceicao, 75, shouted down from her window next to Salazar's home. ''If Salazar was bad, the people who run the country today are even worse.''
 Miguel Arriaga, 17, an engineering student, said he voted twice for Salazar because today's Portugal was ''godless'' and bereft of values and purpose.
 The television contest may help Salazar's birthplace to resurrect him from the shadows of history, in addition to providing a commercial opportunity.
 For 30 years, a bust of Salazar has been hidden away in the city hall's attic after the rest of the statue was blown up during the revolution. Now the mayor wants to resurrect the statue, next to a planned Salazar museum. Plans also are in the works for a gift shop, T-shirts and commemorative figurines.
 ''Whatever you think of Salazar, he ran the country for nearly 40 years, during which we were treated like children,'' said the mayor, Joao Lourenco, a conservative. ''Now, we Portuguese have finally grown up and we need to confront our past.''
 In a potent sign that a historical reckoning is finally taking place, a new satirical play -- ''Salazar, the Musical'' -- is drawing large crowds on a Lisbon stage.
 On a recent night, the audience howled with laughter as the pious Salazar, who never married and was staunchly Catholic, was depicted as an ineffectual and lecherous womanizer who kills his mother, gropes dancing nuns and leaves the running of the country to his famously powerful secretary and housekeeper, Dona Maria.
 Jose Pedro Vasconcelos, 29, and Miguel Melo, 40, the two actors who play Salazar and who co-wrote the play, say they felt compelled to stage the musical because Salazar was the last sacred cow in Portugal. He added: ''Abortion is no longer a taboo. Homosexuality is no longer a taboo. Dope is not a taboo. Yet Salazar still gives us goose bumps.'' 
 Some say the vote for Salazar was a backlash against the government of Prime Minister Jose Socrates, 52, a Socialist, who has recently pushed through painful economic reforms. But in an interview, Mr. Socrates blamed the vote on the mobilization of a small fringe group of rightists.
 ''We are a modern European country,'' he said. ''We voted 59 percent in favor of liberalizing abortion.''
 Salazar came to power in a coup that overthrew an elected government in 1926. His New State initially brought economic stability and social order to Portugal. Many Portuguese still revere him for keeping the country out of World War II.
 But his dark record includes the creation of a secret police force that tortured opponents, and widespread censorship that stifled cultural expression. He is also criticized for clinging to a crumbling empire.
 Sociologists here say Salazar's popularity may also be part of a global trend in which economic insecurity and fears of international terrorism have created nostalgia for the authoritarianism of the past.
 Adriano Moreira, 86, a minister for overseas affairs under Salazar, argues that if today's Portuguese idealize Salazar, it is because he was not a fascist dictator, but rather a ''soft authoritarian'' and father figure who gave the country a strong sense of national identity. Independent historians say only 60 people died in jails for political reasons during Salazar's nearly 40-year rule.
 Whatever the explanations for the late dictator's grip on the Portuguese psyche, Mr. Dacosta, his biographer, argues that both the young and older generations need to confront his ghost.
 ''Salazar is not an extraterrestrial who just landed here,'' he said. ''He is part of the Portuguese soul. Until we come to terms with Salazar, we Portuguese will never be who we really are.''

HEADLINE: Court Voids Higher Limits On Truckers' Work Hours

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
A federal appeals court on Tuesday struck down a Bush administration rule that loosened limits on the work hours of truck drivers, concluding that officials had failed to offer adequate justification for the changes.
 In a unanimous decision, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said the federal agency that oversees the trucking industry had not provided enough evidence to demonstrate the safety of its 2005 decision to increase the maximum driving hours of truck drivers. The hours were increased to 77 from 60 over 7 consecutive days, and to 88 hours from 70 over 8 days. 
 The court found that the agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, had ignored the results of a study, which it had commissioned, involving a database of more than 50,000 truck accidents from 1991 to 2002. Using the data, the study extrapolated a substantially higher risk of fatigue-related accidents in the extra hours of service allowed by the new rules. 
 The agency, part of the Transportation Department, ''failed to provide an adequate explanation for its decision to adopt the 11-hour daily driving limit,'' the court said. 
 The new rules had been adopted after heavy lobbying by politically influential leaders of the trucking industry. They were part of a broader strategy by the Bush administration to reduce regulations on businesses. 
 Safety experts and insurance analysts challenged the changes. They said longer driving hours had contributed to a high number of truck accidents. About 100 people die each week in truck-related accidents, making the industry America's most treacherous as measured by deaths and injuries to truckers, drivers of other vehicles and pedestrians.
 Supporters of the loosened standards say they have made it faster and cheaper to move goods across the country. They say that the changes promoted safety and that shorter hours would force the industry to put more drivers with little experience behind the wheel. And they note that the fatality rate in truck-related accidents -- the number of deaths per miles traveled -- has continued a long decline.
 Still, the rate remains nearly double that for accidents involving only cars, and the Bush administration has repeatedly missed its own targets for reducing truck-related fatalities.
 The decision on Tuesday, in a case filed by the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen, was the third in three years bringing judicial criticism down on the motor carrier agency.
 A different appeals panel criticized the agency in December 2005 for failing to issue adequate rules for the training of drivers, saying it had ignored its own studies on a need for more comprehensive training.
 And in 2004, a third panel of the appeals court struck down new hours-of-service rules that were virtually identical to those at issue in Tuesday's decision, saying they had been ''arbitrary and capricious.'' 
 After Congress, at the urging of the Bush administration and the trucking industry, intervened to block the enforcement of the 2004 court order, the motor carrier agency issued the 2005 rules. At the time, the agency said it had addressed the concerns raised by the appeals court's 2004 decision. 
 In a regulatory impact analysis accompanying the 2005 changes, the agency concluded that the economic costs to the industry of tightening the hours-of-service rules, as consumer groups had proposed, outweighed the safety benefits. But the court said Tuesday that the analysis was flawed. The opinion was written by Judge Merrick B. Garland and signed by Chief Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg and Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson.
 Safety groups hailed the ruling.
 ''The court is saying once again, no,'' said Jacqueline S. Gillan, vice president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, an alliance of consumer, health and insurance organizations. ''For three and a half years this agency has tried every which way to defend a rule that would result in longer consecutive driver hours and longer total work hours. This has a dramatic dangerous impact on the lives of truck drivers and on the lives of everyone sharing the roads with trucks. And once again the court has said, 'No, you cannot go ahead with a rule when it violates the law and you clearly have not justified it.' ''
 The agency would not say whether it would appeal the decision or seek a stay of the court's order, which is to take effect in September. 
 ''We are analyzing the decision issued today to understand the court's findings as well as determine the agency's next steps to prevent driver fatigue, ensure safe and efficient motor carrier operations and save lives,'' a statement issued by the agency said.
 The American Trucking Associations, which defended the changes to the rules in the proceeding, said it would ask the court to stay its ruling to give the agency time to provide a better justification of the changes.

HEADLINE: Japan's Quake-Prone Atomic Plant Prompts Wider Worry

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, July 24 

 BODY:
After a deadly earthquake struck northwestern Japan last week, the nation was stunned by widespread damage to a nuclear power plant near the quake's center, including minor radiation leaks, ruptured pipes, flooding and a fire that belched black smoke for more than an hour on live television. 
 But perhaps the most startling discovery occurred in the days that followed, when scientists used data from the magnitude 6.8 earthquake on July 16 to conclude that the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa plant, the world's largest by electrical output, may have unknowingly been built directly on top of an active seismic fault. That could account for the force of the tremors, which Tokyo Electric Power, the operator of the plant, said were more than twice as strong as the plant's design limits. 
 The earthquake, which killed 11 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Kashiwazaki, a city nearby, has raised discomforting questions about the safety of nuclear plants in Japan. The plants in this earthquake-prone nation are supposed to be nearly earthquake-proof, built to withstand the most powerful punch. The Kashiwazaki plant's surprising vulnerability to damage, however, has distressed many Japanese. 
 The damage at the plant appeared to offer a vivid reminder of the risks of nuclear power, as the United States, Europe and countries elsewhere are giving atomic energy a second look as a clean, plentiful alternative to oil and other fossil fuels. Resource-poor Japan kept building nuclear plants even after accidents like Three Mile Island in 1979 in the United States and Chernobyl in 1986 in Ukraine froze construction in the United States and parts of Europe for decades. 
 Nuclear experts applaud the fact that all four of the Kashiwazaki plant's seven reactors that were operating when the earthquake struck were safely shut down, despite the unexpected strength of the tremors. But Tokyo Electric's failure to predict the size of the tremors that could strike the area, and to detect the fault line beneath the plant, left many here wondering whether regulators and plant operators could also have underestimated the potential for devastating earthquakes at Japan's 48 other nuclear reactors. 
 ''The plant did an excellent job of ensuring the safety of the reactors themselves,'' said Michio Ishikawa, president of the Japan Nuclear Technology Institute, a research group sponsored by the industry. ''But how could they have not known about the active fault line?'' 
 On Tuesday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which oversees energy policy, said it would create an independent panel of academic experts to investigate the damage at the Kashiwazaki plant in Niigata Prefecture. The panel's findings will be presented to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a United Nations group that will send its own inspectors to the plant, the ministry said. 
 The discovery of the fault line has attracted intense news media attention in Japan, partly because it echoes problems at nuclear plants elsewhere in Japan. Lawsuits have sought the closure of at least four other plants because of nearby fault lines. The plants include one in Shika, a town in western Japan, where a large fault was discovered in 2005, just before the plant was completed. 
 The earthquake last week also defied expectations by moving differently from previous quakes in the region, Tokyo Electric said. The Kashiwazaki plant was designed to withstand shorter, more intense tremors. But the recent quake struck with a broad, wrenching horizontal swaying that caused water to slosh out of storage pools. 
 About 317 gallons of this spilled water, contaminated by tiny amounts of radioactive material, reached the nearby Sea of Japan. Tokyo Electric said the levels of radioactivity in that spill and a separate leak of contaminated exhaust were far too low to harm the environment. It also said damage at the plant had only occurred in less critical areas, which had been built to less stringent standards than the reactors, which were housed in bunkerlike concrete buildings. 
 Tokyo Electric admitted that it had failed to find the fault where the earthquake occurred. The company said the fault line did not show up in surveys of the area made in the late 1970s, when it started building the plant. 
 But the company says the plant is still safe because the fault line appears to lie more than 12 miles beneath the plant, too deep to cause the sorts of big cracks and other surface movement that could damage the reactors' thick concrete buildings. 
 ''Not finding the fault was a miss on our part,'' said Toshiaki Sakai, who leads the engineering group in charge of Tokyo Electric nuclear plants. ''But it was not a fatal miss by any means.'' 
 Still, critics say the fact that the miss could happen at all points to a bigger problem: the broad discretion that the government gives power companies in deciding whether a site is safe. 
 Katsuhiko Ishibashi, a professor at Kobe University specializing in earthquakes and urban safety, was a member of a committee that set new earthquake safety guidelines for Japan's nuclear reactors last year. He said some of the committee's 20 members were scholars and engineers with close ties to power companies, including one who advised those companies. 
 Mr. Ishibashi said the guidelines, approved in September, were too vague and left too much discretion to power companies in deciding whether a plant site was seismically safe. He said he got so angry at the lack of discussion in the committee about the new guidelines that he resigned in disgust at the final meeting. 
 The strength of the earthquake in Kashiwazaki ''could have been predicted, and should have been predicted,'' Mr. Ishibashi said. ''The new guidelines are very insufficient and have loopholes.'' 
 Plant operators and government regulators call those criticisms unfair. They say the companies' plans face intense scrutiny from committees of independent scholars. They also say the Kashiwazaki plant was just unlucky: The earthquake struck a year before Tokyo Electric was to finish a seismic survey to ensure that the plant met the standards of the new earthquake safety guidelines. 
 ''The company did the best it could with the technology that it had available when the plant was constructed,'' said Hitoshi Sato, deputy director general for nuclear safety at the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. ''If you insisted on being 100 percent sure about finding all active fault lines, you'd never get anything built.''

HEADLINE: Figures Moving as if in a Trance Across an Isolated, Lawless Island

BYLINE: By ROBERTA SMITH

 BODY:
History often gets the better of artists who tackle it head-on, resulting in work that is didactic, parasitic or sensational and adds little to our understanding of its course or to art. In ''Condensation,'' an exhibition of five videos by the Taiwanese artist Chen Chieh-Jen at Asia Society, these risks are alternately avoided or tripped over, which makes the show a kind of primer of dos and don'ts for art about history. 
 Mr. Chen, born in 1960, has a penchant for a slow-moving cinematic elegance that can be tedious in some works and appropriately solemn in others. All of his films are silent; at a moment when much video art would be unwatchable without the benefit of some bit of seductive music, this is noteworthy, even startling. 
 Mr. Chen has shown in several of the numerous international biennials (Sao Paulo, Venice, Liverpool, Sydney, Gwangju and, next fall, Istanbul) that form an institutional art market paralleling the more purely commercial one. He took up video in 2002 after nearly 20 years of working in photography, installation and performance, or what seems to have been a combination of the three -- manipulated photographs in which he added himself, Zelig-like, to horrific historical images of precolonial and colonial warfare and torture from China and Taiwan. One of these, a famous 1905 photograph of lingchi, an ancient form of Chinese execution known as ''death by a thousand cuts,'' also inspired the earliest, most sensational and weakest video here. 
 The show at Asia Society presents all the artist's videos to date and is his first solo exhibition in New York. Organized by Miwako Tezuka, Asia Society's assistant curator of contemporary art, it could be a bit premature. Still, Mr. Chen's videos seem both to build upon and to improve his previous efforts. 
 The history that grips Mr. Chen in most of these works is Taiwan's -- its long insulation, precarious economic health and the scars left by a succession of regimes (Chinese and Japanese) that culminated in the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek starting in 1949. Chiang gained control of Taiwan -- with help from the United Nations -- after being defeated by Mao's Communists, and imposed martial law to make ready for a reinvasion of mainland China that never happened. 
 But for two decades, Taiwan was the only China recognized by the United Nations, the United States (which provided a lot of aid) and most of the West. This changed in the early 1970s, when the reality of the Communist People's Republic of China could no longer be ignored. Chiang died in 1975, his successors dismantled martial law in 1987 and the first democratic elections took place in 1996. By then globalization was taking a toll. As businesses moved elsewhere in search of cheaper labor, factories closed, pension funds vanished and many workers felt abandoned. 
 Mr. Chen makes his country feel like a lawless place suffused with corruption, paralysis and isolation. How to make art about this without paralyzing the viewer is a challenge. 
 At his best, he does so by evoking the resilience of the individual and by countering reality with different kinds of artistry: with slow-moving images that might almost be mural-size photographs, shots of piles of detritus that resemble installation art and of people moving with the dreamlike pace (and silence) of performance art. 
 These qualities work best in three videos set amid the haunting devastation and architectural grandeur of abandoned factories. In the first, ''Factory'' (2003), Mr. Chen invited several women to revisit the vast garment factory where they worked as recently as seven years before. As his camera creeps past and circles back, or zooms slowly in and out, the women work at their sewing machines, slump over them or wipe the dust from rows of chairs in the shadow of a mountain of old tables that itself resembles an installation piece. We see close-ups of weathered faces, a hand trying futilely to thread a needle, a sewing-machine foot chugging across the blue fabric of a jacket. Two women stand amid the mountain of tables, holding up one of these jackets as if it were a protest banner. 
 In ''On Going'' (2006), a lone office worker slumps at his desk in a new, pristine office building and is then seen in an abandoned factory, silk-screening broadsheets in the back of an old truck lined with vintage portraits. The wall label says he is protesting globalization, but he could also be mourning Taiwan's exclusion from the great experiment in China. 
 The film that I found easiest to sit through is ''Bade Area'' (2005), shot in Bade, a once-thriving industrial city in northwestern Taiwan. The camera follows a gaunt middle-aged man as he scavenges in an abandoned factory where squatters seem to live on the roof. He joins a bucket brigade extracting secretarial chairs from a pile of office furniture and ultimately finds a thin, dusty mattress that he carries away, past a billboard announcing ''The Majestic Town.'' 
 In the best scene he wanders across the building's roof, where barrel vaults form a hilly terrain complete with streams of stagnant water. He passes a sprawling group of drinkers, then a man who has found a microphone and amplifier (he is either singing or giving a speech) and, finally, a woman who sells him a drink of water. He seems, briefly, like a wanderer in a traditional Chinese landscape painting. 
 Mr. Chen's work is full of echoes of past art and especially films and videos, including those of Chantal Akerman, Ulrike Ottinger, Alan Sekula, Kim Sooja and Zhang Yimou, the Chinese director of ''Raise the Red Lantern'' and ''Ju Dou.'' The face of the dying man in the lingchi video monotonously evokes Maria Falconetti in Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1928 ''Passion of Joan of Arc.'' The big movie-still, light-box photographs of Jeff Wall, which sometimes take the inequities of labor as their subject, also come to mind. And the drinkers, putterers and wanderers of the roof scene in ''Bade Area'' can call forth Vittorio de Sica's poetic films set in the poverty and chaos of Italy just after World War II. 
 In fact, Mr. Chen's work is so alive with such references that the ease with which cinematic mediums circle the globe, and bend to the purposes of artists in one culture and then another, becomes one of his underlying themes: perhaps the most optimistic one.

HEADLINE: Grand Jury Won't Indict Doctor in Hurricane Deaths

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, July 24 

 BODY:
A grand jury Tuesday refused to indict a doctor accused of killing four elderly patients in the chaotic aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, ending a case that inflamed public opinion here, turned the doctor into something of a folk hero and demoralized an already-shaken medical community. 
 The doctor, Anna M. Pou, had been a respected medical professor on the staff of the Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center in New Orleans. The Orleans Parish grand jury cleared her of accusations that she had deliberately injected the critically ill patients with a lethal combination of morphine and another drug in a sweltering hospital that had been without power for days after the storm. Charges against two nurses accused of assisting her had earlier been dropped in exchange for their testimony for the prosecution. 
 Dr. Pou, 51, has maintained her innocence since her arrest a year ago. Medical ethicists have said that at the very least the accusation of homicide against her raised difficult questions of what constituted appropriate treatment during a crisis; some said charges should never have been brought against her.
 On Tuesday the American Medical Association released a statement praising the grand jury's decision. 
 Trembling and tearful at a news conference, Dr. Pou said she had been through a ''very challenging and painful'' time and now planned to resume her practice after teaching for the last year. Describing how she had received the news, she said she was ''at home with my husband and I fell to my knees and thanked God.'' 
 She declined to discuss precisely what happened at the hospital after the hurricane, citing pending civil suits against her by three of the patients' families. In previous television interviews she has said that she had simply tried to make patients at the hospital ''comfortable.''
 Attorney General Charles Foti of Louisiana, who had ordered Dr. Pou and two nurses, Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, to be arrested last year on charges of second-degree murder, defended the case Tuesday, saying independent expert pathologists had reviewed it favorably before it was brought. 
 ''I regret their decision,'' Mr. Foti said of the grand jurors, while criticizing the district attorney's office for not calling on certain witnesses to testify.
 But the district attorney in New Orleans, Eddie Jordan, told reporters, ''I agreed with the grand jury.'' 
 From the beginning the case has transcended the simple accusation of murder, coming to encapsulate for many here the horrific conditions and choices that prevailed in the days after the storm -- and particularly on Thursday, Sept. 1, 2005, the day the deaths occurred, and the last day before large-scale help arrived in New Orleans.
 The temperature at Memorial Medical Center was over 100 degrees, five feet of water lapped its lower floors, patients were dying, and Dr. Pou and the nurses were among the few medical professionals who had stayed behind to confront the hurricane's aftermath at its worst flash point -- the hospitals.
 Patients had to be squeezed through a hole and carried up many flights of stairs to the roof to be airlifted out. There were at least 34 deaths at Memorial as patients and doctors waited to be rescued from the marooned hospital.
 Those circumstances, acutely recalled by citizens here, quickly turned public opinion -- as measured by letters to the editor, blogs, call-in shows and even rallies -- to Dr. Pou's side. On Tuesday, her lawyer, Richard Simmons, touched on that common knowledge, saying, ''Anybody with a television set knows the cause of death.'' A rally in support of the doctor last week at City Park drew hundreds of people, many of them nurses and doctors, including some who had been at the hospital. 
 Adding to the sense that Dr. Pou had been turned into something of a martyr was the highly public nature of her arrest last summer. Mr. Foti accused her at a news conference of having acted like ''God'' at the hospital in deciding that certain patients were not going to survive the ordeal. He added, ''This is not euthanasia; this is plain and simple homicide.''
 Those words, and the arrest, sent chills through a medical community that had been one of this city's economic backbones before the storm and was severely reduced after it. With hundreds of doctors still living elsewhere and most of the hospitals shuttered, the case against Dr. Pou ''had a demoralizing effect,'' said Dr. Ricardo Febry, president of the Orleans Parish Medical Society. 
 ''Everybody was watching this very closely,'' Dr. Febry said. ''Had the decision been the opposite, who knows what impact that would have had. If it had dropped in the other direction, you would have seen an exodus of people.'' 
 Dr. Pou predicted on Tuesday that the case was still likely to have a chilling effect on local doctors. ''I think it will make it difficult for clinicians to deliver care,'' she said, ''especially for patients that are not theirs.'' 
 Mr. Foti's charges were backed by an affidavit that included the testimony of hospital employees, one of whom said Dr. Pou and the nurses were seen filling syringes. ''A decision had been made to administer lethal doses,'' Dr. Pou told a witness, according to the affidavit. 
 But from the beginning, there were questions about why the doctor would want to kill the patients when others were being rescued. Mr. Foti, at his news conference last year, said he was not required to supply a motive. 
 Dr. Pou's defenders here said, however, her only motives were selfless ones: easing the sufferings of critically ill patients.
 ''This was a doctor who was at all times concerned with her patients,'' said Mr. Simmons, the lawyer.

HEADLINE: Fight Song at Ozarks: Work Hard and Avoid Debt

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER. 
E-mail: joeberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
POINT LOOKOUT, Mo.
 Like many undergraduates, students at the College of the Ozarks here work their way through school, though they often do such unconventional campus jobs as milking cows at dawn in the college's barns and baking fruit breads for sale to donors.
 But what is truly different about Hard Work U. -- as the college styles itself -- is that all 1,345 students must work 15 hours per week to pay off the entire cost of tuition -- $15,900 per year. If they work summers, as one-third are doing this summer, they pay off their $4,400 room and board as well. Work study is not an option as it is at most campuses; it is the college's raison d'etre. 
 This is a college that is philosophically opposed to students starting careers with an Ozark mountain of debt -- 95 percent graduate debt free -- and it believes that students who put sweat equity into their education value it more. 
 ''I find I take more pride in doing well in class when I know I've washed dishes to be able to take that class,'' said Sarah Ledoux, a sophomore from Deridder, La. 
 Other students make similar remarks on this campus, spread across a thousand acres of the hardscrabble hills and hollows of southwestern Missouri. Those students and the college's longtime president, Jerry C. Davis, think the up-by-the-bootstraps credo is one that more campuses should adopt. Too many parents, they say, think children should focus only on the ''full college experience'' of classes, clubs and sports, and be spared the economic realities or have those realities postponed through loans. 
 ''The work ethic is not what it used to be,'' Mr. Davis said in his Georgia drawl. ''When you go out into the real world, they don't care where you went to school. They care if you show up on time, if you don't do the job right, if you've got a good attitude. Employers will tell you that graduates of College of the Ozarks have qualities they like.''
 Mr. Davis, a self-made man who overcame a life that included a broken home and expulsions from two colleges, says that his school's outlook is particularly pertinent in an era when the price of tuition can buy you a Mercedes-Benz, and when loan companies are so eager to hand out money that lenders have been accused of offering stock deals to college officials. 
 The College of the Ozarks -- a four-year college since 1965, and rated No. 30 by U.S. News and World Report among Midwestern colleges offering both liberal arts and professional degrees -- is one of seven so-called work colleges. Six describe themselves as Christian institutions and often, like Ozarks, are socially and politically conservative.
 At Ozarks, drinking is forbidden, men and women live in separate dormitories and students must attend seven chapel services a year, whatever religion they are. The political outlook is evident in campus speakers like Margaret Thatcher and Tommy Franks, the retired general who led the Iraq invasion.
 If work colleges have flourished through an almost spiritual faith in self-reliance, the practical economics are clearly not suited for every campus. Roger Lehecka, the former dean of students at Columbia and a consultant to scholarship programs including one at The New York Times, points out that working 15 hours a week amounts to earning roughly $6,000 for two semesters, a small portion of a year at Columbia that can cost more than $45,000. 
 ''No way a kid could do that working 15 hours,'' Mr. Lehecka said.
 Colleges like Columbia pay high salaries to attract top scholars and offer students a smorgasbord of electives as well as amenities like Olympic-scale gyms. College of the Ozarks is run on a lean staff -- it has only four deans -- and pays full professors under $70,000 a year for teaching more hours per semester, 12. English majors can avail themselves of a bare-bones survey course like 20th-century British literature but not of a course just in James Joyce.
 College of the Ozarks also gets students to do its maintenance and office jobs; student labor accounts for 7.5 percent of the $51 million budget, said Rick Hughes, the business manager. And the college has a $362.8 million endowment, 173rd among the nation's colleges, which allows it to hand out $11.5 million in scholarships. Three of four students have family incomes low enough to qualify for Federal Pell grants of up to $4,310.
 Avoiding debt is a powerful force in a region where the anguish of the Depression has been whispered down the generations. A Thomas Hart Benton painting of the embattled Joad family that used to advertise the movie ''The Grapes of Wrath'' is in the college's museum.
 ''Growing up it was always taught you never bought something unless you had the money to pay for it,'' said Eden Doss, 19, the daughter of a waitress from Berryville, Ark., who works as a researcher at that museum.
 The other day, half a dozen women were mixing the candied cherries, pecans and dates for one-pound, mail-order fruit cakes that sell for $13 apiece. There was Crystal Klung, 21, of Shickley, Neb., the daughter of a mechanic and nursing home aide whose sister Cassie is saddled with loans from a Nebraska college, and Lauren Smollen, 21, who comes from a single-parent household in Jefferson City. 
 ''My family doesn't have a lot of money,'' Ms. Smollen said. ''Here you're pretty much guaranteed to have college paid for. You don't have debt, which is a pretty big deal when you don't have a lot of money.''
 MANY students work off campus as well, taking jobs in nearby Branson, with 49 theaters graced by names like Andy Williams and Dolly Parton that mix gospel, patriotism and glitz with country music. 
 Students of less-than-steely discipline admit that work sometimes cuts into study time and social life. Joe McCloud, 17, who was working with a student crew dragging lawnmowers when the heat index stood at 105, said that while the college mattered more because ''you worked for it,'' he didn't get much down time. 
 ''You're so tired,'' he said, ''you go to your room and sleep.'' 
 For some, the jobs are steppingstones toward a career. Annette Sain, a 1986 alumna, got interested as an undergraduate in work at the college's museum. Now she manages it. 
 And Tim Stroud, 19, of Hume, N.Y., who was tenderly hooking up Holsteins to the vacuum lines of milking machines, hopes to use his new skills to start an agricultural business. 
 He said he was glad that he would be able to spend the money he earned on buying cows, not paying off loans.

HEADLINE: Blair Asserts 'Sense of Possibility' After Meeting 2 Sides in Jerusalem as Mideast Peace Envoy

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 24 

 BODY:
Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, on his first visit to Jerusalem in his new post as international diplomat seeking to advance Mideast peace, declared after meeting Israeli and Palestinian leaders that he felt ''a sense of possibility.'' 
 He declined, however, as did those he met, to explain the basis for his optimism at a time of deep political divisions and weak regional leadership. 
 Mr. Blair is the new representative of the so-called Middle East quartet -- the United States, the European Union, Russia and the United Nations -- and reportedly plans to spend a week every month in the region.
 He met with Fatah and independent politicians in the Palestinian government but did not speak to the Hamas faction, elected by Palestinians and running Gaza and regarded as a terrorist group by Israel and the West. He may well make discreet contact with Hamas through independent intermediaries, however. 
 Officially, Mr. Blair's function is limited to helping the non-Hamas Palestinians in the West Bank create the institutions and security necessary for future statehood, and not to try to replace Washington as a mediator.
 The Palestinians say they hope that Mr. Blair's energy and his influence in Washington will expand his mandate and help push forward the larger peace process.
 Most of Mr. Blair's meetings with the Israelis have been about how to bolster Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president, who represents Fatah, in his effort to get rogue gunmen off the streets.
 That effort suffered somewhat overnight, when elite Presidential Guard units reportedly mistreated the daughter and son of the jailed Fatah leader Marwan Barghouti. According to an account in the Palestinian newspaper Al-Hayat al-Jadida, the guards stopped the daughter, Ruba Barghouti, in a car. The guardsmen laughed at her, she called relatives who came, and a fight occurred.
 Similar accounts of rudeness and criminal activity by Fatah-affiliated gunmen and security forces have regularly angered Palestinians.
 Also on Tuesday, the police broke up a fight between Fatah and Hamas students at An Najah University in Nablus. Three people were wounded by gunfire, including one who was shot in the head and was in critical condition, doctors said. Others were injured in beatings. The clash began when Hamas backers staged a sit-in and Fatah supporters demanded that they remove Hamas flags.
 The Israelis say they are trying to help Mr. Blair even though they regard large moves now as unlikely or dangerous.
 Mr. Olmert's new deputy prime minister, Haim Ramon, for example, is said to favor a gradual Israeli pullback from West Bank cities and a return to a situation closer to that in the West Bank before the last intifada broke out in 2000, when Israeli forces were not present in large areas. But Israel has built a separation barrier since then, and Israeli security officials have made clear that they regard a pullback of Israeli forces in the West Bank as perilous now.
 Mr. Ramon also is chairman of a committee on illegal settlement outposts in the West Bank, which Israeli officials insist means that some of them might be removed. The outposts are illegal under Israeli law. Israeli settlements in the West Bank are regarded as illegal by most of the international community.
 Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the Likud opposition, recommended to Mr. Blair specific economic incentives from private industry that could quickly improve the economy in the West Bank and create jobs, a Netanyahu aide said. Mr. Netanyahu warned against relying on the public sector, which has been slow and corrupt.
 He expressed agreement with Mr. Olmert that the time was not ripe now for talks on a peace settlement. He and Mr. Blair also discussed regional dangers like Lebanon and Iran, the aide said. Mr. Netanyahu said that unless Iran could be stopped from getting nuclear weapons, any Israeli-Palestinian progress would not be very important.
 ''This initial visit is a chance to listen, to learn and reflect,'' Mr. Blair said. ''There will be a time when the many questions that are very obvious should be answered, but I feel that this is not the moment at this point.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Pushing to Avoid A 'Do-Nothing' Label

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats celebrated the first minimum wage increase in a decade on Tuesday with a festive labor rally across from the Capitol. But they know they will have to accomplish considerably more to avoid the sort of do-nothing labels they hung on Republicans not too long ago
 ''It is not enough, but it is a great start,'' Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as she told the cheering crowd that the wage increase that took effect Tuesday was just one element of a middle-class economic program that includes college tuition help, expanded health care coverage and other emerging proposals. 
 Democrats hope to post more legislative victories in a few days, including enacting into law some of the remaining recommendations of the bipartisan Sept. 11 commission. They also want to pass a lobbying overhaul that was central to their campaign last year against the ''culture of corruption'' so they can start their late-summer recess on a high note.
 Republicans agree it would represent real progress if Democrats could get those measures through and tee up a few others for the fall. But they are withering in their criticism of what the Democratic majority has -- and has not -- done since taking power in January.
 ''They've wasted the first seven months by being excessively partisan and creating unnecessary, in my view, disputes with a pretty robust minority of 49,'' said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader.
 Democrats accuse Mr. McConnell and Congressional Republicans of deliberately trying to block the majority's initiatives so they can then pin the blame on the Democratic leadership that was put in place in the 2006 elections.
 ''They resent what happened last November, they're jealous of what happened last November, and they're mad as hell at what happened last November,'' Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said Tuesday. ''What they don't want to acknowledge is what we've been able to accomplish.''
 Mr. Reid and other Democrats say they are not getting credit for some of their achievements, including spending increases on veterans programs and military health care as well as agricultural assistance and Gulf Coast recovery aid included in an emergency spending bill. They also passed a budget and finished up spending bills left incomplete by Republicans last year and initiated a series of inquiries into Bush administration operations.
 Nonetheless, Democrats know that they need to send other significant legislation to President Bush's desk and cannot simply make the case for a continuing majority on the basis of a standoff with Mr. Bush over Iraq policy and reinvigorated oversight of the White House and Cabinet agencies. Americans United for Change, an activist group allied with Democrats, has even broadcast a television advertisement reminding voters of Democratic initiatives.
 The next 10 days will be critical. If Democrats can get antiterrorism legislation and a lobbying measure through to stand alongside the minimum wage increase, they will have fulfilled some of their main campaign commitments. An energy bill, children's health care coverage and college aid measures would be in the pipeline for September.
 Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois, the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, said he was optimistic that Democrats would get the results they needed. In the process, he said, they will show how Republicans failed when they ran Congress by shortchanging minimum wage earners, veterans and college students and by allowing corruption to fester.
 ''Those are all things that we have gotten done or will get done that they refused to do,'' Mr. Emanuel said.
 Republicans say that Democrats should not get their hopes too high about the days ahead. The final version of the antiterrorism legislation has been tied up in a dispute over legal immunity for those who report suspicious activity. The lobbying overhaul, whose details have not been disclosed, faces potential procedural obstacles.
 ''The way that they have proceeded, I am not sure that you can count on anything getting done, even those things that look like a fairly certain bet,'' said Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, a member of the Republican leadership.
 Mr. Kyl did offer an apology for calling this a do-nothing Congress, saying that because Democrats had sent Mr. Bush legislation naming 20 postal facilities, it should be called the post-office Congress.
 Republicans say that even if Democrats achieve their objectives, they will still fall short of the work of the Republican Congress in 2005, a comparable year between elections, when Republicans delivered energy and highway legislation just before leaving for August.
 And they say Democrats are lagging far behind on the annual spending bills, perhaps in an intentional effort to corner Mr. Bush and Republicans so they have to confront an all-encompassing year-end spending measure that would be difficult to veto. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Bush agreed to meet with Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Reid to try to head off a budget showdown set off by his objections to Democratic spending levels.
 What Republicans do not typically mention when discussing Democrats is that they were usually far behind on the spending bills when they ran Congress. They also do not like to point out that the energy and highway bills that passed in 2005 had been stalled for years and broke free only because their party was under pressure to produce some legislative victories.
 Facing those same kinds of pressure, Democrats are scrambling to produce as well.

HEADLINE: Weakness in Advertising Reduces Earnings at Times Company

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said yesterday that its second-quarter operating profit fell because of weakness in newspaper advertising but that net income doubled because of a gain from the sale of its television stations. The company also announced plans to cut operating costs by $230 million over the next two years.
 The company said that income from continuing operations fell 59 percent, to $22.1 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $53.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.7 percent, to $788.9 million. 
 Like the rest of the industry, The Times is struggling as ad dollars shift from newspapers to the Internet. Advertising fell at all of the company's publishing units, with a 5.3 percent decline at The New York Times Media Group, which includes the flagship paper and The International Herald Tribune. The advertising decline was 7.6 percent at the New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe and The Worcester Telegram & Gazette, and 11.6 percent at its regional newspapers.
 ''Classified advertising has been much more difficult than we expected going into the year,'' said James M. Follo, the chief financial officer of the Times Company. Mr. Follo cited weak demand for help wanted and real estate ads in particular, with the latter segment affected by a broader downturn in the national real estate market. On the other hand, ad spending in the financial services, cosmetics and packaged goods categories was more robust, Mr. Follo said.
 Revenue from online operations, which includes nytimes.com and About.com, jumped 23.4 percent, to $80.9 million, and the company is on track to generate at least 10 percent of overall revenue from the Internet this year. 
 Over all, net income at the Times Company rose to $118.4 million, or 82 cents a share, from $59.6 million, or 41 cents a share, largely as a result of a $94.3 million after-tax gain from the sale of nine network-affiliated television stations. A significant portion of the sale proceeds were used to reduce the company's debt, which fell to $965 million from $1.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2007.
 The company said that its earnings from continuing operations would have been 34 cents a share but for three special items -- a profit from the sale of WQEW-AM radio station in New York, a loss on the sale of its printing plant in Edison, N.J., and accelerated depreciation charges from the scheduled closing of the Edison plant.
 Operating profit at About.com, meanwhile, rose 16.4 percent, to $8.5 million, helped by ConsumerSearch.com, which the company acquired in May. 
 ''Activist investors criticized the About acquisition in 2005 but it's worked out,'' said Frederick Searby, an analyst with JPMorgan Securities. ''Internet is beginning to move the needle slightly.''
 Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of the Times Company, said, ''While our second-quarter results reflected the weakness in the print advertising market stemming from both secular and cyclical forces in our business, we continued to move aggressively on new product development, cost reduction and the rebalancing of our portfolio.'' She said that $130 million of the cost reduction would come in 2008, with the balance coming the next year. The cost reductions exclude the effects of inflation and one-time charges.
 Mr. Follo did not provide a detailed breakdown of where the savings would come from. But a portion will come from the consolidation of New York area printing operations at the paper's College Point plant in Queens, as well as the reduction next month in the width of The Times, The Boston Globe and regional papers, which should save $13 million annually. 
 Other costs cuts will come from the administrative, production, technology, distribution and circulation functions. Mr. Follo said, ''Our cost initiatives will be carefully managed so that they do not adversely affect the quality of our journalism, the smooth functioning of our operations or our ability to achieve our long-term goals.''
 Wall Street was pleased by the cost-cutting initiative. 
 ''The savings being talked about are much higher than even the most optimistic estimates,'' said Paul Ginocchio, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''The only negative is what it potentially says about the outlook for revenues over the next two years. If you're working that hard on the cost side, does it mean the outlook for revenue isn't good?''
 Mr. Searby of JPMorgan said: ''The big news is the cost cuts over the next two years. They're finally biting the bullet and adjusting to the reality of an accelerating, secular decline in print.''
 In a conference call with analysts after the earnings announcement, Ms. Robinson said Internet advertising growth at The Times Media Group slowed in July. But she added The Boston Globe's ad outlook will most likely improve during the second half of the year as new shopping malls open in Natick and Foxboro, Mass. Other bright spots include advertising by competing banks as well as new branding efforts by telecommunications companies like Verizon and AT&T. 
 Over the last year, Ms. Robinson said, the Times Company sold about $700 million in assets. Those sales, combined with strong cash flow, ''gave us the confidence to raise the dividend 31 percent.'' 
 Shares of the Times Company rose 1.7 percent, or 39 cents, to $23.61.
 The earnings report comes as other media giants struggle to adapt to the new landscape. Last week, the board of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, recommended the company accept a buyout bid from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The Bancroft family, which owns a controlling stake in Dow Jones, is evaluating Mr. Murdoch's $5 billion offer and a final decision is expected within days.

HEADLINE: Aid From China Builds an Ally in East Timor

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS

DATELINE: DILI, East Timor 

 BODY:
It looks like a pleasant place to conduct affairs of state: a broad, palm-fringed compound by the side of the sea with reflecting pools, a rock garden and fluttering flags.
 It is the future Foreign Ministry of East Timor, as depicted on a large billboard at the gate of a construction site, and it is a gift from the Chinese government.
 Together with a new presidential palace that is also being built by the Chinese, it will be one of the most impressive buildings in this low-rise capital. 
 The projects are the most visible sign of a growing Chinese presence in this threadbare little country with few natural resources and only marginal geographical advantages to tempt a great power.
 ''The Chinese government thinks that as good partners, good neighbors and good friends of Timor-Leste, we are obliged to give a helping hand,'' said the Chinese ambassador, Su Jian, in an interview, using the country's official name.
 China's friendly stance is part of a broad diplomatic and economic policy throughout the region to which some people give the gentle description ''soft power.'' Most analysts say East Timor seems to be of interest less as a prize in its own right than as a natural extension of China's energetic courtship of its neighbors in Southeast Asia.
 On the hunt for natural resources and working to create a friendly neighborhood as it develops its own economy, China for the past decade has been creating a web of bilateral and multilateral partnerships that bind its neighbors to it.
 It plays down any self-interest as it increases trade and aid throughout Southeast Asia.
 ''In a region where there is a historic fear of China, they are promoting the idea that China is a friendly partner,'' said Joshua Kurlantzick, the author of a new book called ''Charm Offensive: How China's Soft Power Is Transforming the World.'' 
 ''And they do see these countries as far more strategic than the United States does, and so they are willing to spend resources on them,'' he said.
 In the longer term, some analysts say, China may want to create its own sphere of influence, elbowing aside the United States in the region. Washington's preoccupation today with wars and terrorist threats has left inviting openings for China's advances in Southeast Asia.
 ''They have been expanding their influence and building their links to governments in a very careful, sophisticated way,'' said Daljit Singh, a regional policy analyst with the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies in Singapore.
 ''They are aware that in the past there was a good deal of suspicion of China,'' Mr. Singh said, ''and their soft approach is designed to appease, to increase their footprint and their influence through trade agreements, free trade offers, strategic partnerships.''
 China is the leading trading partner and investor in Myanmar (formerly Burma) and Cambodia, where it wields considerable political influence. It recently stepped directly into America's sphere of influence with giant projects in the Philippines, including an aqueduct and major highways. It is an increasing presence in Thailand and Indonesia.
 East Timor, in its very small way, is part of this picture as China cultivates relationships with the poorer nations of Asia and the Pacific.
 It is a former Portuguese colony of just one million people that broke away in 1999 from 24 years of Indonesian occupation and has been struggling to stand on its own feet ever since. A large portion of the country is unemployed, about 20,000 are in need of food aid and 100,000 were displaced from their homes by a wave of violence last year.
 China was the first nation to recognize the country when it became an independent state in 2002.
 ''The leaders of Timor-Leste regard China like an elder brother and a most reliable friend,'' Mr. Su, the Chinese ambassador, said. 
 Last year, the total import and export volume between the countries was only $13.6 million, according to the ambassador.
 But China is building barracks and providing uniforms for the country's small military, bringing in medical teams and police officers, training civil servants and farmers, and inviting students and official delegations to Beijing.
 ''China's experience is very rich in helping small and developing countries in Africa,'' said Mr. Su, who has served in four previous Portuguese-speaking postings, including Angola and Guinea-Bissau.
 ''The Chinese government knows exactly what these countries need and also can provide them with very pragmatic skills and technology,'' he said. ''It is very suitable to development of these small countries.''
 East Timor does have an oil field, and its location on the sea lanes between Indonesia and Australia could be of interest. The oil is in the Timor Gap, where East Timor and Australia have worked out a formula for sharing revenues.
 East Timor's oil money is being held in a government fund for the future to avoid the economic disruptions such a windfall can cause, particularly in a country with few institutions or trained people able to put it to good use.
 Mr. Su said that the Chinese oil giant PetroChina had been given a contract to conduct an onshore seismic survey and that China might become involved in offshore oil field development.
 Beyond this, China's emerging presence in a country whose dominant players at the moment are Portugal and Australia has caused speculation among local analysts and in the regional press.
 The ambassador displayed amusement at the idea that China could have larger ambitions in this area.
 ''I once talked with Timorese friends about many articles and stories that try to give China strategic interests in Timor-Leste,'' Mr. Su said. ''When my Timorese friends notice these groundless exaggerations, my Timorese friends all laugh at that.''

HEADLINE: Siemens Makes 2 Deals to Recast Its Product Mix After a Scandal

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 25 

 BODY:
Siemens announced two multibillion-dollar deals on Wednesday as part of its new chief executive's plan to retool the company, which has been tinged by scandal.
 Siemens will sell its automotive parts division to another German company, the tire maker Continental, for 11.4 billion euros ($15.6 billion) and acquire Dade Behring Holdings, a maker of medical diagnostic products based in Deerfield, Ill., for $7 billion. The deal for Dade is worth $77 a share, a 38 percent premium over the closing price of its stock on Tuesday.
 Siemens said the deals would further its goal of recasting its sprawling product portfolio as it focuses on four core areas of energy and environmental technology, public infrastructure equipment, automation technology and health care. Dade Behring's products are used in testing for heart disease, cancer and blood disorders. Last year, Siemens bought the diagnostics business of Bayer HealthCare for $5.3 billion and Diagnostics Products for $1.86 billion. 
 The acquisition of Dade Behring is the first significant move taken by the new chief executive, Peter Loscher, who took over the company from Klaus Kleinfeld this summer. He has said a prime task will be to simplify the Siemens structure, which contributed to what German authorities investigating the company think was a chronic use of bribes to win contracts.
 ''We will make Siemens more focused, less complex and faster,'' Mr. Loscher said in a statement on Wednesday. The company said it would also cooperate with the World Bank, which is investigating accusations that the company charged excessive fees for a power generation project in Pakistan financed by the bank during the 1990s.
 The automotive sale will result in a drastically slimmed down Siemens, which produces power generation equipment, automation systems and light bulbs, among many other products.
 That deal will also vault Continental, which until recently was losing money, into the front ranks of the auto parts industry, a business in which much consolidation is expected as companies seek to reduce costs and resist pressure from automakers to lower prices.
 Continental had 14.9 billion euros ($20.4 billion) in sales last year and will acquire a Siemens division, known as Siemens VDO Automotive, that had nearly 10 billion euros in sales. The deal is Continental's largest acquisition in its 136-year history, and the company will rank among the top five auto-parts makers in the world.
 But with size also comes the burden of integrating Siemens VDO into Continental.
 ''We are well aware of the magnitude of the task,'' Manfred Wennemer, the chief executive of Continental, said in a statement. Continental said that it had no plans to shed its tire business nor its rubber division to finance the acquisition. It has 4 billion euros ($5.4 billion) set aside for purchases and said it had secured ''attractive financing.'' It also said it might issue more stock.
 The sale of Siemens VDO, which Siemens had planned since January, took an unexpected twist over the last month as Continental, and then the American automotive supplier TRW, signaled interest in buying it.
 Siemens had planned an initial public offering in which it would retain the majority share. The German union IG Metall had advocated this step, figuring that it was the best way to guarantee the 53,000 jobs at Siemens VDO, of which about 19,000 are in Germany. But the offering would probably have raised up to 2 billion euros less than the sale, analysts said.
 On Wednesday, Siemens also reported that net income for the quarter ended June 30 rose 54 percent, to 2.1 billion euros, compared with 1.34 billion euros in the period a year earlier. The results in the latest quarter were affected by the transfer of assets to a joint venture with Nokia. Revenue rose 8 percent, to 20.2 billion euros ($27.7 billion).
 The profit numbers came in slightly less than expected, and its shares fell by 6 percent, to 99.30 euros in Frankfurt.

HEADLINE: June Sales of Existing Homes Fell 3.8%, More Than Expected

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, July 25 (AP) -- Sales of existing homes fell in June for a fourth consecutive month, further evidence that housing troubles are far from over.
 The National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday that sales of existing homes dropped by 3.8 percent in June, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.75 million units. That is the slowest sales pace since November 2002, and the decline was about twice what had been expected.
 The median price of an existing home edged up to $230,100, 0.3 percent more than a year ago. The median is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less. 
 It was the first price gain in 11 months. Analysts, however, said that they expected prices to fall further because of the high number of unsold homes.
 For June, the median price of a single-family home rose by 0.1 percent and the price of a condominium increased by 2.6 percent when compared with the period a year ago.
 ''With inventories still way out of line, unless prices fall a lot more, the housing market will not turn around any time soon,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors.
 In a separate report Wednesday, the Federal Reserve said the economy expanded in June and early July. But most Fed regions reported further declines in residential construction and real estate activity.
 The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, told Congress last week that he expected housing to be a less severe drag on growth in the coming months. Many private economists are not as optimistic. They note that existing-home sales fell at an annual rate of 28 percent from April through June, the steepest in the downturn.
 ''Housing is contracting at an accelerating pace, taking out with a vengeance the brief stabilization at the turn of the year,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, a private forecasting firm.
 The housing slump follows five boom years when sales of new and existing homes set records and home prices soared by double-digit rates. Since late 2005, sales have slumped as mortgage rates rose and prospective buyers balked at selling prices.
 Those problems have worsened in recent months because of troubles in the subprime mortgage market, which offered loans to buyers with spotty credit histories. Rising mortgage defaults are adding more homes onto an oversupplied market.
 Countrywide Financial, one of the largest mortgage lenders, reported a sharp decline in second-quarter profit because of an increasing number of loans going bad. That sent jitters through financial markets and led to a 226-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average Tuesday. Investors are worried that the problems in subprime lending could drag down the economy.
 The declines in existing-home sales in June covered all parts of the country. Sales fell by 7.3 percent in the Northeast, 6.8 percent in the West, 2.8 percent in the Midwest and 1.7 percent in the South.
 David F. Seiders, chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, said the unexpected weakness in recent months had caused him to shave his forecast for housing construction this year. It now shows a fall of 23 percent after a 14 percent drop in 2006.
 Mr. Seiders said that he expected only a 2 percent rise in 2008 and that the weakness would last longer than in previous housing dips.
 The supply of unsold homes dropped by 4.2 percent in June, to 4.2 million units. That level, however, still was seen as a drag on the market. Some analysts said part of the decline occurred because disappointed owners pulled their homes off the market or decided to rent rather than sell.
 The Realtors are forecasting that sales of existing homes will fall by 5.6 percent this year and prices will drop by 1.4 percent. That would be the first annual price decline based on records that the Realtors have kept for more than four decades.

HEADLINE: Operating Profit Falls at Times Co.

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The New York Times Company said today that its second-quarter operating profit fell because of weakness in newspaper advertising but that net income doubled because of a gain from the sale of its television stations.
 Highlighting the challenge faced by the entire newspaper industry as ad dollars shift away from newspapers to the Internet, the company also said it plans to cut operating costs by $230 million over the next two years.
 The company said that income from continuing operations fell 59 percent, to $22.1 million, or 15 cents a share, compared with $53.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue fell 3.7 percent, to $788.9 million. 
 Advertising fell at all of the company's publishing units, with a 5.3 percent decline at The New York Times Media Group, which includes the flagship paper and The International Herald Tribune. The drop was 7.6 percent at the New England Media Group, which includes The Boston Globe and The Worcester Telegram & Gazette, and 11.6 percent at its regional newspapers.
 ''Classified advertising has been much more difficult than we expected going into the year,'' said James M. Follo, the chief financial officer of the Times Company. Mr. Follo cited weak demand for help wanted and real estate ads in particular, with the latter segment affected by a broader downturn in the national real estate market. On the other hand, ad spending in the financial services, cosmetics and packaged goods categories was more robust, Mr. Follo said.
 Net income rose to $118.4 million, or 82 cents a share, from $59.6 million, or 41 cents a share, largely as a result of a $94.3 million after-tax gain from the sale of nine network-affiliated television stations. A significant portion of the sale proceeds were used to reduce the company's debt, which fell to $965 million from $1.4 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2007.
 The company said that its earnings per share from continuing operations would have been 34 cents but for three special items -- a profit from the sale of its WQEW-AM radio station in New York, a loss on the sale of its printing plant in Edison, N.J., and accelerated depreciation charges from the scheduled closing of the Edison plant.
 Revenue from online operations jumped 23.4 percent, to $80.9 million, and the company is on track to generate at least 10 percent of overall revenue from the Internet this year. 
 Operating profit at About.com, meanwhile, rose 16.4 percent, to $8.5 million, helped by ConsumerSearch.com, which the Times Company acquired in May. ''Activist investors criticized the About acquisition in 2005 but it's worked out,'' said Fred Searby, an analyst with J.P. Morgan. ''Internet is beginning to move the needle slightly.''
 ''While our second-quarter results reflected the weakness in the print advertising market stemming from both secular and cyclical forces in our business, we continued to move aggressively on new product development, cost reduction and the rebalancing of our portfolio,'' said Janet L. Robinson, the chief executive of the Times Company. She said that $130 million of the cost reduction would come in 2008, with the balance coming the following year. The cost reductions exclude the effects of inflation and one-time charges.
 Mr. Follo did not provide a detailed breakdown of where the savings would come from. But a portion will come from the consolidation of New York-area printing operations at the paper's College Point plant in Queens, as well as the reduction next month of the width of the The Times, The Boston Globe and regional papers, which should save $13 million annually. 
 Other costs cuts will come from the administrative, production, technology, distribution and circulation functions. Mr. Follo said ''our cost initiatives will be carefully managed so that they do not adversely affect the quality of our journalism, the smooth functioning of our operations or our ability to achieve our long-term goals.''
 Wall Street was pleased by the cost-cutting initiative. ''The savings being talked about are much higher than even the most optimistic estimates,'' said Paul Ginocchio, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. ''The only negative is what it potentially says about the outlook for revenues over the next two years. If you're working that hard on the cost side, does it mean the outlook for revenue isn't good?''
 Mr. Searby added: ''The big news is the cost cuts over the next two years. They're finally biting the bullet and adjusting to the reality of an accelerating, secular decline in print.''
 In a conference call with analysts after the earnings announcement, Ms. Robinson said Internet advertising growth at the Times media group slowed in July. But she added The Boston Globe's ad outlook will likely improve during the second half of the year as new shopping malls open in Natick and Foxboro, Mass. Other bright spots include advertising by competing banks as well as new branding efforts by telecom companies like Verizon and AT&T. 
 Over the last year, Ms. Robinson said, the Times Company sold about $700 million in assets. Those sales, combined with strong cash flow, ''gave us the confidence to raise the dividend 31 percent.'' Shares of the Times Company rose nearly 2 percent, to $23.68.
 The earnings report comes as other media giants struggle to adapt to the new landscape. Last week, the board of Dow Jones, publisher of The Wall Street Journal, recommended the company accept a buyout bid from Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The Bancroft family, which owns a controlling stake in Dow Jones, is currently evaluating Mr. Murdoch's $5 billion offer and a final decision is expected within days.

HEADLINE: The New Democratic Scapegoat

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama are both serious foreign policy thinkers. So that makes it all the more bizarre that in one important area of foreign policy they both would drag this country backward.
 That's trade, particularly the effort to bash China as a scapegoat for our economic problems.
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have signed on as co-sponsors of a bill -- the latest resurrection of anti-China legislation -- that could target China for punitive duties unless it revalues its currency. The China-U.S. relationship is the most important relationship in the world, and this bill would risk trade battles that would disrupt it for many years to come. 
 It's precisely the kind of cowboy diplomacy that would infuriate the commentariat if it were coming from President Bush. Yet the president, while reckless in most areas of foreign policy, has been steadfast on trade and his handling of China.
 The China bill that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have co-sponsored would antagonize ordinary Chinese. It would set a precedent for politicizing trade disputes. And it marks a betrayal of President Bill Clinton's outstanding legacy on economic issues.
 For eight years, Mr. Clinton tugged Democrats away from protectionist impulses and toward pro-growth and pro-trade policies that elevated America's standard of living. Now the Democratic Party as a whole is retreating from that free trade legacy.
 Congressional Democrats have been cool or petulant toward a series of free trade agreements in Latin America. This month House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and three other top Democrats bluntly declared that ''our legislative priorities do not include the renewal of fast track authority'' to negotiate trade agreements. In the trade arena, Congressional Democrats are gratuitously angering our allies in much the way that Dick Cheney has already done in security affairs.
 Trade is a particularly useful prism through which to look at politicians, for it offers a litmus test of political courage and economic leadership. That's because there are no political benefits to a candidate who supports free trade, but considerable benefits to the country. 
 There are a couple of grim possibilities here. One is that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama really believe in stepping away from the Bill Clinton legacy on trade. The other possibility, perhaps even sadder, is that they are faux China-bashers who stake out myopic positions for political calculations, even if their heart isn't in those positions. 
 So maybe Democrats are only seasonal protectionists, enjoying a useful weapon against Republicans in the 2008 campaign. After all, Mr. Clinton himself was a China trade hawk when he ran for president in 1992 but then reversed himself in office -- so there's hope that Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama would likewise show more maturity in the White House.
 Yet all this is dispiriting to anyone who yearns for leadership from the next president. Once in office, Mr. Clinton and Al Gore bravely used the bully pulpit to educate the public about the benefits of trade and to challenge those like Ross Perot, who appealed to Know-Nothing nativists. It would be a tragedy for all the world if the next Democratic president followed Mr. Perot rather than Mr. Clinton.
 It's true, of course, that the Chinese yuan is undervalued. That's bad for China, and it's one of the imbalances (along with our own addiction to debt) that is disruptive for the global economy. China should sharply stimulate domestic consumption and nudge the yuan upward faster than it has been.
 But this legislation vastly exaggerates the impact on the U.S. from the yuan value. China's manufacturing juggernaut hurts Mexico and other countries that peddle cheap shoes and shirts, but it has much less effect on American workers. Meanwhile, that flood of Chinese imports helps low-income Americans by lowering the cost of essentials like clothing.
 Look, there are valid reasons for Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama to stand up to China -- not least China's disgraceful policy of supplying Sudan with the weapons used to slaughter people in Darfur. But a legislative bludgeon to adjust the yuan exchange rate could hurt both countries.
 There'll be a tendency among liberals to excuse Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama for pandering on trade, because they are sensible on so many other issues.
 But when we see candidates as smart and sophisticated as Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, we should demand more from them than Ross Perot-style populism. And it would be a disaster if eight years of reckless gunboat diplomacy in the political/military realm were followed by reckless cowboy diplomacy in trade.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A Good Part-Time Job

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Judith Warner's July 24 column, ''The Full-Time Blues,'' captures the essential problems faced by workers who desire part-time employment. 
 Yes, part-time work is desired by 60 percent of working mothers, as the Pew Research Center states. Adequate compensation, benefits, health care and flexibility are the major stumbling blocks for many to pursue this alternative work arrangement.
 The next glut of workers facing ''The Full-Time Blues'' are potential retirees. Many are stuck in the workplace longer than they desire for the same reasons. If other countries can make it, work why can't we?

 The writer is a career counselor and coach and the author of ''The Savvy Part-Time Professional.'' 
 To the Editor:
 Judith Warner's column raises important points about national priorities for working parents. But pigeonholing this as a woman's work force issue is both dismissive of working fathers and limits the possible solutions for families. 
 For more than seven years, my wife and I have both worked slightly reduced schedules to have more time with our young children. I'm home on Mondays, and she's home on Fridays. We have both chosen and been allowed by our employers to work schedules that have varied from 75 to 90 percent of full-time employment as our daughters have grown. 
 By both of us working about four days a week, we have maintained benefits and not forsaken significant salary. Admittedly, we both have enlightened and, unfortunately, unique employers. But the more frequently that mothers and fathers ask to work reduced schedules, the more accepted this arrangement will be in our society. Tom Salyers
 Takoma Park, Md., July 24, 2007
 To the Editor:
 Judith Warner is pessimistic about passing any legislation soon that would address the systematic discrimination faced by part-time workers. Yet such discrimination can be challenged under existing legislation. The Equal Pay Act has been used successfully to challenge lower pay for a female engineer who was paid less per hour than her male colleagues just because she worked part time. 
 And while there is no successful case law in the United States challenging the blatant discrimination of part-time workers under Title VII, the legal framework used in Europe to pave the way for the equal treatment of part-timers, the legal theory of disparate impact or indirect discrimination, was directly imported from the United States. 
 Using this approach, excluding part-timers from paid sick leave, for example, constitutes disparate impact because, given that the clear majority of part-timers are women, women are disproportionately disadvantaged by such a measure. 
 In view of much reputable research showing the economic benefits of providing paid leave, business costs should no longer be a justifiable reason for such discrimination. It has always puzzled me as a European that in a culture that is so focused on litigation this clear aspect of discrimination goes ignored.

 To the Editor:
 Does Judith Warner really think that the ''interesting question'' to ask these days in regard to mother's work and family decisions is why mothers aren't getting part-time work? After decades of articles criticizing mothers on all sides of the ''mommy wars,'' are we not ready to ask: Why aren't fathers getting part-time work? 
 Certainly, there is evidence to suggest that a growing number of fathers are now choosing to stay home or work part time to help care for their children. Perhaps when society begins to see the care of children as an issue facing all parents, we will be able to move beyond a perception that mothers are the only ones with the problems. Katy Roche

 To the Editor:
 One way to broaden the support for better part-time employment conditions is to appeal to the interests of the aging baby boomers, who facing retirement, might appreciate the opportunity to work part time without losing benefits or damaging their 401(k) financial plans.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Asks Drivers What Their Time Is Worth

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Jonathan Miller contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For legislators, the calculus is usually pretty simple: Raising tolls carries the risk of political suicide. But what if drivers say they are willing to pay more to put the region's bridges and tunnels in their rearview mirrors faster?
 That is what the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is trying to find out in a survey it mailed last week to 38,000 drivers who regularly use the Lincoln Tunnel. The 17-page questionnaire asks them to rate options that include paying fees of up to $30 to ride in a high-occupancy lane that would run eastbound for 2.5 miles from the New Jersey Turnpike to the tunnel. 
 That option received tentative approval from some drivers.
 ''I'd be willing to part with more money to get in with less traffic,'' said Mike Kessler, a retired banker from West New York, N.J., who was putting air in the tires of his BMW at a service station in Weehawken yesterday.
 In the survey, which was reported yesterday in The Record of Bergen County, drivers are asked to weigh the fees for riding in a high-occupancy lane with buses and carpoolers against crawling in the regular lanes, riding public transportation or joining a carpool. Those willing to pay the fee would share the express lane with buses and cars carrying three or more people.
 Currently, the high-occupancy lane on Route 495 is limited to buses and does not carry an additional toll. 
 The federally financed survey, which is costing about $1 million, is part of a broader study aimed at finding ways to relieve congestion heading into Manhattan via the Lincoln Tunnel, where traffic has grown by 1.6 million vehicles, about 8 percent, in the past decade. According to the New Jersey Department of Transportation, eastbound traffic during the peak morning hours is expected to grow by 14 percent from 2002 to 2030. 
 ''The current exclusive bus lane is already at capacity, so the question is how to get more buses into the city,'' said Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for the Port Authority. He added that 1,700 buses carrying more than 62,000 commuters used the exclusive bus lane each weekday, about half the people who travel through the Lincoln Tunnel in those hours.
 The study will not be completed until the end of 2008, and any construction to accommodate the new lane would take several more years.
 The Port Authority is not the only agency reassessing tolls. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority recently sent out requests for consultants to bid on two studies, including one that would evaluate the merits of charging tolls in both directions on the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Currently, tolls are collected only westbound, on the Staten Island side.
 These moves are part of a broader effort by transportation agencies to gradually redefine how they use tolls, not only to help pay for construction and maintenance of their highways, bridges and tunnels, but also as a device to try to regulate the number of vehicles on the road.
 ''If we want to sustain our economy, we have to look at how we distribute traffic,'' said Robert E. Paaswell, the executive director of the University Transportation Research Center at City College of New York. ''We've reached the point that we don't have adequate transportation supply to meet demand, and if it gets too crowded, people will move to Connecticut or Florida, which we don't want.''
 While transportation engineers have for years looked at ways to calibrate tolls to match the traffic, the advent of technology like E-ZPass has made the endeavor more practical. But the real question is how much people are inclined to pay for exclusive roads that in theory will shave many minutes off their trips.
 In one instance, drivers were asked in the survey if they would prefer to pay $30 to save 20 minutes getting to and through the Lincoln Tunnel; leave things the way they are; join a carpool that would save 17 minutes but cost $9; or ride a train to Manhattan for $8 and take an additional five minutes.
 Stephen Sigmund, chief of government affairs at the Port Authority, said the agency would not charge $30 at any of its crossings. Rather, the hypothetical figure was meant to find out what customers ''might be willing to do in the future to help speed their commute and more frequently utilize mass transit.''
 Yesterday, drivers were on the fence. Altef Hussain, 40, a driver with a Manhattan car service, said he made frequent trips between Manhattan and Newark Liberty International Airport.
 ''For me, it will help out,'' he said. ''The customer pays for it. If I make it an extra half-hour early, I make 10 to 15 bucks extra.''
 But Johason Perez, who lives in Queens and drives to work in West Orange, N.J., said that any change in pricing would hurt him, even if it shaved off time. ''That'd kill my budget,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Manhattan: Rights Group Seeks Police Records

BYLINE: By AL BAKER

 BODY:
The New York Civil Liberties Union has filed a public records request asking the Police Department to turn over computerized data on stop-and-frisk activities so it can analyze the role that race plays in such street stops. Asked if the department would comply, its spokesman, Paul J. Browne, pointed out that the department had already turned over reports on its raw data to the City Council, as required by law. The reports showed a fivefold increase in the number of stop-and-frisks from 2002 to last year, with more than half of them involving black residents. The civil liberties group wants to analyze each of the 508,540 street stops last year, as well as those from the first half of this year. The department commissioned the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit organization, to conduct an independent assessment of the stops, Mr. Browne said. He added, ''In terms of race, the data showed that stops were consistent proportionately with descriptions provided by victims of violent crime.'' The Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, said yesterday that the Council expected the police to provide the data to citizens and that if they did not, the Council would ''take appropriate action.''

HEADLINE: Bechtel Meets Goals on Fewer Than Half of Its Iraq Rebuilding Projects, U.S. Study Finds

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
One of the largest American contractors working in Iraq, Bechtel National, met its original objectives on fewer than half of the projects it received as part of a $1.8 billion reconstruction contract, while most of the rest were canceled, reduced in scope or never completed as designed, federal investigators have found in a report released yesterday.
 But the report, by the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, an independent agency, places a large share of the blame for the failures on the government overseers at the United States Agency for International Development who administered the contract. The aid agency assigned just two people in Iraq to oversee the giant contract, which included some 24 major projects and 150 subcontractors and stipulated that all invoices be approved or denied in just 10 days.
 The report is the first of a planned series of audits of Western contractors that have received large slices of the roughly $40 billion in American taxpayer money that has been spent on the troubled program to rebuild Iraq. Previous audits have looked at individual projects but never the performance across Iraq of a single contractor. 
 Stuart W. Bowen Jr., who heads the special inspector general's office, said the United States government clearly shared responsibility with the company for the project failures.
 ''I would say there's fault on both sides,'' Mr. Bowen said in an interview yesterday. He added that neither the aid agency nor the United States Army Corps of Engineers, which also oversaw aspects of the contract, ever came close to filling all their staff positions in Iraq.
 ''This isn't so much an indictment of Bechtel as it is a criticism of the system,'' said Stephen Ellis, a vice president at Taxpayers for Common Sense in Washington. ''Those two individuals overseeing over a billion dollars in contracting -- it seems to me they may deserve a medal, but they shouldn't have had to do that,'' Mr. Ellis said.
 While the new audit is a sometimes scathing look at landfills that were never dug, fiber-optic networks never completed and sewage treatment facilities that never worked as designed, there is also praise for the work Bechtel did complete, including the installation of two huge electrical generators at the Baghdad South Power Plant and the rehabilitation of a sewer system in the Zafaraniya section of the capital.
 ''It's actually quite positive, looking at it from a Bechtel perspective, in a lot of cases,'' said Bill Shoaf, program director for the company's Iraq infrastructure program. Although only 10 of the 24 job orders met their original objectives, Mr. Shoaf said, ''Conditions change and priorities change and customers want change.''
 Bechtel was one of the first American contractors working in Iraq after the invasion, and it received an early reconstruction contract worth about $1 billion in April 2003. Later that year, Congress approved a much larger reconstruction program, worth $18.3 billion, to rebuild Iraq's water, sanitation, electrical, oil, transportation and telecommunications sectors. In January 2004, the company received a contract for $1.8 billion of the rebuilding project to carry out some of that work.
 But by April of 2004, the main Iraq insurgency had broken out, greatly complicating reconstruction efforts. And at the same time, American government agencies overseeing the effort struggled to fill staff positions. The aid agency filled only 170 of 251 authorized positions in Iraq, the inspector general's report says, while the Army Corps filled just 18 of 37 positions it had created to support the agency in the country.
 Adding further turmoil to the program was the decision by the United States to shift billions of dollars from reconstruction to arming and training Iraqi security forces, causing dozens of projects to be cut back or canceled. Even on the projects that survived, contractors like Bechtel subcontracted much of the work to companies that in turn subcontracted parts of the work to other companies, and so on, making oversight of progress in a dangerous, war-torn country nightmarish at times.
 The inspector general's report is careful to point out that even under these conditions, Bechtel was successful on a number of projects, and a few -- including a $22 million water plant -- actually came in at under the expected cost. ''In other instances, however,'' the report says, ''millions of dollars were spent and requirements were not met, reduced or clearly established.''
 Among the work that failed was a huge project to add desperately needed electrical output to the Musayyib power plant, south of Baghdad. Originally budgeted at $23 million, the project ran into problems with American subcontractors, the Iraqi Electricity Ministry and deteriorating local security. Finally, only $6.6 million was paid out before the project ended, and even then, the report says, there is no clear indication of whether anything actually improved at the plant.
 ''Thus, it is difficult to establish the value of the product received for the $6.6 million cost of this job order,'' the report says.
 Perhaps even more telling was a Baghdad landfill project originally budgeted at $14 million but never dug, even after $4 million had been spent on the project. Highly trumpeted by the American authorities in Iraq, the project was to be something entirely new for a country never known for the quality of its sanitation facilities. The report says in dry language that the project was canceled after three sites were considered and rejected ''because of land ownership issues and security concerns.''
 Mr. Shoaf, of Bechtel, said the history of the project was considerably more colorful. The first site considered was near Abu Ghraib, an area that turned out to be a cauldron of insurgent activity, in addition to containing a notorious prison. The site also happened to be riddled with unexploded military ordnance and was abandoned, Mr. Shoaf said. 
 Work began on a second site on the outskirts of Baghdad, but the local Iraqi governing council ordered that the landfill be moved elsewhere, he said. Finally, the project turned to a third Baghdad site where, as it happened, the water table was too high for a landfill to be excavated.
 So, Mr. Shoaf said, the project was dropped and the equipment that had been purchased was turned over to the Iraqi government. By that time, according to the inspector general's report, $4 million had been spent.
 Army Major Faces Bribery Charges 
 An Army major is facing federal charges that in 2005 he accepted millions of dollars in bribes from contractors doing business with the Pentagon in Iraq and Kuwait.
 The Justice Department said yesterday that the major, John Cockerham, 41, of San Antonio, either awarded or controlled the contracts. He has been charged with bribery, money laundering and conspiracy. 
 He and his wife, Melissa, were charged Sunday. His sister Carolyn Blake, 44, of Sunnyvale, Tex., was charged Tuesday. His wife and his sister were charged with conspiracy.

HEADLINE: House Resolution Rejects Permanent Bases in Iraq

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25 

 BODY:
The House voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday to bar permanent United States military installations in Iraq as lawmakers readied for yet another clash over a Democratic demand to withdraw combat troops from the conflict.
 By a vote of 399 to 24, the House adopted a resolution that would limit federal spending intended ''to establish any military installation or base for the purpose of providing for the permanent stationing of United States Armed Forces in Iraq or to exercise United States economic control of the oil resources of Iraq.''
 Democrats said the measure, the latest in a series of politically tinged war votes, was needed to make it clear that America had no plan for a permanent military presence in Iraq -- a fear they said was fueling some attacks on American troops and building the insurgent resistance. 
 ''We must soundly reject the vision of an open-ended occupation as bad policy that undermines the safety of our troops and recognize it for what it is: another recruiting poster for terrorists,'' said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California and an author of the proposal.
 House Republicans offered little resistance, saying the plan essentially reflected current law and Bush administration policy. But they criticized Democrats for what they said was meaningless legislation since the administration had not called for permanent bases.
 ''The bill brought to the floor by the majority today represents yet another political stunt, and an intellectually dishonest one at that, because the United States has never proposed establishing a permanent base in Iraq or anywhere else,'' said Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the Republican leader. All of the plan's opponents were Republicans.
 The vote came as Representative John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, chairman of the subcommittee that sets Pentagon spending and a leading Democratic critic of the war, indicated he would try, as early as next week, to add a new withdrawal plan to the annual military spending bill.
 Under Mr. Murtha's draft proposal, President Bush would be required to present Congress with a classified plan for bringing regional stability in the Middle East and within 60 days begin ''an immediate and orderly redeployment of U.S. armed forces from Iraq.'' 
 The withdrawal would begin with troops that have been there longer than a year. The proposal, which also calls for an estimate of the American presence in the region for the next five years, does not set a deadline for removing the troops, though Mr. Murtha estimated it would take more than a year.
 Mr. Murtha predicted that the central showdown over the withdrawal plan would come in September, after the Congressional recess. He said he had indications that more Republicans and some in the military might be ready at that time to rally behind his latest proposal. 
 ''When you get to September, this is history, this is when we are going to have a real confrontation with the president,'' Mr. Murtha told reporters. ''I see signals that things are going to get worked out.''
 But House Republicans were likely for now to oppose Mr. Murtha's plan as a misguided Congressional infringement on the president's powers as commander in chief. And many Democrats prefer an end-date for the withdrawal.
 Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House speaker, said lawmakers should expect repeated votes on Iraq policy, and she criticized Mr. Bush for citing, in a speech on Tuesday, Al Qaeda as the chief reason for keeping troops there.
 ''Just when you think you have seen it all, just when you think you have heard it all, the president mentioned Al Qaeda nearly 100 times to justify his course of action in Iraq,'' said Ms. Pelosi, who said Democrats were prepared to vote every day on Iraq policy if necessary.
 In the Senate, where lawmakers have put off their dispute over Iraq for now, senior members resurrected popular parts of a Pentagon policy measure that stalled last week in the stalemate over the Democratic push for a withdrawal timetable.
 In a bipartisan decision, the Senate approved provisions intended to bring improvements in active-duty and veterans health care and provide a 3.5 percent military pay raise as of Oct. 1. The remaining elements are not expected to resurface in the Senate until September.

HEADLINE: Defense Minister Is Replaced As Brazil's Air Crisis Grows

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, July 25 

 BODY:
President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Wednesday replaced the country's defense minister, whose duties include oversight of civil aviation. The move came eight days after the deadliest air disaster in Brazilian history.
 With the fallout spreading from last week's accident at Sao Paulo's Congonhas airport, Mr. da Silva said he was replacing Defense Minister Waldir Pires with Nelson Jobim, a highly respected former Supreme Court president and justice minister. Mr. da Silva said at Mr. Jobim's swearing-in ceremony that Mr. Pires had resigned voluntarily, but a government news release said he had been asked to do so.
 ''From this moment on, we are going to do what has to be done,'' the president said at the ceremony. He added, ''And spend what has to be spent.'' 
 Pressure had been mounting for Mr. da Silva to make changes after a year of chaos in the military-controlled aviation industry, with problems that included strikes of air traffic controllers, daylong delays and flight cancellations. The outrage over Mr. Pires's handling of the situation grew louder after a TAM Airlines Airbus crashed last week at Congonhas, killing 199 people.
 The accident was the second major air disaster in less than 10 months in Brazil. The TAM plane skidded off a short, slippery runway, crashed into an office building and a gas station and exploded. Last September, 154 people were killed in a midair collision between two planes flying over the Amazon. Both accidents are still under investigation.
 For Brazil, the latest tragedy has exploded into a full-blown crisis. Brazilian airlines have canceled hundreds of flights, with one, Gol, advising passengers on Wednesday not to fly for the rest of the month. Wal-Mart has advised its 55,000 employees in Brazil to avoid Congonhas until conditions improve, the newspaper O Globo reported. O Globo also reported that American Airlines was advising its pilots to turn back to their point of origin at the first sign of trouble in Brazil.
 The latest accident has led to international criticism of Brazil's flawed aviation system. Last week, the International Federation of Air Traffic Controllers Associations said that air safety in Brazil was ''currently compromised and is a danger to the traveling public.'' 
 That led Gen. Jose Carlos Pereira, the director of the national airport authority, Infraero, to fire back that Brazil could solve its safety problems without outside intervention. ''This crisis is ours,'' General Pereira said. ''The dead are ours.''
 He added: ''Brazil does not need international help. Let them worry about their airspace, and we will worry about ours.''
 Political analysts called Mr. Jobim's appointment an astute move by Mr. da Silva. A lawyer by training, Mr. Jobim could help navigate legal issues raised by the crash, and he comes from the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, which is allied to Mr. da Silva's Workers Party.
 David Fleischer, publisher of the political newsletter Brazil Focus and a professor of political science at National University of Brasilia, said Mr. Jobim would try to persuade the military to relinquish some of its authority over the civil aviation system. Brazil is one of the few countries in the hemisphere whose airline industry is administered by the military. 
 Mr. da Silva, now in his second term in office, had shied away from confrontations with the military. 
 But in a speech announcing the change on Wednesday, Mr. da Silva said that the Defense Ministry needed to be strengthened and given ''sufficient force to do what needs to be done,'' and that the military should be modernized and better equipped.
 Making further changes to the leadership of the aviation industry will not be easy for Mr. da Silva. Milton Zuanazzi, the president of the National Civil Aviation Agency, which regulates air traffic issues such as scheduling and falls under the Defense Ministry, has permanent tenure.
 The aviation crisis is the latest challenge for Mr. da Silva, who until recently had a more than 60 percent approval rating. Recent corruption scandals within his party have threatened to diminish Brazil's growing international standing on trade and economic fronts. The president waited three days after the accident before announcing any major changes to the civil aviation system. 
 Until Wednesday's dismissal of Mr. Pires, the government's major reaction was to propose to build a new airport in Sao Paulo, which will do little in the short term to improve airport infrastructure and security amid a rising tide of passengers, analysts said. Before last week's crash, Congonhas handled about 600 takeoffs and landings a day.
 ''This is going to be haunting Lula for some time,'' said Peter Hakim, the president of the Inter-American Dialogue in Washington, adding that the latest accident ''is bringing attention to Brazil's broader infrastructure problems.''

HEADLINE: Struggle in Housing Market Is Expected to Persist All Year

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON, July 26 (AP) -- Sales of new homes fell in June by the largest amount in five months as the housing industry continued to struggle with its worst downturn in 16 years. The median home price also fell.
 The Commerce Department reported Thursday that sales of new single-family homes dropped by 6.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 834,000 units. The decline was more than triple what had been expected and was the largest percentage drop since sales fell by 12.7 percent in January. Sales are now 22.3 percent below the level of a year ago. 
 The median price of a new home sold last month dropped to $237,900, down by 2.2 percent from a year ago. It was the biggest year-over-year price drop since a 6.5 percent fall in April. The median price is the point where half the homes sold for more and half for less.
 A report Wednesday showed that sales of existing homes dropped by 3.8 percent in June, to a five-year low. The weakness reflects spreading troubles in the mortgage market as more borrowers default on their loans, putting those homes back on an already glutted market. In addition, banks and other lenders are tightening their standards, making it harder for prospective buyers to qualify for loans.
 By region of the country, sales of new homes fell 27.1 percent in the Northeast, 22.5 percent in the West and 17.1 percent in the Midwest. Only the South saw an increase in sales, a gain of 7.6 percent.
 Economists say they believe the weakness in housing could linger through the rest of this year, until a huge overhang of unsold homes is worked down. For June, the inventory of unsold new homes was unchanged at 537,000 units.
 In other economic news, the Commerce Department said that orders for big-ticket manufactured products increased 1.4 percent last month, the best showing since a 5.1 percent increase in March. Orders declined 2.3 percent in May.
 The June strength in durable goods orders was concentrated in orders for commercial airplanes, which soared 28.7 percent, reflecting strong demand for Boeing aircraft. Aircraft orders, which are extremely volatile from month to month, fell 21 percent in May.
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department reported that the number of newly laid off workers filing claims for unemployment benefits fell to 301,000 last week, a drop of 2,000 from the previous week. Economists had been expecting a slight rise.
 Economists say they believe that the economy regained momentum in the spring after a lackluster start to the year. Economic growth slowed to a dismal annual rate of 0.7 percent from January through March, the weakest showing in more than four years.
 The government will report on April-June growth on Friday, and many analysts say they believe the report will show a solid rebound, to growth of around 3.2 percent, despite the housing industry troubles.
 The report on orders for durable goods showed that many sectors other than aircraft declined last month.
 Overall transportation orders were up 6.1 percent, but that reflected the 28.7 percent jump in demand for commercial airliners and a 9.9 percent rise in orders for military aircraft. Orders for autos were down 1.4 percent last month.
 Outside of transportation, orders fell by 0.5 percent, reflecting weakness in a number of categories. That was the second consecutive drop in orders excluding transportation.
 Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft, a category that is considered a good proxy for business investment, fell by 0.7 percent last week after an even bigger 1.5 percent decline in May.
 Other sectors showing weakness were primary metals, including steel, which dropped by 3.6 percent, and computers and electronic products, down 4.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Global Stock Markets Tumble Amid Deepening Credit Fears

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS and VIKAS BAJAJ; Julia Werdigier contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock prices tumbled on Wall Street and across much of the rest of the world yesterday. They were driven sharply lower by worries over slowing economic growth in the United States and worsening borrowing conditions that could make everything from huge corporate buyouts to buying a new home more difficult.
 Major stock market gauges -- including the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- were down more than 2 percent. 
 It was the worst one-day decline on Wall Street since markets plunged worldwide in late February after an investing scare in Shanghai, and it occurred amid the biggest volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchange in five years. Losses were comparable throughout Europe, and larger in many developing countries. 
 ''The preconditions for a shock are in place,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''Until very recently investors were very nonchalant about risks.''
 Stock markets have been volatile in recent weeks. Continued strong profits for many companies and an economic boom in Asia have helped push oil prices higher. Meanwhile, however, there are various signs of weakness in the American economy and new difficulties in borrowing for many homeowners and companies that are highly leveraged or have poor credit.
 The plunge came a day after the private equity firm buying Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler said it would complete the transaction for the automaker despite an inability to borrow the money in credit markets, as had been planned. Banks will hold those loans, as they will for a similar deal involving Alliance Boots, a British pharmacy chain. Shares of DaimlerChrysler fell $4.11, to $88.91.
 ''There is fear, but not a fear of recession,'' said Bill Gross, chief investment officer of the Pacific Investment Management Company, known as Pimco, a large bond management firm. ''The fear is directed toward the question of who will be willing to lend $200 billion to provide takeout financing for previously announced private equity deals.''
 Yesterday, the Dow industrials plunged 311.50 points, or 2.3 percent, to 13,473.57, while the S.& P. 500 dropped 35.43 points, or 2.3 percent, to 1,482.66. The Nasdaq composite index was down 48.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,599.34. The S.& P. is still up 4.5 percent for the year, while the Dow is 8.1 percent higher. But the S.& P. has fallen 4.5 percent since reaching a record last week. 
 In the last hour or so of trading, the major Wall Street indexes recovered about a third of their steepest losses for the day. 
 Losses of more than 2 percent were recorded in Spain, France and Germany, while Britain, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil fell more than 3 percent. Asian markets fell less yesterday, closing before the worst selling began, but opened down sharply on Friday. 
 The Nikkei 225 in Japan and the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong were down some 2.5 percent at the opening. Benchmarks in Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore all fell by more than 3 percent. All had regained some points by midmorning, but continued to trade broadly lower.
 The credit difficulties began in the United States with investors growing worried about losses on securities that helped to finance subprime mortgages for borrowers with weak credit, but now they have spread to highly leveraged companies as well.
 ''The really good times are over,'' said Simon Ballard, a global credit strategist at ABN Amro Asset Management in London. ''What we have now is a very weak market in terms of credit globally,'' he added. ''It will change the environment for higher leverage-type transactions going forward, especially leveraged buyouts.''
 In the past, a sudden slow down in lending has sometimes led to sharp market falls. The leveraged buyout boom in the 1980s came to a halt when a planned buyout of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, could not be financed. The S.& P. 500 fell 6 percent in one day when that was announced, but regained all the lost ground within 12 weeks. 
 Even as the stock market has gyrated in recent weeks -- with the Dow industrials alternating between rising and falling over the last eight trading days -- financial stocks have been coming under pressure. Citigroup dropped $1.40, or 2.9 percent, to $47.81 yesterday, and is down 9 percent in the last two weeks. Goldman Sachs fell $8.04, or 4 percent, to $195.12 yesterday, and has dropped 12 percent over the period.
 The falling stock markets yesterday helped turn oil markets lower. After rising above $77 a barrel in early trading -- the first time since last summer that level was hit -- the nearby crude oil future fell back below $75. 
 Exxon Mobil reported its first earnings decline in years, saying it made $10.26 billion in the second quarter, about $100 million less than in the second quarter of 2006. Earnings per share were up, because of an aggressive share repurchase plan, but shares of Exxon fell $4.56, to $88.23.
 American investors were also depressed by a report of slowing sales of new homes, and by reports of losses from home builders. Beazer Homes fell $1.48, or 8.7 percent, to $15.56, and has now lost two-thirds of its value this year. 
 Beazer faces a criminal investigation for arranging government-guaranteed mortgages for buyers who should not have qualified, but other home builders have also plunged. Pulte Homes fell 63 cents, or 3 percent, to $20.04, and is off about 40 percent this year.
 Not all stocks were lower. 
 In an indication of the higher volatility in the stock market, Apple, which lost 8 percent of its value on Tuesday amid fears that its iPhone had not sold as well as expected, regained all of that loss after it reported strong profits Wednesday and said it expects to sell one million phones by the end of September. 
 One index that tracks volatility in the stock market, the VIX, is at its highest level in more than a year.
 3M, which reported record profits, was the only one of the 30 Dow industrials to be up in late trading.
 The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell to 4.79 percent yesterday from 4.90 percent Wednesday, as some investors sought safety in the most secure financial instruments available. For lower quality bonds, however, the yields rose and some were difficult to sell. 
 ''We needed to clean house and it's getting cleaned,'' said Kingman D. Penniman, the president of KDP Investment Advisors, which focuses on high-yield bonds. ''It's the market going from too much liquidity to none. Many of the participants have never seen it.''
 Standard & Poor's, in its leveraged commentary report, said the decline in high-yield bond prices this week was the largest since the plunge after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
 ''It's pretty clear that this is a big move away from taking risk,'' said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and chief economist for OppenheimerFunds, a mutual fund company.
 ''People have been borrowing unusually cheaply to buy assets,'' Mr. Webman said, ''and that whole transaction made sense -- whether it was houses or companies -- if the asset was going to appreciate. But if that asset was not going to appreciate, your loan was not going to work.''
 The fall in Treasury bond rates has done little for mortgage rates. Freddie Mac reported that the average rate for 30-year mortgage loans was 6.69 percent. Since mid-June, Treasury rates have fallen by half a percentage point, but only a tenth of that move has carried over to the mortgage market.
 With the growing distress in credit markets, securities backed by risky mortgages have been a top concern. They are held by pension funds, hedge funds and many other investors around the world. Until recently, most policy makers and analysts argued that even if the market for those bonds collapsed, no major firm was likely to be seriously injured.
 But the big banks now find themselves taking on more loans because they had promised to do so if the loans could not be sold. And the market for some types of securities has all but vanished.
 Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, said this week it may have to keep riskier mortgage securities that it used to routinely sell. Countrywide fell 82 cents, or 2.7 percent, to $29.25, and is trading at a three-year low.
 ''Everybody now recognizes that the elimination of creative finance in housing leaves us with a problem for new homebuyers,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, because their income is not high enough to buy homes with interest rates and home prices at current levels.
 ''You can make the case,'' Mr. Barbera added, ''that we are simply witnessing a reverse of the late 1990s -- Asia collapse, long-term interest rates swoon and U.S. housing booms.'' 
 This time, however, interest rates may not fall much, he said, because of a boom in Asia, and that will put more pressure on housing prices.

HEADLINE: In the Amazon: Conservation or Colonialism?

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

DATELINE: ANAVILHANAS ECOLOGICAL STATION, Brazil 

 BODY:
Depending on one's point of view, the World Wildlife Fund's financial support of a nature reserve here on the Rio Negro is either part of a laudable attempt to conserve the Amazon jungle -- or the leading edge of a nefarious plot by foreign environmental groups to wrest control of the world's largest rain forest from Brazil and replace it with international rule.
 In 2003, after signing an agreement with the WWF and the World Bank, the Brazilian government created the Amazon Region Protected Areas program. Since then, more than a score of national parks and reserves covering an area larger than New York, New Jersey and Connecticut combined have been brought into that network and provided with an infusion of new funds. 
 The program's objective is to set up ''a core system to anchor bio-diversity protection for the Amazon,'' Matthew Perl, the WWF's Amazon coordinator, said during a June visit to the area, a sparsely populated archipelago of 400 islands northwest of Manaus. ''It's part of a strategy to buy time, bring each protected area up to certain standards of management and pool resources for monitoring and enforcement.''
 But that effort has aroused the suspicions of powerful business and political groups in Brazil that want to integrate the Amazon into the country's economy through dams, mining projects, highways, ports, logging and agricultural exports.
 ''This is a new form of colonialism, an open conspiracy in which economic and financial interests act through nongovernmental organizations,'' said Lorenzo Carrasco, editor and co-author of ''The Green Mafia,'' a widely circulated anti-environmentalist polemic. ''It is evident these interests want to block the development of Brazil and the Amazon region by creating and controlling these reserves, which are full of minerals and other valuable natural resources.''
 Such views are widely held in Brazil, cutting across regional and class lines. In a survey of 2,000 people in 143 cities conducted in person in 2005 by the country's leading polling organization, Ibope, 75 percent said that Brazil's natural riches could provoke a foreign invasion, and nearly three out of five distrusted the activities of environmental groups. 
 Winning the battle for Brazilian public opinion is crucial to any global effort to preserve the environment and, by extension, curb climate change. Brazil is the world's fourth largest producer of the principal greenhouse gases; more than three-quarters of those emissions result from deforestation, most of which occurs here in the Amazon.
 But the notion that foreigners covet the Amazon has long been widespread in Brazil, fed in part by anxiety about the central government's tenuous control of the region. Those concerns have been exacerbated in recent years by the Internet, which has become a home for fabricated documents and declarations meant to convince Brazilians that their sovereignty is at risk.
 The most notorious example is a widely reproduced map supposedly used in an American middle-school geography textbook. Rife with misspellings and errors of syntax of a type common to speakers of Romance languages like Portuguese, it shows the Amazon as an ''international reserve,'' and describes Brazilians as ''monkeys'' incapable of managing the rain forest.
 Other spurious documents say that both President Bush and Al Gore made speeches during the 2000 presidential campaign in favor of wresting the Amazon from Brazil. Elsewhere, the documents quote an apocryphal American general, who leads an agency that the Pentagon says does not exist, as saying, ''In the event Brazil decides to use the Amazon in a way that puts the environment of the United States at risk, we must be ready to interrupt that process immediately.''
 Since the Iraq war began, accusations of American military designs on the Amazon are often invoked to denigrate environmentalists and their complaints about government policy. At hearings late last year on a proposed dam on the Madeira River, proponents distributed a map showing what they said were American ''forward-operations locations'' in the region meant to block Brazil's development, including military bases and advisers in Bolivia and Venezuela, two countries not exactly on friendly terms with the Bush administration.
 Some of the material circulating has been traced to right-wing nationalist groups sympathetic to the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. But in an unusual instance of former adversaries agreeing, organizations on the extreme left -- even in the governing Workers' Party -- have also endorsed the notion of a foreign plot to seize the Amazon, as have some active duty segments of the military.
 ''Everything indicates that the environmental and indigenous problems are merely pretexts,'' said a recent Brazilian military intelligence report, which was made available to The New York Times by a Brazilian who received a copy and who was concerned at the views expressed. ''The main NGO's are, in reality, pieces in the great game in which the hegemonic powers are engaged to maintain and augment their domination. Certainly, they serve as cover for those secret services.'' 
 In reality, Mr. Perl, the WWF coordinator, said, his organization hopes merely to create a buffer around the nature reserve here through the creation of a larger ''Rio Negro Conservation Bloc.'' He said the idea was to protect the existing reserve by helping existing Indian reservations, state parks and nature reserves along the banks of the river to operate more effectively.
 By 2012, Mr. Perl said, his organization and its partners hope to bring an area larger than California into the system. A fund administered by a Brazilian foundation that aims to raise $390 million and includes donations from the German government and others has been created. 
 In the mid-1990s, part of the area surrounding the archipelago was in fact declared a state park. But little was done to make that decree effective, and since then the federal government's land-reform agency has settled 700 peasant families here and the Brazilian Navy, Marines and police have set up jungle training centers in the protected area.
 ''There is layer upon layer of claims, plan upon plan, and so this has become an area of conflict,'' said Thiago Mota Cardoso, who monitors the park for the Institute for Ecological Research, one of the WWF's regional partners. ''It is ironic that this land belongs to the federal government, and yet the government does nothing.''

 Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art. 
 'IN CONTEXT: COLLAGE + ABSTRACTION' This beautiful, intelligent exhibition of abstract works and collages by more than 50 artists includes some of the more memorable objects in Chelsea right now. It is a song of praise to craftsmanship and making, an unfashionable concept but ultimately at the core of all visual art, at least until the 1960s. In attendance are not only the usual names in this area, including Kurt Schwitters and Robert Motherwell, but also a raft of lesser-known but no less talented artists who have traditionally exhibited on the Upper East Side but haven't really gotten their due. Several exhibitors make collages by cutting, tearing, folding and jumbling together bits of colored paper, sometimes painted, among them Jack Tworkov, Jerry Jofen, Esteban Vicente, Holli Schorno, Janice Biala, Mario Naves and Fritz Bultman (whose ''Waves and Others'' is at right). Others prefer structured, ordered patterns that delight the eyes, cutting and combining paper and other materials to create a mandala, a ziggurat, a diamond design or random geometric shapes. Anne Ryan's circa-1950 collage on Masonite gleams, looking something like a stained-glass window. Rounding out the lineup are some young artists, among them David Poppie, who fashions abstract collages from spent matchbooks. 
It is hard to say whether he can push the idea or the material much further, but the work stands up in this exalted company. (Through Aug. 10, Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 533 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, 212-675-7490, pavelzoubok .com.) BENJAMIN GENOCCHIO
 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE GREAT COVER-UP: AMERICAN RUGS ON BEDS, TABLES AND FLOORS,' through Sept. 9. The more than 60 rugs in this extraordinary show count among the best pictorial art of 19th- and early-20th-century America, which means that quite a few of the women who made them qualify as great, if unidentified, artists. Densely textured, gloriously colored, boldly scaled and exuberantly frontal, they were made between 1800 and 1950 and provide something of a history of the American handmade rug, from bed to floor, and from mostly yarn-sewn to the wildly popular hooking technique. Their intuitive intelligence, where space and composition are concerned, proves once more that modern form is not a modern invention and flattens the always provisional distinction between art and craft. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
 AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY: 'GOLD,' through Aug. 19. Having delved into pearls, diamonds and amber, the museum applies its time-tested show-and-tell formula to the premier precious natural material, gold. This astounding array of art, artifacts and natural samples -- larded with fascinating facts and tales -- ranges from prehistoric times to the present. Stops along the way include pre-Columbian empires, sunken treasure, Bangladesh dowry rituals and the moon landing. It turns out that gold comes from the earth in forms as beautiful as anything man has thought to do with it, but that gold ingots have a brute force all their own. You are certain to emerge with mind boggled and eyes dazzled. Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5100, amnh.org. (Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'DIVISIONISM/NEO-IMPRESSIONISM: ARCADIA AND ANARCHY,' through Aug. 6. Ultimately this rare, compressed, mercurial exhibition of work by the Italian Divisionists of the 1890s is long on history and short on truly convincing paintings. The inclusion of works by Seurat and his French, Dutch and Belgian followers clarifies how the Italians pushed Pointillism, Seurat's invention, in all directions: toward realism, academic classicism, Symbolism, class consciousness and even Impressionism. The show opens a new, albeit small, window on the genesis of Modernism beyond the French canon. If many of the works are period pieces, they are also immensely appealing, bighearted and physically robust period pieces. Guggenheim Museum, 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SHAPES OF SPACE,' through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art's central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap music emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. (See above) (Smith)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'BIOGRAPHICAL LANDSCAPE: THE PHOTOGRAPHY OF STEPHEN SHORE, 1969-1979,' through Sept. 9. In 1971 the Metropolitan Museum of Art gave Stephen Shore its second-ever exhibition by a living photographer. (Alfred Stieglitz had the first.) He was 23 when it opened. What he did makes up most of this wonderful show. Mr. Shore has reprinted the photographs digitally, with rejuvenated colors as fresh and subtle as the day the pictures were shot. The work's laconic eloquence speaks of an era and a nation. Its wit and affection add buoyancy to scenes of threadbare America from a moment when the country was depressed by war and years of civil unrest. Its formal rigor makes an uncanny order out of images that, at first glance, look like no place or nothing. Look again. His show reminds us of a period when cutting-edge American art and the tradition of straight, documentary photography got together. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at West 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'LET YOUR MOTTO BE RESISTANCE: AFRICAN AMERICAN PORTRAITS,' through Sept. 9. This show of photographic portraits is a praise-song in pictures, a shout-out to history. It's also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. It tends to be a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is, with a Who's Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X, and with Leontyne Price, Mahalia Jackson and the Supremes sharing a stage. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'DATELINE: ISRAEL: NEW PHOTOGRAPHY AND VIDEO ART,' through Aug. 5. Roughly every decade, the Jewish Museum offers a survey of contemporary art from and about Israel. This year non-Israeli artists from Europe and the United States -- and a single artist from Palestine -- have been added to the mix. There's some very good work here, though on the whole the show grapples with crucial political issues in an indirect way. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, jewishmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'IMPRESSIONIST AND EARLY MODERN PAINTINGS: THE CLARK BROTHERS COLLECT,' through Aug. 19. The Met examines the lives and collecting habits of two feuding brothers, heirs to the Singer sewing machine fortune, who were among the leading 20th-century art patrons. Sterling Clark was founder of the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass. His younger brother, Stephen, was a trustee of both the Met and the Museum of Modern Art (and established the National Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y.). The brothers shared a love of Renoir, Degas and Americans like Winslow Homer, but Sterling ''drew the line'' at Cezanne and considered Matisse and Picasso ''bad painters and fakers.'' Tracking their taste and how they dispersed their collections is interesting -- and perhaps instructive for contemporary collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 THE MET: 'COAXING THE SPIRITS TO DANCE,' through Dec. 2. How the Papuans practiced their beliefs on the remote Pacific island of New Guinea in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when they still had little contact with the West, is the complex and fascinating story told in this exhibition of some 60 objects and 30 rare photographs of the works on site or in actual use. The carved and painted ''spirit boards'' made throughout the gulf region, on the south coast of present-day Papua New Guinea, are probably the most easily recognized of the area's traditional artworks. Their central designs, passed down from fathers to sons and through marriages, typically represent a bush or river spirit, with a heavily stylized face and perhaps a small body, surrounded by various totemic symbols. More daring in concept are the masks used in ritual dances. Papuan art may not be as varied or exciting as that of many African or Amerind peoples, but it records a vibrant community. (See above.) (Grace Glueck)
 THE MET: 'HIDDEN IN PLAIN SIGHT: CONTEMPORARY PHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE COLLECTION,' through Sept. 3. A small but potent exhibition of contemporary photographs from the museum's collection that opens with an epigraph by Henry David Thoreau: ''The question is not what you look at but what you see.'' Artists here find beauty in the everyday and mundane, from Walker Evans's late series of Polaroids to Stephen Shore's landscapes and Rachel Harrison's photograph of a house in Perth Amboy, N.J., where thousands believed that they saw the face of the Virgin Mary on a second-floor window. Although this is a small show -- only a few dozen photographs installed in two rooms -- it could take you longer to absorb than a much larger exhibition. It is not just about viewing photographs, after all, but about learning a new way to look at the world. (See above.) (Schwendener)
 * THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'INCISIVE IMAGES: IVORY AND BOXWOOD CARVINGS,' through Nov. 25. This extraordinary show, drawn almost entirely from the Met's vaults, presents an array of nearly 100 carved figures, crucifixes, reliefs, containers, hand-held weapons and the occasional piece of furniture. It is an engrossing hive of religious fervor, Classical erudition (and occasional naughtiness), style shifts and multicultural crosscurrents. And among the many feats of drop-dead artistic skill are several of traffic-stopping caliber. Don't miss it. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'NEO RAUCH AT THE MET: PARA,' through Oct. 14. The figurative style of the leader of the Leipzig School is never less than ambitious, but here it looks almost fatally retro, as if the context of the Met had made the painter's mind turn to thoughts of browned-out colors; characters of a Romantic 19th- century mien; and settings that often suggest garrets or hunting lodges. The result is an exhibition that looks too much at home in the museum and sells Mr. Rauch's talent short, but is still one that should be seen. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'POIRET: KING OF FASHION,' through Aug. 5. A revolutionary in revolutionary times, the fashion designer and cultural dynamo Paul Poiret introduced unstructured garments that freed women from corsets in 1906, the year before Picasso committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) ''Demoiselles d'Avignon'' to canvas. But the modern painter whom Poiret most resembles, in his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, is Matisse. This rare exhibition, the latest effort from the Met's esteemed Costume Institute, does his sartorial genius justice with a spare installation rendered radiant by hand-painted silk backdrops of the leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms of Paris. (See above.) (Smith) 
 * THE MET: 'ONE OF A KIND: THE STUDIO CRAFT MOVEMENT,' through Dec. 2. Focusing on the postwar development of artist-craftsmen who not only conceive and design their own objects but have a direct hand in making them, this display of furniture, glass, ceramics, metalwork, jewelry and fiber includes funny, quirky, provocative and sometimes gorgeous things. Among its stars are a witty bust by the California funk ceramicist Robert Arneson (1920-92), portraying the mother of the 16th-century painter and printmaker Albrecht Durer; John Cederquist's elegant cabinet concealed behind a trompe l'oeil door painted and veneered to look like a battered wooden packing case with a rowdy wave tearing through it; and Bonnie Seeman's fetching ceramic coffeepot and tray, whose mock cabbage leaves and rhubarb stalks evoke the genteel tradition of 18th-century British and continental china, but can also be read as human rather than vegetative tissue. Traditionalists, too, have their place in this show, with the wood workers Wharton Esherick and Sam Maloof represented by elegantly simple renditions in the furniture line; respectively, a music stand and a Shaker-like settee. (See above.) (Glueck) 
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 28. Two large Pop Art sculptures, two architectural models and a model enlarged into a sculpture-installation piece confirm that one of the greatest American artists of the postwar era doesn't do himself or anyone else any favors when he strays from the wall to work fully in the round. The results have a certain Stella-like verve but are otherwise generic. (See above.) (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'THE FRENCH EVOLUTION: RACE, POLITICS & THE 2005 RIOTS,' through Sept. 9. Alexis Peskine serves as an informed guide to recent events in France, although his position is somewhat complicated. Son of a Franco-Russian father (an architect) and an Afro-Brazilian mother, Mr. Peskine holds a bachelor of fine arts degree from Howard University and a master's from the Maryland Institute College of Art -- which set him distinctly apart from the working-class youth in the banlieue, or suburb. His training as a graphic artist is evident in paintings that appropriate elements from comics, cartoons and food products, while his interest in hip-hop culminates in a music video titled ''Ripa'' (slang for Paris). Uneven at times, Mr. Peskine's work is ambitious and reflective. It also succeeds in showing us how in France's difficulties we feel echoes of our own. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Schwendener)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'NEW YORK RISES: PHOTOGRAPHS BY EUGENE DE SALIGNAC,' through Oct. 28. This exhibition makes a case for adding Eugene de Salignac, the official photographer for the New York City Department of Bridges, Plant and Structures from 1903 to 1934, to the canon of American photographers whose images are forever linked with the city. He captured the Williamsburg, Manhattan and Queensboro Bridges just as construction was completed and the subways tracks were being laid. In some of his moving, eye-catching images, he exhibits his appreciation for New York's work force. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1673, mcny.org. (Bridget L. Goodbody)
 NEW YORK BOTANICAL GARDEN: 'PARADISE IN PRINT,' through Aug. 19. Watercolors, folio editions, rare books and prints from the 18th through the mid-20th centuries reveal how closely linked natural and human histories have been in the Caribbean over the last 500 years. Engravings and lithographs of cash crops like coffee, chocolate, tobacco and sugar (nicknamed ''green gold'') are accompanied by images from Mark Catesby's 18th-century natural history, which served as the model for Audubon's ''Birds of America''; images of African slaves and colonialists; selections from the 19th-century French lithographer Etienne Denisse's book ''Flora of America;'' and Nikolaus Joseph Jacquin's extraordinary ''Selectarum Stirpium Americanarum Historia,'' published around 1780 in Vienna and illustrated with watercolors painted directly into the book. (It was purchased for the Botanical Garden by Andrew Carnegie.) Bronx River Parkway and Fordham Road, Bedford Park, (718) 817-8616, nybg.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Feb. 25. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. The exhibition includes works by George Loring Brown, Asher Brown Durand, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church and others. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Schwendener)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NEW YORK DIVIDED: SLAVERY AND THE CIVIL WAR,' through Sept. 3. New York has a cosmopolitan pride in itself, but as this exhibition shows, it is not always well deserved. Even after slavery belatedly came to an end in New York State in 1827, New York City was a ''hotbed of pro- slavery politics,'' inspired by close commercial links with the South and the international cotton trade. For every instance of abolitionist activity, there is another in which slavery is defended or supported. This powerful exhibition, focused on the years between Emancipation and Reconstruction, and featuring documents, videos, audio dramatizations, books, cartoons and historic objects, shows how divided the city was, even during the years of the Civil War. But it also draws attention to the importance of black abolitionists and to the forces that countered slavery's horrific heritage. It brings to a close the Historical Society's multiyear exploration of slavery in New York. (See above.) (Edward Rothstein)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'ORGANIZING CHAOS,' through Sept. 24. With John Cage as spirit guide, this exhibition presents eight works by eight artists in eight large galleries with no muss, no fuss, no nasty spillover, although this doesn't rule out many interesting connections. The subject is broached in film, video, text and photographs that alternate between macrocosmic and microcosmic, silence and noise, anarchic and tightly scripted. Orchestras, entropy, human hatred and life in the studio, the Sunday papers and the backyard are invoked in contributions from Luke Fowler, Rivane Neuenschwander and Cao Guimaraes, Bruce Nauman, Christian Marclay, Tomoko Takahashi, Robert Smithson, Hans-Peter Feldmann and Stephen Vitieollo. A Museum of Modern Art affiliate, 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org.. (Smith)
 WADSWORTH ATHENEUM MUSEUM OF ART: 'FAITH AND FORTUNE: FIVE CENTURIES OF EUROPEAN MASTERWORKS,' through Dec. 9. Celebrating the return of its famous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo paintings and objects of art from a three-year national tour, the Wadsworth has arranged a feast of a show. One of the most appealing things about this gathering of some 400 treasures is the mix, with knockout paintings keeping period company with small sculptures, elaborate table furnishings, decorative platters, Meissen knockoffs of Chinese pottery, a porcelain birdcage and vases and such. Strolling through the galleries, you'll find treasures like ''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (about 1594-95), said to be the first authentic Caravaggio in an American museum; Fra Angelico's poignant, poetic fragment ''Head of an Angel'' (about 1455-50); and Francisco de Zurbaran's fearsome portrayal of a dead martyr, ''Saint Serapion'' (1628). But the piece de resistance is an entire gallery made into an art and curio cabinet, with a planned clutter of brilliant objects that play to a viewer's inner acquisitor: exotic shells mounted in gold; an extraordinary Baroque ivory carving (presumed to be before 1650) of Adam and Eve; an automatic tabletop clock (about 1619) with a standing lion that could roll its eyes, open its jaws and stick out its tongue when the hours struck. Dazzlement prevails. 600 Main Street, Hartford, (860) 278-2670, wadsworthatheneum.org. (Glueck)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM AT ALTRIA: MATTHEW BRANNON, 'WHERE WERE WE,' through Aug. 26. Matthew Brannon brings together art, poetry and advertising in a series of letterpress prints that hark back to 1950s and 1960s textile designs by Astrid Sampe and Marimekko. Texts written by the artist and accompanying the images read like song lyrics crossed with Conceptual Art and Language Poetry (which emphasized experimentalism and reader interaction). Consumption and excess are frequent references, as well as how art, design and fashion feed these modern yet primordial urges and desires. 120 Park Avenue, at 42nd Street, (917) 663-2453, whitney.org. (Martha Schwendener)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'LINCOLN KIRSTEIN,' through Aug. 27. In the middle of the last century Lincoln Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, he endorsed, among others, the artists in this show. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus (who was Kirstein's brother-in-law), Walker Evans and Pavel Tchelitchew. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein's taste clearly hasn't won the day, but it's never bad to re-examine received opinions or to be reminded of a generous advocate. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600. (Kimmelman)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RESISTANCE IS ... ,' through Sept. 2. This is an earnest sort of show about social unrest and upheaval, but it's smart, engaging and nicely put together, combining a pleasing diversity of artists, mediums and styles. Several of the two dozen works are documentary photographs of acts of social disobedience, public demonstrations and political counteraction, among them now-famous images by Richard Avedon, Gordon Parks, Larry Fink, Gilles Peress and Garry Winogrand. Timing is everything, and this gathering of works couldn't look or feel more apposite. (See above.) (Benjamin Genocchio)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'RUDOLF STINGEL,' through Oct. 14. The work of this Italian-born artist, who is based in New York, seduces the eye while also upending most notions of what, exactly, constitutes a painting, how it should be made and by whom. His favored materials include carpet and Styrofoam, as well as paint on canvas. His style swings between abstract purity and Photo Realism. His grandly spare survey has a mirrored floor and a foil-covered room, lighted by a crystal chandelier, that visitors may mark on and that he may or may not later appropriate as a painting. As enthralling as it is perturbing, his work combines beauty, humor and a democratic slant with a rigorous sense of economy. It also forms one of the best-looking exhibitions lately seen at the Whitney. (See above.) (Smith)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'SUMMER OF LOVE: ART OF THE PSYCHEDELIC ERA,' through Sept. 16. Tear gas, pot and patchouli were the scents of the 1960s. You can almost detect the last two wafting through this two-floor display of rock posters, light shows, photographs and paintings. But the burn of tear gas, with the association of political emergency it brings, is missing in a show that remembers a lot, but forgets much more, about what was happening 40 years ago, when America was losing its mind to save, some would say, its soul. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 Galleries: Uptown
 'MAGICAL MEANS: MILTON AVERY AND WATERCOLOR' Milton Avery (1885-1965) painted in watercolor mostly when he was away from his New York studio. Watercolors were light and easy to transport, and during the Depression, when the cost of paper was a consideration, he could use both sides of a sheet. Works spanning more than 30 years are here, including landscapes, portraits, still lifes and abstract compositions. Bulky bathers show him distilling the influence of Matisse and Picasso. Echoes of Ashcan realism are obvious in paintings of train tracks or the boardwalk at Coney Island. Mostly the work shows Avery's consistent desire to, as he once said, ''eliminate and simplify, leaving apparently nothing but color and form.'' Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Aug. 10. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: SoHo
 ALEX HAY: 'NEW PAINTINGS' In the 1960s this painter pitted Pop, Photo Realism and abstraction against one another. Now he has turned to ''found'' abstractions: enlarged replications of weathered, peeling boards. Made with an elaborate process of stenciling and spray painting, they lean toward the modernist monochrome, while keeping one foot planted in trompe l'oeil. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 JIM ISERMANN: 'VINYL SMASH-UP, 1999-2007' This exhibition sets out to be a miniretrospective of Jim Isermann's vinyl decals. Though the pieces are hung in a manner more appropriate to an interior designer's showroom than to an art gallery, this Electric-Kool-Aid-Acid-Test-colored show will give you a good dose of California-meets-Op-Art aesthetics. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Aug. 4. (Goodbody)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'AGITATION AND REPOSE' This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands, by Via Lewandowsky. It continues with Rainer Ganahl's bicycle ride into oncoming traffic and Holly Zausner's body-ladened tour of Berlin, and concludes with Claire Watkins's sculpture of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, the excellent Roman Signer. In one, a helicoptor buzzes him in bed; in another, hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third, a sudden explosion prompts him to start -- and finish -- a painting. Repose has never been Mr. Signer's thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Aug. 17. (Cotter)
 'COLOUR BEFORE COLOR' The spelling discrepancy in the show's title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sun bathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos Perez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, through Aug. 17. (Smith)
 'A POINT IN SPACE IS A PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT' Despite its title, taken from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, this group show of 56 works by 30 artists is fairly even-tempered, less about argument than unexpected connections. With special attention to the margins and physical process, it ranges across generations, styles and mediums, gathering together works by Lynda Benglis, Bruce Nauman, Niki de Saint Phalle, Forrest Bess, Joe Overstreet, Cathy Wilkes, Raoul De Keyser, Al Taylor and Andre Cadere. Common ground is a shared opposition to tradition, standard definitions of greatness, accepted notions of material or finish, or the separation of art mediums. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Aug. 10. (Smith)
 'PROMISED LAND' Blink and you could be standing in the American wing of a big survey museum, only Americana here is delivered with a twist: a painting with a hunter standing over a pile of wildlife booty; a pencil drawing of Ben Franklin sitting cross-legged with an eagle above him ready to pounce; a tattered Confederate flag made with bubble gum and hung from a twig. The show, organized by Elizabeth M. Grady, takes its title from John Salvest's illuminated sign with black vinyl letters spelling out the words ''Promised Land.'' Like much of the work here, the sign, bordered with blinking red lights, offers sardonic commentary on the contemporary state of the Union. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, at 28th Street, (212) 268-2699, morganlehmangallery.com, through Aug. 4. (Schwendener)
 'ROLE EXCHANGE' This elegant exhibition takes an interesting idea and walks with it. The idea is the practice, widespread among artists since the late 1960s, of creating fictional identities, especially in camera-based work. But it is thorough and contains a handful of unfamiliar artists and works. And one effort is especially worth the trip: Kalup Linzy's fabulously nuanced (and lip-synched) new video, a collaboration with Shaun Leonardo that restates a vintage blues duet as a gay flirtation. Sean Kelly, 528 West 29th Street, (212) 239-1181, skny.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 'SOURCE CODE' This is the first of three shows commemorating Eyebeam's 10th anniversary. The roster includes ''artists, technologists, hackers and programmers,'' from Cory Arcangel to Radical Software Group, Mark Napier, Carrie Dashow, Nina Katchadourian, Steve Lambert, Golan Levin and Jennifer and Kevin McCoy. ''The Duellists'' by MediaShed is a work in which two young men, videotaped on closed-circuit television in a shopping center, engage in a choreographed performance of Parkour, a form of ''free running'' that looks like a combination of break dancing, martial arts, acrobatics and skateboarding without the board. Interesting that, in an exhibition centered on technology, a work foregrounding raw human ability steals the show. Eyebeam, 540 West 21st Street, (212) 937-6580, eyebeam.org, through Aug. 11. (Schwendener)
 Galleries: Other
 MARTIN CREED: 'FEELINGS' Operating somewhere between a sardonic court jester and an art-world Martha Stewart (try this at home), the British Conceptualist Martin Creed pokes fun at the avant-garde while extending its traditions. Occupying 24 spacious galleries, this show includes marker-pen monochromes; sculptures consisting of stacks of beanbag chairs and sheets of plywood; a person who runs through the galleries every 10 minutes; videos of people engaged in basic bodily functions; and a gallery full of dark blue balloons that is the next best thing to an antigravitational chamber. Immense and provocative fun, the work also strikes deep at the heart of art and its role in the world. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. (845) 758-7598, through Sept. 16. (Smith)
 SOL LEWITT: 'DRAWING SERIES ...' If the greatness of Sol LeWitt, the Minimal-Conceptual artist who died in April at 78, has so far escaped you, this exhilarating show of 14 of his mind-teasing, eye-filling wall drawings from the late 1960s and early '70s may do the trick. Selected and arranged by the artist, they proceed in carefully sequenced contrasts and echoes that are both insightful and idiosyncratic. Since their generating instructions are part of their titles, they reduce the creative process to a short, highly visible straight line. But their crisp geometries, accumulating marks and radiating patterns force us to mind the gap between artistic thought and artistic action, to experience the inability of language to account fully for visual outcome. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diabeacon.org, through Sept. 10. (Smith)
 Public Art
 MAD. SQ. ART 2007: ROXY PAINE This installation is made up of two stainless-steel tree sculptures, ''Conjoined'' and ''Defunct,'' and a glacierlike boulder, ''Erratic,'' by Mr. Paine. The tree sculptures are made from thousands of pieces of metal pipe and rod elements that have been cut, welded and polished. They are real enough to resemble actual trees but not so real that they form a continuum with the surrounding foliage. What captures your immediate attention is ''Conjoined,'' a 40-by-45-foot sculpture of two trees whose gleaming steel branches cantilever and then improbably connect in midair. It is impossible to tell where the branches of one tree begin and the other's end. But the piece is also beautifully eccentric, a futuristic fantasy of streamlined vegetation manufactured in imitation of the real thing, only much more appealing and exciting. Madison Square Park, 23rd Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 538-4689, madisonsquarepark.org, through Dec. 31. (Benjamin Genocchio) 
 Last Chance
 'AUTOMATIC' Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE' This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Grace Glueck)
 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look like both a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird's sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor, a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile, and tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain's suicide note; Chris Farley's birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled ''Suicidal Tendencies.'' Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There's plenty of serious intent, ingenuity and talent here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, closes today. (Smith)
 'CONCRETE WORKS' What sounds like a ready-mix formula for a summer show is actually an astute selection of works that highlight the currently popular grab-bag approach to art history and the age-old sleight-of-hand tactic that prompts viewers to wonder how artists fabricate their works. Some of the pieces create conversations about abstraction and process that span decades. Lucy McKenzie's gray-scale chalk and charcoal work on paper nods to Mondrian and Max Ernst; Walead Beshty's photographs hang across the room from two fuzzy Laszlo Moholy-Nagy photographs; and a surprising pairing of Albert Oehlen with Man Ray centers on a ''discussion'' of Pollock's drip process. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com, closes today. (Schwendener)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'DESIGN LIFE NOW: NATIONAL DESIGN TRIENNIAL 2006' Like its two predecessors, this ambitious show illuminates the volatile, contradictory and ever- expanding field of design, but fails to call it to order. The inclusions range from genius to schlock, delightful to dispiriting. They cover medical innovation, military hardware, completely frivolous reiterations of received ideas (far too many of which trace to Surrealism), sundry Web sites and magazines, haute couture, architecture and recycling -- more varieties of recycling than you can easily count. The show coalesces into deliberately orchestrated skirmishes between conflicting principles and entities: corporate and private, decorative and essential. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, ndm.si.edu, closes on Sunday. (Smith) 
 'CREATIVE GROWTH' The talent just about jumps off the wall in this show of work by nine disabled adults who attend the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, Calif. The sensibilities might be divided between those who emphasize order and concentrated forms and those whose dispersed patterns or lines vibrate in time with the chaos of the universe. But either way their efforts, which include painting, drawing and sculpture, mesmerize. Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, closes today. (Smith) 
 LOU LAURITA: 'THERE'S A PARTY GOING ON' Art and language are one and the same in Lou Laurita's large gouache paintings, which mix images from coloring books, pornography and 19th-century botanicals with words lifted from song lyrics and personal profiles found on the Internet. The interweaving of elements is ingenious enough to yield several levels of reading -- all the words and images spell out larger words -- but the work moves beyond cleverness to convey yearning, rage and melancholy, usually simultaneously. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closes Thursday. (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,'. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures -- and that look as if they date from the early 1960s. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 'NEW ECONOMY' This has been a busy year for Joao Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized ''New Economy,'' a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show's premise feels somewhat dated. Mr. Ribas also has a weakness for the kind of critical-theory jargon that peaked a decade or two ago, quoting Peter Drucker's 1994 book, ''Post-Capitalist Society,'' and following that up with a description of the ''postindustrial economic order'' as a ''knowledge-driven form of post-Fordist capitalism.'' Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)
 'NOT YOUR PARENTS' MTV: MUSIC VIDEOS FROM HELL' The six artists and artist teams included in this show do creative things with the music video form, but the most energetically demonic is Kenneth Tin-Kin Hung's ''Because Washington Is Hollywood for Ugly People.'' A hilarious portrayal of the nation's current, disastrous leadership set to the music of MC Paul Barman, it adds very sharp teeth and a bit of scatology to the hot colors and dense collages of 1960s psychedelia. Although Mr. Hung has a well-known Web site (kintin.com), this is the first time his work has been exhibited in New York. Don't miss it. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 7277-3323, postmastersart.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 SARAH PETERS In an impressive first show, this artist revisits several pictorial conventions of colonial America -- the portrait, the mourning picture and the landscape -- with antic results. Her weapon of choice is black ballpoint pen backed by pencil, deployed in a fidgety yet gossamer cross-hatch style whose precedents include Edward Gorey and the early work of Jim Nutt and Sue Williams. Winkleman Gallery, 637 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 643-3152, winkleman.com, closes today. (Smith)
 'STRANGE MAGIC' The camera-based art of Liz Deschenes, Anne Collier, Amy Granat, Eileen Quinlan and Sara VanDerBeek has found that there are all sorts of new tricks to be conjured inside the triangle defined by the 1980s practices of photo appropriation, rephotography and setup photography. That all the artists are women harks back to the breakthroughs of the late 1970s, when numerous women used the camera to reimagine Conceptual Art. Luhring Augustine, 531 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-9100, luhringaugustine.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: 'ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of overreaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener) 
 'YOU ALWAYS MOVE IN REVERSE' Bjarne Melgaard, who had a memorably assaultive solo at the late, lamented Alleged Gallery in Chelsea a few years ago, says that he conceived this group show as a swipe at the ''teenage rebellion thing.'' He enlisted some good artists to press his point, among them Jason Dodge, Richard Hawkins, Jeff Ono and B. Wutz. But the occasion is mainly notable for marking the return of Lydia Lunch, a true-blue rebel, whose one-time-only performance in the gallery surely outshone the photographs by her in the show. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com, closes on Tuesday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Blow the Whistle on Betting Scandals

BYLINE: By JUSTIN WOLFERS. 
Justin Wolfers is a professor of business and public policy at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.

 BODY:
Cambridge, Mass.
 NO one should be surprised by the news that federal officials are investigating whether Tim Donaghy, a referee for the National Basketball Association, bet on N.B.A. games and may have used his position to manipulate game scores so that he or his associates could profit from their wagers. David Stern, the commissioner of the N.B.A., characterized Donaghy as ''an isolated case,'' but this both misrepresents history and misses the point. 
 Stern may be correct that Donaghy is the only bad apple in the current crop of N.B.A. refs, but sports betting scandals are fairly common. They are the result of persistent economic incentives that can be traced to the structure of sports gambling markets. And these incentives can be changed. 
 The activity known as ''point shaving'' gets at the heart of the problem: a corrupt player or official is rarely asked to throw a game to one team or the other. Instead he is asked to influence something rather immaterial, like the winning margin. This is profitable because gamblers typically bet on whether a team will exceed some point differential -- the ''Vegas Spread'' -- rather than whether a certain team will win. 
 Because basketball can be affected significantly by the actions of a single player, coach or referee, it is extremely susceptible to gambling-related corruption. But we have seen similar scandals in other sports, including football, soccer and cricket. The common thread in each case has been the existence of large-scale betting on immaterial outcomes, like the point spread, or how many combined points the two teams will score, or the winner of a meaningless ''dead rubber'' in cricket, a game that takes place at the end of a best-of-five series after one team has already won three games. The exception is the Chicago ''Black Sox'' scandal, when White Sox players threw the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds.
 To the corrupt participants, point shaving feels like a victimless crime. The same team, after all, still wins. And this ensures minimal scrutiny of their actions.
 Not all gambling leads as easily to corruption. For instance, if betting were allowed only on which team would win a game or a series, then corrupt gamblers would find it much more difficult to get referees or players to cooperate with them. The Black Sox players are famous precisely because they are rare. 
 If David Stern wants to reduce gambling-related corruption in the N.B.A., he should try to find a way to encourage the types of bets that do not promote corruption. When faced with a betting scandal, a sports league usually hardens its anti-gambling stance. But that doesn't work. A smarter approach would be to become more tolerant of some kinds of gambling in an effort to crowd out the bets that create incentives for scoreboard manipulation. 
 That's right: Legalizing wagering on which team wins or loses a particular game, while banning all bets on immaterial outcomes like point spreads, would destroy the market for illegal bookmakers and make sporting events less corruptible by gamblers. 
 Unfortunately, we're unlikely to see this necessary reform anytime soon. It may be hard to remember in an era of ubiquitous gambling, but outside Nevada, all sports betting is illegal in the United States. This gives us the world's strictest anti-gambling legislation in theory, but in practice it means that most gambling occurs either in the unregulated underworld or in barely regulated offshore (but online) jurisdictions.
 By plowing through the mountains of data created by sporting events, forensic economists have uncovered the footprints of this wrongdoing. If point shaving is occurring, then game outcomes should be especially sensitive to the Vegas Spread. In a paper published last year, I found that to be the case. Point shaving may be widespread enough to have occurred in around 1 percent of N.C.A.A. basketball games. An intriguing undergraduate thesis by a Stanford economics student, Jonathan Gibbs, suggested that similar forces may be at work in the N.B.A. The only thing new in the Donaghy scandal is the accusation that a referee, rather than a player, tried to tweak the score.
 We do not yet know the details of the Donaghy case, but I would not be surprised if investigators are looking into whether he manipulated the total number of points scored in games without affecting the winner. A basketball referee has ample opportunity to influence the number of points scored, or just as important, whether the clock is ticking. This type of manipulation helps corrupt gamblers win their ''over/under'' bets, and it probably alters the winner of very few games.
 A more sensible legal framework would reduce this sort of manipulation. Bettors value regulation: They get paid, their legs don't get broken, and they can talk about their wagers around the water cooler with no legal risk. The rise of government-run gambling on horse racing in Australia paralleled the demise of the country's illegal bookmakers in second half of the 20th century. 
 The competitive advantage conferred by regulation may also channel problem gamblers into the legal sector. If policymakers build in sufficient safeguards, we can direct victims of compulsive gambling into treatment. Instead, today's problem gamblers are channeled by illegal bookmakers into ever-higher losses, and their mounting financial pressures sometimes lead to criminal conduct.
 Point-shaving is a crime of opportunity, and the opportunity comes from the structure of sports betting markets. The commissioners of the major sports need to address these systemic issues. A transparent and well-regulated gambling sector could easily out-compete the unregulated offshore bookmakers and the illegal onshore ones. More important, it would reduce the number of betting scandals we're likely to see in the future.

HEADLINE: The Sum Of Some Fears

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Yesterday's scary ride in the markets wasn't a full-fledged panic. The interest rate on 10-year U.S. government bonds -- a much better indicator than stock prices of what investors think will happen to the economy -- fell sharply, but even so, it ended the day higher than its level as recently as mid-May, and well above its levels earlier in the year. This tells us that investors still consider a recession, which would cause the Fed to cut interest rates, fairly unlikely.
 So it wasn't the sum of all fears. But it was the sum of some fears -- three, in particular. 
 The first is fear of bad credit. Back in March, after another market plunge, I spun a fantasy about how a global financial meltdown could take place: people would suddenly remember that bad stuff sometimes happens, risk premiums -- the extra return people demand for holding bonds that aren't government guaranteed -- would soar, and credit would dry up.
 Well, some of that happened yesterday. ''The risk premium on corporate bonds soared the most in five years,'' reported Bloomberg News. ''And debt sales faltered as investors shunned all but the safest debt.'' Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com said that if another major hedge fund stumbles, ''That could elicit a crisis of confidence and a global shock.''
 I saw that one coming. But what's really striking is how much of the current angst in the market is over two things that I thought had been obvious for a long time: the magnitude of the housing slump and the persistence of high oil prices.
 I've written a lot about housing over the past couple of years, so let me just repeat the basics. Back in 2002 and 2003, low interest rates made buying a house look like a very good deal. As people piled into housing, however, prices rose -- and people began assuming that they would keep on rising. So the boom fed on itself: borrowers began taking out loans they couldn't really afford and lenders began relaxing their standards.
 Eventually the bubble had to burst, and when it did it left us with prices way out of line with reality and a huge overhang of unsold properties. This in turn has caused a plunge in housing construction and a lot of mortgage defaults. And the experience of past boom-and-bust cycles in housing tells us that it should be several years at least before things return to normal.
 I've written less about oil prices, so let me emphasize two points about the oil situation. First, we're now in our third year of very high oil prices by historical standards -- prices as high, even when adjusted for inflation, as those that prevailed in the early 1980s, after the Islamic revolution in Iran. Second, unlike the energy crises of the past, this price surge has happened even though there hasn't been any major disruption in world oil supply.
 It's pretty clear what's happening: economic development is colliding with geology. 
 The ''peak oil'' theorists may or may not be right in asserting that world oil production is already as high as it will ever go -- anyone who really knows what's going in Saudi Arabia's fields, please drop me a line -- but finding new oil is getting a lot harder. Meanwhile, emerging economies, especially in Asia, are burning ever more oil as they get richer. With demand soaring and supply growth sluggish at best, high prices are what you get.
 So why did people seem so shocked by a few more bad housing and oil numbers? What I guess I didn't realize was how deep the denial still runs.
 Over the last couple of years a peculiar conviction emerged among some analysts -- mainly, for some reason, among those with right-wing political leanings -- that the housing bubble was a myth and that the real bubble was in oil prices. 
 Each new peak in oil prices was met with declarations that it was all speculation -- like the 2005 prediction by Steve Forbes that oil was in a ''huge bubble'' and that its price would be down to $35 or $40 a barrel within a year. And on the other side, as recently as this January, National Review's Buzzcharts column declared that we were having a ''pop-free'' housing slowdown.
 I didn't think many people believed this stuff, but the market's sudden freakout over housing and oil suggests that I was wrong.
 Anyway, now reality is settling in. And there's one more thing worth mentioning: the economic expansion that began in 2001, while it has been great for corporate profits, has yet to produce any significant gains for ordinary working Americans. And now it looks as if it never will.

HEADLINE: Meeting on Aiding 2 Million Iraqi Refugees Highlights Divisions

BYLINE: By HASSAN M. FATTAH; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, July 26 

 BODY:
Diplomats and other delegates met here on Thursday to try to find ways to resolve the plight of more than two million Iraqi refugees estimated to be in Jordan, Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East, but they stopped short of proposing any concrete solutions. 
 The meeting, a follow-up to a conference of Iraq's neighbors and donor states in May in Sharm el Sheikh, Egypt, was intended to help develop a strategy for settling the growing refugee crisis. But it served only to underscore the divided interests of host states that are seeking aid to cover the cost of having the refugees, and those of Iraq and donor states, which are seeking a long-term solution to the escalating crisis. 
 ''I personally would not consider this a successful meeting,'' said Mohammad Hamoud, an Iraqi deputy foreign minister and one of the leaders of Thursday's meeting. ''It was an exhibition of the problems we face, but did little in the way of proposing solutions.'' He also accused host states of treating the refugees harshly, subjecting them to long waits at the border, only to be refused entry in many cases. He asked the host states to ease restrictions on the refugees. 
 About 750,000 refugees now live in Jordan, and 1.5 million live in Syria, most growing destitute and facing a cooler welcome from their hosts. Under Jordanian and Syrian laws, the Iraqis are considered guests living there on visas, and are not eligible for the same protections and benefits as other refugees. Humanitarian and aid groups have been limited in the kinds of support and help they can offer the refugees. 
 The Bush administration is coming under increased pressure from Congress and its international allies to come up with a response to the Iraqi refugee problem. But so far, most of the American efforts, both from Congress and the administration, have focused on trying to find a way to help Iraqis whose lives might be in danger because they worked with or aided the United States in Iraq.
 Democrats, led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, have been pushing legislation to increase the number of Iraqi employees of the American government allowed to take refuge in the United States.
 ''Many Iraqis have been working with our armed forces, our diplomatic mission and our reconstruction teams in Iraq and have performed valiantly, and their lives are at risk,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a statement on Monday. ''America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bull's-eye on their back because of their association with our government.''
 Administration officials say they are addressing the issues by trying to reduce violence in Iraq, by providing money -- $150 million this year -- for Iraqi refugee assistance and by increasing the number of Iraqi refugees who can be resettled in the United States.
 Earlier this month, Ryan C. Crocker, the United States ambassador to Iraq, sent a cable to Washington pressing the Bush administration to grant immigrant visas to all Iraqis employed by the American government. Administration officials said that Mr. Crocker's sentiments were echoed throughout the State Department, but conceded that there remained a gap between words and action on the issue.
 In Amman, Thursday's meeting included delegates from Iraq, Syria, Egypt, the Arab League and United Nations relief organizations, as well as representatives of the United States, the European Union, Turkey, Iran, Russia and Japan, which attended as observers. While the stated focus was on developing an economic, security and infrastructural strategy for dealing with the refugees, aid was the central focus of most of the discussions. 
 ''What people are here for, and what they really want to hear about, is money,'' said a delegate from an international aid group. 
 Mukheimar Abu-Jamous, secretary general of Jordan's Interior Ministry, pleaded for greater international support, and said the influx of refugees had exposed his country to untold security challenges. 
 ''The prevailing security situation in Iraq that prompted this influx of refugees to Jordan has amounted to increased security challenges in our country,'' he said. ''Our security bill has peaked.''
 The human rights group Amnesty International warned Wednesday that the flow of refugees from Iraq was ''threatening a humanitarian crisis that could engulf the region unless concerted international action is taken now.''
 Jordan has grown increasingly concerned that Iraq's sectarian tensions may spill over to its soil, and it fears that growing destitution among the refugees could lead to increased crime. Jordanian delegates at the meeting estimated that Jordan would need more than $1 billion in aid to cover the infrastructural and security costs of taking in the Iraqis. Syria estimated its cost for doing the same at more than $250 million. 
 Mr. Hamoud, the deputy foreign minister, said Iraq had promised to increase an earlier pledge of $25 million in aid for the refugees. ''They have been asking crazy numbers that we cannot deliver,'' he said of the host states. ''We can promise to help the refugees, but we cannot be made responsible for rebuilding other countries' infrastructure.''
 The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that 50,000 people continue to flee Iraq every month, mostly to neighboring Jordan and Syria. An additional two million Iraqis are believed to be displaced within Iraq, many taking refuge in the Kurdish north, which has largely been spared violence. 
 ''The response of the international community must go beyond accepting token numbers of refugees from Iraq -- their assistance must constitute a significant part of the solution to this terrible crisis,'' Malcolm Smart, head of Amnesty International's Middle East and North Africa Program, told The Associated Press on Wednesday. 
 The group called on the United States, the European Union and other developed countries to provide resettlement programs for refugees.

HEADLINE: A Life Defined by Enduring The Worst of Nature, Twice

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
''Tom Crean: Antarctic Explorer,'' a one-man show running at the Irish Repertory Theater, began its life in a London museum as a 15-minute historical re-enactment, the creation of an Irish actor and writer named Aidan Dooley, whose passion onstage belies the encyclopedic economy of his title. 
 Crean was an adventurer for hire, an aficionado of physical misery and member of the Royal Navy who served both Captain Robert Scott and Sir Ernest Shackleton in two attempts to reach the South Pole that cumulatively spanned five eviscerating years. In his lifetime, Crean received only a fraction of the glory bestowed on his employers, but all the horrific thrills: temperatures of 90 degrees below zero, the pain of snow-blinding, the diet of seal flesh. 
 Dressed in the early-20th-century explorer's costume of tent cloth and punctured wool, Mr. Dooley offers an unparalleled portrayal of what it must feel like to experience life-imperiling cold. The clothes don't look as if they could sustain you through a winter in Vermont. Tears turn to steam in the climate he describes, his eyes lit like torch fire. 
 During his mission with Shackleton, Crean survived for months trapped on ice floes, ultimately making his way across an 800-mile stretch of the South Atlantic in a lifeboat. And these were tortures to which he committed himself after the considerable trials of his three-year expedition with Scott.
 So what was Crean thinking and why did he bother? It is the question that keeps gnawing at you, but Mr. Dooley remains decidedly uninterested in the psychological roots of Crean's relentlessness. At two hours the play is certainly long enough to accommodate the inquiry, but Mr. Dooley indulges in narrative where he ought to supply analysis. (No one-man show should exceed 90 minutes unless the one man performing it is Will Ferrell or Jesus.)
 Crean never reached the South Pole. That he didn't matters not at all. It isn't the destination; it is the journey. Mr. Dooley's effort so vividly embodies that maxim, you almost start to believe it.
 ''Tom Crean: Antarctic Explorer'' continues through Sept. 9 at the Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737.

 Museums
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THE SHAPES OF SPACE,' through Sept. 5. The Guggenheim takes time off from thematic blockbusters to bring the public up to date on recent acquisitions, provocatively installed by three younger curators among an astute selection of older works from the collection. The theme is space, one of modern art's central concerns. The results are mixed, but cause for optimism. It is not every day you can look at a Mondrian while listening to disco and rap music emanating from another kind of grid: the flashing patterns of a digitized dance floor by Piotr Uklanski. The atmosphere can get a bit mall-like at times, but this is what every New York museum needs to do more: play with the collection and find new ways to bring it to life. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.

 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JOURNEYS: MAPPING THE EARTH AND MIND IN CHINESE ART,' through Aug. 26. Every six months or so, the Met rotates all the work in its Chinese painting galleries to preserve the delicate silks and papers, and each time the curator in charge, Maxwell K. Hearn, produces a new and illuminating thematic exhibition, as is the case with ''Journeys.'' Outward-bound and inward-bound are the directions taken by Chinese landscape painting, and it carries us on some fascinating voyages in a show that mixes classical and contemporary art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'RICHARD SERRA SCULPTURE: 40 YEARS,' through Sept. 10. This retrospective is a landmark by a titan of sculpture. At 67, Mr. Serra is still nudging the language of abstraction, constructing ever more awesome mazes of looming Cor-Ten steel. His ''Torqued Ellipses'' and ''Torqued Toruses'' and other recent works like ''Band'' and ''Sequence'' have their origins in pieces he did 40 years ago in rubber and lead, as this retrospective handsomely affirms, but these are nonetheless unprecedented variations on the theme of dumbfounding spirals and loops. These shapes and experiences are new. That's about the best, and the rarest, compliment you can give to any artist. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Michael Kimmelman)
 NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY: 'NATURE AND THE AMERICAN VISION: THE HUDSON RIVER SCHOOL AT THE NEW-YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY,' through Feb. 25. The third show in a series on Hudson River School paintings from the collection argues that the idea of an American landscape filled with ''sacred'' sites is as much a cultural invention as it is an accident of nature. Thomas Cole's epic series of imaginary landscape paintings, ''The Course of Empire,'' is the centerpiece. Other works look back to the Old World, borrowing ideas about the European Grand Tour to create an American Grand Tour of natural sites along the Hudson, the Catskills, the Adirondacks and farther westward. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org.

 ALEX HAY: 'NEW PAINTINGS' In the 1960s this painter pitted Pop, Photo Realism and abstraction against one another. Now he has turned to ''found'' abstractions: enlarged replications of weathered, peeling boards. Made with an elaborate process of stenciling and spray painting, they lean toward the modernist monochrome, while keeping one foot planted in trompe l'oeil. Peter Freeman Inc., 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Aug. 3. (Smith)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 'AGITATION AND REPOSE' This group show opens with a very anxious object: a wall clock with spinning hands, by Via Lewandowsky. It continues with Rainer Ganahl's bicycle ride into oncoming traffic and Holly Zausner's body-ladened tour of Berlin, and concludes with Claire Watkins's sculpture of what appears to be a detached nervous system. The real draw, though, is a group of six short videos by, and starring, the excellent Roman Signer. In one, a helicoptor buzzes him in bed; in another, hay explodes through the floor as he sits reading; in a third, a sudden explosion prompts him to start -- and finish -- a painting. Repose has never been Mr. Signer's thing. Tanya Bonakdar Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, (212) 414-4144, tanyabonakdargallery.com, through Aug. 17. (Cotter)
 'COLOUR BEFORE COLOR' The spelling discrepancy in the show's title is meant to indicate that color photography as we now know it was not the exclusive achievement of Americans like William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, but was also nurtured by a group of European photographers whose efforts range from the subtle still lifes of Luigi Ghirri (which are similar to those of Irving Penn) to claustrophobic close-ups of sun bathers by the Spanish photographer Carlos Perez Siquier. The show, organized by the British photographer Martin Parr, is a must-see for anyone interested in the medium. Hasted Hunt, 529 West 20th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedhunt.com, through Aug. 17. (Smith)
 'A POINT IN SPACE IS A PLACE FOR AN ARGUMENT' Despite its title, taken from the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, this group show of 56 works by 30 artists is fairly even-tempered, less about argument than unexpected connections. With special attention to the margins and physical process, it ranges across generations, styles and mediums, gathering together works by Lynda Benglis, Bruce Nauman, Niki de Saint Phalle, Forrest Bess, Joe Overstreet, Cathy Wilkes, Raoul De Keyser, Al Taylor and Andre Cadere. Common ground is a shared opposition to tradition, standard definitions of greatness, accepted notions of material or finish, or the separation of art mediums. David Zwirner Gallery, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Aug. 10. (Smith)
 'PROMISED LAND' Blink and you could be standing in the American wing of a big survey museum, only Americana here is delivered with a twist: a painting with a hunter standing over a pile of wildlife booty; a pencil drawing of Ben Franklin sitting cross-legged with an eagle ready to pounce; a tattered Confederate flag made with bubble gum and hung from a twig. The show, organized by Elizabeth M. Grady, takes its title from John Salvest's illuminated sign with black vinyl letters spelling out the words ''Promised Land.'' Like much of the work here, the sign, bordered with blinking red lights, offers sardonic commentary on the contemporary state of the Union. Morgan Lehman, 317 10th Avenue, at 28th Street, (212) 268-2699, morganlehmangallery.com, through Aug. 4. (Schwendener)
 Last Chance
 'AUTOMATIC' Organized by the artist Chris Churchill, this lively exhibition crosses generations and styles to argue that the automatist drawings and rebellious attitudes of artists like Roberto Matta and Arshile Gorky were given figurative form by H. C. Westermann and Peter Saul and passed on to a younger generation that includes Jason Fox, Chloe Piene, David Korty and Taylor McKimens. Whatever. There is much to look at and a few notable outside-the-beltway entries, especially works by Isaac Lin, Fritz Welch and Joseph Ayers, who is represented by a giant graphite drawing of a giant whose legs bear an uncanny resemble to the forest he surveys. Franklin Parrasch Gallery, 20 West 57th Street, (212) 246-5360, franklinparrasch.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'KINDRED SPIRITS: ASHER B. DURAND AND THE AMERICAN LANDSCAPE' This show of about 60 works by Durand has as its centerpiece ''Kindred Spirits'' (1849), a tribute to the landscapist Thomas Cole and his friend the poet and journalist William Cullen Bryant. A founder of the Hudson River School, Durand (1796-1886) favored the realistic approach to landscape. He explored forest interiors with close attention to the ways of trees, foliage, rocks and ground cover in smaller works, while his larger and more elaborate exhibition pictures, influenced by European masters, are Arcadian visions suffused with light, color and atmospheric perspective. The show reveals Durand's strong sense of artistic mission and his potent role in shaping the aesthetic of 19th-century America. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Grace Glueck)
 COLBY BIRD AND JOSHUA FIELDS This two-person exhibition manages to look like both a one-person show and a group show. The works are disparate, rough around the edges and tilted a little too steeply toward the boys-will-be-boys end of the spectrum. Mr. Bird's sculptures include a refrigerator precariously packed with malt liquor, a kind of maw made of fluorescent lights and ceiling tile, and tumbleweed fenced inside a real barbed-wire fence. Mr. Fields focuses on Kurt Cobain's suicide note; Chris Farley's birth and death certificates; various feats of urination; and, in the best work here, a fictional album titled ''Suicidal Tendencies.'' Two copies of it rotate on turntables on opposite sides of the gallery, making only scratching sounds and no discernible progress. There's plenty of ingenuity here, but the ideas are mostly received. CRG Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 229-2766, crggallery.com, closes today. (Smith)
 'CREATIVE GROWTH' The talent just about jumps off the wall in this show of work by nine disabled adults who attend the Creative Growth Art Center in Oakland, Calif. The sensibilities might be divided between those who emphasize order and concentrated forms and those whose dispersed patterns or lines vibrate in time with the chaos of the universe. But either way their efforts, which include painting, drawing and sculpture, mesmerize. Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 MARTIN KIPPENBERGER: 'PREIS BILDER' Seven canvases from two series of paintings rarely exhibited in this country play on the double German meaning of preis (price and prize), some variation of which appears on each surface. They show this famous bad-boy sculptor conveying his usual sarcasm in surprisingly beautiful terms that couldn't get much flatter. Hard-edged and brushy techniques contrast the main tactics of formalist painting while converting the Modernist grid into designs redolent of drapery and checked tablecloths. A preponderance of hot pink argues for the pleasure principle. 1018 Art, 1018 Madison Avenue, near 78th Street, (212) 537-0453, 1018art.net, closes today. (Smith) 
 LOU LAURITA: 'THERE'S A PARTY GOING ON' Art and language are one and the same in Lou Laurita's large gouache paintings, which mix images from coloring books, pornography and 19th-century botanicals with words lifted from song lyrics and personal profiles found on the Internet. The interweaving of elements is ingenious enough to yield several levels of reading -- all the words and images spell out larger words -- but the work moves beyond cleverness to convey yearning, rage and melancholy, usually simultaneously. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224, closes Thursday. (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'FRANK STELLA: PAINTING INTO ARCHITECTURE,'. Crammed into a gallery that feels like an obstacle course, this exhibition spans 43 years with 25 paintings, reliefs, drawings and architectural models, all with the goal of tracing an evolution that has not yet occurred. Taking up most of the space are enlarged versions of models that are considered sculptures. The main draws are the examples of the paintings and reliefs that are the basis of Mr. Stella's importance as an artist. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org, closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 'NEW ECONOMY' This has been a busy year for Joao Ribas, who became a curator at the Drawing Center and now has organized ''New Economy,'' a show that looks at art practices in the global information economy. As you might expect, the Internet is addressed, but old-economy titans like Karl Marx and Adam Smith get some play too. Over all, however, the show's premise feels somewhat dated. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, SoHo, (212) 226-3970, artistspace.org, closes tomorrow. (Schwendener)
 'NOT YOUR PARENTS' MTV: MUSIC VIDEOS FROM HELL' The six artists and artist teams in this show do creative things with music video, but the most energetically demonic is Kenneth Tin-Kin Hung's ''Because Washington Is Hollywood for Ugly People.'' A hilarious portrayal of the nation's current, disastrous leadership set to the music of MC Paul Barman, it adds very sharp teeth and a bit of scatology to the hot colors and dense collages of 1960s psychedelia. Although Mr. Hung has a well-known Web site (kintin.com), this is the first time his work has been exhibited in New York. Don't miss it. Postmasters, 459 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 7277-3323, postmastersart.com, closes tomorrow. (Smith)
 CHRISTIAN TOMASZEWSKI: 'ON CHAPELS, CAVES AND EROTIC MISERY' The Polish-born, New York-based artist Christian Tomaszewski breaks down film's ''fourth wall'' by inviting viewers to enter his version of David Lynch's ''Blue Velvet.'' Installed in the basement of SculptureCenter are re-creations of locations and dollhouse-size models of objects from the movie, as well as other tableaus. Problems arise when he tries to merge the ''Blue Velvet'' angle with aspects of Kurt Schwitters's ''Merzbau'' to explore the collision of Postmodern and Modern ideas and aesthetics. Mr. Tomaszewski might be accused of overreaching, but he offers plenty to think about: memory, representation and America as seen through both his eyes and Mr. Lynch's. The SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org, closes on Sunday. (Schwendener) 
 'YOU ALWAYS MOVE IN REVERSE' Bjarne Melgaard, who had a memorably assaultive solo at the late, lamented Alleged Gallery in Chelsea a few years ago, says that he conceived this group show as a swipe at the ''teenage rebellion thing.'' He enlisted some good artists to press his point, among them Jason Dodge, Richard Hawkins, Jeff Ono and B. Wutz. But the occasion is mainly notable for marking the return of Lydia Lunch, a true-blue rebel, whose one-time-only performance in the gallery surely outshone the photographs by her in the show. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com, closes on Tuesday. (Cotter)

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo to Limit Subprime Lending

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif., July 26 (AP) -- The mortgage division of Wells Fargo said Thursday that it planned to withdraw from the increasingly risky business of issuing home loans through brokers to borrowers with blemished credit records. 
 The move is the latest response to decay in the subprime mortgage industry, which lends to people with spotty credit histories. As interest rates have risen and home values have been stagnant or have fallen in parts of the country, many of these borrowers have defaulted.
 Wells Fargo ranks among the sector's largest lenders but has been relatively unscathed by the bad loans that have led to the closing or bankruptcies of more than two dozen subprime lenders since late last year.
 Wells Fargo said the subprime wholesale lending business represented 1.6 percent of the bank's $397.6 billion in mortgage lending in 2006. But the ''continued turmoil'' in the sector is not worth the risk, said Cara K. Heiden, president of Wells Fargo's home mortgage division.
 The bank said it still planned to issue subprime loans, but not through brokers.

MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, show times and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'BRAND UPON THE BRAIN' (No rating, 96 minutes) A baroque entertainment with one foot in silent cinema and the other gingerly toeing the sound waves, Guy Maddin's latest centers on a man who, in visiting a now-emptied foundling home, journeys deep into his childhood. It's wild! It's weird! It's strangely touching and a total must-see! (Manohla Dargis)
 'BROKEN ENGLISH' (PG-13, 93 minutes) This low-key comedy, about a romance-scarred professional woman named Nora Wilder (Parker Posey) who invigorates her life with help from a handsome, sensitive, fedora-clad Frenchman (Melvil Poupaud), is a textbook example of an Indiewood film: a Hollywood fantasy wrapped in plain brown paper. Written and directed by the first-time feature filmmaker Zoe Cassavetes, daughter of the pioneering independent director John Cassavetes, ''Broken English'' seems blithely unaware of the bait-and-switch that it will ultimately pull. 
 (Matt Zoller Seitz) 
 'CAPTIVITY' (R, 98 minutes) This latest example of torture as entertainment uses the abduction and abuse of a vain supermodel (Elisha Cuthbert) to remind us that attractive women need to be kept in their place. Arriving in theaters front-loaded with a controversial billboard campaign (depicting the ''Abduction,'' ''Confinement,'' ''Torture'' and ''Termination'' of its star), as well as a rare censure from the Motion Picture Association of America, the movie has been thoroughly eclipsed by its marketing. Yet despite the controversy, this dreary game of punish-the-tease is no more than a desperate attempt to cling to the buzz of ''Saw'' before fans are distracted by the next shiny power tool. 
 (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'EVAN ALMIGHTY' (PG, 89 minutes) Your average Sunday school lesson about Noah and the flood is likely to be funnier, smarter and more theologically coherent -- to say nothing of cheaper to produce -- than this drab, timid attempt to wring laughs from religion. (A. O. Scott)
 'FANTASTIC FOUR: RISE OF THE SILVER SURFER' (PG, 95 minutes) The only thing that rises in this stinker are low expectations. (Dargis)
 '1408' (PG-13, 94 minutes) In this stylish but derivative adaptation of a Stephen King short story, John Cusack plays a writer investigating a series of grisly deaths in Room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel in Manhattan. Mikael Hafstrom directs with old-fashioned restraint and a stylish use of intense close-ups, and while the Dolphin is no Overlook (the hotel in ''The Shining''), its old-world creepiness is exactly right. (Catsoulis)
 'GHOSTS OF CITE SOLEIL' (No rating, 85 minutes, in English, Haitian and French) In making this intimate documentary about street fighters in Haiti at a time of political turmoil, Asger Leth had remarkable access, but in the end he relies more on attitude than on insight. (Scott) 
 'GOYA'S GHOSTS' (R, 113 minutes) This new feature from the director Milos Forman (''Amadeus,''''Man on the Moon'') is an unwieldy mix of political satire and lavish period soap opera. Set in 18th-century Spain and covering the last phase of the Inquisition and Napoleon's occupation, it resembles the Oscar-baiting epics that mixed art-house swagger, Hollywood glitz and shout-outs to liberal common wisdom. Stellan Skarsgaard plays Goya, whose narrative presence is more marginal than the title suggests; Javier Bardem is Brother Lorenzo, the monk investigating the disappearance of one of Goya's models, Inez (Natalie Portman), who is being held incommunicado and tortured for the crime of having a Jewish ancestor. (Seitz)
 HAIRSPRAY (PG, 107 minutes) It's no surprise that this musical -- adapted from the Broadway show that was adapted from the John Waters movie -- is good-hearted. It's about fighting prejudice by singing and dancing. The surprise is that it's actually good, including the singing and dancing. (Scott)
 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (PG-13, 138 minutes) The fifth installment in the series brings the young wizard into political-thriller territory, and also into a struggle with his own anger and isolation. Imelda Staunton joins the impressive roster of great British actors who have taught Defense Against the Dark Arts at Hogwarts. (Scott)
 'HOLLYWOOD DREAMS' (R, 100 minutes) Filled with movie memories and gender confusion, Henry Jaglom's 15th and most accessible film finds him in a gentler, more wistful mood. Using a rabidly fame-smitten starlet (Tanna Frederick) as his fulcrum, Mr. Jaglom muses over the burdens of fame and the price of success. Knowing but never jaded, the movie is driven by Ms. Frederick's no-boundaries commitment to her broken character, a performance that's as startling as it is touching. (Catsoulis)
 'I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU CHUCK & LARRY' (PG-13, 110 minutes) ... and completely stupid. (Dargis)
 'IN SEARCH OF MOZART' (No rating, 129 minutes) Made to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth, Phil Grabsky's adamantly linear documentary is a myth-busting stride through a prodigiously talented life. Though occasionally losing itself in the reverence of a slew of musical titans, the movie best serves its prolific subject when attending to the music itself and the breathless enthusiasms of its performers. (Catsoulis)
 'INTERVIEW' (R, 83 minutes) Diverting if dishonest cat and mouse, with Steve Buscemi (who also directed) as a self-serious journalist who says he doesn't really want to interview Sienna Miller's tabloid celebrity. (Dargis) 
 'INTRODUCING THE DWIGHTS' (R, 104 minutes) You don't really want to meet them -- at least not the mother, a needy stand-up comedian egregiously overacted by Brenda Blethyn. Her sons are sweet enough, though, and one of them has a charming girlfriend. (Scott)
 'KNOCKED UP' (R, 129 minutes) Foul of mouth and true of heart, this new comedy from Judd Apatow (''The 40-Year-Old Virgin'') captures the sexual and moral confusion of the present moment remarkably well. Seth Rogen and Katherine Heigl are unlikely bedfellows but perfect comic foils as a shlub-babe couple whose one-night stand leans to an unintended but not unwelcome pregnancy. (Scott)
 'LADY CHATTERLEY' (No rating, 168 minutes, in French) Translating D. H. Lawrence into French, Pascale Ferran has made a bracingly sexy, unfailingly insightful examination of nature, desire and the powerful connection between them. (Scott)
 LIVE-IN MAID (No rating, 83 minutes, in Spanish) This small, perfect film from Argentina follows two women, an upper-class dowager (Norma Aleandro) and her housekeeper (Norma Argentina), whose relationship is altered, for good and for ill, by economic distress. (Scott)
 'A MIGHTY HEART' (R, 108 minutes) Michael Winterbottom's jolting film about the failed search for the Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is a surprising, insistently political work of commercial art. As Mariane Pearl, Angelina Jolie stars without stealing the show. (Dargis)
 'MY BEST FRIEND' (PG-13, 95 minutes, in French) This sentimental comic fable about Francois, a middle-aged antiques dealer (Daniel Auteuil) in search of true friendship, is sustained by the director Patrice Leconte's eye for detail and his cast's discipline and intelligence. Dany Boon is Bruno, the gregarious taxi driver and trivia buff who seems to be the man of Francois's dreams. (Scott) 
 'OCEAN'S THIRTEEN' (PG-13, 113 minutes) The gang's all here, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure. Steven Soderbergh shoots and directs, while George Clooney, Brad Pitt and the rest hustle and flow. (Dargis) 
 'ONCE' (R, 88 minutes) A modest, scruffy movie about two musicians who meet on a Dublin street and sort of fall in love. Charming, touching and true. (Scott) 
 'PARIS JE T'AIME' (R, 120 minutes, in French and English) ''Paris Je T'Aime,'' a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits, the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served one. (Holden)
 'PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END' (PG-13, 167 minutes) This third and perhaps final episode in Gore Verbinski's swishy, swashbuckling saga wisely returns to the high-seas high jinks that made the first film so enjoyable. In service to a typically convoluted plot -- involving British perfidy, pieces of eight and a Godzilla-size sorceress -- all the usual suspects return to lie, swindle and marvel at Keith Richards's longevity, if not his line delivery. Jack Sparrow hallucinates, Barbossa agitates, and Elizabeth Swann is elected Pirate King. Really. Mr. Verbinski knows who wears the trousers in his trilogy. (Catsoulis) 
 'RATATOUILLE' (G, 110 minutes) A flawless work of popular art from Brad Bird and Pixar. A portrait of the artist as a young rat with haute cuisine dreams. (Scott) 
 'RESCUE DAWN' (PG-13, 96 minutes) The writer and director Werner Herzog (''Aguirre: The Wrath of God'') has remade his 1997 documentary, ''Little Dieter Needs to Fly,'' as a bruising P.O.W. escape picture. Christian Bale plays Dieter Dengler, an assimilated German-American Navy pilot who is shot down over Laos during his first Vietnam War mission, and survives torture and starvation in a prison camp before plotting a daring escape. The movie showcases Mr. Herzog's eye for terrifyingly beautiful landscapes, and a rare understanding of the deep platonic love that blossoms between men in dire circumstances. (Seitz) 
 'SHREK THE THIRD' (PG, 93 minutes) The ogre faces impending fatherhood and a career crisis. (Scott) 
 'SICKO' (PG-13, 123 minutes) Michael Moore's polemic against American health care -- and, more pointedly, in favor of a state-supported system -- is maddening, moving and funny. An excellent spur to further debate. (Scott)
 'SUNSHINE' (R, 108 minutes) The end may be nigh in this spooky and spookily beautiful science fiction thriller -- the Sun is dying, as is, alas, poor Earth -- but the director Danny Boyle is having a grand old time. (Dargis) 'SURF'S UP' (PG, 90 minutes) Treading eagerly on the flippers of last year's ''Happy Feet'' comes this ho-hum computer-animated comedy featuring birds on boards. As a young Rockhopper penguin (voiced by Shia LaBeouf) heads for his first professional surfing competition, he learns about love, perseverance and that winning isn't everything. Though infused with a friendly blue-collar vibe, the movie suggests that a moratorium on penguins might be called for -- despite the inevitable anthropomorphic void. (Catsoulis) 
 'TALK TO ME' (R, 118 minutes) The life of Petey Greene, a real-life Washington radio host, inspired this rousing, raucous movie, which rises above biopic conventions thanks to two first-rate performances: Don Cheadle as Greene and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Dewey Hughes, the uptight station manager who was Greene's partner and friend (Scott) 
 'TRANSFORMERS' (PG-13, 144 minutes) Based on the popular children's toy, Michael Bay's bumper-to-bumper pileup of big cars, big guns and big breasts is part car commercial, part military recruitment ad. (Dargis) 
 'WAITRESS' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Keri Russell is a small-town waitress in a bad marriage who finds solace in pie-baking and adultery in Adrienne Shelly's wry and winning final feature. (Scott)
 'YOU KILL ME' (R, 92 minutes) With its shadows and gallows humor, ''You Kill Me'' goes about as dark as a comedy can go before turning into tragedy or self-parody. John Dahl directs, and Ben Kingsley stars with a bullet. (Dargis)

 SCANNERS: THE 2007 NEW YORK VIDEO FESTIVAL (Today through Sunday) Under one name or another, this annual presentation of new work on video has been around for 16 years, long enough to see the technology shift from analog to digital. The video aesthetic has changed along with the technology, with a lessened emphasis on reportage and a greater sense of visual pleasure. Highlights from the three-day festival include ''Circuits Maximus,'' a live program that matches musicians with video artists (tonight); the traditional review of the year in music video, led by the critic Armond White (tomorrow); ''Passion and Power: The Technology of Orgasm,'' by Emiko Omori and Wendy Slick (tomorrow); and ''Postcards From the Edge,'' a collection of nine short works engaged in the project, according to the program notes, of ''constructing and deconstructing the eccentricities of politics and culture'' (Sunday). Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 875-5600, filmlinc.org; $11.

 UNEASY RIDERS: AMERICAN FILM IN THE NIXON YEARS, 1970-1974 (Tomorrow and Sunday) Here's a different approach to a body of work -- the ''new'' Hollywood of the early 1970s -- that's usually treated as apolitically, as the triumph of a handful of young geniuses (Scorsese, Spielberg, Coppola) over an antediluvian studio system. David Schwartz, the chief curator of the Museum of the Moving Image, has chosen 22 films from that fateful time frame to screen over the next six weeks, highlighting the social and political tensions that also helped to shape the American cinema of the '70s. The program starts tomorrow with Monte Hellman's eternally controversial, eternally brilliant ''Two-Lane Blacktop'' (1971), followed by one of the best of John Huston's late films, the seedy boxing drama ''Fat City'' (1972). On Sunday, the director Jerry Schatzberg will introduce his superb first feature, ''Puzzle of a Downfall Child'' (1970); later there's a rare opportunity to see Barbara Loden's neglected masterpiece, ''Wanda'' (1970), on a big screen. Museum of the Moving Image, 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $10. (Kehr)
 DIETRICH AND GARBO: SCREEN GODDESSES (Tomorrow and Sunday) At Symphony Space, a series devoted to the work of two of Hollywood's most famous immigrant workers continues this weekend with a double feature of Josef von Sternberg's all but abstract 1932 study in light and shadow, ''Shanghai Express,'' with Marlene Dietrich, and Greta Garbo in Clarence Brown's 1935 adaptation of ''Anna Karenina.''

GRAPHIC: Photo: 'THE SILENT CITY: NEW YORK IN THE MOVIES, 1898-1928' ''In New York and other big cities,'' Buster Keaton wrote in his autobiography, ''crowds will always hamper your work.'' Especially if you're a big star, as Keaton was in 1928, the year he made ''The Cameraman,'' above, his last great feature and his first movie for MGM. Elaborate plans to film on location were scrapped when he was mobbed on city streets, and most of the movie was shot in Hollywood, but no matter: it makes a lovely start to Film Forum's series ''The Silent City: New York in the Movies, 1898-1928,'' on Monday nights through Aug. 27. All the Keaton poetry is here in this tale of a tintype photographer whose desire to impress a girl, Sally (Marceline Day), leads him to great feats and disasters as a newsreel cameraman. There's Keaton the actor (watch how he nestles his head onto Sally's shoulder, a picture of bliss)
Keaton the physical marvel (running to catch up with a bus, he leaps, lands neatly with legs outstretched on a fender and resumes his chat with Sally)
Keaton the accidental avant-gardist (the film he shoots for the newsreel company suggests the experimentation of Dziga Vertov's ''Man With a Movie Camera,'' a Soviet masterpiece of 1929)
and, everywhere, Keaton the virtuoso (his solitary baseball game in an empty Yankee Stadium is just one example). Signing with MGM, Keaton later said, was ''the worst mistake of my career.'' It meant scripts, schedules, regimentation
after this film he would never again work in the free, improvisatory way that was so essential to his genius. If ''The Cameraman'' is for the ages, ''Speedy,'' the 1928 Harold Lloyd vehicle sharing Monday's double bill, is beautifully of its age, the Jazz Age, which perhaps found its purest physical expression in New York. Lloyd's Speedy, a cabbie in a hurry, races up and down city streets, at one point picking up Babe Ruth, in a nifty cameo. ''Gee, Babe,'' Speedy says, ''you've done more for baseball than cheese did for Switzerland.''

HEADLINE: Home Builders Post Steep Losses As Value of Unsold Land Slips

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
D. R. Horton, one of the nation's largest home builders, posted a third-quarter loss after writing down the value of unused land and warned there was no recovery in sight for the troubled housing industry. 
 Another home builder, Beazer Homes USA, which faces federal investigations of company practices and personnel, also said it swung to a loss in its fiscal third quarter after cutting prices to spur sales and taking charges to write down the value of unsold inventory.
 Shares of Horton lost 32 cents, to $17.16. Beazer Homes fell $1.48, or almost 9 percent, to $15.56. Horton executives had braced for a poor spring, normally the best time of year to sell houses, but the results in the April-June quarter were even weaker than expected.
 ''It is now clear that the selling season did not materialize this year,'' said Horton's chief executive, Donald J. Tomnitz, adding that it was unclear when a housing recovery would begin. ''We don't see one on the horizon.''
 Horton was pushed to a loss by pretax charges of $852 million that reflect the lower value of land and other holdings, and $426 million in the value of Horton's intangibles, such as brand name.
 With the write-down charge, Horton said it lost $823.8 million, or $2.62 a share, in the quarter, in contrast to a gain of $292.8 million, or 93 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Analysts said they were stunned by the size of the write-offs, which were equal to about 8 percent of Horton's equity.
 Mr. Tomnitz said sales and prices were stabilizing in Florida and the Northeast.
 ''We're still struggling in California,'' he added. He said many buyers could not afford to buy housing without ''unusual'' loans that are no longer easy to get, like mortgages with little or no down payment.
 Beazer Homes posted a loss of $123 million, or $3.20 a share, in contrast to a year ago, when it earned $102.6 million, or $2.37 a share.
 The latest quarter included pretax charges of $188.5 million to write down the value of inventory and good will and to forfeit options on land.
 Beazer Homes previously disclosed that it had received a subpoena from the United States attorney's office in the Western District of North Carolina, seeking documents on the company's mortgage origination services. The Securities and Exchange Commission has started a formal investigation of Beazer Homes to determine whether any person or entity related to the company violated federal securities laws.
 Beazer Homes said most of its markets had an excess of houses for sale, forcing it to lower prices. The company also blamed higher interest rates and tighter lending standards for crimping already-soft demand.
 Like D. R. Horton, Beazer Homes said it could not predict when market conditions would improve.

HEADLINE: The Case for Trade

 BODY:
Trade has been getting an unfair beating from Democrats. Party leaders backpedaled from their agreement with the White House to approve free trade pacts with Peru and Panama and are opposing the agreement with South Korea. They also refused to extend so-called fast track authority, which guarantees a simple up or down vote on trade deals. And Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama -- playing to the campaign crowds -- are backing legislation that would punish China for manipulating its currency and, not incidentally, could trigger an ugly trade war. 
 Yet for all their concern about globalization's impact on American workers, Democrats are going after the wrong targets. It is true that wages for most workers are going nowhere. Many fear for their jobs. But, as many centrist Democrats have argued for years, throttling trade would end up hurting a lot more people than it helped. 
 There are several ideas worth considering to assist the workers who lose their jobs because of trade or other forces buffeting the American economy. More progressive taxation can also be used to mitigate the impact of stagnating wages. But for American incomes to keep growing, the nation needs to embrace globalization, not turn against it. 
 Trade expands access to foreign markets for American exporters and multiplies the choice of products for producers and consumers. Foreign competition also spurs productivity growth at home. Economists at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics estimate that growth in trade since World War II added about $1 trillion a year -- in 2003 dollars -- to America's national income. If the world's remaining barriers to trade and investment were to fall, they say, it would add $500 billion more. 
 The plight of American workers is all too real -- and the Bush administration has shown an astonishing lack of concern. Despite a phenomenal increase in workers' productivity, wages are only marginally higher than they were 25 years ago. Since 2000, earnings have fallen or remained flat, after accounting for inflation, for every category of worker except those with a Ph.D. or a professional graduate degree. Economists blame a host of factors, including technological advances, immigration, a falling minimum wage and a decline in union power. Some studies suggest that trade has played a small role.
 Displaced workers, meanwhile, can expect very little help from the government. Trade Adjustment Assistance, or T.A.A., provides extended unemployment compensation, training and limited wage insurance for displaced workers who are forced to take lower-paying jobs. But it is available only to a very narrow set of manufacturing workers who can verify their jobs were destroyed by trade. 
 What is needed is a more ambitious effort to help both displaced workers and those who keep their jobs but still can't get ahead because of stagnating wages. There are promising policy options. And Democrats would do a lot more for America's workers if they shifted their focus away from bashing trade and toward these ideas. 
 They could start by reforming health insurance to ensure that workers who lose their jobs don't also lose affordable health care. The growing inequity of pretax income can be dealt with through more progressive taxation, which could start with allowing the Bush tax cuts for the rich to expire as scheduled in 2010. Other proposals are also worth serious debate. Democrats in the House and Senate are trying to extend T.A.A., which expires Sept. 30, to cover service workers. But they should consider extending it to all workers who are displaced from their job by economic forces beyond their control, whether through trade or technological change.
 Research suggests that trade inspires less protectionist feelings in countries with bigger governments and bigger social safety nets. Promoting trade and helping America's workers are two ideas that Democrats should get behind.

HEADLINE: Ford Breaks String of Losing Quarters, but Says Respite Will Be Brief

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY and MICHELINE MAYNARD

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich., July 26 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company surprised Wall Street with its first quarterly profit in two years on Thursday, but its respite from red ink will be temporary.
 Ford posted an unexpected $750 million profit during what is traditionally the best-selling season of the year for the car companies, breaking a string of seven consecutive quarterly losses.
 Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, warned, however, that ''substantial losses'' lay ahead in the second half of 2007, when Ford will face cost pressures for rolling out new vehicles as well as pressures from the broader economic slowdown. 
 Ford also confirmed that it was reviewing bids for its British marques, Jaguar and Land Rover, and acknowledged for the first time that it was conducting a business review of Volvo, the first step toward formally putting the Swedish auto company up for sale. It said it expected the review to be completed by year's end.
 The overall profit is Ford's first under Mr. Mulally, who became chief executive last September. Ford shares rose 12 cents Thursday, to close at $8.09.
 ''Our plan is taking hold and producing results. But we have a long way to go,'' Mr. Mulally said in a conference call with reporters and analysts. A few minutes later, he added, ''We will incur substantial losses in both the third and fourth quarters, primarily in North America.''
 For the full year, Mr. Mulally said Ford would lose money, but less than the $3.1 billion it lost last year, excluding revamping charges that pushed its overall loss to $12.7 billion.
 ''We are encouraged by improved results in North American auto, but Ford will need to accelerate its cost reduction activities,'' Jonathan Steinmetz, an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley, wrote in a note to clients.
 Donat R. Leclair, Ford's chief financial officer, said in an interview that the profit was a sign of progress but not of the company's having turned a corner.
 ''It's nice that we made a profit for the quarter, and we're really happy about that, but the plan is to improve, to restructure,'' Mr. Leclair said. ''We believe that we will improve in every quarter going forward, year over year.''
 Ford began a turnaround program in North America in January 2006, and accelerated the plan last fall, shortly after Mr. Mulally joined Ford from Boeing. In that time, more than 30,000 jobs have been cut and thousands more cuts are planned.
 The profit could hinder Ford's efforts to cut labor expenses during contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union this summer. Talks between the U.A.W. and all three Detroit automakers formally began within the last week, and the union's current contract expires Sept. 14.
 But Mr. Mulally said the competitive pressures on Ford had not lessened.
 ''We still lost $279 million in North America,'' he said. ''We have a lot of work to do to get back to profitability. Long term, we need to work on every element of our competitiveness so we can get back and compete with the best in the world.''
 Earlier this week, the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, declined to comment on how Ford's poor finances, relative to its crosstown rivals, would affect talks, adding, ''They have a lot of cash, by the way.''
 Indeed, Ford has more than $37.4 billion in cash on hand, but company executives note that most of it is borrowed. The company raised $23 billion last year by mortgaging most of its North American assets, from factories to its blue oval logo.
 But a sale of its European brands would give Ford a large cash infusion at a critical point in its 104-year history. Analysts predict the three brands collectively could bring in as much as $15 billion.
 ''Clearly, the real opportunity going forward is to integrate and leverage our Ford assets around the world,'' Mr. Mulally said. ''It was just clear to us that it was a good time to review our portfolio and decide the best thing for our brands going forward.''
 The Texas Pacific Group, led by the investor David Bonderman, is among the investment groups interested in Jaguar and Land Rover, a person with direct knowledge of the discussions said Thursday. Others include Cerberus Capital Management, which is buying the Chrysler Group.
 For the second quarter, Ford's overall profit was nearly $1.1 billion better than its performance in the same period a year earlier. Revenue rose 6 percent, to $44.2 billion, as improvements in currency exchange rates, sales mix and net pricing overcame a decrease in overall sales.
 Earnings from continuing operations were $258 million, or 13 cents a share. Analysts expected a 35-cent loss, although the carmaker no longer provides financial guidance.
 Ford posted a profit in all regions except North America, where it lost $279 million; that number is an improvement from a $789 million loss in the second quarter of 2006. The company has said it will not be profitable in North America until at least 2009.
 Revenue declined in North America, to $18.8 billion from $19.1 billion, as sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles declined amid high gasoline prices.
 Bruce Clark, a senior vice president for Moody's Investors Service, said Ford was making ''solid progress'' in improving the quality of its cars and crossover vehicles. But, he said, ''Not only does Ford have to continue delivering better quality vehicles, it has to convince consumers to pay up for them.''

HEADLINE: In This Mess, Finger Pointing Is in Style

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Who's to blame for the subprime mortgage mess? 
 It's the lenders, says William Poole, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. As he sees it, bankers and mortgage brokers persuaded innocent borrowers to take out ARMs -- adjustable rate mortgages -- when rates were all but sure to rise. He also blames investors who bought the mortgage securities that are now in trouble.
 Bankers should take their share of scorn, but they were not the only ones who encouraged borrowers to take out adjustable rate mortgages at precisely the wrong time. So did Alan Greenspan, the longtime chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 In Mr. Poole's view, it was obvious from 2002 to 2004 that short-term interest rates were all but certain to rise, thus driving up the cost of ARMs. But the bankers did not point that out to their customers.
 ''Apparently driven by the prospects of high fee income,'' said Mr. Poole in a speech a week ago, ''mortgage originators persuaded many relatively unsophisticated borrowers to take out these mortgages; then, investors willingly purchased them when they were securitized. Many of these mortgages are now in default, some of the lenders are bankrupt, and the mortgage-backed securities are trading at deep discounts to face value.'' 
 In 2004, however, the Fed sent a different signal. Mr. Greenspan, speaking to Credit Union executives on Feb. 23, said ''recent research within the Federal Reserve suggests that many homeowners might have saved tens of thousands of dollars had they held adjustable rate mortgages rather than fixed rate mortgages during the past decade.'' 
 He conceded that they might suffer if rates rose, but that was not the point he emphasized. Instead, he used option pricing theory to conclude that homeowners were paying a very steep price when they took out fixed rate mortgages.
 ''American consumers might benefit if lenders provided greater mortgage product alternatives to the traditional fixed rate mortgage,'' said the Fed chairman.
 Rarely has an industry done a better job of following a regulator's suggestion. The bankers came up with mortgages that took 40 years to pay off, rather than the customary 30-year amortization period. If that was not enough, they offered loans with negative amortization, so that every month a borrower owed more than he had the month before. People could get mortgages without anyone's checking to see if they had lied about their income.
 Mr. Greenspan may have come to regret his 2004 remarks. In the fall of 2005, he told a group of mortgage bankers that the ''apparent froth in housing markets may have spilled over into mortgage markets.'' He voiced concern over ''more exotic forms of adjustable rate mortgages,'' but said nothing to indicate banks should stop offering them. 
 Had Mr. Poole been willing to talk to me, I would have asked if he thought the Fed bore any responsibility.
 Now the problems are surfacing. Earnings are down at Countrywide Financial, which as David Hendler of CreditSights pointed out, was ''a leader in developing and bringing to the fore many of the innovations that are now adding a certain toxicity to even prime mortgages.''
 Angelo R. Mozilo, Countrywide's chief executive, doesn't think he should be blamed. Talking to analysts this week, he called Mr. Poole's comments ''unbelievable'' and criticized the Fed for first raising interest rates and then forcing banks to tighten their lending standards. 
 When an analyst suggested that Countrywide, the country's largest mortgage lender, should not have made those loans, Mr. Mozilo sounded as if he had no more choice than a lemming going over the cliff. 
 ''Our place in the industry would have changed dramatically because we would have arbitrarily made a decision that was contrary to what everything appeared to be -- values going up and no delinquencies, no foreclosures -- and we suddenly stop the music,'' he said.
 ''Nobody saw this coming,'' he added.
 Actually, there were forecasts of disaster. But Mr. Poole was not among the Cassandras.
 In March of last year, a few months before home prices peaked, he said a housing bubble might be brewing, but that Fed research indicated home prices were not unreasonable.
 ''So, if you have an academic interest in house prices, I recommend that you wait a few years,'' he said. ''If you have a direct financial interest, I can't help much -- you're on your own!''
 That exclamation point was in the text released by the Fed.

HEADLINE: Home Refinancing Program Aims to Help Owners Stay Put

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
New York State and the Federal National Mortgage Association will announce plans today to refinance up to $100 million in mortgages for homeowners who are facing the prospect of higher monthly payments on troubled home loans in the coming months, officials said. 
 The plan, which is called ''Keep the Dream,'' is expected to provide enough money to cover several hundred mortgages. It is similar to programs adopted by several states, including Massachusetts, Ohio and Maryland, that are trying to address, in a limited way, the fallout from the aggressive home loans made during the recent housing boom. 
 In the coming year and a half, mortgage experts say, about $800 billion in adjustable-rate mortgages will reset to higher interest rates. Though most homeowners should be able to refinance, economists worry that many may no longer qualify for a new loan because lenders have become stricter and home prices have been falling in most parts of the country outside Manhattan. 
 ''We believe that there are low- to moderate-income borrowers out there that the conventional market is not lending to,'' said Priscilla Almodovar, chief executive of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, which is overseeing and partially insuring New York's plan.
 The record of state refinancing programs is not extensive. Most states are in the early phases of their efforts and are offering too little money to have a significant impact on the troubled mortgage market. Some have had trouble finding enough qualified borrowers.
 At the federal level, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, has introduced a bill that would offer $300 million in federal funds to refinance and provide counseling for borrowers nationwide who are encountering difficulties. The senator also hopes to raise $600 million from private lenders. 
 Ohio and Massachusetts are raising money by selling taxable bonds that will be repaid by interest from the mortgages. New York will instead finance the program through Fannie Mae, which will sell the loans to investors as mortgage bonds. The state has approached 30 banks and mortgage companies to make loans. 
 Homeowners can qualify as long as they are no more than 60 days behind on their payments. The program, which will begin accepting applications in September, will not be open to those in foreclosure, because the state does not have the resources to assist someone losing a home, Ms. Almodovar said.
 At the end of March, 3.9 percent of all mortgages in New York were past due by 30 days or more and 1.2 percent were in foreclosure, which was down slightly from the end of last year, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Across the nation, 4.3 percent of all mortgages were 30 days past due. 
 The loans can be no bigger than $427,000. Borrowers cannot earn more than 125 percent of the area median income in upstate New York and 165 percent of the area median income in the city and its suburbs.

HEADLINE: 52 Ways to Cool Off, And All of Them Free

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
WITH her fluffy white bath towel, Brenda Gruskin -- taut copper skin, black designer swimsuit, awash in gold jewelry -- claimed a parcel of sun-warmed concrete on the deck of the John Jay Pool on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.
 ''When I tell people I use city pools, they can't believe it,'' she said, surveying the rectangular gulch of wobbling azure water one recent morning, beyond it the East River running swiftly south. ''They think the pools are dirty or rowdy. I tell them, 'The public pools are the best-kept secret in the city.' ''
 That secret is getting out. Last year 1.5 million people visited city pools, and though the pools have long served less-privileged New Yorkers, they are now used by a more diverse population than ever: ethnically, socio-economically; backstrokers, breast-strokers. 
 The pools are luring families, the very young, the very old and also people who can afford more exclusive settings. The reasons: They are safer, and many have undergone renovations recently, including the installation of shade structures, ornamental plantings and spray showers in kiddie pools. Many now offer special lap-swim sessions in the early morning and evening, as well as swimming lessons. And they are free. The city has 1,080 lifeguards this summer, its highest number ever, said Adrian Benepe, the parks commissioner, who noted that city pools get just as crowded as they did pre-air-conditioning.
 ''City pools still serve a primary purpose as an escape for the working class who cannot afford to leave the city in the summer,'' he said. ''But they get a much broader user group and demographic today.''
 The city's 52 outdoor pools are open daily through Labor Day, generally from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. During heat waves they are often kept open until 8. Almost all city pools are about 3 to 4 feet deep throughout.
 In a steamy city these urban oases offer a measure of cool, chlorinated bliss. They are great for people watching and a good way to introduce yourself to a new neighborhood. They are often hubs of neighborhood activity, attracting food vendors, street musicians, family barbecues and general commotion.
 You can walk dripping wet out of Highbridge Pool, in Washington Heights, and within a single block browse a smorgasbord of Dominican food. There is a fruit stand selling containers of sliced mangos for $2; and if you're thirsty, a man with a machete will chop open a coconut and stick a straw in it. Nearby, a woman sells johnnycakes, fried, flat dough snacks, for $1 apiece from her shopping cart, along with the popular Dominican fruit shake known as morir sonando (''to die dreaming''), made from oranges, milk, sugar and chopped ice. Outside the bathhouse trucks parked at the curb sell chimichurri (meat sandwiches) and steaming plates of chicken, pork or beef with rice and beans.
 Oh, right -- the swimming. Well, the entrance is at Amsterdam Avenue and West 173rd Street, and on hot days there are longish lines -- women to the left, men to the right -- cordoned with police barricades.
 One recent sultry afternoon a parks enforcement officer with a megaphone barked at the teenagers in line to behave. The pool -- 220 feet by 162 feet -- was packed, and a dozen lifeguards and parks enforcement officers stood along the side, incessantly whistling young men out of the water for infractions. Outside, young men sized up female bathers for chats between the chain-links.
 The city pools got a black eye some years back when there were headlines about incidents of unruly teenage boys surrounding girls and harassing and groping them. The city has since stepped up security, assigning police officers and parks enforcement officers to pool decks, as well as installing security cameras. The lifeguards are armed with whistles, the parks officers with summons books and nightsticks, and the police with 9-millimeter pistols.
 A tour of a half-dozen pools over the last two weeks found clean water and pool decks, although the locker rooms and waiting areas can be less so and are often in disrepair. To enter a pool you must show an attendant that you have a conventional bathing suit -- park officials say they don't want the suit's colors running -- and that you have a padlock to secure your belongings in a locker. Only white T-shirts, towels, hats, sunglasses, sunblock, flip-flops and a book or magazine are allowed on the pool deck. Basically all else is banned, including electronics, food and newspapers.
 Certain things seem senseless, like seeing half the pool closed to swimming with a huge line of eager bathers waiting outside, and the policy of closing the pool for an hour at 3 p.m., usually the hottest part of the day, necessitating a whole new lengthy entry process. (Parks officials say the hour closing is for cleaning the pool.)
 A major reason the early pools were built is that hundreds of children were drowning each summer swimming in the city's waterways, Mr. Benepe said.
 ''These great outdoor pools would never be built today because it's no longer wise to invest in outdoor pools that are used two months of the year,'' he said. ''The ones we have were built to a palatial scale. The message is that working people can feel like royalty by passing through the portals of these edifices built like temples and Roman castles and French fortresses. You feel superhuman.''
 Crotona Pool in the Bronx stretches between East 172nd and East 174th Streets on Fulton Avenue on the edge of Crotona Park. Its bathhouse is an Art Deco interpretation of a French castle, and the interior is a city landmark.
 Last Saturday you could smell the barbecues set up in the park, mingling with sunblock and chlorine and hot asphalt and car exhaust. A loud radio beyond the fence blasted salsa music, and down the block a car alarm sounded for hours on end. The pool, 330 feet by 120 feet, has a shallow section for small children. It is secured by a tall, spiked iron fence topped with coils of razor wire. The pool edge is lined with blue, wooden police barricades to curtail running and jumping into the pool. But several barricades had been moved, and a dozen teenage boys were engaged in a testosterone-fueled romp, racing around the pool deck, wrestling and throwing one another, and any girls close to their age, into the water. As the pool emptied at closing time, four police cars had pulled up, and the officers sternly watched the crowd exit and slowly disperse.
 Hamilton Fish Pool, on the Lower East Side at Houston and Pitt Streets, draws downtown hipsters, Chinatown residents and the largely Hispanic population living in the nearby housing projects. The pool, which is 165 by 98 feet, sits in the center of Hamilton Fish Park and is flanked by Beaux-Arts-style structures.
 David Sanchez, 30, a construction worker, sat on the side of the pool one recent weekday, dangling his legs in the water.
 ''Most of these kids you see here are from the projects,'' said Mr. Sanchez, who lives in a project on Avenue D and enjoys the multicultural girl-watching at the pool. ''You think these kids ever seen a real beach? Myself, I've only been to Coney Island and Orchard Beach. It's just easier to come here.''
 Astoria Pool in Queens is in Astoria Park overlooking the East River between the Hell Gate and Triborough Bridges. It is the largest of the city pools and one of the largest in the country. The main pool is 330 by 165 feet and was designed to accommodate 3,000 swimmers. 
 Its diving pool, with a 32-foot-high elevated platform, was closed in 1981 because of trespassing, and the mucky bottom now resembles a bog. (Mr. Benepe said he hoped to reopen at least one diving pool in each borough eventually.) Outside the Art Deco bathing pavilion there is a stand that sells bathing suits, caps, goggles and swimming diapers. A short block away on Ditmars Boulevard are several cafes with outdoor seating and good food.
 One recent sweltering weekday more than 500 people waited to re-enter the pool at 4 p.m., forming a line that stretched up and out of the park. Along the outside of the bathhouse a thin pipe sprayed a cool mist onto the line. Those farther down the line drank from a temporary water fountain rigged to a sidewalk fire hydrant.
 Brian Azcona, 16, and four friends waited. They had taken the train from Bushwick, Brooklyn.
 ''It's cleaner than the beach, that's for sure,'' Brian said.
 Astoria, Crotona and Highbridge are among the 11 Olympic-size pools the city opened in the summer of 1936. Built by Robert Moses, the city's first parks commissioner, with financing from the federal Works Progress Administration, the pools were heralded as some of the most remarkable public recreational facilities ever built in the United States.
 Then there are the smaller pools, like the Sheltering Arms Pool in Harlem, at Amsterdam Avenue and West 126th Street. There is a bus depot across the avenue, and pedestrians and bus riders are well within splashing range of bathers.
 Back at John Jay Pool, Ms. Gruskin casually greeted friends milling about the end of the pool deck near East 78th Street at Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. The pool, in John Jay Park, overlooks the East River and abuts the drive so closely that you could splash the passing cars. The London plane trees that rise from the deck offer a generous canopy of shade. 
 The pool, which has one of the city's two remaining diving boards, is favored by neighborhood families and a group of adults who all seemed to know one another. By early afternoon they give way to the crowds of excited adolescents.
 ''They take the train here from East Harlem or the Lower East Side, where I grew up,'' Ms. Gruskin said. ''City pools are for the people who can't afford to go out to a nice beach.''

HEADLINE: Unions Dismayed by New Jersey Health Care Shortfall

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Labor officials responded with dismay yesterday to a presentation about New Jersey's huge shortfall in its financing of health care that it has promised to current and future retired public workers.
 Some of the officials worried that the daunting numbers that were formally announced yesterday had been rolled out now as a political ploy, intended to whip up fears that retirees' benefits were simply too expensive to keep paying. 
 The state's total bill will be $58 billion, an outside actuary explained at the presentation before the State Health Benefits Commission, a governing body composed of state officials and labor representatives. Towns and other local units of government will have to pay an additional $10.7 billion in today's dollars. 
 The shortfall was revealed when the state complied with a request to complete calculations required by a new accounting rule for state and local governments. The state has virtually no money in reserve to cover those costs.
 The actuary, Michael E. Morfe of Aon Consulting, also explained that these costs could be greatly reduced if a retiree health fund, to pay off the shortfall, were created soon. 
 Officials fear that the need to cover retiree benefits could swamp the state's general budget, forcing tax increases or service reductions, and require some kind of cutback in the level of medical benefits offered to retirees.
 Many union officials crowded into a conference room in the State Pensions Building in Trenton to hear the presentation. Afterward, there seemed to be little consensus about the usefulness of creating a reserve. 
 Joseph A. Golowski, a retired state auditor who is now a consultant for the Communications Workers of America, said most New Jersey governmental bodies were already operating on a tight budget.
 ''Everybody's got their hands out right now,'' Mr. Golowski said, ticking off the community colleges, nonprofit hospitals, towns and others in New Jersey that are feeling a financial pinch and asking for more state assistance.
 Mr. Golowski said that if the state gave little or nothing to those entities, but then produced billions of dollars for a retiree health fund, ''we're going to get all the anger.'' Already, he added, he hears people on call-in radio shows complaining that state employees do not deserve the benefits they get. He said he wished New Jersey could put off taking action until the economy improved and there was less pressure for scarce dollars. 
 Carla Katz, president of the Communication Workers' Local 1034, the largest of the unions representing New Jersey state employees, saw things differently. She said that because the health-care cost figures reflected a legal and moral obligation, the most responsible approach would be for state officials to set aside money. 
 ''They pre-fund the pensions, obviously,'' she said. ''So they should fund this, too.''
 In his report, Mr. Morfe showed that financing the retiree health plan in advance would save a lot of money over time, because it would allow some of the cost to be covered by investment income. 
 If New Jersey does not create a trust fund, he said, its annual retiree health expense would work out to about $5.8 billion a year, and continue rising. But with a fund, its yearly expense would work out to about $3.5 billion a year, and would rise much more slowly. 
 New Jersey is now using the pay-as-you-go approach, which means it will spend about $1.1 billion on retiree health care this year. That number is expected to grow sharply in the next few years. 
 In 1994, the state decided to stop setting aside money in a fund to pay for health care for its retired public workers, paving the way for a big tax cut. Officials had hoped that pension fund investments would pay for at least some of the health care costs. 
 Gov. Jon S. Corzine said at a news conference in Trenton on Wednesday that the state's obligation was ''a pretty heavy body blow at $58 billion,'' even though earlier estimates had suggested the cost would be even higher. 
 ''Now we are in a serious financial challenge in how we deal with unfunded pensions, unfunded health care, and the mandates we are under in other areas,'' Governor Corzine said.

HEADLINE: On Paying For Cars With Cash

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD. 
Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 27 

 BODY:
There are two questions that greet every car buyer who walks into a showroom: ''Are you ready to buy today?'' and ''How do you plan to pay?''
 If the answer to the first is yes, there are smiles all around. If the answer to the second is cash, that warm greeting may grow chilly.
 To be sure, no dealer will turn away a cash-paying customer, not in the atmosphere that surrounds the automobile industry these days, but all things considered, they are less welcome than buyers who want to lease or finance their cars. ''We actually love all paying customers,'' said George Borst, the chief executive of Toyota Financial, ''but we really want people to finance.'' 
 On the other hand, many car dealers are trying to clear out big inventories at the end of the 2007 model year to prepare for fresh models that begin arriving soon. 
 But buyers who pay cash, whether they write a check or borrow the money elsewhere and bring it to the showroom, provide car dealers with fewer opportunities to make money on a car deal. 
 That ranges from the cut they get from arranging a lease or loan, to options like extended warranties or antirust coating that buyers are more likely to choose if they can fold it into the amount they borrow. In some cases, those extras account for up to 75 percent of a showroom's profits.
 But, to some dealers' chagrin, cash deals are up in 2007. Some 11.7 percent of buyers paid cash for cars in the first half of this year, versus about 8 percent over the last few years, according to a survey by CNW Marketing Research, which studies car buying habits. 
 In all, about 26 percent of buyers are bringing cash to the table, whether it is out of their bank accounts or in pre-arranged loans through their credit unions, banks or home lenders, according to the Power Information Network, the research arm of J. D. Power & Associates.
 That overall figure is up slightly from last year, but still below the one-third of buyers who paid cash in the 1950s, when customers, many with lingering memories of the Great Depression, came to showrooms with their check books or stacks of bills. 
 It is in line, however, with the rate during the 1970s and 1980s, before car companies made widespread use of cut-rate loans and discount lease plans.
 One big reason for the recent rise in cash-paying buyers is the introduction of small and less-expensive cars into the American market, like the Honda Fit, Toyota Yaris and Nissan Versa, said Art Spinella, the president of CNW Marketing. 
 Because many consumers purchase small vehicles as second and third cars, and have a car loan for their primary vehicle, a number are choosing instead to pay cash rather than take on another loan, Mr. Spinella said. That is particularly true for women buyers, who account for about 42 percent of cash-paying customers.
 Cash-paying buyers, who tend to be wealthier than typical consumers, are often reaping investment profits. This year, 34.8 percent paid for their cars by selling stock, the most common source of cash, compared with 31.8 percent who took money out of their savings, Mr. Spinella's data showed.
 Indeed, at brands like Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Audi and BMW, as many as one-third of transactions are cash sales.
 For these customers, sticker price can be no object. One shopper at Lexus of Ann Arbor, Mich., recently paid $116,000 in cash for the Lexus LS 460 Lh, the hybrid version of Lexus's ultra luxury sedan, which went on sale in July. 
 Mark A. Louria, the general sales manager there, said about 25 percent of his customers paid cash for their new cars, keeping them for an average of six to seven years. Mr. Louria said he tried to encourage many customers to lease their cars instead, arguing that it was a better way to take advantage of ever-changing technology.
 In the end, ''it's whatever works best for them,'' Mr. Louria said.
 Shopping sites like Edmunds.com, Cars.com, Kelly Blue Book (kbb.com) and Autobytel.com are places where consumers can research data like the invoice price, and the amount that manufacturers are giving to dealers in rebates and extra incentives.
 Those who plunk down dollar bills often cite a single reason. ''I just don't like debt,'' said Todd Larson of Shorewood, Minn. Mr. Larson and his wife, Linda, paid $33,000 cash for their 2005 Ford Freestyle, as well as a 2001 Jeep Cherokee. 
 For Matthew Galloghy, 30, who lives in Batavia, Ohio, outside Cleveland, it is simply saving money. He recently paid about $20,000 for a Honda Accord, and plans to drive it for about 10 years. 
 Mr. Galloghy takes his thrift to another level. He said he would make a monthly deposit equal to a car payment, or about $300, in a money market account. ''And now I certainly have a cushion for emergencies or anything else that may come up,'' Mr. Galloghy said.
 Cash purchases had all but died out in 1998, when buyers were snapping up cheap lease deals that allowed them to take home more expensive models, especially sport utility vehicles, for little down and minimal monthly payments.
 After a rebound, they plummeted again in the months after the September 2001 attacks, when auto companies led by General Motors rolled out zero percent financing plans in an effort to spur auto sales. 
 Lately, these plans have been far more limited than they were earlier this decade, said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with Edmunds.com, a Web site that offers car-buying advice. Many automakers, who made zero percent financing available to virtually any customer six years ago, now offer it only to those with the best credit, he said.
 Auto company finance arms and banks have been burned by oversetting these cars' residual value, or the amount that they estimate the vehicle to be worth when the lease is finished. The higher the residual, the lower the monthly payment, but a too-high residual means the finance company takes a loss on the car after it is turned in.
 These lenders also have been hurt by their practice of encouraging five and six-year car loans, which can lead to lower payments, but can result in a vehicle being worth less than the remaining amount to be paid off, a situation the industry calls ''upside down.''
 Zero-percent-financing plans, in which buyers need only pay for taxes, licenses and other documentation, can prove more beneficial to consumers with the best credit.
 Likewise, a discounted lease of 36 months or less can allow trend-conscious customers to swap their cars for the next hot model without gambling on the car's value, even though they will pay interest on the lease, transaction fees, and may need a down payment. No matter what, buyers need to haggle over the price first before discussing the details.
 But some buyers simply want to own outright. In that case, these consumers need to do their homework before they begin negotiating, checking out the prices that are being paid in their area for the automobile they want on sites like Edmunds, which provides a tool it calls the ''true market value.'' 
 Buyers enter their ZIP codes, and then choose the options they want, and are provided with the price most frequently paid by purchasers in their area.
 Without that knowledge, cash-paying customers risk not just a frosty dealer response, but a concerted effort to get them to change their minds, said Mr. Toprak, who sold cars early in his career.
 ''When I was at a closing and the customer said, 'this is a cash deal,' I knew I would not make any money for the next hour,'' he said.
 Mr. Toprak advised cash buyers to get prices from several dealers through their Web sites. If a sales person balks at honoring that figure because a customer wants to pay cash, the buyer can threaten to go elsewhere, he said. 
 Still, some buyers prefer to stick to their guns. 
 John Kealing, a St. Louis salesman, paid $34,000 cash for his 2006 Infiniti G35x, the second car this decade for which he has paid cash. Mr. Kealing said he deliberately waited until the last minute to tell the dealer that he was paying cash. ''He found out when he put the loan document in front of me,'' Mr. Kealing said. 
 The dealer ''tried to talk me out of it, actually,'' he said. ''He told me he had some great rates, but I didn't waver.'' 
 Rob Butler, owner of the Butler Automotive Group in Indianapolis, said he doesn't discourage customers who want to pay cash from doing so.
 ''If a guy likes to write a check, fine,'' Mr. Butler said. ''Cash is still cash.''

HEADLINE: Economy Expands 3.4%; Interpretation Is Debated

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The economy pulled out of a sharp winter slowdown and grew at a quicker pace in the spring quarter, overcoming a consumer spending lull as foreign trade and business investment picked up, the government reported yesterday. 
 But some sources of strength that fed into the expansion, which was 3.4 percent after inflation, are not likely to be as forceful in the months ahead, leaving most economists expecting growth for the rest of year to be less robust.
 How much less? That is still an open question. 
 With analysts divided over whether the economy is fundamentally on the upswing or showing signs of deterioration, politicians weighed in with their views as well. After the Commerce Department released the initial report on how the nation's gross domestic product performed during the April-to-June quarter, Republicans and Democrats quickly offered their interpretations of the numbers. 
 The chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Edward P. Lazear, said the numbers were consistent with a recovering and robust economy. ''We believe that the economy is back on track,'' he told reporters in Washington.
 Democrats cast the report in less upbeat tones. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York called the report ''a temporary oasis amidst too much bad economic news.''
 An improvement in the trade deficit, stronger spending by businesses and the government and a little less drag from the housing market helped lift growth in the second quarter from the anemic 0.6 percent rate from January through March, the slowest period in more than four years.
 Both figures tend to misrepresent the overall trajectory of the economy, and economists said a more accurate picture lay between the two. And that suggests that real growth has still not returned to the roughly 3 percent rate that economists consider healthy and sustainable without feeding into higher inflation. 
 ''It's a little bit fanciful to get as excited about 3.4 as you were despondent about 0.6,'' said Robert J. Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment advisory firm. ''Essentially over the first half of this year, and the second half of last year, the run rate of the economy is 2 percent. And that's soft.''
 Several factors reversed in the second quarter, giving the economy a different composition. Government and business investment -- which includes purchases of buildings, equipment and software intended to enhance prospects for the future -- grew at a much faster pace compared with the first quarter.
 The balance of trade also changed. In the second quarter, exports grew 6.4 percent, compared with just 1.1 percent in the first quarter. And imports declined 2.6 percent after gaining 3.9 percent in the quarter before. As a result, overall foreign trade lifted growth in the second quarter -- adding 1.2 percentage points to the overall pace of economic activity.
 ''It's a very different mix,'' said Mickey D. Levy, the chief economist of Bank of America.
 One factor that was critical in keeping the economy afloat this winter underperformed in the spring: the American consumer. Personal consumption, adjusted for inflation, advanced just 1.3 percent, compared with 3.7 percent in the first quarter.
 Much of the consumer pullback in the second quarter was due to rising energy prices. With the price of gasoline leveling off, many economists expect consumer spending to pick up. But they said that the outlook for consumers was hard to predict without knowing what would happen to fuel costs or how people would react to tightening of credit in the housing market and the recent shakiness in the stock market. 
 ''You can't say much about gas prices with confidence at this point in the year, but if we stay at current levels, consumer spending should do better,'' said Stephen Stanley, the chief economist of RBS Greenwich Capital.
 If job market conditions worsen as well, that could also cause Americans to curb some of their spending.
 ''Probably the biggest factor will be slower job and income growth over the second half of the year,'' said Richard F. Moody, chief economist of Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm in Austin, Tex. As a result, he said, ''I see a modest rebound in consumer spending.''
 Another unknown factor that will determine how much the economy grows in the second half of the year is the housing market. The second quarter was not as bad as the first. A decline in home buying subtracted half of a percentage point from the G.D.P. figure, compared with about a full point in the first quarter.
 ''That drag is beginning to dissipate,'' argued Dean Maki, the chief United States economist of Barclays Capital.
 But other economists looked at bloated home inventories and insisted that new home construction still had further to fall. ''We have such large inventories that builders are simply going to have to cut back more,'' Mr. Moody said.
 And economists were also split about whether the fastest-growing sectors of the economy would pull their weight for the rest of the year. Business and government spending -- particularly military spending -- were so strong that many economists said they would undoubtedly fall back.
 Investment in commercial buildings surged 22.1 percent, compared with 6.4 percent in the first quarter. Government spending grew 4.2 percent, after falling 0.5 percent in the first quarter.
 But on the positive side, some economists argued, business stockpiles did not grow as much as expected, leaving room for companies to add to them later in the year and help push the economy forward. 
 ''Firms are entering the second half of the year with very lean inventories,'' Mr. Stanley said. ''That just bodes well for continued gains in output.''

HEADLINE: From Jail, Colombian Warlord Ponders Long Years of Conflict

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Jenny Carolina Gonzalez contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ITAGUI, Colombia
 IN his prison cell here on the outskirts of Medellin, Salvatore Mancuso reads Gandhi and self-help books. He taps notes to his lawyers into a BlackBerry. He gazes at photos of his 19-year-old wife and 8-month-old son. He listens to vallenato music on his iPod. 
 And he meditates on the meaning of war. 
 ''There are no good men or bad men in war,'' Mr. Mancuso, 42, Colombia's paramilitary warlord extraordinaire, said in a long, meandering interview. ''There are objectives, and the objective of war is to win by combating the enemy, and the enemy is not fought with flowers or prayer or song. The enemy is fought with weapon in hand, which produces dead men.'' 
 As a commander and the premier strategist for the death squads that committed some of the worst atrocities in this country's long internal war, Mr. Mancuso knows a lot about killing. He put into motion plans that transformed the paramilitary militias from an anti-guerrilla force into major cocaine traffickers and allies -- some say masters -- of high-ranking officials throughout Colombia's government. 
 With that chapter of war ceding to a more subdued conflict, Mr. Mancuso now spends his days in prison alongside other paramilitary leaders as part of a deal to confess his crimes and pay reparations to his victims. This arrangement allows him to spend just eight years in confinement, and perhaps less, before returning to society. 
 His confessions have fed the slow-burning scandal over revelations of ties between paramilitaries and a web of elite politicians, army generals and spies, almost all supporters of President Alvaro Uribe. In a country weary of war, Mr. Mancuso has become an uneasy reminder of how the conflict permeated so many areas of life. 
 ''We were the mist, the curtain of smoke, behind which everything was hidden,'' Mr. Mancuso, dressed casually in sandals and a black striped shirt and sitting in an ergonomic chair in his cell, said of the paramilitaries. 
 A child of privilege, Mr. Mancuso grew up near the Caribbean coast in Monteria, the son of an Italian father, a prosperous businessman, and a mother who had been ''Cattle Queen'' in a regional beauty contest. After high school, his parents sent him to study English at the University of Pittsburgh while he took a break from civil engineering studies. 
 He returned from the United States to a country strained by guerrilla subversion, kidnappings and the rise of drug cartels. As a powerful cattleman by the mid-1990s, Mr. Mancuso formed a paramilitary organization ostensibly to protect the lives and property of his social class. 
 HIS own warpath allowed him to extend his power far from Monteria to the nebulous border region with Venezuela, where the police in the frontier city Cucuta respond to Mr. Mancuso's authority to this day, according to Human Rights Watch, which has tracked his activities for the past decade. 
 Mr. Mancuso denies this, saying he leads a quiet life in prison. But he says he understands the motivations that would push some of the 30,000 demobilized paramilitary fighters into shadowy new organizations that still carry out selective killings and export cocaine, describing them as ''qualified labor.'' 
 As Mr. Mancuso's star rose during the bloodiest days of the war, he coordinated the killings of at least 86 people, according to the attorney general's office in Bogota. That number corresponds to Mr. Mancuso's own confessions in recent months. In one of those sessions, he sobbed as he asked forgiveness for his crimes. 
 Victims' groups, which contend that Mr. Mancuso oversaw hundreds of killings, see crocodile tears in such emotion. ''It contradicts reality for someone like Mancuso to see themselves as heroes or martyrs,'' said Ivan Cepeda, the leader of a victims' group whose father, a senator, was killed by paramilitaries. ''This peace process is fictitious.'' 
 The demobilization process is also in danger of collapsing. Other paramilitary leaders said they would halt their confessions this week after a Supreme Court decision viewing the militias as common criminals, as opposed to political ones. The ruling could jeopardize the militia leaders' hopes to re-enter Colombian society after revealing details of their crimes before prosecutors and victims.
 Few things are as elastic as the truth as Colombia grapples with the fallout from its war, but Mr. Mancuso says he is prepared to set the record straight by writing a book about what took place during the conflict. Few people speak so clearly about the obstacles that prevent Colombia from moving beyond stalemate to peace. 
 War, Mr. Mancuso would have Colombia believe, pushes its actors into unsavory options. So does the situation that passes for a semblance of stability these days, he says, pointing to the $5 billion in aid Washington has channeled to Colombia this decade to combat drug trafficking and insurgencies, only to see cocaine exports flow unabated. 
 THE Colombian authorities, Mr. Mancuso said, ''don't want to eradicate cocaine because the conflict generates so much international support that puts money on top of the table, and allows so much money under the table in the form of corruption.'' 
 Assessing Colombia's treatment of jailed paramilitary leaders, human rights activists fear that Mr. Mancuso will avoid paying for his crimes. 
 Under Colombia's lenient rules, Mr. Mancuso could end up spending much less than eight years in a prison where he is already allowed amenities like satellite television in his cell, bodyguards, visits each weekend from his wife, Margarita, and their son, Salvatore, and a laptop computer with Internet access, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director for Human Rights Watch. 
 ''This is Uribe's gift to the leaders of paramilitarism,'' said Mr. Vivanco, referring to the criticism surrounding the policies of President Uribe in relation to the militias. 
 Mr. Mancuso shrugs off such statements, saying the change he has undergone in prison has been ''radical.'' But innocence and guilt seem like malleable concepts to someone who speaks like a polished corporate executive of his decision to use drug trafficking to finance his activities, explaining he had no choice but to mimic the guerrilla insurgency's methods. 
 ''I could not lose the war,'' Mr. Mancuso said. 
 ''We have a narco-economy,'' he added, as if Colombia wanted to be reminded of that curse. ''We are a narco-society.''

 Re ''The Full Time Blues,'' by Judith Warner (column, July 24): 
 Many women who are mothers have to maximize their income, often by working full time when they would rather work part time, because the cost of child care is not fully deductible. 
 If it were deductible, as business expenses such as club memberships are, or better yet, if the cost were considered a tax credit, women, and their spouses, would be freer to choose whether their work force participation should be full or part time.
 I am surprised that young parents are not making this a political issue. Why should business owners be able to deduct the full cost of their employees, but the employer of a babysitter can't? Yet the employer of the babysitter is expected to pay Social Security and unemployment tax. 
 This is an inequality that if remedied would be a great boon to families. Margaret McGarrahan

HEADLINE: Wheels of Fortune, on a Roll

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS HEINGARTNER

 BODY:
The London Eye Ferris wheel, inaugurated on Dec. 31, 1999, was only meant to stay a few years. But almost immediately, it was clear that the 443-foot Eye would be a keeper. 
 Its success, in turn, has reinvigorated demand for Ferris wheels. Similar ''observation wheels,'' a name that has come back into vogue, have recently opened or are being built in Malaysia; Manchester, England; Singapore; and Melbourne, Australia, with others planned for Berlin, Dubai, Beijing and Orlando, Fla.
 And as with skyscrapers, a heated competition is under way for the world's tallest. Last year, China's 525-foot Star of Nanchang took that distinction from the London Eye. The 541-foot Singapore Flyer will eclipse the other two in early 2008, followed soon after -- in time for the 2008 Summer Olympics -- by the 682-foot Great Beijing Wheel. 
 The big wheels are also big business. On average, about 3.5 million people a year, or 10,000 a day, pay $30 or more for a half-hour spin on the London Eye. The Singapore Flyer will be able to carry 27,000 passengers a day, with each ride costing about $20, or more for options like express boarding or Champagne. Although the Flyer is not scheduled to open until March, its first three months are already fully booked. 
 Cities also love the wheels. They bring in tourists and create jobs, and offer an easy way to stand out. ''These wheels are becoming their icon de jour,'' said Dennis L. Speigel, president of International Theme Park Services, a consultant in Cincinnati. ''And success breeds the development of other wheels in other cities.''
 The newest observation wheels frequently form part of a larger development project. Visitors to the wheels in Singapore and Melbourne, for example, will be able to meander though shops, restaurants and other entertainment as they wait for their ''flight,'' a contrast to the glacially slow queue that snakes outside the London Eye. 
 The sponsorship possibilities are also rich. Last month, the British Airways London Eye, as it is officially known, was used to promote the movie ''Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.'' A 100-foot likeness of the surfer was affixed to the center of the Eye, as the film's stars did their interviews in the wheel's capsules. And the pods on the new wheel that spins atop the Dream Mall, a huge shopping complex that opened this spring in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, are decorated with images of the popular cartoon character Hello Kitty. 
 Unlike the seating in their older counterparts, the observation wheels feature climate-controlled, rotating capsules that can hold up to 40 people, and can be reserved for business meetings, birthdays and weddings. Capsule amenities include leather seats, plasma screens, refrigerators and bars. 
 The new wheels also spin more slowly, allowing passengers to board without the wheel's being stopped. The London Eye, for example, revolves at a leisurely 0.6 mile an hour. The 394-foot Sky Dream Fukuoka in Japan even advertises this lazy pace as a selling point -- it helps ensure ''maximum kissing time.''
 In fact, slow speeds have long been the norm in Japan, where Ferris wheels have enjoyed a unique popularity. ''After World War II, they were a symbol of our economic recovery,'' said Yuko Fukui, who wrote a book on the history of Ferris wheels. ''In Western countries, they're more thrilling, like a roller coaster. However, in Japan, they've always been more like the new observation wheels.'' 
 Structurally, the wheels rising up today still bear much in common with the original, designed by the civil engineer George W. Ferris for the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. It was presented as America's answer to the Eiffel Tower (which opened in 1889 and, like the London Eye, was meant as a temporary structure). 
 Even by modern standards, Ferris's original was no slouch: for 50 cents apiece, nearly 1,500 passengers at a time could ascend to 264 feet. The biggest wheel in the United States today is the comparatively modest Texas Star at the State Fair of Texas, in Dallas. At 212 feet, it fails to top even the Riesenrad in Vienna, which was made famous in the 1949 film ''The Third Man'' and is still operating 110 years after its construction.
 Before the recent renaissance, times were tough on Ferris wheels, especially in the United States and Europe. According to Norman Anderson, a retired professor at North Carolina State University who wrote the book ''Ferris Wheels: An Illustrated History,'' neither Disneyland (which opened in 1955) nor Walt Disney World (1971) deigned to include one. And as increasingly spectacular theme park rides set the tone in the 1970s and '80s, traditional attractions like Ferris wheels and carousels fell out of favor. 
 ''Almost every carnival and state fair, even the church bazaars, had a Ferris wheel,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''But the problem is that the things are so well-built they last forever, so there wasn't a lot of economic encouragement to build new ones.''
 Mr. Speigel, of the International Theme Park Services, agreed. ''They became somewhat passe in the mid-70s,'' he said. ''Nobody was putting them in anymore, and we didn't see any activity there until really the success of the London Eye.'' Since then, he said, the boom has been ''similar to what happened in the roller coaster industry, when steel roller coasters started getting higher and higher. Now the wheels are getting larger and larger in diameter, and I'm not sure where it's going to end.''
 In that respect, the sky is the limit. According to several engineers, the wheels could theoretically get as tall as any building. ''Technically there are ways,'' said Roy Vocking, vice president of Ride Trade International, a company based in Liechtenstein that builds amusement rides. ''You can build it in concrete, and it can be any height you want,'' he said.
 But bigger is not always better. ''These very big wheels of over 120 meters are costing around a hundred to two hundred million dollars,'' he said. ''So if you're not going to get millions of people through a year, it doesn't make economic sense to build them.'' 
 The call of nature is another barrier to height. ''The biggest constraint is the amount of time people need to be away from the toilet,'' Mr. Vocking said. A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, another builder of giant wheels, said studies indicate 35 to 45 minutes is the longest people are willing to wait.
 Indeed, ''half an hour is a good time to experience a good view,'' said Florian Bollen, the chairman of the Great Wheel Corporation, a company developing many of the newest wheels. ''Everything beyond that gets kind of repetitive.'' 
 ''I think we are now already stretching toward the limits,'' he added. ''I think that the 208 meters in Beijing is not going to be topped very quickly.''
 So now some wheels are competing on novelty, rather than size. The Tianjin Eye, a wheel planned in China for next year, will be built on a traffic bridge, with cars passing on either side. Big wheels on the roofs of department stores have become a fixture in Japan and Korea, and in 2005 Ride Trade built an oval wheel on the facade of a gambling parlor in Osaka. 
 ''The developers want something to make their particular attraction stand out,'' Mr. Vocking said, adding that Ride Trade had even received a recent request for a figure-8 shaped wheel. 
 At the same time, relatively smaller (and often portable) observation wheels are also quietly rising in cities like York, England, and Belfast, Northern Ireland. In North America, the first next-generation observation wheel is the 175-foot Niagara SkyWheel, which opened last summer on the Canadian side of the Niagara Falls. 
 ''At the end of the day, it all comes down to location,'' Mr. Vocking said. ''If you have the location and an interesting iconic attraction which will enable you to have a bird's-eye view of the area, success is almost guaranteed.''

HEADLINE: Markets Around the World Are Marching in Lock Step

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Five months after stock markets around the world were shaken by a 9 percent plunge in the value of Chinese stocks, the markets have again come under severe pressure -- this time made in America.
 And China could not stop it.
 But even after the worst week for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index in nearly five years, the American market and most others remain higher than they were after the Feb. 27 sell-off that started in China and went around the world. 
 In between the two falls, the leader among stock markets was China, which basically failed to participate in this week's downturn that affected most other markets in the world. Its stock market is almost 80 percent higher than it was after the Feb. 27 fall.
 That day may be remembered, not as the start of a worldwide bear market as was feared then, but as an indicator of a new world economic pecking order. Whereas it was long said that the world caught pneumonia when the United States suffered a cold, it is now the Chinese economy that has taken world leadership. So long as it remains strong, many companies will prosper no matter what the prospects for their home markets.
 That remained true even this week, when nervousness over financial conditions and the American economy led to significant declines that did not, however, wipe out the overall gains recorded since the February plunge.
 The economic strength this year has been largely in Asia, where there is talk of an overheating Chinese economy and annual growth rates in gross domestic product remain in the double digits. While recessions in America and Europe would presumably damage China's exports, its growth has so far resisted government efforts to slow it down through higher interest rates.
 As a result, the prices of such economically sensitive commodities as oil and copper are significantly higher now than they were in February. 
 The Feb. 27 plunge also seems to have heralded a return of stock market volatility, which has risen substantially in many markets, including both the United States and China. 
 In this week's five sessions, the S.& P. 500 rose on two days, but fell sharply on the other three. It has now lost more than 1 percent of its value in four of the last six trading sessions.
 In the entire fourth quarter of last year, there were only three sessions in which the index rose or fell 1 percent. The year has had two days of more than 2 percent moves -- Feb. 27 and Thursday -- and while both were negative the overall pattern is still positive.
 In recent weeks, interest rates on government bonds have fallen around the world, including in Japan, Britain, Germany and the United States. That would normally tend to stimulate economies, but the impact has been muted by the recent rise in interest rates paid by borrowers who do not enjoy the sterling credit standing of major governments.
 In the United States, the yield on the 10-year Treasury notes is higher than it was in February, but fell to 4.76 percent yesterday from a high of 5.29 percent in mid-June. But the yield on an index of high-yield corporate bonds maintained by KDP Investment Advisors has risen rapidly, to 8.85 percent from 7.11 percent. And Freddie Mac's weekly report of interest rates on conventional 30-year mortgages showed a rate of 6.69 percent this week, down a little from the week before but well above February levels.
 In addition, some highly leveraged borrowers have suddenly found it hard to borrow at all, causing problems for private equity firms that need to complete announced takeovers. Cadbury Schweppes, the British company trying to sell its United States beverage business, which includes 7-Up, Dr Pepper and Snapple, delayed the deadline for submitting bids, a move that reflected financing hardships. 
 A look at world stock market movements, shown in the accompanying charts, since the February plunge shows that major markets now tend to move more in line with one another than ever before, reflecting the dominance of global companies. One of the charts shows the performance since the Feb. 27 plunge of both the S.& P. 500, which contains large American companies, and the S.& P. Euro 350, made up of major European companies. Over all, they have moved in lock step with one another for most of that period. And similar sectors seem to have done well or poorly. The figures are in dollars, to remove the effect of currency changes.
 The divergences between Europe and the United States are in areas with a greater reliance on the domestic markets. The consumer discretionary sector did much better in Europe than in the United States. Financial stocks underperformed in both markets, while energy and industrial stocks did well.
 Within the American markets, many industrial stocks are up significantly since February, even with this week's problems, as is shown in the graph of the Bloomberg industrials. But retail stocks have given up the gains they recorded in the spring, and are lower than they were after the February plunge. Home builder stocks have fallen to their lowest levels in nearly three years.

GRAPHIC: Charts: Since the Feb. 27 plunge in stock prices, interest rates have diverged, with mortgage and high-yield interest rates continuing to rise while government bond yields fell in the last month.

HEADLINE: Sale of Cadbury Drinks Unit Postponed in Jittery Market

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

DATELINE: LONDON, July 27 

 BODY:
Cadbury Schweppes delayed the sale of its drinks unit on Friday, citing ''extreme volatility'' in the leveraged debt market.
 The company's decision was the latest indication that the private equity boom may be coming to an end. Cadbury, the world's largest candy maker, extended the deadline to sell its American beverage unit, the maker of Dr Pepper and 7Up, saying that even though ''interest in the business remains strong'' it wants to ''allow bidders to complete their proposals against a more stable debt financing market.'' 
 The company had received offers worth about $:8 billion, or $16.4 billion, from at least three bidding groups that include the private equity firms Bain Capital Partners and the Blackstone Group, according to people close to the company. 
 But some analysts, including Martin Deboo of Investec Securities in London, have cut their estimates for the price of the sale. At the same time, private equity firms, which are among possible bidders for the unit, have recently struggled to arrange for financing of takeovers as debt investors have begun to balk at the risk and have asked for higher interest rates. 
 Cadbury, which makes Trident gum and Dairy Milk chocolate, said in June that it had received ''expressions of interest'' for its beverage unit. The British company in March bowed to pressure from shareholders, including the investor Nelson Peltz, to split off its soft drinks unit and focus on candy. 
 Earlier this week, Chrysler and Alliance Boots, the British pharmacy chain, failed to find buyers for $20 billion of loans to pay for their leveraged buyouts, leaving investment banks stuck with the debt. 
 More than 20 debt offerings have been postponed or sweetened as the markets tightened in recent weeks. Buyout firms are expected to find it harder to raise the $300 billion of debt some banks, including Bear Stearns, estimate they will need to pay for acquisitions.
 ''There is a slowdown in financing but people will still do deals just at a different rate and conditions,'' said Stephen Howard, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London. 
 The jitters in the credit markets on Thursday spread to the equity markets as some investors sold stock of companies that had been seen as potential takeover targets.
 Shares in Virgin Media, the British cable company that earlier this month received a takeover proposal from the Carlyle Group, the private equity group, have dropped 8.7 percent this week. A Virgin Media spokeswoman, Liz Nicholson, declined to comment.
 ''The stock market now has to do without the takeover premiums that were built into the valuations because buyout firms were so acquisitive,'' said Guy de Blonay, a fund manager at New Star Asset Management Group in London.
 As financing tightens, other companies that have avoided bidding against private equity firms in the past may step in, some investment bankers said.
 Rising corporate earnings over the last two years on the back of a strong economy have inflated companies' cash reserves, which they can now spend on acquisitions, while private equity firms rely on tapping the credit markets. Corporations in Europe paid 68 percent cash for their acquisitions this year and 85 percent, a record, in America, according to JPMorgan Chase & Company.
 Cadbury had hired Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley and UBS to advise on the sale of the drinks unit.

HEADLINE: After iPhone Worries, a String of Encouraging Signs

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
IN a week when all eyes were following the gyrating stock market, clues to the iPhone's popularity were revealed, Barclays continued its pursuit of ABN Amro, and the United States and China joined forces to crack down on software piracy.
 IPHONE UPDATE On Wednesday, Apple reported a 73 percent jump in quarterly profit on strong Mac and iPod sales, way ahead of Wall Street forecasts, but investors seemed far more concerned with how well the new iPhone was selling. 
 On Tuesday, the day before Apple's earnings report, AT&T, the iPhone's wireless carrier, said it had activated only 146,000 iPhones during the product's first day and a half on the market, the last two days of the quarter. That was far short of Wall Street estimates of 500,000 and sent shares down more than 6 percent in after-hours trading. 
 A day later, Apple said it had sold 270,000 iPhones during the two-day period, soothing some investors' fears and causing shares of Apple to rise more than 8 percent, more than making up for the losses of the day before but still leaving some investors wondering whether the product was meeting its expectations.
 The full story of iPhone's sales is still a mystery, and only time will tell whether Apple has another iPod on its hands. Apple's chief operating officer, Timothy D. Cook, said, ''Our perspective is measured in years, not months.''
 LAURIE J. FLYNN
 A HIGHER BID Barclays, the British bank embroiled in a bitter takeover battle for ABN Amro, on Monday increased its offer for the Dutch bank to 67.5 billion euros ($93.21 billion) after securing some help from the China Development Bank and Temasek Holdings of Singapore.
 The two financial institutions agreed to invest 3.6 billion euros in Barclays and said they would buy more if the bid for ABN Amro was successful. The deal also allowed Barclays to add a cash component to its offer, which it hopes will be more attractive to some of the hedge funds holding ABN Amro shares than was the previous all-share bid.
 The revised offer is still below that of a consortium led by Royal Bank of Scotland. Shareholders in Fortis, the Belgian financial services firm that is part of the consortium, on Aug. 6 will be the first to vote on the ABN Amro bid.

 PIRACY CRACKDOWN The F.B.I. and Chinese authorities joined forces in the biggest crackdown on software piracy in history. The two-year investigation, named Summer Solstice, led to the arrest of 25 people and seizure of more than $500 million worth of counterfeit Microsoft and Symantec products made in China and sold in more than two dozen countries.
 The F.B.I. announced the arrests and seizure on Tuesday and said the joint investigation would continue. The lawyer in charge of Microsoft's antipiracy program, David Finn, called the operation ''a real milestone.''
 Yet the size and sophistication of the counterfeiting network in Shanghai and Shenzhen point to the depth of the piracy problem. The fake software and packaging was high quality, Mr. Finn conceded, right down to security features like tiny threads woven into the packaging.
 Beyond policing, the main hope for curbing software piracy in China is economic self-interest. As the nation increasingly develops its own software industry, the incentive for adhering to copyright and intellectual property laws grows. China's legitimate software industry is taking off: sales rose 88 percent last year, to $1.2 billion.
 Indeed, China's piracy rate has declined by 10 percent since 2003, according to IDC, a research firm. Still, the country has a long way to go. An estimated 82 percent of the software on personal computers in China is counterfeit.

 A LA CARTE RADIO For years, Kevin J. Martin, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has been pressing the cable television industry to offer consumers the opportunity to pay for only those channels that they watch.
 This week his campaign appeared to pay off, but not in the cable television industry. Desperate to persuade skeptical regulators like Mr. Martin to approve their merger, the nation's two satellite radio stations, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM Satellite Radio, announced plans to offer ''a la carte'' subscription packages after they completed their deal.
 Their announcement came after Mr. Martin and several other commissioners had expressed concerns about the proposed merger and suggested they might not find that it was in the public interest.
 The announcement increased the odds that the agency would approve the deal, which is still considered a close call by analysts. A separate antitrust review by the Justice Department is expected to find the merger plan acceptable. The commission is expected to conclude its review around the end of the year.

HEADLINE: House Passes Farm Bill, Expanding Food Stamps

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Andrew Martin contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27 

 BODY:
House Democrats voted on Friday to approve a farm bill that would continue generous farmers' subsidies at a time of record crop prices, ignoring a veto threat and yowls of protest by Republicans over a tax provision that they said spoiled bipartisan support for the bill. 
 The bill passed, 231 to 191, with 19 Republicans joining 212 Democrats in favor, after a morning of rancorous debate and some hooting and howling that focused not on agriculture policy but on the tax provision inserted to pay for a $4 billion increase in food stamps. 
 The relatively swift passage of the bill, which is projected to cost about $286 billion over five years, was a victory for Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who untangled a thicket of competing interests. Ms. Pelosi faced accusations from fellow Democrats that she abandoned her demands to reform the subsidies in favor of protecting potentially vulnerable freshman Democrats from rural districts. 
 Ms. Pelosi hailed the bill as historic for ending subsidy payments to farmers earning more than $1 million a year, creating support for fruit and vegetable growers and increasing money for nutrition, land conservation and other programs like researching alternative fuels like cellulose-based ethanol. 
 ''Future farm bills will never look the same as those of the past,'' she said on the House floor. 
 Democratic leaders scrambled down to the wire to shore up support as they braced for opposition to the tax provision. In last-minute amendments, the Democrats added more money for nutrition, including $840 million for an international food aid program sought by Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts. 
 The Democrats added $100 million to settle claims of racial discrimination by black farmers against the Agriculture Department, a move applauded by Representative Maxine Waters, Democrat of California, and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus. 
 The House vote sets the stage for complicated negotiations when the Senate takes up its version of the farm bill in the fall.
 In addition to the veto threat by the White House, which is demanding that Congress lower the farmer's income-eligibility ceiling, the World Trade Organization is expected to rule on complaints by countries like Brazil and Canada that the subsidies violate free trade agreements. 
 In an interim report this week, the W.T.O. ruled that the United States had failed to change cotton subsidies, allowed under the previous farm bill, enough to conform to global trade rules.
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns repeated on Friday the administration's displeasure with the current farm bill, especially the tax provision. 
 ''There's no need to raise taxes to deliver a good farm bill,'' Mr. Johanns said, adding that the administration had also proposed far more extensive reforms for subsidies. 
 ''The House bill falls well short of those proposals,'' he said. ''I urge the Senate to chart a different course.''
 Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa and chairman of the Agriculture Committee, hinted of the challenges ahead in a statement giving lukewarm praise to the House bill and some criticism. 
 ''There are a lot of good features in the House bill, and, of course, there are others I believe the Senate will improve upon,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''Most notably, the House bill did serious damage to conservation.'' 
 In the House, much of the oratory focused not on farm policy but on the tax provision, which many Republicans said infuriated them and caused them to drop their support for the bill. It would impose taxes on some foreign corporations operating in the United States that do not now pay taxes on some earnings as a result of international treaties.
 Democrats said the provision merely closed a loophole exploited by foreign companies to evade taxes. 
 Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, ridiculed Republicans in comments on the floor. Mr. Rangel said they knew full well that tax policy would be changed to pay for the farm bill when the Agriculture Committee went to him for help. 
 ''You didn't go to the chairman of the Transportation Committee,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''You didn't go to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. You went to the chairman of the tax-writing committee.'' 
 ''I can understand how philosophically you don't like to talk about taxes,'' Mr. Rangel told the Republicans, but he said it was up to them to reconcile their positions opposing the tax measure but supporting the farm bill. 
 ''You explain it,'' he said as his fellow Democrats hooted approval. ''We don't have to.'' 
 Moments later, it was Republicans who laughed derisively when the chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Representative Collin C. Peterson, Democrat of Minnesota, said: ''This is not a tax increase. This is doing what's right in this country.'' 
 More substantive debate occurred on Thursday, when the House defeated, 309 to 117, an amendment proposed by Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, the leading critic of the subsidies. 
 Mr. Kind's proposal would have overhauled the farm bill by ending payments to farmers earning more than $250,000 a year, limiting payments farmers can receive under guaranteed loan programs, expanding conservation programs and replacing many subsidies with crop insurance and other protection that pays only if farmers lose money.
 In an interview, Mr. Kind said he was disappointed but not surprised that his measure was defeated. He noted the difficulty of changing the status quo in Congress, particularly against a skillful and entrenched lobby like agriculture. ''These entrenched special interests, they are good,'' he said ''They know how to peel people off with this or that.'' 
 Those interests extend far beyond agriculture, however, reflecting the scope of the bill, which includes more money for food stamps, more than $30 billion a year, than for farmers. 
 The new initiatives, including more money for research on alternative fuels, were not the only nod to technology. Acknowledging that most people who receive food stamps no longer use paper coupons but electronic transfers, the bill renames the food stamp program as the Secure Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
 Among the handful of Republicans voting for the bill was Representative Adrian Smith of Nebraska, whose district led the nation by receiving more than $1.7 billion in subsidies from 2003 to 2005. 
 ''I was pleased at the willingness of all members on the House Agriculture Committee to work together to accomplish multiple goals while still preserving a workable farm safety net,'' Mr. Smith said in a statement. ''I look forward to this bill's progress through the Senate and conference committee and to seeing the overly partisan aspects of this bill removed.''

HEADLINE: The Centrists Didn't Hold

BYLINE: By NOAM SCHEIBER. 
Noam Scheiber is a senior editor for The New Republic.

 BODY:
Washington
 NOT very long ago, the Democratic Leadership Council was a maker of presidents -- or, at least, the maker of a president. In 1991, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, then the council's chairman, elucidated the ''New Democrat'' ethos and previewed the themes of his presidential candidacy (''opportunity, responsibility, community'') with a speech at the centrist group's annual conference. ''It became the blueprint for my campaign message,'' Mr. Clinton later wrote in his autobiography. He added, ''By embracing ideas and values that were both liberal and conservative, it made voters who had not supported Democratic presidential candidates in years listen to our message.''
 But few headlines will be made this weekend at the council's ''National Conversation'' in Nashville. The next president of the United States almost certainly won't be there. Not only are Democratic front-runners like Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama planning to skip the conference, but so are the Bill Richardsons and Chris Dodds of the field. That's probably a good move for the candidates, as the council has become radioactive among Democratic primary voters. But the Democratic Leadership Council's fading influence is also good news for the entire party. 
 One cause of the council's decline is obvious. The group lost a direct line to the White House when Bill Clinton left office. But the change has also come about for more subtle reasons. The New Republic, where I work, was once closely associated with the council's moderate agenda. These days, however, many of the fights the group picks seem as quaint to me and my colleagues as an old Fleetwood Mac song. Despite what you hear from the council, the biggest problem facing the Democrats, and the nation, is not the party's liberal activists.
 Before the Clinton presidency, the leadership council's critique of the Democratic Party had merit. Many voters emerged from the 1970s and early '80s deeply skeptical of liberalism. As Mr. Clinton put it in his 1991 speech, people who once voted for the Democrats no longer ''trusted us in national elections to defend our national interest abroad, to put their values in our social policy at home or to take their tax money and spend it with discipline.'' 
 The council grew out of frustration with Walter Mondale's crushing 1984 defeat. Mr. Mondale had maneuvered to win the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s endorsement during the Democratic primaries, but his victory was pyrrhic. The endorsement solidified Mr. Mondale's reputation as the candidate of special interests. In order to shake the label, Mr. Mondale proposed raising taxes to cut the deficit, which only worsened his image among swing voters. 
 During the 1980s and '90s, the council played a vital role in curbing both the perception and the reality of liberal excess inside the Democratic Party, and its efforts paved the way for Mr. Clinton's ascendance. The council's medicine worked. The centrist wing of the party won important battles on welfare reform, crime and the budget. By the late '90s, Americans trusted Democrats to run the economy and keep their neighborhoods safe.
 But George W. Bush taught Democrats of all stripes that their differences with one another were minor compared with the differences between them and Republicans. For seven years, Democrats have faced a radical administration that operates in bad faith. Yet there was the Democratic Leadership Council, still arguing that teachers unions endanger the republic. 
 Democrats, moderate and liberal, have been bewildered by the group's post-Clinton agenda. Take, for example, the law passed by Congress in 2005 that makes it harder for ordinary people to declare bankruptcy. The measure's only obvious beneficiary was the credit-card industry, and most Democrats opposed it. One main exception was a coalition of House members allied with the council. In an implicit rebuke to their Democratic colleagues, these New Democrats declared their support for the bill ''as champions of both personal and fiscal responsibility.'' 
 But Democrats had by this point done much to establish themselves as proponents of ''personal and fiscal responsibility.'' They were in no danger of trashing the party's post-Clinton reputation. More important, the bill hardly seemed like a high priority amid the Bush administration's vast upward redistribution of wealth. 
 The leadership council made an analogous mistake in the aftermath of the Iraq war. By 2006, most Democrats who supported the invasion had recanted. But council officials doubled down in the face of the fiasco, attacking opponents of the war during Ned Lamont's Senate campaign against Joe Lieberman.
 Today, the council has almost no constituency within the Democratic Party. About every five years, the Pew Research Center conducts a public opinion survey to sort out the country's major ideological groupings. In 1999, Pew found that liberals and New Democrats each accounted for nearly one-quarter of the Democratic base. By the next survey in 2005, New Democrats had completely disappeared as a group and the liberals had doubled their share of the party. Many moderates, radicalized by President Bush, now define themselves as liberals. 
 On a variety of issues the council, and not the party's liberal base, is out of touch with the popular mood. A recent Washington Post poll found that 60 percent of independents, along with 70 percent of Democrats, favor withdrawing from Iraq by next spring. 
 Two decades of work by the Democratic Leadership Council -- and a not inconsiderable assist from President Bush -- have made the Democratic Party the healthiest it has been in the 22 years of the council's existence. Democrats should thank the group and then tell it that it's no longer needed.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Has Worst Week In Years, as Stocks Fall Again

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ. 
Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply on Wall Street yesterday, a day after the market tumbled because of worries about slowing domestic growth and tighter borrowing conditions.
 It was the worst week for the American stock market in nearly five years, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping nearly 5 percent, after a sharp sell-off in the last half-hour of trading. The Dow fell 208.10 points yesterday after dropping 311.50 points on Thursday; it declined 4.23 percent for the week.
 Investors took little comfort from a government report released yesterday that showed the economy grew at a strong pace in the second quarter, which Bush administration officials cited in an effort to assuage the public after the rout in the market on Thursday. 
 The stock market has become increasingly volatile in the last several months as the slumping housing market and problems in the debt markets are taxing the American economy. At the same time, stronger growth is China, India and Europe have kept the global economy humming. 
 ''The economy is still strong, job growth is still healthy, the unemployment rate is low, and the global economy is booming,'' said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at the brokerage firm Charles Schwab. ''But there are cracks here and those cracks seem to be gaining more of the market's attention than the stronger components. We'll have to see which one takes hold.''
 Early yesterday, President Bush and four of his top economic and financial officials went on the airwaves to try and dispel worries about the economy. They cited a Commerce Department report that showed that the economy rebounded in the three months that ended in June; it grew 3.4 percent, which was up from a pace of 0.6 percent in the first quarter. 
 ''And so I want the American people to take a good look at this economy of ours,'' Mr. Bush said. ''The world is strong -- the world economy is strong. I happen to believe one of the main reasons why is because we remain strong.''
 While markets did bounce up briefly early in the day, investors found little solace in the latest economic report or the soothing words from Washington.
 When trading ended, the S.& P. had fallen 1.6 percent, or 23.71 points, to 1,458.95; it is now up 2.9 percent for the year after having been up 9 percent last week. The Dow fell 1.5 percent, to 13,265.47, and is up 6.4 percent for the year, about half what it was a week ago. And the Nasdaq composite index fell 37.10 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,562.24. With several swings, the stock market resembled a roller coaster ride -- though one that probably provided little amusement for many investors. The Dow, for instance, swung 254 points from its high to the nadir at which it ended the day. With a half-hour left in trading, it appeared that stocks would close only modestly down for the day before they plunged -- the Dow dropped about 135 points in 25 minutes.
 Crude oil prices surged nearly 3 percent, closing at $77.02 a barrel, a penny short of its record. Treasury notes and bonds were little changed, though high-yield bonds and other debt continued to fall yesterday.
 Earlier, European markets closed essentially flat, after the decline Thursday in the United States, but markets across Asia suffered one of the worst days of the year, with the benchmark Japanese index falling 2.4 percent. The one major exception was China, where markets were mixed.
 The Commerce Department's report on the gross domestic product, the broadest gauge of the economy's output, showed that stronger government spending and exports were the driving forces in the second quarter. It also showed, to the concern of some economists, that consumer spending slowed significantly to a 1.3 percent pace, from 3.7 percent in the first quarter. 
 Still, the chief concern for investors appears to be what is happening with interest rates and the ability of consumers and businesses to borrow money.
 Yesterday, the British candy maker Cadbury Schweppes said it would delay the sale of its beverage unit, which makes Dr Pepper and 7Up, because of ''extreme volatility'' in the market, which is another way of saying it has become harder to raise money for acquisitions. The news came just days after private equity firms and their bankers had trouble finding investors willing to lend the money needed to acquire Chrysler, the automaker, and Alliance Boots, the British drugstore chain.
 Shares of Blackstone, the private equity firm that went public in early June, fell $1.40, to close yesterday at $24.30. The stock opened trading at $31 and reached as high as $38.
 Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup, said it appeared that stock market investors had become rapt by the sudden and significant changes in the credit markets, almost to the exclusion of other factors that usually have a greater influence on share prices, like corporate profits, which remain healthy.
 ''There is the potential for fear generating undue fear,'' Mr. Levkovich said. ''Nonetheless, it becomes real because it's in the market.''
 Bondholders are now demanding that borrowers pay them 3.9 percent more than the yield on the 10-year Treasury note, 4.78 percent, to hold junk bonds, up from a premium of just 2.1 percent in early June, according to KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm.
 In the stock market, the information technology, energy, health care and information technology sectors posted some of the biggest declines. In the energy sector, shares of major oil producers fell even as crude oil prices jumped and Chevron issued a strong profit report that was in line with analysts' expectations.
 Mr. Levkovich suggested that the sell-off could be driven by profit-taking, given that the energy sector is up nearly 19 percent for the year.
 Investors may be thinking, '' 'I've made money here and I want to protect my winnings,' '' Mr. Levkovich said. ''You never lose money taking a profit.''

HEADLINE: With Citizenship Comes a Passion for Politics, and Life

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
When a group of new United States citizens posed for photographs yesterday in a Queens basement, Zhai Ruiyun, 68, was invisible except for a floss of white hair at the top of her head. But if you peered behind the shoulder of a tall man, and between the tiny flags on wooden dowels, you could see that she was glowing like a firefly. 
 Get her talking about voting and Ms. Zhai speaks breathlessly, thumping her breastbone for emphasis. Last fall, the night before she cast her first vote, she was too keyed up to sleep, she said; she stood in the voting booth for what seemed like an age. She was used to thinking of herself as an old immigrant woman, she said, of so little use to anybody that at one point she contemplated a fade-out suicide: she would catch a bus to nowhere, and starve to death. 
 That first vote -- for Ellen Young, a Chinese-American who went on to win a seat in the State Assembly -- made tears run down Ms. Zhai's face. ''I could not believe that at such an old age I could have this right,'' she said yesterday in Cantonese, through a translator. ''It's beyond my words.'' 
 Yesterday, Ms. Zhai celebrated her new status along with 40 other immigrants at Selfhelp Community Services in Flushing, which helps immigrants prepare for the citizenship test. The honorees -- mostly Chinese and in their 70s and 80s -- wore ankle socks and orthopedic sandals; the walls were cinder block, spruced up with balloons and streamers. Everything about it was ordinary, and also extraordinary. Ms. Zhai's teachers murmured about her, the way she walked into the citizenship program and shot past their expectations. 
 Ms. Zhai talked about politics. 
 ''Hillary has a brain,'' said Ms. Zhai, who had six years of formal schooling in China and spent 30 in a factory, hunched over a buffing machine, shining metal parts. ''When Clinton was president, the economy was good.''
 ''Hillary has a president behind her,'' she added. ''I have decided to vote for Hillary.'' 
 On weekday mornings, 200 students crowd into this cramped basement space, where mah-jongg tiles clack in the corners. Among them are bereft members of an urban elite and villagers who labored for decades in laundries and workshops, too exhausted to learn. Others are like Ms. Zhai, brought to America to care for their children's children, and cut loose, late in life, to figure out where they belong.
 Passing the citizenship exam transforms her students, said Jing-Juan Yu, who teaches English and who watched the ceremony from the side of the room. 
 ''It seems that their face is shining,'' said Ms. Yu. 
 Three years ago, when Ms. Zhai first turned up at the center with her husband, she sat across from Jane Qiu, the center's director and a social worker, and wept. A daughter in Arizona had hoped that the Zhais could provide child care, but instead, Ms. Zhai needed treatment for breast cancer. The family cleaned itself out trying to pay her medical bills, which Medicaid does not cover for green-card holders in Arizona, and her daughter finally asked them to leave.
 Life with a second daughter, in New York, was tumultuous: Relations between mother and daughter became so strained that they communicated only by writing notes, Ms. Qiu said. After six years in the United States, Ms. Zhai could not read the alphabet, and she was afraid to venture onto the subway, sticking to the one bus she knew well, the Q58. 
 ''There was no road for me,'' said Ms. Zhai. ''I wanted to kill myself.'' 
 The center helped her enroll in Medicaid, and when she finished her treatment, she began English lessons. This did not begin well; she was undereducated, even for a Chinese woman of her generation, and most of the other students at least knew the alphabet. But the week after Ms. Yu taught her the alphabet, Ms. Zhai came back knowing it. She surpassed her husband, who began preparing dinner for her in the evenings. 
 ''Her cognitive ability surprised me,'' Ms. Qiu said, and over the next two years Ms. Zhai ''learned English from scratch.'' Last July, she astonished her teachers by passing the citizenship exam on the first try. This month, the center closed Ms. Zhai's case. 
 Every now and then, Ms. Zhai crosses a threshold. A year and a half ago, a friend took her to Manhattan on the subway for a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, then left her alone to find her way back. Ms. Zhai panicked: Where was the Q58 when she needed it? She clutched a map and studied it. She got on the wrong train and reversed herself. The afternoon wore on. She made the transfer to the No. 7 at Grand Central Terminal, and as the train crossed the river into Queens, she flushed with satisfaction. She rides the subway all the time now. 
 ''What makes me the most happy,'' she said, ''is to do what I want to do.''

HEADLINE: Picturing Protest, Artists Organize to Fight Camera Permit Proposal

BYLINE: By COLIN MOYNIHAN

 BODY:
As the city considers rule changes that would require a permit to photograph and film in public places, a coalition of filmmakers and photographers is mobilizing a campaign against the rules by using the very medium they believe the regulations would constrict.
 Members of a newly formed advocacy group called Picture New York gathered recently at a gallery in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to harness their creative skills to express their opposition to the rules by planning demonstrations, including one that was set to take place yesterday in Union Square. The public comment period ends next Friday. 
 Some members used a detailed stencil to make cardboard props that resembled a 16-millimeter Bolex camera like the one Andy Warhol used. Others have compiled clips that are posted on a Web site run by the group, picturenewyork.org.
 ''Until very recently, nobody knew about this issue,'' said Laura Hanna, an independent documentary filmmaker. ''We are, in a way, running out of time.''
 The new rules, which were proposed by the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting, would require any group of two or more people who want to use a camera in a public place for more than 30 minutes to get a city permit and $1 million in liability insurance. The same requirements would apply to any group of five or more people who plan to use a tripod in a public location for more than 10 minutes, including the time it takes to set up the equipment. The permits would be free. 
 City officials said they would decide after next Friday whether to adopt the rules as they are, amend them or draft new rules and reopen the public review process. 
 Picture New York's Web site includes a link that allows visitors to send comments to the city's film office. Visitors to the site can also post short films or videos expressing their views. Among those who have is Juliana Luecking, an artist known for posting short clips on the video-sharing Web site YouTube under the name QueenJuliana. In her clips, she interviews people in public places in New York City.
 ''Me with the camera and the person I'm talking to would be two people,'' she said. ''The rules would put a major obstruction in the way of people expressing themselves to me and being able to grab that on camera.''
 Officials have said that the rules are not intended to apply to tourists or amateur filmmakers or photographers. ''For the first time in its 40-year history, the Mayor's Office of Film, Theater and Broadcasting is writing rules that will codify our current procedures with respect to film permitting,'' Julianne Cho, associate commissioner in the film office, wrote in an e-mail message. ''As is standard with the City's rulemaking process, we welcome public feedback as we work to produce rules that continue to assist our customer base and grow the City's film industry.''
 But the language of the regulations does not include specific exemptions for amateurs, and critics have warned that vague phrasing could lead to inconsistent and perhaps discriminatory enforcement. 
 One member of Picture New York, Jem Cohen, said that he was motivated to work against the rules because of an experience in 2005 when federal agents seized film that he had shot from the window of an Amtrak train to Washington. 
 Mr. Cohen, who has made an impressionistic short film about New York City called ''Lost Book Found'' that is in the permanent collections at the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum, said that he was told his material would be returned, but that he received only an empty film can.
 ''I'm shocked that the very first sentence of the Bill of Rights can quickly become meaningless, because photography is an established form of free speech,'' Mr. Cohen said.
 Some opponents say the cost of insurance required under the rules would burden independent filmmakers and photographers with limited budgets. City officials said that if the proposed rules were adopted, insurance could be waived in some cases for those who could not afford it.
 Christopher Dunn, associate legal director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said many people have expressed concern about the rules, including representatives of the Manhattan Neighborhood Network, a public access cable station that often conducts interviews on the street, and bird-watchers and nature photographers who frequent Central Park.
 ''The rules they are proposing are unconstitutional,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''And we will sue if they adopt them.''
 In the end, some opponents said, the rules could diminish the visual legacy of New York, one of the most photographed and filmed cities in the world. ''People look at New York as a romantic and fascinating place,'' said Beka Economopoulos, a member of Picture New York. ''And part of that is because of all the iconic images that have been created here.''

HEADLINE: CUNY Raising Admissions Standards With Higher Math Cutoff

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The City University of New York is beginning a drive to raise admissions requirements at its senior colleges, its first broad revision since its trustees voted to bar students needing remedial instruction from its bachelor's degree programs nine years ago.
 In 2008, freshmen will have to show math SAT scores 20 to 30 points higher than they do now to enter the university's top-tier colleges -- Baruch, Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens -- and its six other senior colleges. 
 Students now can also qualify for the bachelor's degree programs with satisfactory scores on the math Regents examination or on placement tests; required cutoffs for those tests will also be raised.
 Open admissions policies at the community colleges will be unaffected. 
 ''We are very serious in taking a group of our institutions and placing them in the top segment of universities and colleges,'' said Matthew Goldstein, the university chancellor, who described the plan in an interview. ''That is the kind of profile we want for our students.''
 Dr. Goldstein said that the English requirements for the senior colleges would be raised as well, but that the math cutoff would be raised first because that was where the students were ''so woefully unprepared.''
 The chancellor said he had long planned to raise standards further. The new move, which has been discussed with some college presidents but has not been announced publicly, is also a response to some professors' complaints that too many students are poorly prepared for college work, especially in math. 
 In the fall of 2005, for example, more than 40 percent of students in introductory math courses -- pre-calculus, college algebra and calculus -- either failed or dropped out of the classes, numbers typical of many universities nationwide. 
 Still, some CUNY professors fear that the new requirements will keep low-income and black and Hispanic students from entering bachelor's degree programs. The same concern was voiced nine years ago, when students needing remedial instruction were barred. Students, faculty and some elected officials also argued then that enrollments would plunge.
 Enrollments, in fact, have grown since then. But the proportion of black students at the top five colleges fell to 14 percent of regularly admitted freshmen last year, from 20 percent in 1999, according to the university's data. (Those figures do not include those admitted through SEEK, a program for economically and educationally disadvantaged students, who do not have to meet the same criteria.) The proportion of Hispanic students has held even.
 William Crain, a City College psychology professor who fought the earlier change, said he vehemently opposed the new plan because he feared it would keep low-income and black and Hispanic students from entering bachelor's degree programs. ''This is turning the university into more of a middle-class university,'' he said.
 Robert Ramos, a Brooklyn College graduate student who is chairman of the University Student Senate and is a trustee, said he was torn. 
 ''I understand the importance of having high standards,'' he said. ''They help in making your degree much more valuable, especially in this day and age, especially when there is so much competition.''
 But, he added, ''you also have to look at who CUNY is and who the mission of CUNY is to provide education for.''
 Dr. Goldstein acknowledged that ''some dislocating effects'' were inevitable, but said he expected them to be limited.
 Under the new standards, freshmen will have to earn at least 510 on the math SAT to win entry to the five top colleges, and 500 for the bachelor's degree programs at the other senior colleges -- John Jay, Lehman, Medgar Evers, New York City College of Technology, Staten Island and York. The university minimum is now 480, although some colleges have set higher cutoffs.
 The university said 266 students at the five top colleges scored between 480 and 510 on the math SAT last year, but might have qualified in other ways. 
 Currently, students who do not meet the SAT requirement can substitute a score of at least 75 on the Math A Regents exam, which is typically taken in grades 8 to 10, or qualifying scores on ACT's Compass placement tests in pre-algebra and algebra. The university has not yet set the tougher Regents cutoff because the state is changing its high school math program. 
 The plan to raise standards took on momentum last winter, after the university's math council, a group of college professors, asked that the Compass test cutoff scores be raised. 
 In May, Selma Botman, the university provost, notified college presidents that those cutoff scores would be raised very slightly this fall -- to 30 from 27 -- and called on the presidents to improve their teaching and develop other courses for weaker students. 
 Math professors were pleased by the provost's attention but less happy with her solutions.
 Wallace Goldberg, chairman of the math department at Queens College, said at the time that the small increase was like going ''from an F minus minus to an F minus.'' This week, he said the plan to move still higher on Compass cutoffs in 2008 -- a jump to 45 at the top five colleges -- was better but still not enough.
 Many college presidents said they were eager to raise the requirements. ''They are right in thinking the time has come,'' said Christoph M. Kimmich, president of Brooklyn College, who was acting chancellor of the university when the earlier policy change was approved.
 Some CUNY officials, like Ricardo R. Fernandez, president of Lehman College in the Bronx, who were not big supporters of that change, said they had come to embrace it. 
 ''Perhaps I have become more convinced that students are able to rise to the challenge,'' Dr. Fernandez said. 
 He added that higher admissions standards would give Lehman added cachet and help it attract some of the 8,000 Bronx students who attend CUNY colleges in Manhattan that have tougher admissions requirements than Lehman does. 
 Marcia V. Keizs, president of York College in Queens, said higher admissions standards were bringing in better prepared students who had a greater chance of graduating. ''Many schools that had described York as not being on their radar screen before have put us on their radar now,'' she said.
 Edison O. Jackson, president of Medgar Evers College in Brooklyn, said higher admissions standards had increased the proportion of students in the college's bachelor's degree program to about half of his student population, while the college's associate's degree track had shrunk. 
 ''Students are coming in and saying, 'I want to move into the baccalaureate program and into my major much more quickly,' '' Dr. Jackson said. ''And they are.''

HEADLINE: Fraternizing

BYLINE: By Nicholas Confessore. 
Nicholas Confessore is a reporter in the Albany bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
FOR about a century, visitors passing through the front gates of Union College, onto its leafy, sloping campus, have been greeted by three regal mansions. The houses were long occupied by fraternities, their presence on prime campus real estate a symbol of the centrality of Greek organizations here. But for a growing number of applicants, the houses were also a kind of warning: If frats were not up your alley, Union College probably wasn't, either.
''You'd see that these were very prominent places, and a lot of social activity was concentrated around them, day or night,'' says Thomas D. McEvoy, Union's dean of residential and campus life. Today, the houses convey a decidedly different message. The fraternity brothers have moved, and their former homes, together with several other newly renovated buildings, now make up Union's seven Minerva houses, the heart of an ambitious experiment named for the Roman goddess of Wisdom. 
 In practice, the Minerva houses are a foundation on which Union students -- who typically live and dine off campus -- can build a life outside the classroom. They can watch football games or invite professors over for tea, cook dinner with friends or throw a party. The houses are also a physical symbol of Union's ultimate goal: creating a campus where it is harder to tell where the classroom ends and the rest of college begins.
 ''I know that there is no school in America that isn't trying to figure out something like this,'' says Stephen C. Ainlay, who became president of Union last year.
 Greek organizations have been an integral part of social life here -- and at times the sum of it -- for nearly 200 years. The three oldest fraternities in the country were founded at Union in the 1820s; today there are 10 fraternities and sororities on campus. Together, they have provided one of the few reliable social outlets in Union's hometown, Schenectady, a former industrial powerhouse where swaths of new downtown development don't quite hide the boarded-up storefronts.
 ''By the 1990s,'' says Shelton S. Schmidt, an economics professor and faculty representative at Blue House, one of the Minervas, ''it seemed like alcohol was more of a problem than it was before.'' 
 Beer distributors regularly drove their trucks onto campus to deliver kegs for the frats' tap rooms. Binge drinking and long, loud parties were common, and late-night vandalism was a continuing problem. At the same time, surveys showed that many students were bored. By the end of the decade, a planning committee had concluded that some potential applicants were turning away from Union because they were turned off by Greek life. 
 Trustees greenlighted the Minervas, and every incoming freshman in the class of 2008 was assigned to a house. Three are the former fraternity houses; the frats were relocated to private wings of campus dorms. 
 To some students, the Minervas might as well have been giant pocket protectors -- a gathering place for nerds and outcasts. Campus Greeks, believing officials were trying to abolish the frats on the sly, were outright hostile, as were alumni, about half of whom had been in a fraternity or sorority. 
 ''The majority of the reaction was negative,'' says Thomas C. Gutenberger, Union's vice president for college relations. ''They said they would never support the college again, in different types of flowery language.'' In the two years after the Minervas were announced, the college lost more than one in 10 of its alumni donors. 
 But the Minervas had their own attractions. They had cozy living rooms and widescreen televisions with more sports channels than were available at the frats. Each house also had an activities budget of $30,000 and a kitchen stocked with a bottomless supply of coffee and snacks. (Some houses serve Red Bull at study breaks.) 
 ''A lot of people like the Minervas because we spend tons of money on food,'' says Nehal Thakkar, 19, an aspiring doctor assigned to Blue House. Last year, a $25,000 gift from a Union parent inaugurated an evening speaker series that has brought novelists, musicians and other cultural figures to the campus. The well-appointed houses became a particular draw for freshmen, who are not allowed to belong to fraternities or sororities.
 Moreover, every year, Union graduated a class that couldn't imagine a campus without the Greeks -- and matriculated a class that had never known a campus without the Minervas. 
 In June, the last pre-Minerva class graduated from Union. ''These houses have always been Minervas to me,'' notes Michael Dillon, who just completed his sophomore year.
 As some of the initial resistance has worn down, students and administrators say, the houses have begun to develop traditions of their own. 
 Blue House, for example, used some of its budget to buy all 10 seasons of ''Friends'' on DVD and is now host of weekly viewing parties. Golub House is known for its weekend barbecues, Green House for a weekly jam session and an annual erotica night, where students read from Anais Nin and D.H. Lawrence and raffle sex toys. 
 Alcohol is not banned at Minervas for students 21 and older, and the houses have thrown parties that would not be out of place at a frat -- though, as with all parties on campus, at least one student host must have taken Union's ''social host'' training class. More typical are low-key wine-and-cheese parties with faculty members, which officials hope will teach students to imbibe more responsibly.
 Not all Minerva events have been a hit. While the Green House erotica night ranks among the more popular campus occasions, students say other Minerva activities are badly planned, poorly attended or both, reinforcing the perception that the popular crowd hangs out elsewhere. Moreover, surveys by officials indicate that the program has not reached that critical mass of esteem that would put the houses at the center of campus life. In one survey, a first-year student said she had gone to a Minerva dance that had most of the prerequisites of a good party -- free food, a D.J. -- except for one thing: ''You can't really have a dance party with five girls,'' she wrote.
 But in the same survey, more than half said the system had had a positive impact on campus life. The hope is that those numbers will rise as more students take an active role in running the Minervas. In Sorum House, for example, a small council of students and a faculty member found that even though they were dreaming up activities and promoting them, participants were few. So this past year, the council recruited students to do the organizing themselves, and the resulting events were far more popular; one, a class on how to cook simple meals, drew an overflow audience of dozens of students to Sorum's kitchen.
 Officials say the number of alumni donors has also begun to recover. Last year, Union had its second-best fundraising year in overall dollars. The college received about 4,800 applications for this coming fall, up from about 4,200 for 2003. 
 One thing the Minerva system has not done is eliminate Greek life. Roughly one-third of Union students still belong to fraternities and sororities. The number has been more or less constant for the last decade, and students say the Greek houses remain the college's social epicenter.
 ''People go to both,'' says Nathali Neal, 22, a recent graduate who was in Blue House. ''It started out as competition, with the frats hating them, and the Minervas being ridiculed. Now it's become a kind of symbiosis.''
 During the week, students might go to the Minervas for coffee and dessert with a famous author, to make signs for an Earth Day rally, or to watch ''Grey's Anatomy.''
 ''My Minerva is a place I go to meet new people, to have new experiences, and to learn from them,'' says Brian Gulack, 21, who graduated this year from Union, where he was head of student government and a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon. 
 One evening, he and a group of students and faculty went to see a performance of the Pulitzer Prize-winning drama ''Wit'' at Skidmore College in nearby Saratoga Springs. Then they traveled back to Wold House, their Minerva, for dinner and a discussion of the play, which is about an English professor dying of cancer. 
 ''I'm pre-med, some of the other people had worked in hospices, and one of the faculty brought his wife, who is a physician,'' says Mr. Gulack, who described the evening as ''one of my best experiences in Minerva.'' 
 But when students want to drink and dance, he says, they go to the frats, especially on weekends. Even there, things are not as they always were. Incidents of vandalism appear to be on the wane, officials say. And last year, several frats and Minervas sponsored Oktoberfest together -- a sign, perhaps, of the future. 
 The Oktoberfest party was the only time administrators have allowed kegs in the houses, Mr. McEvoy says. ''The frats are pretty good about running an event with alcohol,'' he notes. ''It was much more economical to purchase quality German beer with kegs.''

HEADLINE: China Moves to Refurbish A Damaged Global Image

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 26 

 BODY:
After years of being accused by Western nations of making only token gestures to fight fake goods and months of complaints about the safety of its exports, China is taking extraordinary steps to change its image.
 Last week, Beijing unveiled new controls aimed at fighting counterfeit drugs and substandard exports. High-ranking officials and regulators vowed to strengthen China's food safety system, tighten controls over chemical use by large seafood and meat producers, and create a system that holds producers more accountable for selling unsafe products.
 The government also announced that it had broken up a series of criminal rings that operated huge manufacturing centers, producing goods as varied as pirated Microsoft software, fake Viagra and imitation Crest toothpaste.
 Authorities here have also reached out to Ogilvy Public Relations, an international consultancy that advises on crisis management. 
 ''This is a very concerted effort to show they are doing something,'' said Russell Leigh Moses, a longtime political analyst based in Beijing. ''They are using work groups, issuing directives and closing factories. They are rolling out the artillery.''
 Spurred on by a sense of economic realpolitik, Beijing has grown particularly fearful that mounting international pressure could lead to sanctions or embargoes, and thereby hinder China's booming economy.
 Whether promising to overhaul China's regulatory regime and stepping up enforcement will be enough to tame what some view as the Wild, Wild East of capitalism is unclear, analysts say, because some of the problems are so deeply rooted.
 ''There's no quick fix,'' says Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative in China. ''China has perhaps been cutting some corners because the focus has been on growth. But they have 5,000 companies that produce medicine. That's far too many.
 ''The government has a limited ability to enforce things,'' he said. ''They need to start with simple things: reduce the number of people you monitor.''
 Still, even critics of China's policies have been impressed with the catalog of recently announced changes.
 The bold actions, experts say, are partly aimed at easing political pressure from the United States and the European Union, where regulators and politicians are pressing for assurances about the quality and safety of goods made here after a string of recalls involving goods like tainted pet food and toothpaste, defective tires and dangerous toys.
 In Washington this month, President Bush created a panel of cabinet officials to make recommendations aimed at minimizing the dangers from imported foods or other products. The announcement coincided with Congressional hearings on food safety.
 And in recent weeks, several Democrats in Congress have pressed for tougher measures against China, including trade sanctions and new money for American regulators to guard against unsafe goods entering the country, particularly from China.
 Those issues will lead the agenda for the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., as he arrives for talks with Chinese officials this weekend.
 Europe is also concerned. Top European Union officials are planning to meet in Beijing next month to discuss food safety and other issues. 
 And on Wednesday, the head of the European Union's consumer protection agency, Meglena Kuneva, pressed Chinese regulators to improve their standards during a tour of a government testing lab and a Chinese toy factory near the city of Nanjing.
 Ms. Kuneva said that she was hopeful China would make progress, but she added that if its products continued to be a problem, the European Union would block market access.
 ''Toys like this can be in the hands of children, so do a good job,'' Ms. Kuneva told a young inspector. ''The good name of this country is in your hands.''
 Many experts doubt whether China can follow through on its promises -- some of which have been made before. And Chinese officials have not conceded that all the problems lie here. Regulators have repeatedly accused the international news media of exaggerating the number of problem Chinese goods.
 Some Chinese businessmen say protectionists in the West are seizing on isolated cases to drum up support for trade sanctions, at a time when China is amassing a huge trade surplus.
 China has also argued that the quality of the food it exports is no worse than the quality of American food entering China. After the United States Food and Drug Administration moved last month to block five types of Chinese seafood from entering the United States market, China responded by banning some imports of American frozen poultry and pork, insisting they were tainted by antibiotic residues.
 Still, many experts say China has also become more candid about the challenges facing the country.
 The government recently acknowledged that 20 percent of its consumer goods and 14 percent of the truck tires made here failed safety inspections.
 And, most dramatically, just two weeks ago, China executed the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, for accepting bribes and failing to police the marketplace. Days after he was executed, a top drug agency official admitted that the obstacles to repairing the regulatory systems were daunting.
 The admissions were a surprising about-face for China, which has been slow to accept blame for shipping tainted products overseas.
 But analysts say that as the evidence and bad news began to mount this year, China was forced to respond in a less adversarial way, particularly because the country's booming economy is built on foreign investment and trade.
 Recently, the government has even sought crisis management advice from Western consultants.
 ''They have not historically been advice takers,'' said Scott Kronick, president of Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide China, part of the WPP Group. ''But they are reaching out in a genuine way to seek advice. I think they recognize everything doesn't have to be rosy.''
 Since then, officials from various regulatory agencies and ministries have held news conferences to announce new regulations or to brief the news media on successful crackdowns.
 Last week, China's quality inspectors promised to improve quarterly reports to the European Union about consumer product safety. And on Thursday, the government said it planned to offer large rewards to citizens who report on illegal practices in the food industry.
 Many experts say the problem in China is not oversight but enforcement.
 ''The issue is not whether Chinese businesses are regulated; they are,'' says Yasheng Huang, an associate professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The issue is that the regulators themselves are unable to be impartial in the enforcement of the laws. Those laws are meaningless in a system that does not even pretend to have judicial independence, media freedom and legislative oversight.''
 Some say regulators are susceptible to corruption and that local inspectors can easily be bought off or persuaded that cracking down on local companies hurts economic development and risks jobs.
 That may explain why after years of promising to tackle piracy and counterfeiting, the practice continues to flourish in China, often in the open.
 Last week, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation and China's Ministry of Public Security said they had broken up one of the biggest software piracy rings ever, arresting 25 people and closing six manufacturing facilities in China.
 They also seized $500 million worth of pirated Microsoft and Symantec software. A day later, the government here said it had seized a ton of fake Viagra pills and closed counterfeit drug factories that produced Tamiflu, anti-malaria drugs and other products.
 The seizures may be a sign of progress, but they are also an indication of how widespread the problem has been for China, experts say.
 ''The problem is these are campaigns and they tend to be turned off at some point,'' says Mr. Moses, the analyst in Beijing.

HEADLINE: An Ambivalent Panama Weighs Noriega's Debt and Threat

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
If Manuel Noriega, the deposed dictator, ever returns to Panama, Winston Spadafora, a justice on the country's Supreme Court, has a question for him.
 ''I'd like to ask him,'' Justice Spadafora said in a recent interview in his chambers, ''what he did with my brother's head.''
 Panama has unfinished business with Mr. Noriega, who was taken from here in January 1990 after the American military invaded. There are criminal convictions against him, including one for the beheading of Justice Spadafora's brother, Hugo, a leading opposition figure, in 1985. And there is a sense among the population that despite his years in prison in the United States, he has not fully paid for all the rough years he put everyone here through.
 Still, as his long prison sentence in Miami nears an end (he is scheduled to be released Sept. 9), there are mixed feelings in Panama about his possible return, and some relief that the United States is trying to send him to France, where he has been convicted of using illegal drug profits to buy property worth more than $3 million. 
 The diminutive Mr. Noriega appeared in federal court in Miami on July 26, his hair dyed black, his military uniform neatly pressed under a bulky black coat and his bearing still ramrod straight, at least for a septuagenarian former general. ''Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' he said in a deep voice when the magistrate handling the United States government's extradition request, William C. Turnoff, asked his name.
 Mr. Noriega's lawyers are fighting for him to go to Panama, not France, insisting that the Geneva Conventions mandate that as a prisoner of war he be sent back to his country.
 The issue remains unresolved. But many say that Mr. Noriega, despite 17 years away and his country's best efforts to forget him, continues to cast a shadow over Panama.
 Some Norieguistas, as his former cronies are called, hold positions in the government, which is controlled by the same Democratic Revolutionary Party that Mr. Noriega used to run. One of them, Benjamin Colamarco, who used to run the Dignity Battalions, the paramilitary outfit that cracked down on dissenters, is now the minister of public works.
 Mr. Noriega's numerous homes and other properties, seized years ago by the government but never sold, lie in ruins. In one ramshackle home in the capital, looted and overrun by rodents, a small sign on the gate says ''Noriega.''
 Unlike Chileans, who have fought hard to have their former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, return from overseas to face justice, Panamanians appear more ambivalent about whether Mr. Noriega ought to spend time in local detention.
 ''If he comes back, plenty of people are going to use his return for their own interest,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional law professor and opposition leader who clashed with Mr. Noriega's government. ''Those who believe in him will go to the airport to meet him. Those who hate him will protest. And some people will fear that he will open his mouth and tell all that he knows.''
 Samuel Lewis Navarro, Panama's foreign minister and the son of one of Mr. Noriega's biggest foes, regards the jailed former general as a historical figure even though he still lives. ''The Panamanian people today recognize that period of our history as a very sad, very unfortunate period,'' he said. ''But they have overcome it with a forward-looking vision.''
 As for Mr. Noriega somehow returning to Panamanian politics, something his lawyers say he is not contemplating, Mr. Lewis, who also serves as vice president, said flatly, ''The political relevance of Noriega in Panama is none.''
 In many ways, Panama is not the same place it was when Mr. Noriega walked out of the Vatican Embassy and into the hands of the American soldiers who took him to Miami to be tried on drug trafficking charges.
 Skyscrapers and construction cranes now dot the skyline of the capital. The economic sanctions that the United States imposed in the 1980s to protest Mr. Noriega's rule were long ago lifted, and Panama's economy is now bursting at the seams, second in this part of the world only to Brazil's.
 The military that Mr. Noriega used to lead has been disbanded, deemed nonessential for the new Panama. When Mr. Noriega dons his uniform, as he did in court this week, he is the general of an army of one.
 Various Panamanian governments have requested the extradition of Mr. Noriega since as far back as 1991. The first extradition request, in fact, was signed by Julio E. Berrios, who worked at the Foreign Ministry at the time but is now one of Mr. Noriega's local defense counsels. Still, despite the long-standing extradition effort, there has been no full-court press by President Martin Torrijos to get Mr. Noriega home.
 ''We're following it very closely,'' said Mr. Lewis, describing the extradition as an American legal matter. ''That's as much as we can do.''
 Frank Rubino, one of Mr. Noriega's lawyers, put it differently. ''They're hiding in the background, letting France have their citizen,'' he said of Panamanian officials.
 Besides the killing of Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Noriega has been convicted of the 1989 killings of a group of army officers who tried to overthrow him, including Maj. Moises Giroldi. Mr. Noriega also has been convicted of corruption and kidnapping.
 ''As military regimes go, Noriega's was a relatively benign one,'' acknowledged an official in the current Bush administration who was involved in American policy in Panama before the invasion ordered by the first President Bush in December 1989. ''They didn't kill that many people. They didn't torture that many people. But that's comparing them with the very worst.''
 American officials say that in most cases deposed leaders should pay for their crimes in the country where they committed their wrongs. But in the case of Mr. Noriega, officials acknowledge that his presence in Panama would probably disrupt the country's progress. Washington's current plan is for Mr. Noriega to go to France, where he could spend a decade in prison, and then go to Panama, if he is still alive.
 The problem is that for all the changes in Panama, Mr. Noriega would return to a country with some of the same dysfunctions as the one he left. The judiciary, for instance, is considered corrupt from the Supreme Court on down, and recent changes in the penal code make it possible that Mr. Noriega would not spend much, if any, time behind bars.
 In a few years, Mr. Noriega, who said in court recently that he was 72, could take advantage of a new provision mandating house arrest for those older than 75. He could demand a new trial because he was not in the country to defend himself. He could claim illness, as Rafael Arosemena, a bank president in Mr. Noriega's time, did recently. That action enabled Mr. Arosemenato to return from exile in Mexico and serve his corruption sentence at home.
 ''He should not serve a day in jail,'' said Mr. Berrios, one of Mr. Noriega's Panamanian lawyers, referring to the convictions in absentia as patently unfair.
 In discussing Mr. Noriega, some Panamanians instinctively seem to slip back in habits of the past, when criticizing him openly was dangerous. A waiter at a trendy restaurant in the old section of the capital, his voice falling to a whisper, said he had an ashtray in his home that was looted from one of the former general's residences. ''Noriega smoked cigars and I always think about all the awful things he was planning as he and his friends put out their cigars in that ashtray,'' he said, insisting that his name not be printed just in case Mr. Noriega returned home.
 A former neighbor recalled all the noise that Mr. Noriega's peacocks used to make in the neighborhood and how she and others would grumble about how, if they ever caught one of the birds, they would make peacock sancocho, which is a popular Panamanian stew.
 ''There was a lot less crime when he lived here,'' the neighbor acknowledged, also insisting on anonymity in case Mr. Noriega became a neighbor again. ''That was because of all the soldiers around. There was less crime but everybody still lived in fear of the soldiers.''
 Not everybody. Mr. Noriega had many backers, and a few are rearing their heads. Sipping a rum drink recently as the sun went down on the Caribbean coast of Panama, Elvia Gayle recalled her dear friend Manuel, a tough man, she admits, but one who had cared about poor Panamanians like her.
 ''I'm not saying he was good,'' said Ms. Gayle, who was a member of a pro-Noriega security battalion. ''But I was his friend and I saw he was a man who could cry.''
 She also has something to say to Mr. Noriega upon his return. ''I will hug him and tell him how much I missed him,'' she said. ''I will be at the airport when he comes back even if I'm the only one. I know I won't be alone, though.''
 Probably not. But also there would probably be his many detractors.
 ''I don't think we Panamanians would try to kill him,'' Mr. Bernal said. ''But he wouldn't have a nice time here. There would be plenty of people yelling at him, telling him what they think of him. He would wish he were back in Miami.''

HEADLINE: New Fees May Put a Bite On Midwest Tournaments

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Larry Krohn, the director of the annual Minnetonka Classic Bass Tournament, says he loves handing the big checks to the people who reel in the biggest fish. The prize pool last month was more than $30,000, including the $9,400 for the top-catching two-person team.
 But Krohn's mood seems to sour at the thought of another check he will have to cut before his next event: a new $400 fee to Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources for a tournament permit. He is already paying smaller fees to the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District, for the city's bill for park use and for the insurance policy required by the local sheriff's department. 
 ''After 15 years of running this, my level of frustration is mounting every year,'' Krohn said. ''Every year, it gets worse and worse in terms of the things you have to do. It's going to be enough of a hassle for some tournament directors that they aren't going to do it.''
 Next week, the Department of Natural Resources begins imposing the highest fees in the nation on fishing tournament organizers. They will range from $120 to $1,000, depending on the number of participants and whether fish are taken off-site to be weighed -- costs almost certain to be passed along to anglers through higher entrance fees. The permits had been free.
 Agency officials say they want to recover the cost of issuing event permits, pegged at $108,000 annually. But many competitive anglers consider fees an assault on their sport and say they worry that they will be the final straw for small tournaments struggling to survive.
 It is a debate that has also come to neighboring Wisconsin, where officials are refining a proposed tournament fee schedule after one failed last year amid concerns that it was excessive. Andrew Fayram, a fisheries policy analyst at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said he expected the next plan to split regulatory costs between competitive anglers and contest organizers.
 Beneath the fee fight is a deeper dispute over water use.
 The spread of tournaments -- traced by some to competitive fishing's increasing television presence -- has stoked questions about the sport's possible strain on fisheries; organizers say they follow catch-and-release practices and that tournaments do not increase fish mortality. There is also tension over lake access and waterway traffic because the events can draw dozens of boats.
 Vern Wagner, who has been active in Minnesota tournament fishing for two decades, said he wondered if the fees were an attempt to discourage contests.
 ''If this was 30 guys in canoes, there wouldn't be a problem,'' he said. ''It's the fact that a bass boat costs $35,000, so, accordingly, somehow we're economically profiting. 
 ''It's a perception that it's a bunch of rich guys going out on the lake and somehow exploiting the resource.''
 Terry Peltier, a member of a Department of Natural Resources citizen panel that recommended the fees, denied trying to curb tournaments.
 But if fewer tournaments is the result, Dave Zentner, an angler from Duluth, Minn., said he was all for it. He viewed fishing as a recreational escape and said he was bothered by corporate sponsorships attached to many tournaments.
 ''I still want to puke when I look at an outdoor channel and see guys grabbing a fish out of a tank and running it across a stage like they've just won the Boston Marathon,'' Zentner said. ''It just turns me off.''
 The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources issues roughly 600 tournament permits a year. The agency requires permits when there are 30 or more entrants for open-water contests and above 150 when the water is iced over.
 Al Stevens, a fisheries program consultant for the agency, said permits helped the department manage where tournaments were held and made sure popular lakes were not overused. The cost of processing permit applications and compiling after-event reports grew more than sixfold in the last decade. The citizen panel recommended a fee to replace dollars currently drawn from a fund fed by regular fishing license fees.
 Under the new system, it will cost tournament organizers $120 for an ice-fishing permit, $400 for open-water events with more than 100 people and onsite fish weighing, $500 for midsized contests where fish are taken off-site and $1,000 for tournaments with 100 or more entrants and off-site weighing.
 Stevens said Minnesota's rates were unrivaled. For instance, Vermont charges a $50 fee and Washington, New Mexico and South Carolina are in the $25 range. Many other states charge nothing.
 Mickey Goetting, the conservation director of the Minnesota Bass Anglers Sportsman Society Federation, said the fees would be especially cumbersome to groups that put on multiple-tournament leagues. 
 The federation would have rather seen the Department of Natural Resources establish a tournament stamp that anglers could buy at a nominal fee with their license that would let them into any event.
 Stevens said some organizers would limit the size of their fields to avoid having to get a permit, and others would merely try to fly under the radar.
 ''I'm afraid of the backlash,'' he said. ''That's just bad for fish management. When we lose sight of how many tournaments there are and where they're at, it could lead to more conflicts at lakes. That's not what we want.''

HEADLINE: Certain Degrees Now Cost More At Universities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Should an undergraduate studying business pay more than one studying psychology? Should a journalism degree cost more than one in literature? More and more public universities, confronting rising costs and lagging state support, have decided that the answers may be yes and yes.
 Starting this fall, juniors and seniors pursuing an undergraduate major in the business school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, will pay $500 more each semester than classmates. The University of Nebraska last year began charging engineering students a $40 premium for each hour of class credit.
 And Arizona State University this fall will phase in for upperclassmen in the journalism school a $250 per semester charge above the basic $2,411 tuition for in-state students. 
 Such moves are being driven by the high salaries commanded by professors in certain fields, the expense of specialized equipment and the difficulties of getting state legislatures to approve general tuition increases, university officials say. 
 ''It is something of a trend,'' said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
 Even as they embrace such pricing, many officials acknowledge they are queasy about a practice that appears to value one discipline over another or that could result in lower-income students clustering in less expensive fields. 
 ''This is not the preferred way to do this,'' said Patrick V. Farrell, provost at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ''If we were able to raise resources uniformly across the campus, that would be a preferred move. But with our current situation, it doesn't seem to us that that's possible.'' 
 At the University of Kansas, which started charging different prices in the early 1990s, there are signs that the higher cost of majoring in certain subjects is affecting the choices of poorer students.
 ''We are seeing at this point purely anecdotal evidence,'' said Richard W. Lariviere, provost and executive vice chancellor at the university. ''The price sensitivity of poor students is causing them to forgo majoring, for example, in business or engineering, and rather sticking with something like history.''
 Private universities do not face the same tuition constraints and for the most part are avoiding the practice, educators say, holding to the traditional idea that college students should be encouraged to get a well-rounded education. 
 Richard Fass, vice president for planning at Pomona, a private liberal arts college in California, said educators there considered it fundamental for students to feel part of the larger college, not segmented by differential costs. ''The entire curriculum is by design available to all students,'' he said.
 Some public university officials say they worry that students who are charged more for their major will stick to the courses in their field to feel that they are getting their money's worth.
 ''I want students in the College of Engineering at Iowa State to take courses in the humanities and to take courses in the social sciences,'' said Mark J. Kushner, the dean of that college. To address problems like climate change, Mr. Kushner said, graduates will need to understand much more than technology. ''That's sociology, that's economics, that's politics, that's public policy.''
 Undergraduate juniors and seniors in the engineering school at Iowa State last year began paying about $500 more annually, he said, and the size of that additional payment is scheduled to rise by $500 a year for at least the next two years. 
 Mr. Kushner said he thought society was no longer looking at higher education as a common good but rather as a way for individuals to increase their earning power.
 ''There was a time, not that long ago, 10 to 15 years ago, that the vast majority of the cost of education at public universities was borne by the state, and that was why tuition was so low,'' he said. ''That was based on the premise that the education of an individual is a public good, that individuals go out and become schoolteachers and businessmen and doctors and lawyers, that makes society better. That's no longer the perception.'' 
 Neither the State University of New York nor the Connecticut State University System use differential pricing, officials say. New Jersey, however, has done so for years, according to a spokesman, Greg Trevor. In the new school year, in-state undergraduates in the general program will pay tuition of $8,541, but engineering and pharmacy students will pay $9,484.80 and business students will pay $8,716.
 Various universities have adopted different versions of differential pricing to try to fight the unintended consequences it may create. Colleges that charge higher tuition for a major like business, engineering or journalism generally allow students outside the field to take some courses in the subject without paying more. 
 ''We do try to encourage crossing disciplines, to get a feel for the world,'' said Randy Kangas, assistant vice president for planning and budgeting at the University of Illinois, where students studying business, chemistry and the life sciences pay higher tuition.
 Most universities with differential tuition use some of the money -- 20 to 25 percent -- for additional financial aid to offset some of the impact. 
 Officials at universities that have recently implemented higher tuition for specific majors say students have supported the move. 
 Students in the business school at the University of Wisconsin, for example, got behind the program because they believed that it would support things like a top-notch faculty. ''It's very important to all the students in the business school to sustain our reputation,'' said Jesse C. Siegelman, 21, who expects to graduate in December 2008. 
 Mr. Siegelman said representatives of 26 of 28 student groups that belong to the school's Undergraduate Student Leadership Council, of which he was president last year, voted to support the tuition proposal.
 In engineering programs, the additional money often goes toward costly laboratory equipment, because students and the companies that will employ them expect graduates to be able to go to work immediately using state of the art tools, said Mr. Lariviere of the University of Kansas.
 ''In many instances,'' he said, ''industry itself is demanding this.'' 
 And in business schools, professors' salaries have risen, with some schools paying starting professors $130,000 or more, said G. Dan Parker III, associate executive vice president of Texas A&M, which he said was considering whether to charge higher tuition to undergraduate students studying business.
 ''The salaries we pay for entering assistant professors on average is probably larger than the average salary for full professors at the university,'' Mr. Parker said of business professors. ''That's how far the pendulum has swung at the business schools, and I sure wish they'd fix it.''
 While several university officials said students in majors that carried higher costs could bear the burden because they would be better paid after graduation, Mr. Lariviere said he was skeptical of that rationale. He pointed out that many people change jobs several times over a career and that a major is a poor predictor of lifetime income. 
 ''Where we have gone astray culturally,'' he said, ''is that we have focused almost exclusively on starting salary as an indicator of life earnings and also of the value of the particular major.''

 CORRECTION:
A chart on Sunday with a front-page article about universities that charge different tuitions for different majors misstated the undergraduate division at Iowa State University that charges more than other programs. It is the College of Engineering, not the business school.

HEADLINE: Stranded Palestinians May Get to Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 28 

 BODY:
For seven weeks now, up to 6,000 Palestinians trying to return to their homes in the Gaza Strip have been stranded in Egypt, objects of a political struggle between the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah involving Israel and Egypt.
 But there finally appears to be a deal, opposed by Hamas, to let them return, beginning with about 100 on Sunday, with more to follow during the week, Palestinian, Egyptian and Israeli officials said Saturday. 
 The Palestinians, some of whom had gone to Egypt or elsewhere for medical care or schooling, have been stuck in Rafah, an Egyptian border town, or nearby El Arish because the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been shut since June 9. Several hundred, with little money, have been living in harsher conditions in the desert, cared for by various international aid agencies.
 The Rafah border crossing, like the separate Karni crossing for goods between Israel and Gaza, was closed because of the fighting in June between Fatah and Hamas. After the Hamas rout of Fatah and takeover of Gaza, those main crossings for people, in Rafah's case, and goods, in Karni's, have been kept shut by Egypt and Israel to isolate Hamas. The closure has had the quiet support of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, who fired the Hamas government and installed a new one in the West Bank led by an independent economist, Salam Fayyad, whose authority Hamas refuses to recognize.
 Hamas has insisted that Egypt and Israel abide by a crossings agreement negotiated by the Bush administration and reopen Rafah and Karni. Hamas has said that it will not allow Kerem Shalom -- a border crossing into Gaza on Israeli territory but where Gaza, Egypt and Israel meet -- to be used for people, because Israel will control who may enter or exit from Gaza. That is how Israel wants it, because Hamas officials have been able to bring in millions of dollars with them unchecked through the Rafah crossing, even though it was monitored by European Union officials and by Israelis on a video link.
 The plight of the stranded Palestinians may be resolved, but not the larger issue. According to Riad Maliki, speaking Saturday for the Fayyad government in Ramallah, Israel will approve the names of those entering Gaza on lists prepared by the Palestinians. Those stranded will cross from Egypt into Israel at the Al Oja cargo crossing south of Rafah, Egyptian officials said Saturday, then be bused to the Erez crossing with Gaza controlled by Israel.
 About 100 on a list of 627 people approved by Israel will cross Sunday and the remainder on Monday, the Egyptians said, with more to follow.
 Ashraf al-Ajrami, minister for prisoners affairs in Ramallah, said Saturday, ''Due to the absence of Palestinian security forces at Rafah crossing, and amid Egyptian, Israeli and European refusals to reopen the crossing, we agreed with the Israelis to let the people cross at an Israeli crossing.''
 Hamas denounced the deal, because it bypasses Rafah. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Sami Abu Zuhri, said: ''There is only the Rafah border crossing. The use of any other border crossing increases Israeli control over the Gaza Strip.'' Hamas has fired mortar shells on Kerem Shalom to try to prevent its use, and may try to do the same toward Erez.
 In an indication of Fatah's lack of interest in opening Gaza for ordinary passage of goods and people, thereby easing pressure on Hamas, Palestinian Authority representatives at the United Nations have been working to block a Security Council presidential statement criticizing the ''humanitarian situation'' in Gaza and calling for the Gaza crossings to be opened immediately, according to the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz. Qatar, which is considered close to Hamas, drafted the statement, which is nonbinding but requires consensus among the Council's members.
 Gazans have been unable to export a single item since Karni was shut July 12, though Israel has allowed vital imports. Israeli officials insist that they only have security concerns about Karni, but also say they will not deal with Hamas. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mark Regev, said that Israel was open to ''creative solutions,'' including the use of a private Turkish company to operate the Gazan side of Karni. But Israel and Mr. Abbas insist that Hamas must have no control over the crossing at all, which Hamas rejects.
 Later on Saturday, Israel killed two Palestinian gunmen from Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah as they tried to plant explosives and fire mortars near the Israel-Gaza border. Abu Thaer, a Gaza spokesman for the brigades, confirmed the attempted attack, saying it was a response to efforts by Fatah and Mr. Fayyad to drop the principle of ''armed resistance'' against Israel.

LENGTH: 1123 words

HEADLINE: The Flights Are Long. The Planes Are Cramped.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
AS if commercial air travel weren't miserable enough, more airlines are using narrower jets on long-haul flights, putting an even greater squeeze on travelers in coach. Delta Air Lines is among the latest to announce plans to use the slim Boeing 757 on trans-Atlantic routes serving destinations like Britain and Ireland. Continental, which now flies 21 routes to 20 European cities with the 757, was among the first. Northwest and US Airways also have begun flying the narrower jets to Europe. 
 Travelers can find some advantages. The increasing use of 757s to Europe has led to expanded schedules, with more nonstop routes to choose from when planning trips. That means more time saved by avoiding long layovers or plane changes in hub cities. It can also mean a quicker trip through customs at the smaller airports. And for some travelers, like those who live close to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut, where Northwest's new Hartford-to-Amsterdam service departs, it can mean a shorter drive home than the one from the larger hub airport -- Boston Logan in this example. 
 But the 757s, which are generally tolerated on shorter, domestic routes, tend to bring out claustrophobia in passengers on long-haul flights. Unlike wide-body aircraft like 767s and A330s, which typically have two aisles, a 757 has one, which means a lot less room for stretching cramped legs. Because the 757 has no two-seat rows in coach, just three seats on each side of the aisle, there is a higher chance of getting stuck in a middle seat. And while most airlines using the 757s on trans-Atlantic flights are reconfiguring their premium class cabins with better seats and entertainment systems, the coach cabins haven't been changed all that much. 
 ''What this means for the economy passenger is that some amenities they typically receive on international flights, such as personal video screens or laptop power ports, are not available,'' said Matthew Daimler, founder of Seatguru.com, which ranks seat quality and offers insider information -- for example, which exit-row seats won't recline. In addition to the amenities, Mr. Daimler added, wide-body planes like 777s and A330s, ''generally offer more overhead storage per passenger, slightly extra seat width, bassinets for infants and typically a better chance of getting an upgrade.''
 For example, there are 48 business class seats on Continental's international routes flying 777-200 aircraft and 235 seats in coach. That's roughly one business class seat for every five in coach. On its 757-200, there are 16 business class and 159 coach seats, or about one business class seat for every 10 in coach. And seats in both business and coach are slightly narrower on the 757. 
 To try to make passengers a little more comfortable, some airlines are taking out seats to offer more legroom in coach and retrofitting their premium cabins with updated business class seats and entertainment. Northwest, for example, has configured its 757s to Europe with 16 new World Business Class seats, which come with portable in-flight entertainment systems with 40 movies, 40 compact discs of music and 6 games. In coach, the pitch, or distance between rows, has been increased up to four inches. Continental completed installation last winter of new entertainment systems in the BusinessFirst cabins of its fleet of 41 Boeing 757 aircraft used primarily on trans-Atlantic flights to and from Newark. This summer it began installing the systems, which offer customers up to 25 movies, 25 short-subject programs and 50 compact discs, in its economy cabins, too. US Airways said it plans to upgrade in-flight entertainment on its 757s later this year. 
 Still, there is the bathroom factor. Because of the single aisle, travelers are effectively trapped, either in their seats or in the aisle on the way back to their seats, every time a cart comes rolling along, which can be often on an international flight. 
 ''If the only aisle is continually clogged and you've got to go -- it's a problem,'' said Jerry Chandler, who writes Cheapflights.com's travel blog. ''You've got to get a kid back to the bathroom? I'm sorry, you're stuck.'' 
 The use of 757s on trans-Atlantic flights was recently made possible by so-called blended winglets -- new devices on wings that reduce drag, increase fuel efficiency and boost flight range. The 757, which took to the skies in the early 1980s, was used at first on mid-length domestic flights and then, after regulations were changed to allow twin-engine airplanes on longer routes, also on transcontinental flights. The new winglet technology, further expanding the 757's range, allows United States carriers in search of new markets overseas to expand service to more regions, often with direct routes to smaller cities -- moves they wouldn't be able to justify using larger planes that eat up more fuel and have many more seats to fill. 
 Northwest, for example, began flying 757s with 160 seats nonstop from Hartford to Amsterdam on July 1. It also started flying from Detroit to Dusseldorf and Brussels this summer using the 757. US Airways now flies 757s to Brussels, Shannon, Dublin, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Glasgow from its Philadelphia hub.
 To try to maximize your comfort on a 757 to Europe this summer, take a look at the diagrams on the airline's homepage to see which seats are open for your flight. Then cross-reference your findings with information on Web sites like SeatGuru.com or SeatExpert.com, which rank seat quality. SeatGuru.com recommends seats in Row 16 on Continental's 767-200, for instance, because they are exit-row seats, with extra legroom, and they recline fully. It advises avoiding Row 14, where reclining is limited. 
 Or you could avoid single-aisle planes altogether. Joseph Remy, a financial analyst from Washington, bought a ticket on a 757 from Newark to Dublin in October for the convenience of flying nonstop. But the experience was so miserable, he said, that he purposely avoided 757s when booking another trip to Ireland this summer. 
 The lack of psychological space was part of the issue. ''To go that long, it just seems so small,'' said Mr. Remy who was stuck next to ''a very large woman'' on the way east and to a drunken man on the way home. With only one aisle, ''there was no escape route'' to take a break from his seatmates or to get around the cart when it came down the aisle. And after having to squint at ''a really small screen'' for the in-flight movie, Mr. Remy said, ''it felt like it was 1965.'' 
 Mr. Remy is flying a two-aisle 767 with a stopover before landing in Dublin for his trip next month. Though a couple of flights on 757s were cheaper, Mr. Remy, said, he wasn't tempted. ''I said no way.''

HEADLINE: Design Teams Hired in Nassau Coliseum Project

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
The Nassau Coliseum redevelopment plan advanced another step when the project's partners chose a master planning team of two architecture and planning firms, the Development Design Group of Baltimore and the Spector Group of North Hills.
 The two companies will design a $2 billion suburban center on 77 acres of county-owned property. It is scheduled to include an 18,000-seat arena for sporting events and concerts as well as housing, office space, retail stores, a hotel and a complete restoration and renovation of the Nassau Coliseum. The project's partners -- Lighthouse Development Group, a joint venture between Charles B. Wang, owner of the New York Islanders and founder of Computer Associates, and Scott H. Rechler, chairman of RexCorp Realty -- announced the hiring of the planning team on July 20.
 The Development Design Group is known for malls and mixed-use developments throughout the country. The Spector Group's projects include RexCorp Plaza in Uniondale, Jericho Plaza and the Islandia headquarters of Computer Associates. The company will provide local expertise for the project's planning and design, said Marc B. Spector, one of the company's principals. 
 Mr. Rechler, Long Island's largest developer of commercial real estate, said, ''We were looking for a team who would want to stick with the character of Long Island, but at the same time provide Long Island with what it doesn't have.''
 The Lighthouse Project is expected to create 16,000 construction jobs, as well as thousands of permanent jobs and many new businesses, and to generate almost $60 million of annual real estate tax revenue, Mr. Rechler said. 
 Nassau Advised to Limit 
 Growth of Health Care Costs
 An advisory committee has recommended ways to restrain the growth of Nassau County's health care bills for county workers, which Howard S. Weitzman, the county comptroller, said were costing taxpayers almost a quarter of a billion dollars each year.
 In the last five years, the county's health care costs for employees and retirees have increased by 60 percent, said the report by Mr. Weitzman's Audit Advisory Committee, which was issued July 19. 
 ''The cost for health care now amounts to 10 percent of the county's budget and an amazing 32 percent of what residents pay in property taxes,'' Mr. Weitzman said. 
 The advisory committee, composed of independent financial experts, was formed by Mr. Weitzman in 2003. Although the comptroller's office does not have the authority to change the county's health policy, Mr. Weitzman has submitted the report to the County Legislature and to County Executive Thomas R. Suozzi, along with its suggestions for limiting the growth of health care costs.
 One cost-saving recommendation that has already begun to be used is the elimination of duplication of benefits -- offering two separate family health benefit packages when both spouses or partners work for, or are retired from, the county. 
 The Legislature eliminated these duplicate benefits for nonunion employees in 2006, saving $276,000 in the first year. The recent agreement with the Nassau Police Benevolent Association also eliminated the practice, which will save more than $900,000 in 2008 when fully in effect. 
 If duplicate coverage is completely eliminated as new contracts are negotiated, Mr. Weitzman estimated, it will save $27 million over six years.
 Other recommendations made by the advisory committee involved participant contributions to the cost of health insurance; changes to the benefit plan; vesting changes that would increase the number of years required for new employees to be eligible for retiree health benefits; and wellness programs for county employees.
 Counties Buying Land
 To Preserve Open Space
 Nassau and Suffolk recently committed millions more dollars to preserve open space, agreeing to buy more than 160 acres of prime land.
 Nassau County closed on a deal on July 18 to buy 33.5 acres of the Northwood estate in Oyster Bay Cove for $11 million. The money came from a $50 million bond, approved by the Legislature in 2004. Tom Maher, the Nassau County director of environmental coordination, said that the Oyster Bay Cove land was chosen because it is adjacent to Tiffany Creek Preserve and expands that open space. 
 Several days earlier, the county closed on the 12-acre Boegner Farm in Westbury. The two sales completed the purchase of seven tracts of land that the county had designated for preservation in its last bond act. 
 Mr. Maher said that in a separate deal later this summer, the county would give the Village of Port Washington North $600,000 for several acres that the village will use in its Baywalk Park project. 
 In Suffolk earlier this month, County Executive Steve Levy authorized the purchase of the development rights to 118 acres of active farmland in the Town of Riverhead, which will prevent any development on the land and enable the farmers to continue to own and farm it without economic hardship. 
 Among the properties to be preserved is the 27-acre Farr Farm in the hamlet of Calverton, bought by the county for $2.43 million. The property includes about five acres of vineyards; the rest is used for organically grown pumpkins and mixed crops. It is the first 100 percent organic farm to be preserved by Suffolk County.
 Also on the list are the 70-acre Zilnicki Farm in Riverhead, which is a large producer of cabbage, and Reeve Farm in Riverhead, a 21-acre crop farm. The total $8.1 million cost for the development rights on both farms was split between Suffolk and the Town of Riverhead.

HEADLINE: Sending Back The Doctor's Bill

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
HOW to fix the health care system?
 Easy, liberals say. If Washington would just force cuts in prescription drug prices and insurance company profits, plenty of money would be left over to cover the uninsured.
 Conservatives prefer to argue that the answer lies in forcing people to pay more of their own medical costs.
 But many health care economists say both sides are wrong. These economists, some of whom are also doctors, say the partisan fight over insurers and drug makers is a distraction from a bigger problem: the relatively high salaries paid to American doctors, and even more importantly, the way they are compensated.
 ''I always find it ironic that when I go to doctor groups and such, they always talk about the cost of prescription drugs,'' said Dana Goldman, director of health economics at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institute in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 Prescription drugs cost, on average, 30 percent to 50 percent more in the United States than in Europe. But the difference in doctors' salaries is far larger, Dr. Goldman said.
 Doctors in the United States earn two to three times as much as they do in other industrialized countries. Surveys by medical-practice management groups show that American doctors make an average of $200,000 to $300,000 a year. Primary care doctors and pediatricians make less, between $125,000 and $200,000, but in specialties like radiology, physicians can take home $400,000 or more.
 In Europe, however, doctors made $60,000 to $120,000 in 2002, according to a survey sponsored by the British government in 2004.
 Given the years of training that doctors require and the stress and importance of their jobs, few would disagree that they should be well paid. In addition, with a year of medical school now about $30,000, many doctors leave school deeply in debt. And many doctors would argue that cutting salaries would only persuade talented, college graduates to pursue better-paying professions. 
 Still, the lower salaries are a significant part of the reason that European countries spend less on health care than the United States does -- a fact liberals avoid mentioning when they preach the advantages of a European-style single-payer system.
 Americans generally do not seem to mind the fact that doctors are well paid. In public opinion surveys, doctors usually rank as the most trusted professionals. Congress has repeatedly blocked Medicare's efforts to reduce the amount it pays for each procedure doctors perform, even though overall Medicare payments to doctors are soaring and the cuts are legally required to keep the program's budget balanced.
 The way that doctors are paid may be an even more significant factor driving up costs and may lead to unnecessary care, said Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonary physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and a former senior adviser to Medicare and Medicaid.
 In the United States, nearly all doctors are paid piecemeal, for each test or procedure they perform, rather than a flat salary. As a result, physicians have financial incentives to perform procedures that further drive up overall health care spending.
 Doctors are paid little for routine examinations and very little for ''cognitive services,'' such as researching different treatment options or offering advice to help patients get better without treatment.
 ''I don't have a view on whether doctors take home too much money or not enough money,'' Dr. Bach said. ''The problem is the way they earn their money. They have to do stuff. They have to do procedures.''
 Primary care doctors and pediatricians, who rarely perform complex procedures, make less than specialists. They are attracting a declining percentage of medical students, and some states are facing a shortage of primary care doctors. 
 Doctors are also paid whether the procedures they perform go well or badly, Dr. Bach said, and whether they are crucial to a patient's health or not..
 ''Almost all expenditures pass through the pen of a doctor,'' he said. So a doctor may decide to perform a test that costs a total of $4,000 in order to make $800 for himself -- when a cheaper test might work equally well. ''This is a highly inefficient way to pay doctors,'' Dr. Bach said.
 Medicare, especially, does not like to second-guess doctors' clinical decisions, said Dr. Stephen Zuckerman, a health economist at the Urban Institute. ''There's not a lot of utilization review or prior authorization in Medicare,'' he said. ''If you're doing the work, you can expect to get paid.''
 As a result, doctors have steadily increased the number of procedures they perform on Medicare beneficiaries -- and thus have increased their income from Medicare, Dr. Zuckerman said. But the extra procedures have not helped patients' health much, he said. ''I don't think there's any real strong evidence of improvements in health status.''
 Private insurers like H.M.O.'s are more aggressive than Medicare in second-guessing physicians' clinical decisions, and they will refuse to pay for imaging scans or other expensive new procedures. Now Medicare and private insurers are moving cautiously to change the current system. Recently, they have proposed pay-for-performance measures that would give doctors small bonuses if their care meets the standards set by national medical organizations such as the American Heart Association.
 BUT all those measures are a minor fix, said Dr. Alan Garber, a practicing internist and the director of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University. Instead, he argues, the United States should move toward paying doctors fixed salaries, plus bonuses based on the health of the patients they care for.
 Even in the existing system, some health insurers, notably Kaiser Permanente, already have large networks of salaried doctors. But it would require doctors to give up some of their autonomy and move into larger group practices or work directly for insurers, a step they have been reluctant to take. About 40 percent of doctors are in single or two-physician practices, Dr. Garber said.
 Nor is the American Medical Association, which represents doctors, eager for wholesale changes in the system, said Dr. Edward L. Langston, chairman of the A.M.A. board. 
 Insurance company profits and the rising cost of preventable diseases like diabetes are big culprits in soaring health care spending, Dr. Langston said.
 But Dr. Goldman of RAND said that doctors are misleading themselves if they think the current system serves patients' needs.
 For example, if a diabetic patient visits a doctor, he said, ''the doctor is paid to check his feet, they're paid to check his eyes; they're not paid to make sure he goes out and exercises and really, that may be the most important thing.'' 
 ''The whole health-care system is set up to pay for services that are rendered,'' he said, ''when the patient, and society, is interested in health.''

HEADLINE: In All Things Moderation, Including Market Timing

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to making asset allocation decisions in your portfolio, it is best not to be dogmatic. That is the conclusion of a new study, which found that investors are likely to do better over the long term by resisting the advice of those who take extreme positions about how much of their portfolios should be allocated among the various asset classes.
 The new study, ''Predictable Returns and Asset Allocation: Should a Skeptical Investor Time the Market?,'' recently began circulating in academic circles as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. A version is available at http://www.nber.org/papers/w13165. Its authors are Jessica A. Wachter, an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Missaka Warusawitharana, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington. 
 Asset allocation and market timing are closely related. Market timing refers to jumping into and out of a single asset class in the hopes of participating in rallies and sidestepping declines, like what the domestic stock market experienced last week. Asset allocation is market timing applied to more than one asset class. 
 The extremes in the asset allocation debate are well known. At one pole are those who believe that successful market timing is impossible over the long run, and that it never makes sense to alter a portfolio on the basis of beliefs about the various asset classes' relative attractiveness. The only occasions on which those allocations should be shifted are when an investor's life circumstances have changed; otherwise, it is best to leave these allocations alone.
 At the other extreme are those who believe that, not only is successful market timing theoretically possible, it is not all that difficult in practice. As a result, investors should be willing to make large and frequent changes to how much they allocate to each of the asset classes. In fact, some advisers at this extreme believe that it may make sense to shift an entire portfolio from being invested in equities one day to being completely in bonds the next.
 In their new study, the researchers explored the middle ground between these two extremes. In particular, they were interested in how an investor might behave if he believed that, while the future course of the markets was not completely random, the extent of any predictability was still quite small. As Professor Wachter put it in an interview, such an investor ''is skeptical of the market timers' claims, but not dogmatically so, and therefore willing to modestly alter his asset allocation when the evidence in favor of doing so is particularly compelling.''
 While conceptualizing this nondogmatic skeptic may be relatively straightforward, actually modeling his behavior is complex. To do that, the researchers resorted to a branch of statistics championed by the Rev. Thomas Bayes in the 18th century. His theory shows how to update probabilities in light of new information. It allowed the researchers to quantify the skepticism of their hypothetical investor and then to estimate how his beliefs would change from time to time as the markets either did or did not live up to previous forecasts.
 An example can help make this approach clearer. Imagine an investor whose default asset allocation is to be 65 percent invested in domestic equities and 35 percent in short- and long-term bonds. Imagine further that this investor operates in a hypothetical world in which there is only one stock market timing indicator: the stock market's dividend yield, which has an excellent long-term record, but whose performance over the last 15 years has been checkered. If this investor dogmatically believes that market timing is impossible, of course, his allocation to domestic equities will always be 65 percent. If, however, this investor is at the other extreme and is a strong believer in market timing, he would currently have only 23 percent of his portfolio allocated to domestic equities, Professor Wachter says. That is because the stock market's current dividend yield is so much lower than the historical average, suggesting an overvalued stock market.
 What would be the current allocation to domestic equities of the investor pursuing the researchers' middle-of-the-road approach? It would be 40 percent, according to Professor Wachter -- still markedly lower than the default allocation of 65 percent, but nevertheless a lot higher than the 23 percent allocation of the investor who is a strong proponent of market timing. This allocation reflects the influence of a number of factors, ranging from a general humility about any indicator's ability to continue working to the dividend yield's mixed track record in recent years.
 The proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. Consider what the researchers found upon calculating the track records of the three approaches to asset allocation that they studied, each of which relied on just the dividend-yield indicator to switch between domestic stocks and short- and long-term bonds. Over the 33 years beginning in 1972 and ending in 2004, the portfolio of the nondogmatic skeptic outperformed those at either extreme in the asset allocation debate. He would have beaten the strong proponent of market timing by an annual average of around 10 percentage points, for example. He furthermore would have outperformed the dogmatic opponent of any market timing whatsoever by an annual average of around one percentage point. 
 PROFESSOR Wachter cautioned that she and her co-researcher couldn't say for sure whether the same conclusion would hold for other market-timing tools.
 But she did say they reached similar results for the one other market-timing indicator that they examined -- the yield spread, which is the difference between the yields on long- and short-term bonds -- and she says that she would not be surprised if the same conclusion held for many other market-timing variables as well.
 These results might strike investors as counterintuitive. If a little market timing is good, shouldn't a lot be better? The reason it isn't, Professor Wachter says, is that even when a good market timing system is right more often than wrong, those wrong times can be disastrous to those who bet on it too heavily.
 The investment implication is clear: While not dismissing market timing, don't bet all-or-nothing on it, either.

HEADLINE: Opponents Pay A Painful Price In Walking Bonds

BYLINE: By DAN ROSENHECK. 
Dan Rosenheck writes for The Economist. E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Barry Bonds may not have had to overcome the obstacles that Hank Aaron did in trying to become baseball's career home run leader, but Aaron did enjoy one advantage Bonds would dearly appreciate: He rarely lacked for a pitch to hit.
 Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Bonds's late-career surge toward the record is that he has challenged Aaron's mark, 755, despite the best efforts of opposing managers and pitchers to deposit him safely on first base whenever possible. Since 2001, Bonds has drawn walks or been hit by a pitch in more than 30 percent of his plate appearances, and more than half of those walks have come on four consecutive pitches. Giants fans have become so fed up with teams pitching around Bonds that for years they have wielded rubber chickens, which they use to taunt opponents for their cowardice. 
 But if winning is more important than records, San Franciscans should break out in cheers whenever their beleaguered, beloved Bonds trots to first base. Although Bonds's walks may not be able to match one of his laser beams into McCovey Cove for spectacle, opposing teams far more often than not are adding victories to the Giants' ledger when they walk him.
 Walking Bonds is the right move in certain circumstances. But evaluating the treatment of Bonds in the aggregate requires a more sophisticated tool than intuition: a statistic known as Win Expectancy. Although difficult to calculate, Win Expectancy is perhaps the most intuitive statistic ever developed. It is, quite simply, the probability that a player's team will win the game. By comparing the Giants' likelihood of victory if Bonds walks against their chances of winning if he is pitched to, the impact of the decision whether to walk him can be expressed with mathematical certainty. 
 For example, if the 2002 version of Bonds is allowed to hit with the go-ahead run on second base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Giants win the game 69.2 percent of the time. But if he is walked, their probability of victory falls to 62.5 percent. By contrast, if he is allowed to hit with one out in the bottom of the ninth, a man on second, and the Giants trailing by two runs, San Francisco has a 16.8 percent chance of winning, but if he draws a walk, their odds improve to 18.7 percent.
 Tom M. Tango, a co-author of ''The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball,'' applied this Win Expectancy framework to every possible game situation -- inning, outs, score differential, and runners on base -- to determine when the seemingly unstoppable Bonds of 2001-4 should have been given a walk.
 Of the 284 official intentional walks Bonds drew in that period, only 80 clearly decreased the Giants' chances of winning, and 91 substantially improved their odds. (The remaining 113 were toss-ups). According to Tango, those 91 ill-advised intentional walks were worth 4.7 wins to San Francisco, including 2.1 in 2004 alone.
 ''Two wins is enormous,'' Tango said. ''It's the equivalent of turning a league-average hitter into someone playing in the All-Star Game.''
 The official intentional walks drawn by Bonds between 2001 and 2004 were actually the least beneficial to his club of all his walks. During the same four years, he drew an additional 136 four-pitch walks not recorded as intentional. Only 6 of those were preferable to pitching to Bonds, and 77 definitely benefited the Giants, resulting in an additional 4.1 wins.
 Since Bonds returned from his 2005 knee injury, he has not been the same hitter -- his slugging percentage has been a merely excellent .550 rather than the stratospheric .800 he posted during his peak -- but opposing clubs continue to treat him as if he is. While most hitters with .550 slugging percentages could expect to receive around 13 intentional walks in the 837 plate appearances Bonds has accumulated the past two seasons, Bonds has received 69. That represents an additional 2.4 wins opposing managers have handed to the Giants.
 So how many home runs has the National League's Bondsophobia cost the slugger? If one simply eliminates the inadvisable official intentional walks from Bonds's record since 2001 and replaces them with the average of his production when he is pitched to, he would have only 11 more home runs than his current total. Yet the results are much more dramatic if all his unwisely granted four-pitch walks, as well as half of the toss-up decisions, are replaced with official at-bats. In that case, Bonds would have blasted a single-season record of 78 home runs in 2001, surpassed Aaron late in 2006, and have continued well into uncharted territory this year, reaching 784 by today. He would still have reached a milestone last week, though: his 3,000th hit.
 Barry Bonds may not be anyone's idea of a great teammate. But every time he takes a pitch, he is truly taking one for the team: passing up a chance at personal glory to edge the Giants closer to victory.

HEADLINE: Family-Leave Values

BYLINE: By Eyal Press. 
Eyal Press is a contributing writer for The Nation. The paperback edition of his book, ''Absolute Convictions: My Father, a City and the Conflict That Divided America,'' was published earlier this year.

 BODY:
When Karen Deonarain was discharged from Prince George's Hospital Center in Maryland following the birth of her daughter, Razia, several years ago, the status of her job did not rank high on her list of worries. ''My main concern was the baby,'' she said one recent afternoon, as a heavy rain drenched the sidewalks outside the cafe where we had arranged to meet.
 Deonarain was 30 when her daughter was born. A small, heavyset woman with a gentle voice and a reserved manner, she worked at the time as a senior claims examiner for a company called Computer Literacy World, which does contract work in data entry and computer-system configuration. She liked the job, though she was in no condition to return to the office after her discharge. The pregnancy had been a difficult one, ending in a weeklong marathon of unnerving medical consultations and impromptu prayer sessions that began when Deonarain's water broke 16 weeks earlier than expected. At one point, her doctor warned her that a baby born so prematurely stood a 50 percent chance of suffering from cerebral palsy. Days later, her 1-pound-10-ounce newborn was wheeled into the neonatal intensive care unit. 
 Deonarain remembers her ordeal being made somewhat easier by the sympathy extended to her by her employer. On Jan. 7, 2004, the day after she was admitted to the hospital and told she should remain there until delivering her child, she says she spoke to her supervisor, a woman named Gwen Tolbert. They kept no written record of their conversations, and the company disputes Deonarain's version of the events. But according to Deonarain, Tolbert told her not to worry and indicated that the company understood the baby's fragile health would likely prevent her from coming back to work until April. The two women chatted again a week later, after Razia was born. This time, Deonarain says, Tolbert congratulated her and said she had already arranged to have some sick leave transferred to her. 
 ''I felt really reassured,'' Deonarain told me. 
 It was almost 10 weeks before Razia was discharged from the hospital. It took considerably less time for Deonarain's sense of reassurance to turn into bewilderment. One morning about six weeks after giving birth, she received a phone call from the mortgage company with which she and her husband had been working to refinance their home. A loan officer informed her that, according to information received from Computer Literacy World, she was no longer on the payroll there -- which, if true, meant the refinancing loan could not be approved. Deonarain told the loan officer not to worry, since she was sure the information was erroneous. After they finished talking, she called Gwen Tolbert. But, Deonarain says, Tolbert told her there had been no mistake: her job had been terminated because she'd failed to contact the company since Jan. 5, 2004, violating a rule requiring workers to account for any absence within three days. 
 Deonarain listened, amazed: she had been at work on Jan. 6, she says, and had spoken to Tolbert herself from the hospital on two occasions after that date. She says she had also been given every indication the company understood she would need time off after the pregnancy. (Computer Literacy World would not comment on the case, and Tolbert did not return calls, but in sworn statements the company has said that after the baby was born, Deonarain promised to let Tolbert know within a few days when she would be returning to work, and that she was fired after Tolbert didn't hear from her for five weeks.) Deonarain remembers being on the phone, pleading for sympathy. ''I was like, 'Please, I need my job -- I have a premature child.' '' Tolbert said that she was sorry, but that the job had already been filled; Deonarain recalls being told that she was welcome to apply for another position, at a lower salary.
 Deonarain did something else instead: after overcoming her initial shock, she got in touch with the D.C. Employment Justice Center, an organization based in Washington that she had heard defended workers' rights. The center referred her to a couple of lawyers, one of them a Maryland attorney named Daniel A. Katz. As he listened to the details of the story, Katz was flabbergasted. He soon started searching about to find grounds for a lawsuit. 
 Until recently, lawsuits claiming workplace discrimination because of family care-giving obligations were rare -- in part because, however harsh it may seem to lose your job under circumstances like Deonarain's, employers could often get away with it. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees workers some unpaid time off in the event of a serious health problem, after the birth of a child or to care for a sick family member, but the law's scope is limited. (It doesn't cover companies with fewer than 50 employees, for example. Computer Literacy World had just under 50 at the time.) And no federal antidiscrimination statute exists that explicitly protects family caregivers in the workplace. 
 But what constitutes discrimination in the eyes of the law is changing. And one reason it's changing is that the ranks of people like Karen Deonarain have grown. Since the mid-1990s, the number of workers who have sued their employers for supposed mistreatment on account of family responsibilities -- becoming pregnant, needing to care for a sick child or relative -- has increased by more than 300 percent. More than 1,150 such lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, a trend that has not gone unnoticed in the business world, not only because companies are well aware of the negative publicity lawsuits can generate but also because numerous plaintiffs have walked away with hefty damage awards. In one case, a jury granted $11.65 million to a hospital maintenance worker who was penalized for having to care for his elderly parents. In Ohio recently, a jury awarded $2.1 million to an assistant store manager who was demoted because she has several kids. 
 The workers pressing such claims have invoked a dizzying array of laws to prove they were mistreated. Some have relied on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which a number of courts have ruled prohibits not only overt sex discrimination but also seemingly neutral policies that have a disparate impact on women. Others have invoked the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, which covers both individuals with disabilities and, to a lesser extent, the people who care for them. Others still have drawn on the many state and local laws passed in recent years to safeguard the rights of employees with families. 
 The flood of cases reflects not just the increased presence of women in the workplace but also the growing difficulty Americans of all social backgrounds seem to be having in balancing the demands of work and family. Unlike so-called ''glass ceiling'' cases involving women barred from the top rungs of a handful of elite professions, the plaintiffs in these new work-family disputes have ranged across the occupational spectrum, from physicians to police officers to grocery clerks. While not all have become millionaires, more than half have prevailed in court -- a success rate significantly higher than that of more conventional employment-discrimination cases, which is below 20 percent. Beyond causing headaches for their employers, the lawsuits are serving notice that the battle over ''family values'' is no longer just about gay marriage and abortion: it's also about workplace attitudes that some advocates believe do significantly more to undermine family life than those controversial practices do.
 o person has made this argument with more vigor in recent years than Joan C. Williams. A professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, Williams, 55, is tall and slender, with reddish-brown hair and something approaching rock-star status among the small but growing network of lawyers and scholars who litigate or study family-responsibility discrimination cases. I first met Williams in April at the headquarters of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in Washington, where she'd been invited to testify at a hearing on balancing work and family. It was the day after the student massacre at Virginia Tech, and the session opened with a moment of silence. Then Stuart Ishimaru, an E.E.O.C. commissioner, thanked the various panelists for taking the time to share their expertise with the agency, singling out Joan Williams. She had flown to Washington the previous day; she would soon be off to Sacramento, where she was scheduled to testify before the California Legislature, and after that to Colorado, to appear before the National Association for Law Placement. 
 Williams has been racing across the country giving such speeches since 2000, the year her book ''Unbending Gender'' appeared. In the book, which set in motion the legal trend that now consumes much of her time, Williams argued that the growing tension between work and family was not simply a product of economic necessity. It stemmed, rather, from a marketplace structured around an increasingly outdated masculine norm: the ''ideal worker'' who can work full time for an entire career while enjoying ''immunity from family work.'' At a time when both adults in most families had come to participate in the labor force, Williams argued that this standard was unrealistic, especially for women, who remained the primary caregivers in most households. 
 At a Starbucks after the E.E.O.C. hearing, as she sipped tea and picked haphazardly at a brownie, Williams told me she wasn't sure when she wrote the book what the best remedy was. One possibility was legislation -- subsidized child care, generous parental-leave policies -- of the sort many European countries have. Another was for employees to take legal action, an idea she described in the book's most provocative chapter. To show how discrimination can harm caregivers, Williams told the story of a lawyer with sterling performance reviews who was passed over for a promotion because she was a mother; management had assumed she wouldn't be interested and promoted an unmarried woman instead. Even though the position was not given to a man, a court agreed the firm's action might constitute sex discrimination, not least because numerous fathers had received such promotions. Negative assumptions about the capabilities of women with children pervade the marketplace, Williams averred, and can violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act even when employers insist their actions are not motivated by sexism. 
 ''Unbending Gender'' struck a nerve -- soon after its publication, Williams found herself fielding ''a zillion invitations to speak'' -- but its author admits she had ''no idea'' whether the legal theory she had sketched out might catch on. There were plenty of skeptics, which is not surprising. Unlike being black or female, after all, becoming a parent is a choice, one that often limits an employee's availability. As she traveled across the country, Williams heard this frequently from feminists convinced that courts would side with businesses in such disputes. But she heard something different from the lawyers she met, who seemed equally certain jurors would sympathize with workers punished simply for trying to be responsible caregivers. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more lawsuits kept being filed. Williams soon established the Center for WorkLife Law, which emerged as the place to go to learn more about the subject -- not only for scholars and journalists but also for employees, who started calling its hot line to find out how they, too, might file a claim. It was, for Williams, a bracing moment, as much for personal reasons as for professional ones. After attending Harvard Law School, she told me, she worked for several years as an attorney. Then she had a daughter, Rachel, and found herself staring at the quandary so many women face. ''I got sort of obsessed with the issues,'' she recalls, ''because they were framing my life.'' Williams also thought back on occasion to her grandmother, one of the first women to attend Johns Hopkins Medical School. Before graduating, she married and moved with her husband to a new city. When she tried to complete her degree, a medical-school dean told her that a woman should be ashamed of nurturing such ambitions. After that, Williams says, ''she gave up.''
 Williams viewed the lawsuits as a way to complete an unfinished revolution. But she also recognized they could be perceived another way, a point she pressed on feminist colleagues who saw in them a noble but losing cause. ''I said to them: 'You're thinking of these as very edgy gender-discrimination cases. In fact, they're family-values cases.' ''
 This view would meet with no objection from a former Maryland state trooper named Kevin Knussman, who does not fit the conventional image of a plaintiff in a sex-discrimination case. Knussman, who is 50, has close-cropped brown hair shaved high above the ears and a neatly trimmed, graying mustache. He lives in the town of Easton, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, in a saltbox-style house with an American flag out front and framed passages of Scripture on the walls inside. On the day I visited him recently, he wore a short-sleeved shirt emblazoned with the logo of the Easton little-league softball team, which he coaches. 
 Knussman is a churchgoing Christian and a conservative Republican. In 1999, he also became the first person to prevail in a sex-discrimination lawsuit filed under the Family and Medical Leave Act. A jury awarded him $375,000 in damages, although a judge subsequently reduced the amount to $40,000. The suit was filed shortly after his wife, Kimberly, became pregnant and began to suffer from an array of medical complications, including pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition. Wishing to be there to support her, Knussman wrote to his boss at the Maryland State Police to request four to eight weeks of leave, to which he was entitled under the F.M.L.A. He was told there was ''no way'' he could take more than two weeks. Later, after his wife gave birth to a baby girl, he asked for 30 days off, as is available to primary caregivers under Maryland law. A personnel manager for the state police, where he had worked for 17 years, denied the request, telling him, ''Unless your wife is in a coma or dead, you can't be primary care provider.'' The same person also told him that God made women to have babies. 
 Knussman chuckled as he recalled these statements. But the experience was considerably less amusing at the time. The stress of being forced back to work when he felt his family needed him was shattering. Caught between the demands of a job he loved and his family, he plunged into depression, he says, and briefly contemplated suicide. ''I would come home after work and Kim was asleep on the couch, and my daughter was crying, and I felt it was really hindering Kim's ability to heal and recuperate,'' he told me. ''It certainly didn't make me feel good -- I had to abandon my family in order to collect my paycheck.'' 
 The case was not without its incongruities. Representing Knussman in court was the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that would most likely not win any popularity contests at the Calvary Baptist Church near Easton, where Knussman and his family attend services. At one point, he was invited to the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, for a photo op with President Clinton to celebrate the anniversary of the F.M.L.A. 
 ''I told the woman who called, 'You know I'm a conservative Republican,' '' he recalled, laughing. 
 ''I know you won't embarrass us like that,'' she replied.
 He showed me the photograph with a proud smile spread across his face. When I asked whether he had any regrets about taking legal action, he shook his head. ''They had hurt my family significantly, especially my wife. To hurt my family -- it really was important to rectify.''
 The plaintiffs in roughly four-fifths of the work-family lawsuits filed thus far have been women. As Knussman's case shows, men, too, may find themselves subjected to stereotypes about their domestic responsibilities -- by employers who feel they shouldn't have any. What women alone appear to encounter is a powerful set of negative assumptions associated with motherhood. The rise of lawsuits in recent years has coincided with a new body of research, much of it produced by a scholarly project called the Cognitive Bias Working Group. One member of the group is Shelley Correll, a sociologist at Cornell. A few years ago, Correll was poring over labor-market data and noticed that while the gap between the wages of men and women had narrowed, the gap between mothers and everyone else remained wide. She wanted to understand why. As an experiment, Correll and other researchers asked volunteers to evaluate a pool of equally qualified male and female job applicants. On some resumes, a clue signaled that the applicant was a parent. Correll also sent 1,276 resumes for entry-level and midlevel marketing jobs to 638 real employers. 
 The results, as reported in the May 2007 issue of The American Journal of Sociology, are striking. Among the volunteers, mothers were consistently viewed as less competent and less committed and were held to higher performance and punctuality standards. They were 79 percent less likely to be hired and, if hired, would be offered a starting salary $11,000 lower than nonmothers. Fathers, by contrast, were offered the highest salaries of all. Meanwhile, in the test run with real-world employers, the hypothetical female applicants without children were more than twice as likely as equally qualified mothers to be called back for interviews. Correll's findings echo a discovery made by the psychologist Amy Cuddy. Cuddy asked volunteers to evaluate four imaginary professionals: a childless female, a childless male, a mother and a father. All these professionals had identical experience and educational backgrounds. Yet the mothers were given the lowest competency ratings, by both male and female evaluators, and were least likely to be recommended for hiring and promotions. 
 Some employers, lawyers say, may be tolerant, even welcoming, of an employee who bears one child, only to balk when discovering she has become pregnant again. Attorneys who handle such cases refer to this as ''the second-baby syndrome.'' Other times, tension may arise when another factor -- say, a disability -- enters the picture. This is what Lucia Kanter believes happened to her. An attorney from San Francisco, Kanter started working several years ago at the Administrative Office of the Courts, the policy-making body of the California judicial system. She loved the job and, she says, was well regarded by her superiors. She also thought she would finish her career there, in part because it seemed like an accommodating place for working parents. After the birth of her first son, Julian, in January 2004, Kanter was given a generous (albeit unpaid) 11-month leave. She was then allowed to return on a four-day-a-week, 80 percent schedule. A year and a half later, she had a second son, Thanael, and this time was given six months off. 
 Shortly after Thanael was born, however, tests confirmed something that Kanter and her husband had begun to suspect: Julian, their older child, was autistic. They now faced the daunting challenge of raising a child with a disability. When Kanter learned this, she says she wrote to her manager to ask whether she might return, at least initially, either on a 60 percent schedule or an 80 percent schedule with a rotating day off, so she could attend Julian's therapy sessions. Her request, she says, was denied. Then she asked for an extended leave of absence but again was turned down. Finally, she says, she suggested resuming her prior schedule, but with some additional time off so she could hire a second nanny. She figured the agency would at least be open to discussing this, but it said no. 
 Instead, she says, she received a termination letter.
 She was stunned. ''If my jaw could have dropped to the floor, it would have,'' she told me when I visited her recently at her home in San Francisco. Now, invoking both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act, she is suing her former employer for discrimination, a decision she said she agonized over: ''I have a child with 14 therapists, and another young child -- I don't need this headache.'' 
 Of course, her colleagues at the Administrative Office of the Courts may have had reason to worry about that very fact, and to wonder whether her hands might be too full to handle an ordinary workload. (The agency would not address the specifics of the case, but in court papers and in a statement it denied all wrongdoing alleged by Kanter.) In non-F.M.L.A. cases, if employers can show an adverse action was taken for legitimate business reasons -- if a worker's presence in the office is essential to a company's operations, say -- they often can persuade a judge or jury to spare them liability, particularly if they can point to a positive track record toward the protected class of employees. Kanter acknowledged there were worse places for women with children to work, though she also recalled how, at an office baby shower, she overheard a high-ranking superior tell a female attorney: ''So this is it, right? There aren't going to be any more pregnant women after this?'' 
 Even so, when Kanter first sat down with a lawyer after her dismissal, she said, she pinned her hopes not on a lawsuit but on a settlement that would reinstate her job, which she still describes with unrestrained fondness. At one point, she ushered me into her living room, flipped on the computer and inserted a DVD of the training sessions she used to conduct at work (where, coincidentally, one of her main responsibilities was to counsel members of the court system about employment law). Her black Lab lay curled in the corner. Her kids were asleep upstairs. As the video played, Kanter gazed at the monitor with a look of pure longing in her eyes. She was suing only because she had run out of options, she said with a heavy sigh, and because she had come to identify with working mothers who've been ''pushed or nudged out of their jobs.''
 Until recently, prevailing in such a case likely would have required showing that a man in the same situation was treated differently. In the past, the absence of a so-called ''male comparator'' had often led courts to dismiss sex-discrimination claims even when evidence of stereotyping seemed to exist. But this is by no means certain anymore. In 2004, in the case of Back v. Hastings-on-Hudson, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a school psychologist who claimed she was denied tenure because she was a mother did not need a comparator to prove she had been unlawfully stereotyped. 
 The Back opinion was drafted by one of the nation's most liberal courts. But conservative judges have issued plenty of pro-plaintiff rulings as well. In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia -- considered among the most conservative in the country -- upheld $520,000 awarded to an attorney who claimed she was mistreated for being a working mother, and it ordered a lower court to consider additional punitive damages. Perhaps the most surprising decision to date emerged out of Nevada, in a case involving a state social worker named William Hibbs, who filed a lawsuit under the F.M.L.A. when his wife suffered a near-fatal car accident and he was ordered back to work after his employer said he had exhausted the leave the state offered. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which, in 2003, affirmed Hibbs's right to recover damages. It was a stunning ruling, both because the court had upheld states' immunity from federal lawsuits in a string of prior cases and because, in his majority opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist underscored the importance of transforming workplace stereotypes. ''The fault line between work and family,'' he declared, is ''precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.'' The Second Circuit subsequently cited this language in the Back decision. 
 Had Chief Justice Rehnquist secretly been dropping in on meetings of the Cognitive Bias Working Group? A more likely explanation is that, like conservative judges in other cases, he saw the issue through the prism of family values -- and, perhaps, his own personal experience. At one point in his career, Rehnquist had to care for his own wife, who was terminally ill with cancer. As reported by Linda Greenhouse in this newspaper, his daughter, Janet, was a single mother who had a demanding job and apparently relied on his help on occasion. Several times during the term the Hibbs case was argued Rehnquist left the chambers early to fetch his granddaughters from school.
 s surprising as such rulings have been, they have not convinced everyone that the proliferation of lawsuits is a good thing. Among those with reservations is Zachary Fasman, a partner at the New York office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who specializes in employment law. At the E.E.O.C. hearing back in April, Fasman testified that there is a danger the lawsuits will be used as a lever to force companies to change legitimate business practices (mandatory overtime, strict attendance rules) that not all workers can handle. Imagine the effect on the workplace, or the potential impact on America's competitiveness, if United States courts ruled, for example, that companies could no longer dictate to their employees what time the workday began and ended. ''I'm not against work-life balance -- who is?'' Fasman later told me. ''But the organization of the work force has always been left, to a large extent, to the discretion of the employer. So long as it doesn't discriminate, where a business draws the line on these things depends on the nature of the business. You can't rewrite the rules of the American workplace unless Congress does it.''
 Some C.E.O.'s, however, have begun rewriting the rules on their own, spurred by the need to compete for high-quality employees. Several years ago, a businessman named Jim Johnson dropped in on a talk Joan Williams was giving in Denver, because his wife had heard about Williams and urged him to go. Afterward, he decided to reorganize the moving-and-storage company he runs. Today, many of Johnson's employees log more hours at home than at the office. ''I've got customer-service people working at home, order-entry people, long-distance dispatchers,'' he told me. There has been a slight increase in productivity, he said, as well as another benefit: ''This flex-hour, work-at-home group -- the turnover has been almost nonexistent.''
 Clearly, though, not every company in America would embrace such a blueprint. In the meantime, as the number of workers suing their employers continues to grow, there is another danger -- that lawsuits will come to be seen as the vehicle of reform for problems that could be addressed more effectively through other means. By way of contrast, consider Britain, where, several years ago, the Blair government passed a flexible-work law that allows employees with children under 6 to request a reduction or rearrangement in their schedules. Employers can refuse but must explain their reasoning in writing. In Sweden, parents have the right to work a six-hour day until their children turn 8, at a prorated salary. Although some view such practices as a drag on the economy, policies mandating lengthy, paid parental leave and government-subsidized child care are the norm throughout Europe.
 In ''Unbending Gender,'' Joan Williams wrote that ''suing your employer is not the ideal mechanism of social change.'' When we met not long ago in San Francisco, I reminded her of this passage. She smiled. Lawsuits ''are the worst possible vehicle for social change,'' she said, ''except for nothing, and that's where we are right now.'' Williams pointed out that, in addition to the hot line for aggrieved employees, the Center for WorkLife Law advises a rapidly expanding number of employers and management-side lawyers. Of course, she would prefer that Congress pass legislation guaranteeing all workers paid sick leave, paid parental leave and access to affordable child care, she went on to say. ''But what's happening in public policy in this arena? It took more than a decade to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, and it's very limited. So when people say, 'Well, the lawsuits are limited achievements,' I say: 'Well, compared to what? You're not in Europe.' ''
 Indeed, in the United States today, working parents receive supports and benefits that in much of the developed world would be considered scandalously ungenerous. Some unflattering comparisons with Europe were drawn at the E.E.O.C. hearing in April, where Williams suggested that even companies had reached the point of wanting more guidance from Washington about how caregivers should be treated. The message was evidently heard. In late May, the agency issued enforcement guidelines that for the first time spell out the myriad situations -- a police detective removed from high-profile investigations after she adopts a child, a technician and father denied a part-time posting reserved for a woman -- prohibited under existing law. The E.E.O.C. makes clear that personnel decisions implemented on the basis of stereotypical assumptions are unacceptable and urges employers ''to make it easier for all workers, whether male or female, to balance work and personal responsibilities.''
 It would be hard to imagine such a step happening were it not for the wave of lawsuits in recent years. Meanwhile, people like Karen Deonarain are waiting for their days in court. It has been more than three years since she lost her job. Her lawsuit, which charges that she was fired for complications related to her pregnancy, amounting to a form of sex discrimination, is in the discovery phase. A hint of weariness creeps into her voice when she talks about the case. ''I think they want to drag it out so I'll go away,'' she told me, laughing softly. 
 But Deonarain is not planning to give up anytime soon. Since her dismissal, she and her husband, a car wholesaler, have made a major lifestyle adjustment -- no vacations, no expensive meals. She has yet to land a full-time job. The refinancing loan on the house eventually came through, and her daughter, Razia, is doing O.K., but the experience of being fired has had lasting psychological effects. ''I find myself acting a little timid, protecting myself, so the world out there won't hurt you,'' Deonarain said. She told me she often thinks about what might have happened had she been a single mother. ''I'm doing this so they won't do it to the next person.'' And what does she expect to get out of it herself? She paused. Some compensatory damages would be nice, she admitted. Her eyes circled the room. ''And an apology would be good, too.''

HEADLINE: Can Ford Clean Up After Itself?

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
IN the summer of 2005, around the time that residents of Upper Ringwood, N.J., began to wonder whether the skin rashes, nose bleeds and bronchitis that plagued their community were more than bad luck, the Ford Motor Company and the Environmental Protection Agency made a request: the automaker and the regulator wanted access to the yards around two families' homes to remove waste that had been dumped in the area. Ford boasts in its ads that ''It's Easy Being Green,'' but residents feared the request suggested something not so easy at all. From the mid-1950s to the late 1970s, Ford operated an assembly plant in northern New Jersey, in nearby Mahwah, that cranked out millions of passenger cars. Ford closed the plant in 1980, after dumping what the E.P.A. describes as thousands of tons of paint sludge and other waste in Upper Ringwood, a community of about 350 working-class residents located in the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains. 
 A few years later, the Environmental Protection Agency identified Upper Ringwood for priority cleanup under its Superfund program. Ford, deemed responsible for the pollution, spent the next five years assessing and removing sludge from a 500-acre site that included 50 homes. Satisfied with Ford's cleanup, the E.P.A. dropped Upper Ringwood as a Superfund site in 1994, having determined, according to a public notice, that ''no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate'' and that ''the current risk posed by the site is within an acceptable range.''
 Yet recently, based on Ford's and the E.P.A.'s own recent follow-up studies of the soil and groundwater in Upper Ringwood, those conclusions unraveled and became fodder in what environmental experts say is now among the messiest industrial cleanup efforts in Superfund's 27-year history. 
 Since the E.P.A. relisted Upper Ringwood last year as a Superfund site, cleanup experts in the area have not only removed several thousand tons of waste that crews had previously overlooked, but workers have also identified substantial amounts of potentially hazardous paint sludge in the yards of at least two private homes, according to federal regulators and Ford.
 Last year, residents sued Ford in a New Jersey state court for property damage and personal injuries, citing the improper disposal of waste from the Mahwah plant. The lawsuit claims that Ford's hazardous paint sludge and other contaminated material, while dumped decades ago, still contaminate the soil, air and groundwater in their community; that Ford failed to tell more than 600 residents how dangerous the waste was; and that Ford has yet to properly clean up the mess. 
 To make their case, residents have enlisted several high-profile legal experts and consultants, including the environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the physician James Dahlgren of ''Erin Brockovich'' fame, and the law firm of the late civil rights lawyer Johnnie Cochran. The lawyers contend in the suit that contaminated waste that Ford left behind has contributed to such illnesses among residents as the diabetes that caused Paul Eugene VanDunk to have his leg amputated and the cancer that killed his daughter. ''This community was here long before Ford had anything to do with Upper Ringwood,'' says Andrew Carboy, a lead lawyer for the residents. ''Ford's involvement here ended almost 40 years ago, but the community is still dealing with the health consequences of Ford's dumping.''
 Ford counters that its history of dumping in Upper Ringwood, which occurred for four years, was legal and authorized by town supervisors. It says it was just one of several companies that deposited waste in the area during the years that its Mahwah plant operated and that its dumping activities and recent cleanup efforts have not endangered the health of residents.
 ''Bronchitis could be caused by a number of things that have nothing to do with toxins,'' said Alan Kraus, a Ford lawyer, during a recent court appearance. According to records of the proceedings, Mr. Kraus said he needed a medical history from each of the plaintiffs before turning over any records concerning the automaker's waste disposal activities.
 ''To be honest, I'm not a doctor, but I don't know whether bronchitis can be caused by toxins,'' he said in court. 
 Citing the litigation, Ford officials declined to be interviewed, but said in a statement that ''the company is working diligently to address remaining issues related to its past disposal activities.'' Ford also noted that ''the Borough of Ringwood used the site as a general dump before, during and after the four-year period that Ford-related waste materials were disposed at the site'' and that recent surveys of the property ''recorded the presence of non-Ford related miscellaneous wastes and debris on approximately half of all locations included in the survey.'' 
 Ford contractors and E.P.A. officials also say that residents here have been wary about granting access to their homes to remove potentially dangerous, brick-size shards of sludge. 
 ''C'mon, we understand that the residents in Ringwood do not trust the agency or Ford too much,'' says Patricia Carr, an E.P.A. spokeswoman. ''But how can they voice concern about the health effects of the waste there for all these years and then not allow us access into their homes?'' 
 Residents see things quite differently. ''Tell me what they can do to satisfy us for the lives that have been lost already?'' asks Wayne Mann, a local activist and community leader. ''How do you justify what they've done?''
 THIS rustic community, an hour's drive from the heart of Manhattan, is home to the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation, a group of American Indians with roots in the area reaching back before the Revolutionary War. The tribe has maintained many of its traditions, and has been slow to integrate; residents hunt deer and turkey and fish the local streams for food. They also harvest vegetables grown on small plots in their yards, and are not politically active -- which contributed to Ford's and the E.P.A.'s inefficiency in cleaning the area, residents say.
 Environmental advocates say that the significance of the fight between Ford and residents here transcends Ford's activities, plaintiffs' lawyers' claims of ''environmental racism,'' or so-called green-washing efforts of companies with dubious environmental records to improve their images. They say it sheds light on the inherent limitations of the Superfund program, which has relied heavily on the scientific research and the purse strings of corporate polluters to clean up sites -- limitations that have only been compounded by severe cuts recently in the E.P.A.'s budget.
 The plaintiffs' lawyers also contend that Ford's waste has resulted in the contamination of a local reservoir that provides drinking water for 2.5 million people in the surrounding area. Ford denies that.
 ''This site is the poster child of corporate bad behavior and the inability of the E.P.A. to really make corporate polluters do proper cleanup of sites,'' said Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, an environmental advocacy group in New Jersey. Ford's waste, Mr. Spiegel said, ''is polluting the drinking water for millions of people, yet it's still unclear whether the E.P.A. will ever force Ford into really cleaning it up.'' 
 ROGER DeGROAT, 58, leaves the above-ground swimming pool outside his Upper Ringwood home empty because he's afraid he might be filling it with contaminated water. He points at a purple rash on his arms to illustrate other fears. ''I don't know what these blotches are,'' he says. ''It scares me because my doctor doesn't know what's wrong with me either. I get dizzy for no apparent reason; my eyes itch.
 ''My children have nose bleeds so bad in their sleep that they wake up stuck to the bed, like they've been hit in the head or something,'' he adds. 
 Mr. DeGroat, like many other residents here, says he believes that hazardous waste contributed to his family's illnesses as well as elevated rates of leukemia, cancer, diabetes and asthma in other residents. 
 A line of trucks barrels past Mr. DeGroat's house and disappears behind gates securing the work site where a business hired by Ford is cleaning Upper Ringwood. In recent months, workers have been removing sludge and investigating the possible presence of such hazardous substances as lead, arsenic, chromium, ethylbenzene and P.C.B.'s in local soil, according to the E.P.A. 
 Residents say that the cleanup makes their close-knit community feel like an occupied military zone, with the constant rumble of tank-size tractors drowning out the banter from children playing tag and hopscotch.
 Despite the noise and the threat of illnesses, Mr. DeGroat says that he, like most of the American Indians who live here, can't imagine relocating. Tribe members have maintained largely isolated lives (due, they say, to racial taunting and stereotyping from people outside their community) and are groomed to be suspicious of most outsiders. 
 After Ford built its Mahwah plant in 1955 and bought 800 nearby acres to build homes for its workers, it became among the largest employers in the area. In 1967, Ford hired a contractor to dispose of waste from the Mahwah plant. Court filings say that Ford's agreement with the contractor ''called for disposal of cardboard and other packing materials from the plant, scrap car parts, paint sludge and scrap and dented drums containing obsoleted hardened production sealing and insulating stock of noninflammable nature.'' Ford says that state and local officials approved the dumping that occurred from 1967 to 1971. 
 Residents say that regardless of who approved the dumping, their lives were changed. ''The way we were living is not how people live in the real world,'' says Mr. Mann, who is also a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against Ford. ''There was trash everywhere. There were drums and chemicals all around, and trucks coming and dumping anywhere and everywhere. The Dumpsters would get so high that they would mysteriously burn for weeks.'' 
 STARTING in the late 1960s, Ford says it began divesting large portions of the dump site in Upper Ringwood. It donated 300 acres of land to the town government, which, it claims, allowed other companies to continue dumping on the site between 1972 and 1976 (at which point state regulators shut it down). 
 Joseph Maraziti, a lawyer representing the town government said that after Ford left the area, the Upper Ringwood site was used for only household waste, not potentially toxic industrial waste. ''As of this moment, there has been no identification of any hazardous material connected with that site other than Ford's,'' he says. 
 Ford closed its Mahwah plant in 1980. Two years later, New Jersey regulators discovered substantial levels of arsenic in local water samples and gave their findings to the E.P.A., which added Upper Ringwood to a national priorities list under its Superfund program. Ford's cleanup crews arrived in Ringwood in 1983, but the company acknowledges that the process from the start was prolonged by extensive research and bureaucratic red tape. 
 ''With the site sprawling over more than 500 acres, the E.P.A. had to make decisions regarding how best to investigate, characterize and then address the disposal of hazardous substances on the site,'' the company said in a statement. 
 Part of the problem, too, Ford and E.P.A. officials say, was a steep learning curve in the remediation of Superfund sites, or as the 1980 law is called, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Superfund was a response to public outcries in the 1970s over the discovery that some 22,000 tons of toxic waste had been dumped in the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
 ''There was no model out there and no mentors in cleaning up sites,'' says Ms. Carr, the E.P.A. spokeswoman. ''The law was detailed and prescriptive but nobody had any experience in how to do this.'' 
 Among the most costly initial mistakes, Ms. Carr says, was the agency's failure to involve residents in the cleanup. ''In the early days, we didn't have a lot of interaction with the residents in Ringwood and from that have learned to reach out earlier in the process,'' she said. 
 Ford says it does not accept full responsibility for the lack of dialogue with the community. In its statement, the company says that ''in the 1980s and early 1990s, neither the Borough of Ringwood nor the residents expressed significant interest in the process to Ford.'' 
 Residents don't dispute that they were hesitant to speak out early on, but say they were silent because of fears of retribution. ''When the berries and the fruit and the frogs started disappearing, I looked the other way,'' Mr. Mann says. ''Who is going to cry out when you are only renting and can be thrown out? There were some who wanted to be vocal, but if you fought back against the state, local government and a major company like Ford, what was going to happen to you?''
 Ford says in a statement that even its best efforts to alleviate those fears during the more recent cleanup often proved ineffective. It says it helped the E.P.A. set up a toll-free number early in the reinvestigation process that residents could use to anonymously report information regarding the location of paint sludge on the site. ''The toll-free number was never used,'' the company said.
 But as Alan J. Steinberg, a regional E.P.A. administrator says: ''Regardless of who was at fault for what, I find the situation to be heartbreaking. It's obvious that some mistakes were made, that the site was cleaned up too quickly. We are in the process of correcting that mistake by supervising a very intensive cleanup effort by Ford.''
 SOME environmental experts and analysts say the biggest problem in cleaning Upper Ringwood, as well as the nation's more than 1,000 other Superfund sites, stems from the depleted resources of the Superfund itself. Superfund's budget was built on an excise tax on crude oil and chemicals used for manufacturing. The tax lapsed in 1995, and the trust fund has shrunk from $1.5 billion in 1994 to insolvency today -- leaving the E.P.A. struggling to find other sources of money to identify and assess the nation's future cleanup needs, according to several recent studies. The E.P.A. says that Superfund's shrinking resources don't undermine its ability to monitor corporate polluters and that companies themselves can adequately manage and police cleanups on their own. 
 The price tag for all of this remains large: according to a 2005 Government Accountability Office report, it will cost $20 billion to remediate the 142 largest Superfund sites.
 Superfund has proved to be effective in spurring corporate polluters to pay for their own cleanups, analysts say. Rather than face fines of as much as three times the actual cost of a cleanup if the E.P.A. undertook the effort on its own, most major corporate polluters have opted to clean the sites themselves. But that, in turn, has left the E.P.A. dependent on corporate polluters to oversee and clean up problem sites.
 ''Funding of cleanups is a really central issue now that the tax fund has been depleted,'' says Katherine N. Probst, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan economic research group in Washington. ''And there are issues about money, and issues about the future of the program, and questions about what you can expect to get in a cleanup these days.'' 
 For its part, Ford says its efforts to clean the area through the years have been nothing less than rigorous, and that the company's voluntary decision to study the area's ground and streams for pollutants after closing its plant reflects its overall commitment to making the area safe for residents. The company says it is doing additional cleanup work at known landfill areas, including at two abandoned mine sites.
 More specifically, the company said in a statement that contractors have removed several tons of paint sludge deposits from Upper Ringwood sites and that samples of soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater have shown that the sludge has not migrated into soils or water supplies. 
 But residents say other warning signs still concern them, despite assurances from Ford and the E.P.A. Earlier this year, for example, New Jersey health authorities warned residents not to hunt squirrels (a longtime staple of the local diet) after discovering a squirrel that was contaminated with lead. 
 Vivian Milligan, 55, said that the notification unnerved her and that she had not gotten satisfactory answers as to why she had two miscarriages, an ulcer, and has high blood pressure. Or why her husband has had four of his toes amputated. Or why three of her cousins have each had a leg amputated. 
 ''I really feel that there's a connection between the contamination and all the health problems around here,'' she says. ''There's just too many sick people for one little area.''

One site in Upper Ringwood, N.J., where the Ford Motor Company deposited thousands of tons of waste, has been in the center of a lawsuit and what potentially could be one of the most complicated battles in Superfund's 27-year history.

HEADLINE: New Housing on Resort Islands

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
EDGARTOWN, Mass.
 FOR decades, hotels seemed as intrinsic to the landscape of the island of Martha's Vineyard as its wide beaches and finger-shaped lagoons. Ditto for Nantucket, 10 miles farther out to sea to the southeast, where bed-and-breakfast places and stately inns crowded the wide cobblestone streets. 
 Yet in an increasingly common trend, many of these longtime lodgings are either closing outright or drastically scaling back the number and availability of their rooms. 
 Rising home values have made it attractive to convert hotels and inns into condominiums and single-family homes, while high hotel-room rates have led many tourists to stay on Cape Cod, from where ferries sail for both islands, and take day trips over instead. 
 At the same time, island planners say, demand for permanent housing has increased. The year-round population in Martha's Vineyard has risen nearly 30 percent a decade since 1970, according to census data, and Nantucket's shot up 58 percent between 1990 and 2000. 
 From 2002 to 2007, the islands have shed about 200 of 2,500 hotel rooms, based on an analysis of data from business owners. Most of the losses came from bed-and-breakfasts that are converted to single-family homes. But in the next two years, those losses could rise sharply, with hundreds of other rooms coming off the market, as developers transform properties into condos. 
 The decline in hotel beds is a consequence of a sizzling real estate market, where home prices are up 80 to 90 percent in five years, according to the islands' multiple listings services, with an average home price of $775,000 on Martha's Vineyard and $1.19 million on Nantucket. 
 For many hotel and bed-and-breakfast owners, it makes sense financially to convert their properties to single-family homes or condos, and not maintain their current business model of short-term lodging. 
 Escalating hotel rates -- a consequence of the higher cost of living on the islands -- have also put accommodations beyond the reach of many tourists. ''For certain people, the Vineyard is pricing itself out'' of the seasonal hotel market, said Mark London, the executive director of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, a regulatory agency that approves large-scale conversions. 
 Peter Martell, the owner of the 95-room Wesley Hotel in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, put his property on the market in September 2006 for $6.5 million, but it has not sold yet. The gray-shingled hotel, where rates average $205 a night, was just 55 percent full during the Fourth of July holiday week. In the late 1990s, when rates averaged $130 a night, the hotel was around 90 percent full that time of year. 
 ''Occupancy rates are too low,'' Mr. Martell said. ''The common man just can't afford to come here anymore.''
 Those tourists who still choose the islands are increasingly opting to stay in rented homes, where they can save money by cooking their own meals.
 Hotel rooms typically start at $200 a night, so staying a week can cost $1,400, said Alan Schweikert, the owner of Ocean Park Realty in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard. ''But for $1,200,'' he said, ''you can rent your own house for a week with a lot more privacy,'' though it might be an older property far from the ocean. 
 This summer, Martha's Vineyard had 500 houses for rent, scattered from Vineyard Haven to Aquinnah, which doubled the offerings in 2000, according to Mr. Schweikert and Abby Rabinovitz, a principal of Tea Lane Associates, a brokerage in the town of Chilmark on the western side of Martha's Vineyard.
 And on Nantucket, 1,000 homes were listed as rentals this year, versus about 650 seven years ago. As the supply has swelled, and competition has grown, the rental rates have held relatively steady, increasing by just 5 percent since 2000, according to Linda Bellevue, a broker with Congdon & Coleman Real Estate on Nantucket.
 Though rentals may guarantee more creature comforts, like kitchens and outdoor showers, the island's creakier hotels could be retooled to offer similar amenities, said Alan Worden, the chief executive of Scout Real Estate Capital.
 Last December, Mr. Worden bought both the Harbor View Hotel and the Kelley House, two historic Martha's Vineyard properties, in Edgartown.
 As part of a $117 million three-year renovation, the Harbor View will add a spa, fitness center and banquet hall. When the renovation is complete, 85 hotel rooms will either have disappeared or become condos, leaving just 45 traditional hotels rooms, a fraction of the hotel's 130 rooms last year. 
 Eight condos went on the market this month, ranging from 500-square-foot one-bedrooms to 2,000-square-foot three-bedrooms, priced from $525,000 to $1.25 million; none have yet sold. And at the Kelley House, 60 rooms will be whittled down to 45 condos by 2009, Mr. Worden said.
 While it may seem as if guests would not have as many hotel rooms to choose from, most owners will rent their condo-hotel rooms out for a fee, which could be split between owner and hotel, Mr. Worden said. 
 These condo-hotel rooms can be pricey -- about $1,000 a night -- but walk-ins don't seem to blanch, because they are part of an untapped luxury market that expects top-of-the-line finishes like granite and marble counters. ''The affluent traveler doesn't want to be in a small room listening to the noise through the wall, or dealing with a small armoire,'' Mr. Worden said.
 Buyers, meanwhile, attain the best of both worlds: equity in a second home without the hassles of maintaining it, said Robert Matthews, the chief executive of Matthews Ventures Holdings, which is developing the Point Breeze, a luxury condo complex on Nantucket. ''You don't have to deal with plumbers and carpenters and painters,'' he said, explaining that for a monthly fee property managers would maintain the home. 
 Although the Point Breeze will have new construction across its six-acre parcel, it is also adapting an existing structure, the former Gordon Folger Hotel, a 78-foot-tall gabled edifice built during the Depression. 
 The first phase of the $110 million three-year project focuses on the Folger Hotel and calls for trimming the number of rooms to 31 from 36 and selling them as condos. Those units, which range from 350-square-foot studios to 1,150-square-foot two-bedrooms, went on sale this month, priced from $1 million to $4.2 million, though none have yet sold, Mr. Matthews said.
 The second phase, which has not yet been approved by the Nantucket Planning and Economic Development Commission, will convert existing cottages to condos, and actually increase the number of rooms, to 31 from 25, he said.
 Every room at the Point Breeze will be a condo, whereas the Harbor View will keep 45 traditional hotel rooms. Still, Mr. Matthews expects 80 percent of his buyers to agree to rent out the rooms when they are not using them. ''It may not be the Holiday Inn,'' he said, ''but people don't want that anymore.''

HEADLINE: In a Highly Complex World, Innovation From the Top Down

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
USER-GENERATED content -- from Wikipedia to YouTube to open-source software -- is generating waves of excitement. But the opening of innovation to wider numbers of people obscures another trend: many of the most popular new products, like the iPod, are dominated by a top-down, elite innovation model that doesn't allow for customization.
 ''New technologies are becoming so complex that many are beyond the possibility of democracy playing a role in their development,'' said Thomas P. Hughes, a science and technology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Consider: Electronic implants into human bodies; gene-splicing as common as cosmetic surgery; computer networks mining vast databases to discern consumer preferences. All of these innovations are the result of corporate or government initiatives overseen by elites.
 ''The process of innovation leaves out a huge proportion of the population,'' said Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. 
 To be sure, experts like Eric von Hippel, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argue that the proliferation of ''user-generated'' designs signals the ''democratizing'' of innovation. Armed with inexpensive digital tools and networks, ordinary people, he says, can band together to push their own innovations. They also can hijack existing technologies, taking them in directions only dimly envisioned by the original creators. 
 One example is an electronic community called Instructables whose participants share methods for customizing standard products in unpredictable ways. The chief of Instructables, Eric J. Wilhelm, who earned his doctorate at M.I.T., where he was inspired by Mr. von Hippel, has posted a clever means of turning a white Asics Gel-Foundation 7 running shoe into a purple model. (The $90 official version comes only in a white-black-and-blue combination.) 
 Today's Web-savvy consumers ''expect innovations to meet their needs,'' Mr. Wilhelm says. ''If innovation isn't tailored to them, they expect to be able to tailor it to themselves. That is a big change.''
 But does this really mean that elites no longer sit at the top of the innovation food chain? 
 ''Elites have a lot of leverage but less than they used to,'' says Peter Leyden, director of the New Politics Institute in San Francisco. ''More people are getting their voices heard.'' Mr. Leyden sees an emergent American ''republic of innovation,'' where growing numbers of people influence what innovations are made and when. 
 Skeptics, however, say that the rosy scenario is exaggerated and that user-generated innovation is merely a kind of ''democracy lite,'' emphasizing high-end consumer products and services rather than innovations that broadly benefit society. 
 ''Difficult questions are going unasked about who is participating in innovation and on what terms,'' says James Wilsdon, director of the innovation program at Demos, a think tank in London. 
 In that scenario, needed innovations can be overlooked. For example, huge amounts of money are spent on improving Web search engines or MP3 players, while scant attention is given to alternative energy sources. Battling diseases like AIDS or Alzheimer's -- efforts that lobbying groups in wealthy countries help highlight -- attract legions of well-financed innovators, while big global killers, like childhood diarrhea and sleeping sickness, are ignored.
 Popular pressure to pursue certain innovations sometimes gets results, of course. In 2004, voters in California passed a law lavishly funding a stem-cell research institute -- in a rebuke to the Bush administration, which has banned federal funding for such research. ''This was a great example of a democratic adjudication of an innovation issue,'' Mr. Sarewitz of Arizona State said. Even so, bureaucratic and legal delays have meant a slow start for the San Francisco lab, which has not yet received approval to spend any of the $3 billion in promised taxpayer funds.
 The California example suggests that the balance between expert leadership and mass influence is hard to achieve. The underlying complexity of many innovations demands an ever-rising technological literacy from the public, and yet such an outcome ''is a dream that will not likely come to pass,'' insists Mr. Hughes, a visiting professor at M.I.T.
 For all the hoopla over the power and promise of user-generated content, consumer-directed design and other hallmarks of our new golden era of democratized innovation, one of the iconic products of our times -- the iPod -- can't be customized (no, I'm not counting putting on different-colored protective jackets). There is an unbroken line between Henry Ford (with his Model T) and Steve Jobs. The new iPhone similarly reflects the elite, corporate innovator's drive to find one size that fits many.
 The cliche that committees can't create great ideas, or art, still seems to be true -- though whether or not that is the best way to innovate remains an open question. Who knows how much longer?

DRIVEN OUT
 The Forgotten War Against
 Chinese Americans.
 By Jean Pfaelzer.
 Illustrated. 400 pp. Random House. $27.95.
Thinking realistically about the history of the American West easily lands on the list of this nation's top 10 least favorite pastimes. Hundreds of historians have invested their life force in pointing out the inaccuracies in the image of the 19th-century West as a place of colorful romance and innocent adventure. ''No thanks,'' the believers reliably respond. ''We like our version a lot better.''
 Now, Jean Pfaelzer steps forward as a fresh reinforcement in this morale-draining campaign. In ''Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans,'' she tells the story of the ''thousands of Chinese people who were violently herded onto railroad cars, steamers or logging rafts, marched out of town or killed,'' from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains. Despite the forceful adjective of Pfaelzer's subtitle, this burdensome history has not been entirely ''forgotten.'' Scholars have written comprehensively and memorably about it. But it is surely accurate to say that a majority of Americans live without a recognition of the degree, scale and extent of these chilling undertakings. 
 Most know even less about the extraordinary record of the Chinese people's responding to persecution with boycotts, petitions, lawsuits and demands for reparations. In Wing Hing v. City of Eureka, 53 Chinese men and women joined together in asserting that the Northern California city had a duty to protect its residents and in demanding reparations and financial compensation for the violence that drove them out in 1885. Confronted with the requirement, in the Geary Act of 1892, that Chinese immigrants carry an identity card proving they were in the country legally or else face deportation, thousands refused to submit to what they called the ''Dog Tag Law,'' thus undertaking what Pfaelzer says was ''perhaps the largest organized act of civil disobedience in the United States.''
 Altogether, Chinese immigrants filed more than 7,000 lawsuits in the decade after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, ''and they won the vast majority of them,'' Pfaelzer writes. In truth, these efforts to claim the protection of American law should require historians to come up with a whole new understanding -- in geography, chronology and cast of characters -- of the civil rights movement.
 To a surprising and heartening degree, some white Westerners championed the Chinese in their assertion of rights. Taking the job of San Francisco consul for the Chinese government, the lawyer Frederick Bee became an indefatigable filer of lawsuits and writer of protests on behalf of the dispossessed. After the brutal expulsion of the Chinese from the city of Tacoma in 1885, W. H. White, a courageous United States attorney, prosecuted the leaders of the mob, including Tacoma's mayor, chief of police, two councilmen, a probate court judge and the president of the Y.M.C.A. In Southern California, a missionary's wife, one remarkable Mrs. Trumble, protected 30 Chinese men from a mob, standing on her porch aiming a rifle -- and the good advice to disperse -- at the vigilantes. 
 But that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the uplifting part of this review. ''Driven Out'' cites records of more than 100 roundups, pogroms, expulsions and ethnic cleansings (to use Pfaelzer's various terms for these actions) in which white Westerners united to drive the Chinese out of their communities from 1850 to 1906. They used warnings, arson, boycotts and violence to achieve their goal. In many circumstances, labor organizations led the campaigns, casting the Chinese as competitors for jobs and depressors of wages. But middle-class civic leaders often acted in alliance with workers. 
 And what motivated the proud participants in these acts of stunning cruelty? Following the influential work of the historian Alexander Saxton, Pfaelzer -- a professor of English, East Asian studies and American studies at the University of Delaware -- points to the disappointment and disillusion that afflicted many seekers of fortune in the American West, native-born whites and European immigrants alike. When the West defaulted on their high expectations, they directed their frustration at the Chinese. In a more subtle casting of this usual explanation, Pfaelzer portrays it as an act of projection. ''Whites saw in Chinese workers precisely what they hated about their own lives: hard and underpaid work, long hours, poor living conditions and a dearth of women.'' In other words, white workers made the Chinese their scapegoats because of the similarities, rather than the differences, between them.
 Every now and then, as in this example, Pfaelzer hits her stride in a clear and insightful passage of analysis. Her summation of the implications of Chinese litigation is a model of memorable historical interpretation. ''The Chinese brought these suits as part of a strategy of forcing a nation to obey its own laws. Despite the violence and the limits on access to the courts, they acted as if legal judgments could be impartial.''
 The stories Pfaelzer tells deserve our attention, and yet this is not a particularly well-written or well-organized book. In the end, her tireless and thorough research -- sifting through 19th-century newspapers, pursuing diaries and memoirs from local historical societies, seeking out court documents, tracking diplomatic correspondence -- has left her with a nearly impossible problem. How is a writer to make an artful narrative out of tales in which the same miserable events unfold over and over again? Cataloging the harassment of the Chinese in the 1880s, Pfaelzer finally resorts to assembling, in white type on 35 black pages, what she calls a ''litany of hate'': ''a topical and chronological register of acts of ethnic cleansing.'' This is, in other words, the literary genre the rest of us call a list.
 With a topic of this seriousness, it may seem petty to dwell on cryptic sentences or the lack of a uniting theme in paragraphs held together by intellectual duct tape of weakened stickiness. But the uneven quality of the writing has consequence. It gives the reader an unintended relief from an otherwise unrelenting confrontation with human cruelty. One more round of revisions, with sharper phrasing, clearer narrative and more thorough analysis, and Pfaelzer could have sealed off the reader's route of emotional escape.
 In her introduction, Pfaelzer makes an ambitious, though brief, effort to place the Chinese expulsions in a broad planetary history, remembering her ''own family's diaspora'' in flight from Nazi Germany and referring to the ''millions of refugees in Nigeria, Eritrea, Iraq and Darfur'' today. She also notes that ''thousands of immigrants, thousands of people born in the United States to parents born abroad, and thousands of others are marching through the streets of Los Angeles, Houston and New York, refusing to be temporary people, transients, braceros, guests or sojourners.'' 
 Could a reckoning with the unhappy history Pfaelzer documents bring some clarity and wisdom to contemporary debates on immigration? When we ask it to guide our decisions in the present, history has a way of speaking more like a sphinx than like the author of a how-to manual. And yet, in this particular territory, historical perspective surrenders some of its habitual obliqueness and subtlety. First, like many other important works in this field, Pfaelzer's book makes an irrefutable case that immigration played a crucial role in building the economic well-being of the United States. Second, we must acknowledge that nothing has immunized us against the unhappy effect that economic disappointment works on the soul, or against the temptation to find scapegoats to hold responsible for deeper problems. 
 In 1876, commenting on violence against the Chinese in nearby Truckee, Calif., The Reno Evening Gazette in Nevada declared that one attack, in which vigilantes set two cabins on fire and shot at the occupants as they fled, represented a ''phase of human depravity and cupidity that would cast a gloom over the dark shades of hell.'' You might dismiss that phrasing as melodramatic and overwrought. But contemplate the stories brought together in this book, and the writers at that newspaper will seem simply to have stated the truth.

HEADLINE: China Moves to Refurbish A Damaged Global Image

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 26 

 BODY:
After years of being accused by Western nations of making only token gestures to fight fake goods and months of complaints about the safety of its exports, China is taking extraordinary steps to change its image.
 Last week, Beijing unveiled new controls aimed at fighting counterfeit drugs and substandard exports. High-ranking officials and regulators vowed to strengthen China's food safety system, tighten controls over chemical use by large seafood and meat producers, and create a system that holds producers more accountable for selling unsafe products.
 The government also announced that it had broken up a series of criminal rings that operated huge manufacturing centers, producing goods as varied as pirated Microsoft software, fake Viagra and imitation Crest toothpaste.
 Authorities here have also reached out to Ogilvy Public Relations, an international consultancy that advises on crisis management. 
 ''This is a very concerted effort to show they are doing something,'' said Russell Leigh Moses, a longtime political analyst based in Beijing. ''They are using work groups, issuing directives and closing factories. They are rolling out the artillery.''
 Spurred on by a sense of economic realpolitik, Beijing has grown particularly fearful that mounting international pressure could lead to sanctions or embargoes, and thereby hinder China's booming economy.
 Whether promising to overhaul China's regulatory regime and stepping up enforcement will be enough to tame what some view as the Wild, Wild East of capitalism is unclear, analysts say, because some of the problems are so deeply rooted.
 ''There's no quick fix,'' says Henk Bekedam, the World Health Organization's top representative in China. ''China has perhaps been cutting some corners because the focus has been on growth. But they have 5,000 companies that produce medicine. That's far too many.
 ''The government has a limited ability to enforce things,'' he said. ''They need to start with simple things: reduce the number of people you monitor.''
 Still, even critics of China's policies have been impressed with the catalog of recently announced changes.
 The bold actions, experts say, are partly aimed at easing political pressure from the United States and the European Union, where regulators and politicians are pressing for assurances about the quality and safety of goods made here after a string of recalls involving goods like tainted pet food and toothpaste, defective tires and dangerous toys.
 In Washington this month, President Bush created a panel of cabinet officials to make recommendations aimed at minimizing the dangers from imported foods or other products. The announcement coincided with Congressional hearings on food safety.
 And in recent weeks, several Democrats in Congress have pressed for tougher measures against China, including trade sanctions and new money for American regulators to guard against unsafe goods entering the country, particularly from China.
 Those issues will lead the agenda for the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., as he arrives for talks with Chinese officials this weekend.
 Europe is also concerned. Top European Union officials are planning to meet in Beijing next month to discuss food safety and other issues. 
 And on Wednesday, the head of the European Union's consumer protection agency, Meglena Kuneva, pressed Chinese regulators to improve their standards during a tour of a government testing lab and a Chinese toy factory near the city of Nanjing.
 Ms. Kuneva said that she was hopeful China would make progress, but she added that if its products continued to be a problem, the European Union would block market access.
 ''Toys like this can be in the hands of children, so do a good job,'' Ms. Kuneva told a young inspector. ''The good name of this country is in your hands.''
 Many experts doubt whether China can follow through on its promises -- some of which have been made before. And Chinese officials have not conceded that all the problems lie here. Regulators have repeatedly accused the international news media of exaggerating the number of problem Chinese goods.
 Some Chinese businessmen say protectionists in the West are seizing on isolated cases to drum up support for trade sanctions, at a time when China is amassing a huge trade surplus.
 China has also argued that the quality of the food it exports is no worse than the quality of American food entering China. After the United States Food and Drug Administration moved last month to block five types of Chinese seafood from entering the United States market, China responded by banning some imports of American frozen poultry and pork, insisting they were tainted by antibiotic residues.
 Still, many experts say China has also become more candid about the challenges facing the country.
 The government recently acknowledged that 20 percent of its consumer goods and 14 percent of the truck tires made here failed safety inspections.
 And, most dramatically, just two weeks ago, China executed the former head of the State Food and Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, for accepting bribes and failing to police the marketplace. Days after he was executed, a top drug agency official admitted that the obstacles to repairing the regulatory systems were daunting.
 The admissions were a surprising about-face for China, which has been slow to accept blame for shipping tainted products overseas.
 But analysts say that as the evidence and bad news began to mount this year, China was forced to respond in a less adversarial way, particularly because the country's booming economy is built on foreign investment and trade.
 Recently, the government has even sought crisis management advice from Western consultants.
 ''They have not historically been advice takers,'' said Scott Kronick, president of Ogilvy Public Relations Worldwide China, part of the WPP Group. ''But they are reaching out in a genuine way to seek advice. I think they recognize everything doesn't have to be rosy.''
 Since then, officials from various regulatory agencies and ministries have held news conferences to announce new regulations or to brief the news media on successful crackdowns.
 Last week, China's quality inspectors promised to improve quarterly reports to the European Union about consumer product safety. And on Thursday, the government said it planned to offer large rewards to citizens who report on illegal practices in the food industry.
 Many experts say the problem in China is not oversight but enforcement.
 ''The issue is not whether Chinese businesses are regulated; they are,'' says Yasheng Huang, an associate professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The issue is that the regulators themselves are unable to be impartial in the enforcement of the laws. Those laws are meaningless in a system that does not even pretend to have judicial independence, media freedom and legislative oversight.''
 Some say regulators are susceptible to corruption and that local inspectors can easily be bought off or persuaded that cracking down on local companies hurts economic development and risks jobs.
 That may explain why after years of promising to tackle piracy and counterfeiting, the practice continues to flourish in China, often in the open.
 Last week, the United States' Federal Bureau of Investigation and China's Ministry of Public Security said they had broken up one of the biggest software piracy rings ever, arresting 25 people and closing six manufacturing facilities in China.
 They also seized $500 million worth of pirated Microsoft and Symantec software. A day later, the government here said it had seized a ton of fake Viagra pills and closed counterfeit drug factories that produced Tamiflu, anti-malaria drugs and other products.
 The seizures may be a sign of progress, but they are also an indication of how widespread the problem has been for China, experts say.
 ''The problem is these are campaigns and they tend to be turned off at some point,'' says Mr. Moses, the analyst in Beijing.

HEADLINE: Director's Quest for Truth Among the Downtrodden

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
FOR someone whose films have until recently gone largely unseen, the Portuguese director Pedro Costa has a pretty vociferous fan club. His admirers include the French director Jacques Rivette (who called him ''genuinely great'') and the Canadian photographer Jeff Wall (who claimed that Mr. Costa's films improve on Robert Bresson's). He has been feted at festivals and museums from Vienna to Mexico City to Tokyo. His work has been extensively discussed in Cahiers du Cinema, Artforum and Film Comment. Last fall Cinema Scope magazine produced promotional -- or, more to the point, polemical-- T-shirts, identical to the ''Vote for Pedro'' T's from ''Napoleon Dynamite'' except for an additional phrase: ''Pedro Costa, that is.''
But Mr. Costa, 48, is not uniformly loved by world-cinema tastemakers. The press screening for ''Colossal Youth'' at the Cannes Film Festival last year was punctuated by a steady stream of departing critics. Detractors call his films slow and obdurate. Their rigor and stringency, along with the ferocious rhetoric often deployed by his champions, have given him the forbidding air of a high-art Spartan. 
 That reputation does the work a disservice. Few movies are as concretely rooted in physical reality or as profoundly attentive to their social context as Mr. Costa's. In recent years he has shot almost exclusively in the slums of Lisbon, working closely with the downtrodden inhabitants. Staking out a radical middle between documentary and fiction, he has invented a heroic and quite literal form of Arte Povera, a monumental cinema of humble means. (A retrospective of his films, which has been touring North America, starts Friday at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan and runs through Aug. 12.)
 Speaking by telephone from Lisbon, Mr. Costa called his methods a throwback to, of all things, old Hollywood. ''It's like a studio system,'' he said. ''We go to work every day. We have our economic structure -- everyone gets paid the same -- and we have our stars.''
 Mr. Costa's first feature, ''O Sangue'' (''The Blood,'' 1989), was not a reliable indicator of things to come. A black-and-white reverie of family disintegration, it is, in the best sense, a young man's film, drunk on romantic doom and movie love -- a rhapsodic style Mr. Costa now regards as ''camouflage.'' 
 Frustrated with the rightward drift in Portuguese politics and the scarcity of financing, he ventured abroad -- to the West African islands of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony -- and made ''Casa de Lava'' (Down to Earth,'' 1994). The story of a nurse who accompanies a comatose laborer home to Cape Verde, it changed the course of his career.
 The Cape Verdeans he met sent him back to Lisbon with gifts for relatives who had emigrated there. The delivery mission led him to the shantytown of Fontainhas, where many Cape Verdeans had settled. He decided to set a film in the neighborhood, using residents as actors. 
 The result, ''Ossos'' (''Bones,'' 1997), centered on the newborn infant of two hapless teenagers, is a parable of economic and spiritual desperation as oblique and concentrated as anything by Bresson. Mr. Costa was dissatisfied with the shoot, not least for having invaded a residential neighborhood with the unwieldy machinery of film production.
 ''We would be shooting late at night and shining lights into people's houses,'' he said. ''I realized there's something wrong with the way movies are made today.''
 Mr. Costa set out to address not merely logistical headaches but also the responsibility that comes with picking up a camera. The act of filmmaking is premised on a discrepancy of power. As Mr. Costa put it, ''The balance is off between those behind and in front of the camera.'' His next film, ''In Vanda's Room'' (2000), went a long way toward redressing the inequality. 
 Encouraged by Vanda Duarte, an actress in ''Ossos,'' he continued to film in Fontainhas, which was being demolished. This time he did so with a small video camera, often by himself. He grew close to his subjects and shot for almost two years. From 140 hours of footage he shaped a three-hour film.
 A series of shadowy domestic tableaus (the camera never moves, and Mr. Costa used only available light), ''In Vanda's Room'' is a stark, intimate portrait of a community whose world is literally falling apart. (Bulldozers are continuously heard on the soundtrack.) It feels at times like a documentary but is actually the result of long conversations and multiple takes. Ms. Duarte and her friends, who sit around, talk, prepare heroin fixes, smoke and shoot up, are not documentary subjects so much as actors playing themselves. 
 Mr. Costa handled the copious drug use matter-of-factly. ''I was never moralistic,'' he said. ''But I was hoping to get them to see that drugs are a punishment imposed on them by external forces.''
 While shooting ''In Vanda's Room'' he recognized that he didn't want to return to traditional filmmaking. ''Going to work on the bus I felt exactly like I should for the rest of my life,'' he said. ''It's almost not a film at that point. It's a job you do, a job you like. We could be making chairs or shoes. It just happens to be images and sounds.''
 Mr. Costa's films assert that there are more important things than art, even as they insist that beauty is everywhere to be found. ''Art should be more than it is and a lot less than it is,'' he said, voicing the implicit manifesto of his films. ''Brecht said he made jewels for the poor. He talked about the epic quality of the day-to-day life of common people. That's something I pursue. I really want them to be heroes.''
 He left Fontainhas to make ''Where Lies Your Hidden Smile?'' (2001), a documentary on Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet, the avant-garde filmmakers he had long admired. (Mr. Costa speaks passionately of his ''idols'' who range from the Hollywood titan John Ford to the punk-rock rabble-rouser John Lydon.)
 ''Colossal Youth,'' which came next, stemmed from an impulse to document the relocation of the Fontainhas residents. Ms. Duarte, now on methadone though still possessed of her signature hacking cough, appears in the film, but the focus is on Ventura, an elderly Cape Verdean whose wife has left him. Mr. Costa again amassed hundreds of hours of footage, but he moves further from documentary to include surreal and mythic touches. Ventura wanders between the old ghetto, where a few stragglers remain, and the new housing project. He refers to the men and women he meets as his children and repeatedly recites a love letter (adapted from the poet Robert Desnos) to his absent wife.
 In a sense ''Colossal Youth'' is a film about walls. The contrast between the worn interiors of Fontainhas, walls on which entire lives are inscribed, and the whitewashed surfaces of the anonymous new apartments is almost shocking.
 There is a third space the movie briefly occupies -- the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon -- and to hear Mr. Costa describe the genesis of a scene he shot there, the walls are again significant. He was driving with Ventura one day when they passed the Gulbenkian. ''Ventura told me he worked on the construction years ago but had never been to the museum,'' Mr. Costa said, so they pulled over. Inside he noticed that Ventura was drawn less to the art than to his own handiwork: the walls. ''He's moved that his walls have Rubens and Rembrandts,'' he said. ''But he kept looking behind the paintings.''

HEADLINE: An Ambivalent Panama Weighs Noriega's Debt and Threat

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
If Manuel Noriega, the deposed dictator, ever returns to Panama, Winston Spadafora, a justice on the country's Supreme Court, has a question for him.
 ''I'd like to ask him,'' Justice Spadafora said in a recent interview in his chambers, ''what he did with my brother's head.''
 Panama has unfinished business with Mr. Noriega, who was taken from here in January 1990 after the American military invaded. There are criminal convictions against him, including one for the beheading of Justice Spadafora's brother, Hugo, a leading opposition figure, in 1985. And there is a sense among the population that despite his years in prison in the United States, he has not fully paid for all the rough years he put everyone here through.
 Still, as his long prison sentence in Miami nears an end (he is scheduled to be released Sept. 9), there are mixed feelings in Panama about his possible return, and some relief that the United States is trying to send him to France, where he has been convicted of using illegal drug profits to buy property worth more than $3 million. 
 The diminutive Mr. Noriega appeared in federal court in Miami on July 26, his hair dyed black, his military uniform neatly pressed under a bulky black coat and his bearing still ramrod straight, at least for a septuagenarian former general. ''Manuel Antonio Noriega,'' he said in a deep voice when the magistrate handling the United States government's extradition request, William C. Turnoff, asked his name.
 Mr. Noriega's lawyers are fighting for him to go to Panama, not France, insisting that the Geneva Conventions mandate that as a prisoner of war he be sent back to his country.
 The issue remains unresolved. But many say that Mr. Noriega, despite 17 years away and his country's best efforts to forget him, continues to cast a shadow over Panama.
 Some Norieguistas, as his former cronies are called, hold positions in the government, which is controlled by the same Democratic Revolutionary Party that Mr. Noriega used to run. One of them, Benjamin Colamarco, who used to run the Dignity Battalions, the paramilitary outfit that cracked down on dissenters, is now the minister of public works.
 Mr. Noriega's numerous homes and other properties, seized years ago by the government but never sold, lie in ruins. In one ramshackle home in the capital, looted and overrun by rodents, a small sign on the gate says ''Noriega.''
 Unlike Chileans, who have fought hard to have their former dictator, Augusto Pinochet, return from overseas to face justice, Panamanians appear more ambivalent about whether Mr. Noriega ought to spend time in local detention.
 ''If he comes back, plenty of people are going to use his return for their own interest,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a constitutional law professor and opposition leader who clashed with Mr. Noriega's government. ''Those who believe in him will go to the airport to meet him. Those who hate him will protest. And some people will fear that he will open his mouth and tell all that he knows.''
 Samuel Lewis Navarro, Panama's foreign minister and the son of one of Mr. Noriega's biggest foes, regards the jailed former general as a historical figure even though he still lives. ''The Panamanian people today recognize that period of our history as a very sad, very unfortunate period,'' he said. ''But they have overcome it with a forward-looking vision.''
 As for Mr. Noriega somehow returning to Panamanian politics, something his lawyers say he is not contemplating, Mr. Lewis, who also serves as vice president, said flatly, ''The political relevance of Noriega in Panama is none.''
 In many ways, Panama is not the same place it was when Mr. Noriega walked out of the Vatican Embassy and into the hands of the American soldiers who took him to Miami to be tried on drug trafficking charges.
 Skyscrapers and construction cranes now dot the skyline of the capital. The economic sanctions that the United States imposed in the 1980s to protest Mr. Noriega's rule were long ago lifted, and Panama's economy is now bursting at the seams, second in this part of the world only to Brazil's.
 The military that Mr. Noriega used to lead has been disbanded, deemed nonessential for the new Panama. When Mr. Noriega dons his uniform, as he did in court this week, he is the general of an army of one.
 Various Panamanian governments have requested the extradition of Mr. Noriega since as far back as 1991. The first extradition request, in fact, was signed by Julio E. Berrios, who worked at the Foreign Ministry at the time but is now one of Mr. Noriega's local defense counsels. Still, despite the long-standing extradition effort, there has been no full-court press by President Martin Torrijos to get Mr. Noriega home.
 ''We're following it very closely,'' said Mr. Lewis, describing the extradition as an American legal matter. ''That's as much as we can do.''
 Frank Rubino, one of Mr. Noriega's lawyers, put it differently. ''They're hiding in the background, letting France have their citizen,'' he said of Panamanian officials.
 Besides the killing of Mr. Spadafora, Mr. Noriega has been convicted of the 1989 killings of a group of army officers who tried to overthrow him, including Maj. Moises Giroldi. Mr. Noriega also has been convicted of corruption and kidnapping.
 ''As military regimes go, Noriega's was a relatively benign one,'' acknowledged an official in the current Bush administration who was involved in American policy in Panama before the invasion ordered by the first President Bush in December 1989. ''They didn't kill that many people. They didn't torture that many people. But that's comparing them with the very worst.''
 American officials say that in most cases deposed leaders should pay for their crimes in the country where they committed their wrongs. But in the case of Mr. Noriega, officials acknowledge that his presence in Panama would probably disrupt the country's progress. Washington's current plan is for Mr. Noriega to go to France, where he could spend a decade in prison, and then go to Panama, if he is still alive.
 The problem is that for all the changes in Panama, Mr. Noriega would return to a country with some of the same dysfunctions as the one he left. The judiciary, for instance, is considered corrupt from the Supreme Court on down, and recent changes in the penal code make it possible that Mr. Noriega would not spend much, if any, time behind bars.
 In a few years, Mr. Noriega, who said in court recently that he was 72, could take advantage of a new provision mandating house arrest for those older than 75. He could demand a new trial because he was not in the country to defend himself. He could claim illness, as Rafael Arosemena, a bank president in Mr. Noriega's time, did recently. That action enabled Mr. Arosemenato to return from exile in Mexico and serve his corruption sentence at home.
 ''He should not serve a day in jail,'' said Mr. Berrios, one of Mr. Noriega's Panamanian lawyers, referring to the convictions in absentia as patently unfair.
 In discussing Mr. Noriega, some Panamanians instinctively seem to slip back in habits of the past, when criticizing him openly was dangerous. A waiter at a trendy restaurant in the old section of the capital, his voice falling to a whisper, said he had an ashtray in his home that was looted from one of the former general's residences. ''Noriega smoked cigars and I always think about all the awful things he was planning as he and his friends put out their cigars in that ashtray,'' he said, insisting that his name not be printed just in case Mr. Noriega returned home.
 A former neighbor recalled all the noise that Mr. Noriega's peacocks used to make in the neighborhood and how she and others would grumble about how, if they ever caught one of the birds, they would make peacock sancocho, which is a popular Panamanian stew.
 ''There was a lot less crime when he lived here,'' the neighbor acknowledged, also insisting on anonymity in case Mr. Noriega became a neighbor again. ''That was because of all the soldiers around. There was less crime but everybody still lived in fear of the soldiers.''
 Not everybody. Mr. Noriega had many backers, and a few are rearing their heads. Sipping a rum drink recently as the sun went down on the Caribbean coast of Panama, Elvia Gayle recalled her dear friend Manuel, a tough man, she admits, but one who had cared about poor Panamanians like her.
 ''I'm not saying he was good,'' said Ms. Gayle, who was a member of a pro-Noriega security battalion. ''But I was his friend and I saw he was a man who could cry.''
 She also has something to say to Mr. Noriega upon his return. ''I will hug him and tell him how much I missed him,'' she said. ''I will be at the airport when he comes back even if I'm the only one. I know I won't be alone, though.''
 Probably not. But also there would probably be his many detractors.
 ''I don't think we Panamanians would try to kill him,'' Mr. Bernal said. ''But he wouldn't have a nice time here. There would be plenty of people yelling at him, telling him what they think of him. He would wish he were back in Miami.''

HEADLINE: New Fees May Put a Bite On Midwest Tournaments

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Larry Krohn, the director of the annual Minnetonka Classic Bass Tournament, says he loves handing the big checks to the people who reel in the biggest fish. The prize pool last month was more than $30,000, including the $9,400 for the top-catching two-person team.
 But Krohn's mood seems to sour at the thought of another check he will have to cut before his next event: a new $400 fee to Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources for a tournament permit. He is already paying smaller fees to the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District, for the city's bill for park use and for the insurance policy required by the local sheriff's department. 
 ''After 15 years of running this, my level of frustration is mounting every year,'' Krohn said. ''Every year, it gets worse and worse in terms of the things you have to do. It's going to be enough of a hassle for some tournament directors that they aren't going to do it.''
 Next week, the Department of Natural Resources begins imposing the highest fees in the nation on fishing tournament organizers. They will range from $120 to $1,000, depending on the number of participants and whether fish are taken off-site to be weighed -- costs almost certain to be passed along to anglers through higher entrance fees. The permits had been free.
 Agency officials say they want to recover the cost of issuing event permits, pegged at $108,000 annually. But many competitive anglers consider fees an assault on their sport and say they worry that they will be the final straw for small tournaments struggling to survive.
 It is a debate that has also come to neighboring Wisconsin, where officials are refining a proposed tournament fee schedule after one failed last year amid concerns that it was excessive. Andrew Fayram, a fisheries policy analyst at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said he expected the next plan to split regulatory costs between competitive anglers and contest organizers.
 Beneath the fee fight is a deeper dispute over water use.
 The spread of tournaments -- traced by some to competitive fishing's increasing television presence -- has stoked questions about the sport's possible strain on fisheries; organizers say they follow catch-and-release practices and that tournaments do not increase fish mortality. There is also tension over lake access and waterway traffic because the events can draw dozens of boats.
 Vern Wagner, who has been active in Minnesota tournament fishing for two decades, said he wondered if the fees were an attempt to discourage contests.
 ''If this was 30 guys in canoes, there wouldn't be a problem,'' he said. ''It's the fact that a bass boat costs $35,000, so, accordingly, somehow we're economically profiting. 
 ''It's a perception that it's a bunch of rich guys going out on the lake and somehow exploiting the resource.''
 Terry Peltier, a member of a Department of Natural Resources citizen panel that recommended the fees, denied trying to curb tournaments.
 But if fewer tournaments is the result, Dave Zentner, an angler from Duluth, Minn., said he was all for it. He viewed fishing as a recreational escape and said he was bothered by corporate sponsorships attached to many tournaments.
 ''I still want to puke when I look at an outdoor channel and see guys grabbing a fish out of a tank and running it across a stage like they've just won the Boston Marathon,'' Zentner said. ''It just turns me off.''
 The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources issues roughly 600 tournament permits a year. The agency requires permits when there are 30 or more entrants for open-water contests and above 150 when the water is iced over.
 Al Stevens, a fisheries program consultant for the agency, said permits helped the department manage where tournaments were held and made sure popular lakes were not overused. The cost of processing permit applications and compiling after-event reports grew more than sixfold in the last decade. The citizen panel recommended a fee to replace dollars currently drawn from a fund fed by regular fishing license fees.
 Under the new system, it will cost tournament organizers $120 for an ice-fishing permit, $400 for open-water events with more than 100 people and onsite fish weighing, $500 for midsized contests where fish are taken off-site and $1,000 for tournaments with 100 or more entrants and off-site weighing.
 Stevens said Minnesota's rates were unrivaled. For instance, Vermont charges a $50 fee and Washington, New Mexico and South Carolina are in the $25 range. Many other states charge nothing.
 Mickey Goetting, the conservation director of the Minnesota Bass Anglers Sportsman Society Federation, said the fees would be especially cumbersome to groups that put on multiple-tournament leagues. 
 The federation would have rather seen the Department of Natural Resources establish a tournament stamp that anglers could buy at a nominal fee with their license that would let them into any event.
 Stevens said some organizers would limit the size of their fields to avoid having to get a permit, and others would merely try to fly under the radar.
 ''I'm afraid of the backlash,'' he said. ''That's just bad for fish management. When we lose sight of how many tournaments there are and where they're at, it could lead to more conflicts at lakes. That's not what we want.''

HEADLINE: Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
IT'S not so much the modest bungalow's spacious second-floor addition or the expansive side yard that gets to Lori Ann Vendetti.
The thing that keeps her fighting is the misty ocean air that floats through her doorway when she lets her dog out in the morning. The salty aroma can transport her back to childhood weekends spent playing on the beach with her two brothers, long since dead and gone.
 Neither Ms. Vendetti, 46, nor her parents across the street believe they can afford another place within a sniff of the ocean if the City of Long Branch, N.J., wins its 12-year effort to turn their homes over to a private developer who wants to build luxury condominiums.
 ''We always feel like things are stacked against us,'' said Ms. Vendetti, who has lived in her home for 12 years. ''But if they're going to take it from me, they're going to take it with a fight.'' 
 During the last two years, homeowners and property-rights advocates across the country have echoed that sentiment, and state lawmakers have answered. A controversial United States Supreme Court decision in June 2005, which upheld the power of local governments to seize private property for the benefit of private businesses, inspired an uprising that led 40 states to pass laws that rein in, to varying degrees, that authority. 
 But legislatures in the three states in the New York metropolitan area, long seen by property-rights advocates as home to some of the worst abuses of eminent domain, have done little to change the status quo.
 ''New Jersey and New York are among the worst states in the country for eminent domain abuses -- New Jersey is really awful,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Va., which represents residential and business owners facing condemnation. ''What's interesting is that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are some of the few states that have not managed to pass any decent legislation.''
 In Connecticut, where the United States Supreme Court case originated, Gov. M. Jodi Rell late last month quietly signed a law that includes a prohibition on taking property ''primarily'' to increase local tax revenues, leaving open that reasoning as a secondary cause. 
 New York, which already allowed the taking of property for private use, saw its lawmakers introduce 17 related bills in 2006. But the Legislature passed only those laws seeking to ban two specific projects. 
 Similarly, New Jersey legislators have been unable to pass any bill. The State Supreme Court recently stepped into the breach, arguing that cities and towns cannot condemn properties simply because another use could be more productive. That ruling, in Gallenthin Realty Development v. Borough of Paulsboro, has already had an impact on several projects, including a plan to build 2,000 condominiums in downtown Newark.
 Other states have instituted more precise definitions of blight, set minimum compensation levels above market value for the owners of seized properties and restricted eminent domain to more traditional public projects like schools and roads. The legislative changes have been driven by an unusual alliance of conservative Republican property-rights advocates and liberals interested in the rights of lower-income people. 
 Not everyone believes such measures are needed. It remains to be seen if the new laws will protect property owners without chilling redevelopment projects. ''You had this huge uproar,'' said Larry Morandi, who has tracked the new laws at the National Conference of State Legislatures, ''and an incredibly fast legislative response. The effect of that legislation will be seen in how it is implemented, and that takes time.''
 While supporters of the current laws say a reasoned analysis would show that eminent domain is most often employed as a last resort and without major conflict, what has driven the push for change and has led to so many lawsuits is anger at the potential loss of control over such a fundamental aspect of life.
 The lead plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court case, Susette Kelo, a nurse who lived in a pink Victorian cottage in New London, Conn., opposed the town's condemnation of her neighborhood to make way for a private development of offices, condominiums and a hotel. The 5-to-4 majority opinion held that promoting economic development met the ''public use'' clause of the Fifth Amendment that allows condemnations. In a dissenting opinion in the case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor gave voice to the fear that started a revolt: ''Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded.''
 IN Norwalk, Conn., Nancy Esposito doesn't want to be uprooted or upgraded. Her family has owned and run Casey's Sheet Metal Service in Norwalk for 15 years. Five years ago, a developer showed up offering to buy their building as part of a plan to remake several blocks. Ms. Esposito has resisted, and watched as the developer bought most of the buildings and land around her.
 ''They keep saying they want to make this area a destination,'' Ms. Esposito said. ''I say that it is a destination. It's my destination.''
 The developer, Stanley M. Seligson, a Norwalk native, envisions a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood spanning several blocks, with more than 500,000 square feet of stores, restaurants and theaters, 350 apartments and a large medical center. His project would be contiguous with other large developments.
 Mr. Seligson said he has so far acquired 75 percent of the property and was determined to acquire the remaining properties without the town invoking eminent domain. Town officials see the neighborhood as part an old urban core that has not responded to less sweeping redevelopment incentives. Four contiguous redevelopment projects are in the works, all of which have involved or could involve taking property through eminent domain if negotiations between the developer and property owners fail, said Susan Sweitzer, a senior project manager for the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency.
 ''The impetus is on the private developer to make this a nonissue,'' she said.
 Ms. Esposito said she believed the cards were already stacked against her.
 ''They keep saying they will use eminent domain as a last resort,'' she said. ''But when they have the ultimate power to take your property, it's a done deal. There is no such thing as private property anymore.''
 Governor Rell responded to the United States Supreme Court ruling involving the Kelo case by asking local governments to observe a voluntary moratorium on condemnations for private development until the state legislature could act. This year, she introduced legislation.
 ''It is time to clarify our eminent domain laws and make it absolutely clear when and why governments can -- and cannot -- take private property for public purposes,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement in March.
 The law that Mrs. Rell signed requires municipal legislative bodies to approve eminent domain seizures by a two-thirds majority and build in other protective measures for property owners. But property-rights advocates say the law's ban on citing increased tax revenues as a primary reason for condemnation will do little to clarify concerns about when property can be taken. 
 The new law also didn't include a provision that had been proposed by the governor to reimburse property owners at 125 percent of fair market value. Still, a spokesman for the governor said Mrs. Rell was pleased.
 ''Did it achieve everything that she wanted in one fell stroke? No,'' said Rich Harris, the spokesman. ''But certainly this is a considerable step forward from where the state was.''
 James S. Alesi, a state senator from the Rochester area, held a series of hearings across the state on eminent domain after the Kelo decision. He said he was repeatedly told that New York didn't need a handful of hastily drafted bills, but rather a commission to study the issue.
 ''I thought it was beneficial to learn one key thing: We don't really have to do a lot in New York State,'' he said. ''As compared to other areas around the country, New York's laws are pretty strong.''
 The New York State Bar Association has been the most prominent supporter of that position. Patricia E. Salkin, chairwoman of the association's eminent domain task force, said state laws might need tweaking, including a passage to increase public involvement in redevelopment plans and to extend the 30-day period allowed for owners of condemned property to file appeals. But she said states that passed more sweeping laws risked losing vital projects.
 ''We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' said Ms. Salkin, director of the Government Law Center of Albany Law School. ''We should make sure that it's a fair playing field for everybody.'' 
 State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh in Westchester, said the choice was not black and white. ''The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''The bar is entrenched on this one, and they're wrong.''
 In 2004, Mr. Brodsky pushed through a bill that required that towns notify by mail property owners facing condemnation. 
 It followed a controversy in Port Chester, in which a local business owner hadn't seen the Westchester village's notice in a local newspaper that his property was facing condemnation to make way for a Stop & Shop supermarket. 
 The 30 days that the state law allows for appeals passed before the businessman, Bill Brody, had even heard about the plan. A federal judge this month ruled that Mr. Brody's due process rights had been violated. 
 ''I think it's obvious that people are upset by what eminent domain is being used for,'' Mr. Brody said, ''and I think things are going to change.'' 
 Not all redevelopment projects engender large controversy. On Long Island, the Village of Hempstead is moving forward with a $2 billion plan to replace 26 acres in the village's downtrodden center with a mix of 2,500 housing units, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a performing arts center. The city has agreed to sell 21 properties it owns to the developer and seize up to 58 privately owned properties if the developer cannot come to terms with the owners. Most of the concerns voiced so far, including at a packed meeting last week, have involved ensuring that the plan includes a significant amount of affordable housing and that current residents receive enough compensation to find new homes.
 Mr. Brodsky introduced a bill last year calling for the appointment of an eminent domain ombudsman, compensating displaced homeowners at 150 percent of fair market value, and requiring that all condemnations for economic development be part of a comprehensive plan. 
 THE bill gained no traction in the State Assembly. ''This is an area where there's a lot of comfort with a bad law, and that's unfortunate,'' Mr. Brodsky said.
 Mr. Alesi, the state senator from Rochester, maintains that state laws need only to be ''buffed up'' and that the laws may not offer enough protections. Courts are relied on to catch abuses, but average people don't have the resources for a legal fight with the government, he said. ''No one should have the American dream turned into their own personal nightmare because of the government,'' he said.
 Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Town of Paulsboro had overreached in relying on a consultant's determination that an undeveloped 63-acre parcel could be condemned because it was ''not fully productive.''
 ''Under that approach, any property that is operated in less than optimal manner is arguably 'blighted,' '' wrote Chief Justice James R. Zazzali in the court's unanimous opinion. ''If such an all-encompassing definition were adopted, most property in the state would be eligible for redevelopment.''
 Citing the Supreme Court ruling, an Essex County Superior Court judge ruled this month that Newark could not designate as blighted a 14-acre area on and around Mulberry Street so the land could be used to build condominiums. Several property owners had fought the city's efforts to take the land by eminent domain, arguing to the court that the area was still productive. A spokeswoman for Mayor Cory A. Booker said the city had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling. 
 And an appellate panel last week rejected Lodi officials' efforts to replace two trailer parks with housing and shops. A newly elected Borough Council had dropped the plan earlier this month.
 A bill that would more narrowly define blight passed the New Jersey State Assembly last year but has been tied up in a State Senate committee since.
 The New Jersey League of Municipalities opposes limiting the power of municipalities in using eminent domain. Its opinion carries weight in a state with 566 municipalities, a strong tradition of home rule, and one in which many legislators are also mayors of their hometowns.
 William G. Dressel, executive director of the league, said that with little undeveloped land left in the state, and with towns increasingly relying on property taxes to provide services, responsible town leaders must look for ways to redevelop unproductive land. ''We were quite frankly relieved that the court did not unravel the eminent domain statutes as it relates to the use of that tool for economic development purposes,'' he said. ''We feel very strongly that eminent domain is a viable economic development tool in New Jersey that is used sparingly.''
 The state's public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, said a 1992 revision of the state statute created the ''not fully productive'' justification that ''opened up the floodgates'' for the improper use of eminent domain. 
 Mr. Chen's office recently issued a report that listed the plan in Long Branch, where Ms. Vendetti lives near the beach, under the heading ''Bogus Blight.'' It said the town based its conclusion on ''superficial'' exterior inspections that noted deteriorating paint or chipped masonry.
 Nothing appears to be decrepit about the Vendettis' homes. 
 Carmen Vendetti, 80, had saved his money driving a truck to buy his family, in 1960, a modest respite from the harsher environs of their home in Newark. He and his wife, Josephine, moved there full time after he retired. Ms. Vendetti saved her money from a job with Amtrak and bought a house across the street from her parents in 1995. Two months later, she attended a town meeting where a developer's model of the neighborhood showed luxury buildings all along the oceanfront.
 ''They had a house on my lot,'' she said. ''I just laughed and thought, 'How are they going to do that?' No one ever used the words 'eminent domain.' ''
 But Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for 17 years, said some in the area ignored the redevelopment plan, thinking it would fail, as had many before. Some homeowners have accepted offers of units made affordable to them in the new development, he said. He said that with just 20 percent of the construction completed, the beachfront has been transformed from a dangerous area of boarded-up storefronts to an upscale, year-round destination that includes packed restaurants and a popular park. 
 He said he thought the recent emotional backlash may dissuade officials in other areas from even trying such a sweeping turnaround using eminent domain.
 ''Politically it won't work anymore,'' he said. ''I think the time has come and gone.''

HEADLINE: Buzz Cola and Sprinklicious Doughnuts: A Mecca for 'Simpsons' Fans

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
In Times Square, where barriers between alternate universes have been thought to shift, visitors to 345 West 42nd Street are reveling in the most recent rupture in space-time.
 In ''The Simpsons,'' the TV cartoon series whose movie opened on Friday, Kwik-E-Mart is a barely disguised 7-Eleven whose Indian owner changes the expiration dates on spoiled food, worships at a shrine for the elephant god Ganesha and is under constant siege by armed robbers.
 Far from shrinking from the image, 7-Eleven has embraced its inner Kwik-E-Mart. This month it transformed a dozen stores in the United States, including the one on 42nd Street across from the Port Authority bus terminal, into ''Simpsons'' advertisements. 
 Andy Chaudhari (pronounced CHOW-dree), the 7-Eleven franchise owner on 42nd Street, is elated. He said he had received scores of daily telephone calls about Buzz Cola, Sprinklicious doughnuts, Squishees and other ''Simpsons'' products now being sold at the store.
 A man from Albany, Mr. Chaudhari said, drove to Manhattan, the only Kwik-E-Mart in the Northeast, ''just so he could buy 'Simpsons' stuff.''
 As with the other similarly outfitted 7-Elevens, Mr. Chaudhari's business so far has doubled from the same month a year ago, he said.
 In Mr. Chaudhari's store, boxes of Frosted KrustyO's cereal note that they have ''20 percent more air!'' An image of Jasper Beardley, an older citizen of the fictional Springfield with a waist-long beard, is frozen in mistaken suspended animation in the Kwik-E-Mart freezer, as in a ''Simpsons'' episode. 
 The A.T.M. is run by the ''First Bank of Springfield,'' whose slogan is ''Misplacing Decimal Points Since 194.5.'' Several signs over sandwiches and other goods proclaim, ''Buy 3 for the Price of 3.'' 
 To complete the effect, real-world counterparts lumber past the giant cutout of ''Comic Book Guy,'' the ponytailed baby boomer with the beach ball gut, holding nachos in one hand and a graphic novel in the other.
 Of all the figures in the store, however, by far the most popular is Kwik-E-Mart's unscrupulous proprietor, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon (pronounced Ah-poo Nah-HAHS-ah-PEEMA-pet-uh-lin), born in India, with a thick accent to prove it.
 After 18 years and more than 400 episodes, ''The Simpsons'' has become America's new Don Rickles. It is a drive-by satirizer of Christians, Jews, old people, police chiefs, groundskeepers, schoolteachers, doctors and the nuclear power industry.
 At first glance, it is hard to detect that Apu is a controversial character. At the 42nd Street store, South Asians of all ages giggle, put their arms around the Apu cutout's neck and have photographs taken with him.
 But Apu has ''always grated on me,'' said Manish Vij, 34, a blogger at ultrabrown.com, which has links to other Apu critics.
 ''He is a very crude ethnic character, and while there are many other crude ethnic characters on the show,'' said Mr. Vij, a Manhattan software entrepreneur, Apu is the only one with a stereotypical singsong accent, ''like the accent that Chinese-Americans find so insulting.''
 Apu's character is also in a stereotypical business, the convenience-store industry, Mr. Vij said. By contrast, a black character on the show is a physician and a Latino character is an unemployed actor in a bee suit, he said. 
 In some parts of the country, Mr. Vij added, ''Apu'' and his signature line of dialogue, ''Thank you, come again,'' have both become racist taunts.
 Gracie Films, the Culver City, Calif., producer of ''The Simpsons,'' did not return telephone calls seeking comment yesterday .
 For Mr. Chaudhari, the 7-Eleven owner, said the dispute seemed overblown. ''You cannot take everything to heart,'' he said.
 Mr. Chaudhari, 38, has watched ''The Simpsons,'' but confessed that his 14-year-old daughter, Nisha, has to explain the jokes to him.
 Originally from Samou Motawas, a small city in the western state of Gujarat, India, Mr. Chaudhari is the son of a schoolteacher and the grandson of a school principal.
 He came to the United States in 1988, when he was 20, after getting a graduate degree in business. With the economy of India faltering, Mr. Chaudhari said, he came ''for better opportunity.''
 Working in an auto parts factory and later as the owner of a grocery store that failed, Mr. Chaudhari, following the immigrant path that inspired the Apu character, worked as a general manager for an Indian friend who owned a 7-Eleven store in New Jersey.
 There, he learned three principles:
 Emphasize customer service.
 Keep a clean store. 
 Never run out of stock. This annoys customers who cannot find a favorite product.
 ''When my team is throwing out product, like expired sandwiches, I am happy,'' Mr. Chaudhari said. ''That means they have not run out of product.''
 Has he ever been robbed?
 ''No, never,'' said Mr. Chaudhari, who also owns two 7-Elevens in New Jersey, where he lives. Each store is fully staffed with as many as four people round the clock, which Mr. Chaudhari said deters robbers. He opened the 42nd Street franchise in December 2005.
 As for the Kwik-E-Mart makeover, that ends on Tuesday. Interviewed on Friday, Mr. Chaudhari was no longer receiving orders of KrustyO's cereal and other promotional products. He said he would love for the campaign to last months longer, even, he half joked, forever. 
 But, Mr. Chaudhari said, without a trace of Apu, ''What are you going to do?''

HEADLINE: Certain Degrees Now Cost More At Universities

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
Should an undergraduate studying business pay more than one studying psychology? Should a journalism degree cost more than one in literature? More and more public universities, confronting rising costs and lagging state support, have decided that the answers may be yes and yes.
 Starting this fall, juniors and seniors pursuing an undergraduate major in the business school at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, will pay $500 more each semester than classmates. The University of Nebraska last year began charging engineering students a $40 premium for each hour of class credit.
 And Arizona State University this fall will phase in for upperclassmen in the journalism school a $250 per semester charge above the basic $2,411 tuition for in-state students. 
 Such moves are being driven by the high salaries commanded by professors in certain fields, the expense of specialized equipment and the difficulties of getting state legislatures to approve general tuition increases, university officials say. 
 ''It is something of a trend,'' said Barmak Nassirian, associate executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.
 Even as they embrace such pricing, many officials acknowledge they are queasy about a practice that appears to value one discipline over another or that could result in lower-income students clustering in less expensive fields. 
 ''This is not the preferred way to do this,'' said Patrick V. Farrell, provost at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. ''If we were able to raise resources uniformly across the campus, that would be a preferred move. But with our current situation, it doesn't seem to us that that's possible.'' 
 At the University of Kansas, which started charging different prices in the early 1990s, there are signs that the higher cost of majoring in certain subjects is affecting the choices of poorer students.
 ''We are seeing at this point purely anecdotal evidence,'' said Richard W. Lariviere, provost and executive vice chancellor at the university. ''The price sensitivity of poor students is causing them to forgo majoring, for example, in business or engineering, and rather sticking with something like history.''
 Private universities do not face the same tuition constraints and for the most part are avoiding the practice, educators say, holding to the traditional idea that college students should be encouraged to get a well-rounded education. 
 Richard Fass, vice president for planning at Pomona, a private liberal arts college in California, said educators there considered it fundamental for students to feel part of the larger college, not segmented by differential costs. ''The entire curriculum is by design available to all students,'' he said.
 Some public university officials say they worry that students who are charged more for their major will stick to the courses in their field to feel that they are getting their money's worth.
 ''I want students in the College of Engineering at Iowa State to take courses in the humanities and to take courses in the social sciences,'' said Mark J. Kushner, the dean of that college. To address problems like climate change, Mr. Kushner said, graduates will need to understand much more than technology. ''That's sociology, that's economics, that's politics, that's public policy.''
 Undergraduate juniors and seniors in the engineering school at Iowa State last year began paying about $500 more annually, he said, and the size of that additional payment is scheduled to rise by $500 a year for at least the next two years. 
 Mr. Kushner said he thought society was no longer looking at higher education as a common good but rather as a way for individuals to increase their earning power.
 ''There was a time, not that long ago, 10 to 15 years ago, that the vast majority of the cost of education at public universities was borne by the state, and that was why tuition was so low,'' he said. ''That was based on the premise that the education of an individual is a public good, that individuals go out and become schoolteachers and businessmen and doctors and lawyers, that makes society better. That's no longer the perception.'' 
 Neither the State University of New York nor the Connecticut State University System use differential pricing, officials say. New Jersey, however, has done so for years, according to a spokesman, Greg Trevor. In the new school year, in-state undergraduates in the general program will pay tuition of $8,541, but engineering and pharmacy students will pay $9,484.80 and business students will pay $8,716.
 Various universities have adopted different versions of differential pricing to try to fight the unintended consequences it may create. Colleges that charge higher tuition for a major like business, engineering or journalism generally allow students outside the field to take some courses in the subject without paying more. 
 ''We do try to encourage crossing disciplines, to get a feel for the world,'' said Randy Kangas, assistant vice president for planning and budgeting at the University of Illinois, where students studying business, chemistry and the life sciences pay higher tuition.
 Most universities with differential tuition use some of the money -- 20 to 25 percent -- for additional financial aid to offset some of the impact. 
 Officials at universities that have recently implemented higher tuition for specific majors say students have supported the move. 
 Students in the business school at the University of Wisconsin, for example, got behind the program because they believed that it would support things like a top-notch faculty. ''It's very important to all the students in the business school to sustain our reputation,'' said Jesse C. Siegelman, 21, who expects to graduate in December 2008. 
 Mr. Siegelman said representatives of 26 of 28 student groups that belong to the school's Undergraduate Student Leadership Council, of which he was president last year, voted to support the tuition proposal.
 In engineering programs, the additional money often goes toward costly laboratory equipment, because students and the companies that will employ them expect graduates to be able to go to work immediately using state of the art tools, said Mr. Lariviere of the University of Kansas.
 ''In many instances,'' he said, ''industry itself is demanding this.'' 
 And in business schools, professors' salaries have risen, with some schools paying starting professors $130,000 or more, said G. Dan Parker III, associate executive vice president of Texas A&M, which he said was considering whether to charge higher tuition to undergraduate students studying business.
 ''The salaries we pay for entering assistant professors on average is probably larger than the average salary for full professors at the university,'' Mr. Parker said of business professors. ''That's how far the pendulum has swung at the business schools, and I sure wish they'd fix it.''
 While several university officials said students in majors that carried higher costs could bear the burden because they would be better paid after graduation, Mr. Lariviere said he was skeptical of that rationale. He pointed out that many people change jobs several times over a career and that a major is a poor predictor of lifetime income. 
 ''Where we have gone astray culturally,'' he said, ''is that we have focused almost exclusively on starting salary as an indicator of life earnings and also of the value of the particular major.''

Leviathan
 The History of Whaling in America. 
 By Eric Jay Dolin.
 Illustrated. 479 pp. 
 W. W. Norton & Company. $27.95.
Let others make humble claims for their subjects. Eric Jay Dolin, the author of ''Leviathan,'' stakes his proudly in the book's opening sentences. ''From the moment the Pilgrims landed until the early 20th century, whaling was a powerful force in the evolution of the country,'' he writes. ''Much of America's culture, economy and in fact its spirit were literally and figuratively rendered from the bodies of whales.'' 
 America: born of whales! 
 ''Leviathan'' is an exhaustive, richly detailed history of industrial American whaling. By the end you may or may not agree with Dolin, but you will certainly know this: Whaling was a bloody, brutal, messy, stinking, dangerous, sometimes lucrative, always high-risk business. 
 Basque whalers plied the waters off Newfoundland as early as the 1540s, and some Native American tribes may have gone whaling long before the Basques; but Dolin's history really begins in the 1620s, when English colonists began butchering whales that beached themselves or washed ashore. As William Morrell, an Episcopal clergyman who arrived in Plymouth in 1623, wrote: ''The mighty whale doth in these harbours lye, / Whose oyle the careful mearchant deare will buy.'' 
 And ''oyle'' was a precious commodity. When boiled, whale blubber produced a highly prized, long-lasting, clean-burning oil, and that oil became one of the New World's earliest exports and remained a staple of international trade for nearly 250 years. 
 The industry's progress was marked by its distance from the beach. Early colonists practiced drift whaling -- essentially, beachcombing for carcasses. In some coastal towns it was finders keepers. In others, town fathers appointed spotters ''to view & espie if there be any whales cast up'' after storms, with the spoils divided among all citizens. 
 Seeing profit in the whale harvest, colonists began shore whaling in the 1650s. Shore whaling involved posting a lookout atop a tall timber pounded into the sand. When the lookout gave the cry (''Whale off!''), the land-based crew pushed out in a small boat and pierced the whale with a harpoon attached to a rope secured to the boat. Then it was hang on for your life. ''A whale barreling along at the surface would take the men on the proverbial Nantucket sleigh ride, a bone-jarring, terrifying and, at times, no doubt exhilarating trip over the waves,'' Dolin writes. When the whale tired, the men rowed up to it and stabbed it with a long steel knife. ''Success would show itself as a geyser of crimson blood gushing from the whale's blowhole, which caused whalemen to cry out, 'Chimney's afire!' '' 
 Given our modern affection for whales, you might wonder if the whalemen felt any pangs of conscience. Probably not. ''There is no doubt that some whalemen marveled at sperm whales when they saw them, and thought about their form and beauty even as they were preparing to kill them,'' Dolin writes. ''But such musings ... were not foremost in the whalemen's minds. When whalemen looked at sperm whales they mainly saw three things that could make them money -- blubber, spermaceti and ambergris.'' (Spermaceti is a waxy substance found in the head cavity of sperm whales; it made excellent candles. Ambergris is part of the whale's intestinal lining; perfumers once used it to stabilize scent.) Dolin, the author of the ''Smithsonian Book of National Wildlife Refuges'' and other works, avoids casting moral judgments, and rightly so. Back in the day, whaling was seen as nothing more than a form of fishing. The author makes it clear that he's chronicling the history of the American whaling industry, not international whaling, which allows him to steer clear of contemporary battles over Japanese and Norwegian whaling practices. 
 That's not to say the old whalers were wise stewards of the resource. By the early 1700s they'd depleted their near-shore whaling grounds, so they began outfitting ships with dozen-strong crews and venturing farther out into the Atlantic. The industry's dominant port was Nantucket, home to a community of savvy, frugal whaling merchants. ''Quakers with a vengeance,'' Herman Melville called them. London's introduction of oil-burning streetlamps in 1736 stoked demand for whale oil. The invention of the spermaceti-oil candle expanded the market further. From the 1710s to the 1740s, Nantucket's annual oil production grew from 600 barrels to 11,250. (One whale could yield 120 to 200 barrels of oil.) Nantucket's whaleboat captains and owners prospered.
 The more whales they killed, the farther they had to sail to find more. Trips once measured in days stretched into weeks and months. Longer expeditions required bigger ships. Nantucket faced competition: New Bedford, with its deeper harbor, offered an attractive alternative to the new deep-draft vessels, which had a hard time crossing Nantucket's notorious sandbar. 
 The industry peaked between the end of the War of 1812 and the beginning of the Civil War, a half century Dolin describes as the golden age of whaling -- the period when, he writes, ''New Bedford overtook Nantucket as the nation's whaling capital, and scores of coastal towns launched their own whaling enterprises hoping to cash in on this lucrative trade. It is when the maniacal Captain Ahab met his match and his destiny in the form of Moby-Dick. It is when the whaling industry spawned most of its greatest stories of human drive, perseverance, success and failure, and when the American whalemen, harpoons in hand, attained mythic status.'' 
 America's fleet was a veritable armada. In 1846, 735 of the world's 900 whaling ships were American. Why? Because, as Dolin explains, ''American whalemen were simply the best at what they did.'' Foreign competition was less of a threat than rival industries. One of the worst disasters to hit American whaling was the gold rush of 1849, which caused hundreds of whalemen to abandon their boats in San Francisco. ''Eastern whaling merchants could do little to stop this hemorrhaging of whaling talent,'' Dolin notes. Apparently it never occurred to the merchants that an improvement of wages and working conditions -- which Dolin documents in all their wretchedness -- might stanch the flow. 
 But golden-age whalers clear-cut the seas. By the 1850s, whale populations were decimated. American whalers became de facto ambassadors, sailing to Japan and Russia and into the Arctic Ocean for their prey. 
 It was crude oil that killed the industry -- and saved the whales from extinction. Oil was discovered in Pennsylvania in 1859, and it quickly became, as Dolin writes, ''so plentiful, so versatile and so cheap that it quickly replaced whale oil in many of its applications.'' By 1862, Pennsylvania was producing three million barrels per year. Whalers managed only 155,000. 
 By the turn of the 19th century, American whaling hung on by a corset thread. The industry stayed alive by selling whale baleen for the ribbing of women's stays. Then in 1907 a Parisian designer introduced a corset-free fashion line. Women abandoned the garments, and that was the end of the American whaling industry.
 It would take courage to approach whaling as a literary subject -- everything ever written about it lives in the shadow of ''Moby-Dick'' -- and ''Leviathan'' doesn't really aspire to those heights. Accurate details and a full historical scope, not drama, are the book's driving virtues. At times that approach results in wonderful insights into whaling: a real taste of the vile life aboard a whaleship and a cleareyed analysis of the cutthroat tactics of the whale-oil trade. At other times, the details become overwhelming. In the end, though, Dolin succeeds admirably at what he sets out to do: tell the story of one of the strangest industries in American history.

HEADLINE: Tapping Equity in an Emergency

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AMERICANS have used the run-up in real estate values in recent years to build financial flexibility for themselves, and many homeowners reasonably believe they can use their home equity for last-minute emergencies.
 But if they wait until an emergency actually strikes to apply for a home-equity loan, they may be in for a painful shock, financial advisers and mortgage executives say. The very nature of some financial emergencies, like unemployment, may disqualify an applicant from a loan.
 A better alternative for many, planners say, is to open a relatively small home-equity line of credit and leave it untouched until a true emergency arises. 
 ''It's always good to have some place to go in an emergency where you can just write a check without asking someone,'' said Dick Bellmer, chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. ''And a home-equity credit line will, in most cases, be the cheapest way to obtain that debt, because it's tax deductible.''
 Home-equity credit lines work much the same way as credit cards, but they also have important advantages. Not only is the interest paid on the loan's balance typically tax deductible, but the interest rates themselves are much lower than those on credit cards. As of late July, many banks offered these loans to borrowers with good credit at interest rates that were equal to the prime rate, or even slightly below -- roughly 8.25 percent. The average interest rate on a credit card, meanwhile, is about 14.5 percent, and it is generally not tax deductible.
 These benefits have not been lost on the millions of homeowners who have taken out home-equity credit lines in recent years. Some have even taken out such loans to pay off their more costly credit-card debts. 
 Most of the time, borrowers have not fallen behind on paying back these loans. According to a recent survey of commercial banks by the American Bankers Association, the delinquency rate on home-equity credit lines is the lowest of any consumer credit category it tracks, at just 0.6 percent.
 That is good news, said Mr. Bellmer, a partner in Deerfield Financial Advisors Inc. in Indianapolis. ''If you abuse one of these, it'll hurt you, because it's tied to something more than just a credit card,'' he said. ''It'll affect your ability to get another mortgage, and all kinds of other things.''
 Assuming homeowners are interested in using a home-equity credit line only as an emergency fund, Mr. Bellmer said, they should look closely at monthly expenses and the sorts of emergencies they might encounter. Self-employed people who do not have disability insurance, for instance, may need a relatively large credit line to protect them for a longer period.
 Home-equity lines come in a number of varieties. Borrowers will find variations in the indexes to which the loan's interest rates are tied, the period over which borrowers may draw from the credit line, and the lender's flexibility when it comes to locking in the interest rate for portions of the credit line.
 Industry executives say that borrowers should try to avoid loans with prepayment penalties. The average homeowner keeps a house for about seven years, and when it's sold, the credit line must be paid off. 
 ''If you already have a good relationship with your bank,'' Mr. Bellmer said, ''you might be able to get the prepayment penalty waived.''

HEADLINE: For Keogh Plans, a Technicality Could Crack a Nest Egg

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN

 BODY:
TENS of thousands of people who expect to realize their dreams of financially secure retirements thanks to hefty balances in their Keogh plans are actually at risk for a tax-related ordeal, financial advisers say. 
 Many self-employed people may have to pay taxes, penalties and interest on money they had thought was safely stashed in a retirement plan, even when their only violation was failure to update their plan's documents to reflect changes in the tax laws. 
 Congress established Keogh plans in 1962 to allow the self-employed to save, tax-deferred, for retirement for themselves and their employees, if they had any. In the 1980s and '90s, Keogh plans surged as Americans became more aware of the need to save money for retirement, thanks in part to the growing popularity of employer-sponsored 401(k) plans. 
 Since then, Congress has passed a number of tax laws, notably the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which strengthened requirements that pension plans not benefit top executives while slighting rank-and-file employees. 
 Many with Keogh plans have no other employees, but the I.R.S. is charged with enforcing the rules, said Bill Fleming, personal finance managing director at PricewaterhouseCoopers's Private Company Services practice in Hartford.
 ''Congress gave them no leeway,'' Mr. Fleming said.
 Mr. Fleming said that people often did not realize they were more than account holders; they were, legally, pension plan administrators. Older plan documents should have been amended to comply with the new laws, but many of the self-employed may have overlooked the provisions. 
 If the Internal Revenue Service audits a retirement plan and discovers that its language is noncompliant under current law, any contributions made to the plan are not tax-deductible. All tax returns for the years affected must be redone, and earnings for the period of the audit, generally three years, are treated as taxable income. In addition, interest and often penalties, as well as taxes, are assessed.
 ''We've seen a scattering of Keogh audits,'' Mr. Fleming said. ''And whenever you see a scattering, you start to get nervous.'' 
 Seymour Goldberg, a member of the I.R.S. Northeast Pension Liaison Group, which comprises 30 practitioners who work with and advise the I.R.S., confirmed that the I.R.S. was examining pension plans, including Keogh plans, for compliance issues. Mr. Goldberg, a senior partner of Goldberg & Goldberg, a law firm in Jericho, N.Y., said the pension group estimated that a third of the Keogh plans, possibly 50,000 to 100,000 plans, are not in compliance with current tax laws. 
 Although the general intent of the changes in pension law in recent years was to protect rank-and-file employees, Mr. Fleming said, the paradox of the Keogh audits is that very small businesses and solo practitioners are at risk. 
 The plans were marketed by banks and brokerage firms in the 1980s and '90s to professionals, business owners, people who consult on the side, outside directors and others who had what was legally termed self-employment income. 
 If the plan documents have not been amended to reflect the language of the new laws, they are deemed noncompliant, and thus the money in them does not qualify as tax-deferred. 
 The banks and brokerage firms were required to mailed letters to account holders telling them they needed to sign the proper legal forms, but many people apparently ignored them or mistakenly tossed them out as junk mail. They kept investing annually in their Keogh plans by putting in the amounts calculated by their tax preparers or software. They were seemingly unaware of what Mr. Fleming called ''a bunch of complicated rules they didn't understand and probably violated by accident.''
 Now, the I.R.S. is beginning to notice. Any pension plan with assets of $100,000 or more, or that once had that much, is required to file a Form 5500 or Form 5500-EZ each year, and the I.R.S. is stepping up its audits of them. 
 One man in his 80s came to Mr. Fleming for help when he received an audit notice. He was retired and drawing down his plan, which had little money left in it. 
 He no longer had the plan documents, which the I.R.S. demanded he produce, and the brokerage firm with which he opened the plan had been involved in several mergers over the years. A search in the surviving firm could not produce the documents. So he had to pay the taxes, interest and penalties assessed in the audit; in his case, the amounts were small. 
 ''Big companies have advisers, consultants and plan administrators,'' Mr. Fleming said, but noted that ''no one is looking out for the little guy.''
 Mr. Goldberg has spoken to professional groups on the issue and written books on pension law that both the American Bar Association and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants sell to their members. He has also been asked for advice on the matter by other professionals and their clients. 
 Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Fleming recommend that people who have Keogh accounts terminate them and roll the assets over into a SEP, for simplified employee pension, or a SEP-IRA. Keogh plans were popular because they allowed self-employed people to put away more money tax-deferred than an I.R.A. permitted, for example, Mr. Fleming said. However, because of the 2001 tax law, SEPs now allow equally generous tax-deferred savings of as much as $45,000 this year, depending on income. 
 But there is a big obstacle for people with noncompliant Keoghs. The money in them is regarded as tainted and will remain so even if rolled over into a SEP, so the Keogh needs to be made compliant retroactively. ''There is a whole scheme where you can confess your sins and beg the I.R.S. for forgiveness and absolution,'' Mr. Fleming said, adding that it is expensive and time-consuming.
 Mr. Goldberg called the procedure cumbersome. It means assembling the original plan documents and all the amendments that the bank or brokerage offered for its prototype documents; filling out forms in a 70-page document, Rev.Proc.2006-27; and paying a $750 fee to the I.R.S. for plans covering 20 people or fewer. Most people will need a pension consultant to do the paperwork, he said, and that could cost several thousand dollars. 
 IF a business has employees and has not contributed to the Keogh plan for them, that is a serious violation, Mr. Goldberg said. But if the only problem is a technical one -- that is, the plan's language has not been amended for current law and all the paperwork submitted is in order -- approval is assured as of the date the application is filed, although the process takes about a year.
 This voluntary compliance, while both daunting and expensive, keeps the plan tax-deferred and avoids the taxes, penalties and interest that result if a noncompliant plan is audited. 
 ''The small person is being hit with a sledgehammer,'' Mr. Goldberg said. ''There are 10,000 pages of law. Congress needs to simplify it. The law doesn't lend itself to the small employer.''

HEADLINE: The Profit and The Pauper

BYLINE: By Joe Nocera. 
Joe Nocera writes the Talking Business column for The Times.

 BODY:
I GRADUATED from college about $8,000 in debt.
Yes, I know, with English majors now emerging from graduate school saddled with as much as $100,000 worth of student loans, my puny amount seems almost laughable. But it was a different era -- 1974 -- and, at least to me, it was real money. 
 I was exactly the kind of person the student loan program is intended to help; without those loans, I could never have afforded to go to a private university. But I was also the kind of college graduate who was always going to struggle to pay the loans back. I entered the job market in the teeth of a recession. I had to ask for a one-year ''hardship'' delay because I couldn't find a job. And when I finally did find work, it was fulfilling but low-paying. 
 Consequently, I was constantly falling behind on my payments. The bank that administered my federally guaranteed loans would send a stern notice whenever I got too far behind, which would prompt me to cobble together a few payments by skipping some other bill. Then I would start falling behind again. 
 Though I found the situation onerous at the time, what strikes me now is how benign it actually was. My bank probably didn't make a dime on me. It never raised my interest rate as punishment, nor did I ever have to pay any late fees. My chronic tardiness didn't even affect my credit rating. And had I defaulted, I would not have had my wages garnished, or been stuck with the debt if I had filed for bankruptcy. All of which can happen today. 
 ''Student loans have become big business,'' says Barmak Nassirian, the executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers -- and high interest rates and hefty late fees are part of what makes it so profitable. Many a student comes out of college only to discover that his loan has become a noose around his neck. 
 For some months now, the news about student loans has largely been about scandal -- how lenders have curried favor with financial aid officers to get on their ''preferred lender'' lists, for instance. Bills in both the House and the Senate aim to reform the system. But there is a larger, perhaps sadder story here: How did this critically important social program become so unmoored from its original intent, which was to help poor and middle-class students pay for college? To put it another way, why did student loans become more about shareholders than about students?
 GEORGE MILLER, a Democratic Congressman from California, has been obsessing about student loans for a long time. ''If you were going to start this program all over again,'' he says ''you would go back to the concept that this is a service, and an investment, provided by the federal government. And you would probably go back to a direct loan program, funded with some sort of revolving fund. That is how the G.I. bill worked. But that is now viewed as foreign and wrongheaded. Now we have this idea that there has to be a business model.''
 Representative Miller is the author of the bill passed by the House earlier this month. It calls for many useful changes. It raises the amount a student can borrow, which is necessary because the cost of college has risen so dramatically. Over the next five years it cuts interest rates in half, to 3.4 percent, for the neediest students. It insures that no more than 15 percent of a graduate's income would have to go toward repayment -- an important idea, since recent graduates shouldn't have to choose a job based solely on how much it pays. 
 But let's be honest here. No reform legislation is going to change the essential nature of any business, and student loans are no exception. 
 Big lenders will see their subsidies lowered, but they will still be guaranteed big profits. They will still be able to charge those late fees and higher interest rates when borrowers get in trouble. And they will still be able to pursue deadbeats practically into the grave, since people who file for bankruptcy have to keep paying back their student loans -- an astonishing exception to the bankruptcy law that lenders lobbied for, and won, in the 1990s. The student loan business will still be, well, a business. 
 The critical markers in the evolution of the student loan begin, really, with the decision to offer federally guaranteed loans through banks and other financial institutions. It didn't have to be done that way. Congress could have decided that only the government could lend taxpayer dollars. But without a middleman, the loans would be listed as outstanding on the government's books, thus increasing the federal deficit. It was far more politically attractive to use banks to make the loans, and then guarantee them with the taxpayers' money.
 Even with the guarantee, banks were not terribly excited about administering a loan program for college students with uncertain job prospects. So the government tried to make lending even more attractive. It subsidized the interest rates. In the case of a default, it guaranteed that banks would get back not just the principal but the interest. It took all the risk out of lending.
 And to get more loans into the hands of students, in 1972 the government established a quasi-government entity, the Student Loan Marketing Association, now known as Sallie Mae. Sallie's role was to buy up student loans from banks, freeing capital for yet more loans. It could also market and service loans, but it could not originate them. Although always a corporation -- much the way Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have both government status and corporate status -- ''it didn't go all out in search of the next buck,'' Mr. Nassarian says.
 In the 1990s, two important events took place. First, Congress finally decided to lend directly to students. The Direct Loan Program was an immediate hit; within a few years, it had 40 percent of the market. But this was not the kind of G.I. bill, revolving-fund loan that Representative Miller envisions; its intent was to minimize the cost to the taxpayer, not to the student. So it had many of the late fees and higher interest penalties that private lenders were allowed to impose, and the interest rate was the same, 6.8 percent. Shortly after the program passed, the Republicans won both houses of Congress, and began fighting a rear-guard action against it.
 Second, Sallie Mae broke away from the federal government. Its chief executive was an aggressive, profit-oriented man named Albert L. Lord, who feared that the Direct Loan Program would hurt Sallie. Privatization would enable him to fight back. 
 Once it had the ability to originate loans, Sallie devised marketing plans, sought ways to undercut the government lending program and began convincing college financial aid officers to give it special preference. It wasn't too long before private lenders won back some of the market share they had lost to the Direct Loan Program; they now control about 75 percent of the market. 
 As for Sallie Mae, by early 2006, it controlled 35 percent of the federally guaranteed student loan market; No. 2, Citibank, had less than 10 percent. Sallie is also the dominant player in the private student loan market -- that is, loans that are not federally guaranteed. Between the two, it originated $23.4 billion in loans last year alone, and made more than $1 billion in profits.
 ''Sallie revolutionized the industry,'' says Representative Miller, and he doesn't mean that as a compliment. It imposed fees and penalties that added costs when students were already having trouble repaying loans -- while increasing Sallie's profits. It bought its own collection agency. It lobbied to make it nearly impossible for borrowers to escape their student debt. (It was aided along the way by occasional reports of the wealthy reneging on their student debt, thus saddling the taxpayer with the bill.) 
 On one level, what Sallie Mae did under Mr. Lord's leadership was consistent with the times. The dotcom bubble was in full flower. The only thing Americans seemed to care about was whether a company's stock price was rising. And Sallie's was certainly doing that -- more than 1,400 percent between 1995 and 2006. But in our obsession with the market, we had forgotten that this stock's performance resulted in no small part from Sallie Mae -- like many of its competitors -- making money on the backs of struggling college graduates. It was a little like the credit card business: the ''best'' customers aren't the ones who pay off their monthly charges on time; they're the ones who can't. For the student loan industry, the best customers are the students who take on more debt than they can handle to get through school. What's been lost is the idea that student loans are a service with benefits that transcend the financial.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Lord, who stepped down as C.E.O. in 2006 and is currently chairman, was getting rich; between 1999 and 2004, his pay package was worth $235 million, most of it in stock options. In April, Sallie Mae agreed to be bought by a private equity consortium for $26 billion. When the deal closes, as it is expected to in the fall, Mr. Lord will walk off with an additional $135 million.
 No company likes to think of itself as rapacious, and Sallie Mae is no exception. When I spoke to the company spokesman, Tom Joyce, he portrayed Sallie Mae as a company that is doing well by doing good. 
 Sallie dominates the marketplace because people like its products, he said. If wages are garnished to pay back a college loan, that is Congress's fault, because Congress passed the law. ''The private sector is more efficient in making and collecting loans,'' he said. ''When is the last time you had good service from the government?''
 As for the pending legislation, Mr. Joyce said that cutting government subsidies will whittle Sallie's already thin margins to nearly nothing, and student borrowers will wind up bearing extra costs. ''Let's be careful of the unintended consequences,'' he said. When I asked him about the social goals -- as opposed to the business goal -- of lending to college students, he replied, ''Universities are huge businesses with huge endowments. Shouldn't their vendors be in business, too?'' 
 It's good that Congress is wrestling with the problem of student loans. Let's hope a decent law emerges. But let's also keep in mind that student loans went from being a service to a business because that's the way the larger society has evolved over the past few decades. And until society changes, we can hardly expect the student loan business to change. 
 It's a sobering lesson in the limits of capitalism. As a culture, we praise the ability of the market to create the proper incentives and do more good than not. And mostly that's true. But there are some things that are too important to entrust to the profit motive. Shouldn't paying for a college education be one of them?

HEADLINE: Your Energy Use Measured Daily And on Facebook

 BODY:
Clive Thompson in the Aug. 15 issue of Wired magazine came up with a creative way to save energy. 
 To improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions, we first need to make omnipresent the hidden facts about our usage -- paint them on the world around us. ...
 There's already solid evidence that feedback mechanisms can change eco-behavior. Think about how hybrid-car owners become obsessed with the dashboard display showing an on-the-fly calculation of gas mileage. The result? They change the way they drive, specifically trying to maximize mileage. It becomes a game, an enjoyable challenge, complete with quantifiable personal bests. 
 Here's an even wilder idea: How about making our energy use visible to everyone? Imagine if your daily consumption were part of your Facebook page -- and broadcast to your friends by RSS feed. ... 
 The hope is that it could spawn a cascade of conservation. It's fun seeing your personal energy tab go down by kilowatts -- but just imagine watching the world's usage plunge by terawatts or petawatts. It would be like a global Prius, with millions worldwide tweaking the Earth for maximum mileage. Now that's fun.
 Test Tube Demographics
 In its latest issue, The Economist offered a way to stop the declining population in many countries: encouraging greater use of assisted reproductive technologies, or ARTS.
 I.V.F. does seem to be keeping up the numbers in at least one country. Tina Jensen of the University of Southern Denmark has just finished a study of more than 700,000 Danish women. She found that young women in Denmark have a significantly lower natural conception rate than in past decades. ... Whatever the cause, she also found that the effect has been almost completely compensated for by an increasing use of ARTS. Denmark's native population is more or less stable, but some 3.9 percent of babies born there in 2003 (the most recent year for which figures are available) were the result of I.V.F. The comparable figure for another northern European country, Britain was 1.5 percent.
 Without I.V.F., then, the number of Danes would be shrinking fast.
 Lobbying From Turkey
 Michael Crowley, a senior editor at The New Republic, offers up what might be a huge battle in Washington. And it's a very old issue, fueled by money from lobbyists.
 Few people would place the Armenian genocide on their top 10 -- or even top 1,000 -- list of the day's pressing issues. In fact, many Americans would likely be at a loss to explain who or what the Armenians are, much less what happened to them 90 years ago. Not so in Washington. For the past several years, U.S. representatives, lobbyists, and foreign emissaries have been locked in a vicious struggle over a resolution in Congress that would officially deem as genocide the massacre of up to 1.5 million ethnic Armenians in the Ottoman Empire....
 Even more striking than the historic Turkish-Armenian hatred festering in the halls of Congress, however, is the way Washington's political elites are cashing in on it. ...Turkey showers Washington with political operators more than happy to argue their case--for the right price. Few niches of Washington lobbying are as lucrative as the foreign racket, which explains why more than 1,800 lobbyists are currently registered to represent more than 660 overseas clients. Thus the Turks have found no shortage of willing pitchmen. Turkey currently maintains expensive contracts with at least four different Washington lobbying and p.r. firms. The result is that unsuspecting congressmen and staffers frequently find themselves badgered by well-heeled Turkish emissaries. ...
 Strange as it may be to find a World War I massacre on the 2007 Washington agenda, even more bizarre is the possibility that it may precipitate an international crisis. ... The Turks, should their lobbying firepower fail to stop the genocide bill from moving forward, have an even mightier weapon to brandish: the war in Iraq. As they did in 2000, the Turks are hinting they will shut down Incirlik, a far more dire threat now that Incirlik supplies U.S. forces occupying Iraq. Administration officials also fear Turkey might close the Habur Gate, a border point through which U.S. supplies flow into northern Iraq. In an April letter to congressional leaders, [Condoleezza] Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates bluntly warned that a House resolution ''could harm American troops in the field [and] constrain our ability to supply our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: How Ford Brought Power to the People

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE Age of Speed turns 75 this year along with the Little Deuce Coupe that ushered it in, democratizing horsepower and providing the clay from which countless hot rods would be molded.
Three decades before the heyday of the muscle car, Henry Ford inadvertently invented the hot rod by bolting a 65-horsepower V-8 engine into a light, attractive body. His breakthrough cost $460 in its most basic form, a two-door roadster, only $50 more than the same car powered by a four-cylinder engine. Ford figured that even in the depths of the Depression, this was within reach of the working class.
 Six million Americans flocked to Ford dealerships on the announcement day. 
 Yet the car, which is now seen as a 20th century icon and one of the industry's most significant models, was not a financial success. After an initial spurt of orders, harsh reality set in: most Americans couldn't afford lunch, let alone installment payments, so Ford's 1932 sales were barely half of the previous year's volume. 
 Over 10 months of production, 178,749 Ford Model 18 V-8s were manufactured, along with about 75,000 Model Bs that had the same body but a 4-cylinder engine. Both versions of the '32 Ford, each offered in 14 body styles, were lumped together under a common label: the Deuce. 
 After World War II, returning servicemen found that Deuces were cheap and plentiful used cars; that the flathead V-8 engine could be easily tweaked to produce more horsepower; and that the clean design lent itself to modification. Hot-rodders smitten by the combination made the Deuce the holy grail of home-built concoctions.
 ''The Deuce won the hot rodder's admiration because it was the first car that was both affordable and fast right out of the box,'' said Pete Chapouris, a hot-rodder for 50 years and the president of the SoCal Speed Shop in Pomona, Calif.
 To check the vital signs of the seminal Deuce as it turns 75, I test-drove an original '32 Ford V-8 De Luxe Roadster owned by Lynn Stringer of Northville, Mich.
 Motoring sedately along park roads near Mr. Stringer's home in suburban Detroit, the Deuce copes without the trappings now considered necessary. Climate control is achieved by tipping the windshield open to flush the cockpit's heat with a cool breeze. Video entertainment is a soothing sky and a cloud show reflected in the rear of a headlamp shell. The soundtrack is a V-8 murmur so subdued that conversation with my chaperone was not impeded. Mr. Stringer's Deuce roadster elicited so many smiles and thumbs-up salutes that we felt like Marines in a Memorial Day parade.
 The '32 Ford was the most fruitful collaboration between Henry Ford, the homespun industrialist who put the world on wheels, and his son, Edsel, who was president of the Ford Motor Company from 1919 until his death in 1943.
 By the late 1920s Chevrolet had passed Ford, whose Model T had lingered too long, in sales. Chevy countered Ford's new Model A of 1928 by introducing a ''Six for the price of a Four'' the next year. The '32 V-8 was Ford's counterpunch: it cost only $15 more than the Chevy Six and $35 less than a four-cylinder Plymouth.
 Henry Ford's other foe was the Great Depression, which drove the city of Detroit to bankruptcy, left half the local workforce unemployed and slashed car production to 15 percent of capacity. He hoped that an exciting new Ford might draw cash being hoarded under mattresses, driving the country out of the economic ditch.
 Edsel Ford brought an eye for design to the project. Henry's son, more urbane than his father, borrowed visual touches from the company's luxury division to give the '32 the look of a baby Lincoln. A streamlined radiator shell, fluted bumpers and bright accents made the new model a standout.
 While V-8s were available in several luxury models, no such engine had ever been offered in a car designed for the working class. Henry relished the challenge of inventing a V-8 for the masses. He integrated several components into a single engine-block casting to cut manufacturing steps; simplified fuel, lubrication and ignition systems also cut costs.
 But rushing the new V-8 to market proved a mistake, with engine failures attributed to fragile pistons, inadequate cooling and marginal lubrication. Once the bugs were ironed out, though, customers raved about the Deuce's speed. 
 Letters of appreciation came from the dark side. Clyde Barrow wrote, ''For sustained speed and freedom from trouble, the Ford has got every other car skinned.'' A letter to Ford bearing John Dillinger's signature, of doubtful authenticity, bragged, ''I can make any other car take a Ford's dust.''
 Hot-rodders soon discovered that 65 horsepower and a 75-mile-an-hour top speed were merely the start for the V-8. On dry lake beds, racers in California clocked nearly 130 m.p.h. before World War II. The flathead V-8 was also the engine of choice on dragstrips and oval tracks.
 Mr. Stringer joined the movement in 1955 as a teenager in Steubenville, Ohio. ''I started buying any car magazine containing '32 Ford photos or articles,'' he said. ''While attending Purdue University, I drove a hot rod consisting of a Ford Model A body on a '32 frame with Chevy V-8 power. I finally got my first Deuce, a 5-window coupe, in 1959.''
 Mr. Stringer joined the Ford Motor Company in 1963 and spent most of his 35 years there as a truck engineer. By 1968, his tastes had shifted from hot rods to factory-original Deuces; he has owned and restored a dozen or so over the years. 
 ''The '32 has always appealed to me because of its lines and smooth look,'' he said. 
 In 1978, Mr. Stringer purchased the roadster I drove for $7,000. After an eight-year rebuild using still-available new parts and period-correct medium maroon paint, this car has won top honors at several prestigious shows, including ones organized by the Early Ford V-8 Club of America. With less than 50,000 miles and only 500 miles since restoration, it's the closest thing there is to a brand-new '32 Ford. Mr. Stringer estimates the value of his Deuce at $125,000.
 In contrast to most old cars, no putt-putt or wheezing emanates from under a Deuce V-8's hood. The engine starts quickly and chuckles contentedly after the press of a floor button. The tall shift lever pokes straight out of the floor with no boot to shroud its workings. Shifting is easy as long as you heed the wide horizontal gate of the H-pattern and don't hurry gear changes.
 Of course, the driving dynamics are antiquated. The steering is either heavy (during parking) or in need of constant correction (to take up slack in the system while cruising). The brakes groan at low speeds and lack the stopping power for freeway driving. Bumps provoke a cacophony of squeaks and rattles despite the extensive rubber insulation added to the 1932 model. The rudimentary suspension reacts to big jolts with a few cycles of hobby-horse motion.
 When motivated by a quick jab of throttle, the Deuce drives smartly away from the past. The V-8's surge forward is modest by today's standards, but on the 1930's thrill scale it probably rivaled rising hemlines, airplane rides and the end of Prohibition. The first-gear kick carries you to 25 miles an hour, and second is worth 40. At 75 years of age, the Deuce is still a driver's delight. Several hundred '32 Fords are expected to converge on Dearborn, Mich., on Aug. 9-12 to celebrate the Deuce's 75th anniversary. Information is available at deuce75.com.

HEADLINE: A Lesson in European Economy

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
TESTED 2007 Chrysler 300C CRD 
 WHAT IS IT? Full-size rear-drive four-door sedan.
 HOW MUCH? Not for sale in the United States. Estimated base price, $28,500.
 WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A Mercedes-Benz 3-liter turbodiesel V-6 (215 horsepower, 376 pound feet of torque); five-speed automatic transmission.
IS IT THIRSTY? Hardly, for a car this big. By European test standards, combined mileage is 36 percent better than its V-6 gasoline counterpart. 
 ALTERNATIVES Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec, $52,325. THE day after a diesel-powered Audi racecar won the 24 Hours of Le Mans last month -- for the second year running -- was the perfect occasion for my drive in a European-specification diesel family sedan. Sure, the Chrysler 300C CRD I drove around northern New Jersey was not nearly as fast as the winning Audi R10, and I certainly didn't cover as many miles, but in the long run that brooding sedan may be prove as influential as Audi's all-conquering racecar.
 The wonderfulness of Europe's diesels -- half of all new cars sold there are diesel-powered -- is an old story by now. Vacationers returning from the Continent may whine that the locals are rude and American dollars nearly worthless, but they'll be just as likely to sing the praises of their rental car. 
 Many, blissfully ignorant of the E.P.A.'s byzantine regulations, ask, Why can't we get these? I doubt that French tourists go home from a week at Disney World with the same degree of longing for the Sebring they got from Hertz. 
 Hearing the 300C CRD start when I picked it up at the parking garage after work, I wouldn't have immediately known it was a diesel by the sound alone, though the enormous lettering on its flanks made the point. The 300C CRD has less invested in noise containment than an E-Class Benz diesel, it would seem, but it is still quite tolerable.
 There was none of the sooty discharge from the tailpipe one might see from a vintage Oldsmobile diesel, should one of those still be running somewhere. A subdued clatter became notable only at stoplights, and then just enough to make me glance at the mirror expecting to find a heavy-duty pickup on my bumper. 
 Driving the Chrysler, a demonstration vehicle making the rounds courtesy of Bosch, the supplier of its fuel injection system, required some recalibration of my expectations. A foot-to-the-floor merge onto the Interstate brought the speedometer to 120 before I knew it, but that was in kilometers an hour, just about the prevailing pace of traffic. The smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission clicked off full-throttle gear changes at 3,700 r.p.m., appropriate for a diesel but unexpectedly early by gas-engine standards, where shifts come at 5,000 or so.
 The 300C CRD (for common-rail diesel) has a 215-horsepower Mercedes-Benz V-6 under the hood, essentially the engine from the E320, rather than the gasoline V-6 or V-8 engines Chrysler offers in the United States. DaimlerChrysler has already done a similar transplant with the Jeep Grand Cherokee CRD; in that case, the diesel costs about $3,000 more than the gasoline V-6 model.
 The appeal of a diesel is economy, and the 300C CRD has plenty to offer: in the European mileage ratings, it returns 26 m.p.g in town and 43 on the highway, compared with 18/34 for its twin powered by a 3.5-liter gas V-6. (The American version is rated 19/27 on the E.P.A.'s test.) 
 That's not bad, considering the diesel produces nearly as much torque as the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. At the time I drove it, diesel fuel was selling for $2.99 a gallon in New Jersey, about a nickel less than midgrade gas and 30 cents cheaper than premium. 
 There may be some measure of romantic charm to living with a small and relatively low-powered car for a week or two while on vacation, but it's quite another matter to use one in a home-field context. I have driven other Euro models that were touring the States, most memorably a Smart ForTwo, and they were all a treat, but the novelty might have worn thin in short order. Using the large and familiar Chrysler 300 in my own neighborhood offered a better basis for comparison. 
 This much is certain: The sedan I drove was not quite ready for American drivers, at least not without a little retuning. The 4,200-pound car was lazy away from stoplights, finally coming to life at about 2,000 r.p.m. and muscling its way to 60 m.p.h in 7.6 seconds, according to DaimlerChrysler. At a highway cruise, though, the response was perfectly acceptable, and while I could not pass all the cars in the left lane, I took comfort in rolling by a lot of filling stations. NORMAN MAYERSOHN

HEADLINE: When, Exactly, Is a Barn a Suburban Eyesore?

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER. 
E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Bridgehampton 

 BODY:
BILLY BABINSKI is the first to say he could be making more money and working fewer hours doing something other than farming.
But since he was a boy, Mr. Babinski, 28, has had a passion for tilling the soil that his father, grandfather and several other generations of his family worked. At age 5, he and his older sister, Lisa, started selling home-grown produce at a small stand by the family's Wainscott home. 
 After graduating from the University of Delaware in 2001 with a degree in agricultural economics, Mr. Babinski couldn't think of anything he would rather do than return to the family farm. A row cropper, he grows corn, tomatoes, pumpkins and sunflowers on close to 70 acres in three locations, some owned, some rented. 
 ''There is something to be said about enjoying what you do,'' Mr. Babinski said. ''There's a lot of satisfaction to see you have raised something that other people come to get.'' 
 But the hurdles for a young farmer can be formidable. Mr. Babinski supplements his income by mowing lawns. There is the weather to contend with and deer that must be fenced out. Then there are the neighbors who sued him because of a barn he wanted to build. 
 Houses ring a 3.23-acre plot of farmland that Mr. Babinski received from his father, William Babinski, shortly after graduating from college. The land, then valued at about $12,000 an acre, was reserved for agricultural use when his father subdivided half of 6.5 acres into four residential lots. 
 Corn is growing on more than two-thirds of that 3.23-acre plot, which is hidden from Lumber Lane down a gravel and dirt driveway. At the center is a new brown and coffee-colored 3,420-square-foot metal barn crowned with two cupolas topped with weathervanes. 
 Billy Babinski finished putting up the $170,000 barn in December, betting he would prevail in a lawsuit seven of his neighbors filed against him and Southampton Town, trying to prevent the barn, for storing farm equipment, from being built. 
 ''It is just the nature of the beast,'' Mr. Babinski said, gazing from the barn across the landscape to the neighboring houses. ''It is going to be close to somebody.''
 In a decision earlier this month, a State Supreme Court justice upheld Mr. Babinski's right to have the barn. Justice Jeffrey Arlen Spinner wrote that the court was ''somewhat mystified'' by the neighbors' complaint. 
 ''It seems totally inconsistent to own property adjacent to or nearby an Agricultural Reserve, and consider construction of a modern barn, or the appearance of farm machinery along the driveway of such Agricultural Reserve, as not contemplated,'' Justice Spinner said in his decision. 
 David E. Eagan, Mr. Babinski's lawyer, said that ''land use out here is blood sport.'' 
 Homeowners are under the impression that land reserved for agricultural use ''will be lying fallow,'' Mr. Eagan said. It can be used for agricultural activities, ''and therein lies the rub,'' he said.
 According to the state Agriculture and Markets Law, Mr. Eagan said, a farm operation may consist of parcels of owned or rented land that may be contiguous or noncontiguous.
 Kathryn Dalli, a lawyer for the neighbors, said that a decision about appealing had not been made. 
 ''The farmers are making out like bandits,'' Ms. Dalli said, referring to money made selling land for development and getting permission to subdivide in exchange for keeping a percentage of the land for agricultural use. ''No one wanted to prevent him from farming this piece, but the idea of having a storage facility with heavy machinery on this piece of property was not something that was contemplated or necessary.''
 Inside the barn, Mr. Babinski keeps a trailer, a pumpkin stand, bales of hay, a plow, a harrow, grain drills and a large mower. Farming on fragmented segments of land makes it necessary to keep the equipment centrally located, he said. As a concession to the neighbors, he agreed not to leave any farm equipment outside. 
 Joseph Gergela, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau, said the squabble represented a clash between suburban and farm values. ''If people really want to have agriculture,'' he said, ''they have to be able to tolerate that we need a building, we may need a greenhouse, we may need a barn, we may need a farm stand.''
 Mr. Babinski said he put his barn on that lot because he owned it. Had he erected the barn on his father's Wainscott acreage, he said, ''there was no guarantee that I would even be able to afford to keep it'' if his father died. 
 Still, Mr. Babinski acknowledged that having land in his family gave him ''a head start.'' His grandmother gave him eight acres. His father is in the process of transferring to him 20 acres of agricultural reserve land, recently appraised at $71,000 an acre. (Last year, the Town of East Hampton paid $7 million to the elder Mr. Babinski for the development rights. He retained the building rights to an additional four acres.) 
 ''To work and make that money with your hands is almost impossible,'' Billy Babinski said. ''You are not going to go out and buy that and grow tomatoes. You are not going to live long enough to pay it back.''

HEADLINE: Stranded Palestinians May Get to Gaza

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, July 28 

 BODY:
For seven weeks now, up to 6,000 Palestinians trying to return to their homes in the Gaza Strip have been stranded in Egypt, objects of a political struggle between the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah involving Israel and Egypt.
 But there finally appears to be a deal, opposed by Hamas, to let them return, beginning with about 100 on Sunday, with more to follow during the week, Palestinian, Egyptian and Israeli officials said Saturday. 
 The Palestinians, some of whom had gone to Egypt or elsewhere for medical care or schooling, have been stuck in Rafah, an Egyptian border town, or nearby El Arish because the border crossing between Egypt and Gaza has been shut since June 9. Several hundred, with little money, have been living in harsher conditions in the desert, cared for by various international aid agencies.
 The Rafah border crossing, like the separate Karni crossing for goods between Israel and Gaza, was closed because of the fighting in June between Fatah and Hamas. After the Hamas rout of Fatah and takeover of Gaza, those main crossings for people, in Rafah's case, and goods, in Karni's, have been kept shut by Egypt and Israel to isolate Hamas. The closure has had the quiet support of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, who fired the Hamas government and installed a new one in the West Bank led by an independent economist, Salam Fayyad, whose authority Hamas refuses to recognize.
 Hamas has insisted that Egypt and Israel abide by a crossings agreement negotiated by the Bush administration and reopen Rafah and Karni. Hamas has said that it will not allow Kerem Shalom -- a border crossing into Gaza on Israeli territory but where Gaza, Egypt and Israel meet -- to be used for people, because Israel will control who may enter or exit from Gaza. That is how Israel wants it, because Hamas officials have been able to bring in millions of dollars with them unchecked through the Rafah crossing, even though it was monitored by European Union officials and by Israelis on a video link.
 The plight of the stranded Palestinians may be resolved, but not the larger issue. According to Riad Maliki, speaking Saturday for the Fayyad government in Ramallah, Israel will approve the names of those entering Gaza on lists prepared by the Palestinians. Those stranded will cross from Egypt into Israel at the Al Oja cargo crossing south of Rafah, Egyptian officials said Saturday, then be bused to the Erez crossing with Gaza controlled by Israel.
 About 100 on a list of 627 people approved by Israel will cross Sunday and the remainder on Monday, the Egyptians said, with more to follow.
 Ashraf al-Ajrami, minister for prisoners affairs in Ramallah, said Saturday, ''Due to the absence of Palestinian security forces at Rafah crossing, and amid Egyptian, Israeli and European refusals to reopen the crossing, we agreed with the Israelis to let the people cross at an Israeli crossing.''
 Hamas denounced the deal, because it bypasses Rafah. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza, Sami Abu Zuhri, said: ''There is only the Rafah border crossing. The use of any other border crossing increases Israeli control over the Gaza Strip.'' Hamas has fired mortar shells on Kerem Shalom to try to prevent its use, and may try to do the same toward Erez.
 In an indication of Fatah's lack of interest in opening Gaza for ordinary passage of goods and people, thereby easing pressure on Hamas, Palestinian Authority representatives at the United Nations have been working to block a Security Council presidential statement criticizing the ''humanitarian situation'' in Gaza and calling for the Gaza crossings to be opened immediately, according to the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz. Qatar, which is considered close to Hamas, drafted the statement, which is nonbinding but requires consensus among the Council's members.
 Gazans have been unable to export a single item since Karni was shut July 12, though Israel has allowed vital imports. Israeli officials insist that they only have security concerns about Karni, but also say they will not deal with Hamas. A Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mark Regev, said that Israel was open to ''creative solutions,'' including the use of a private Turkish company to operate the Gazan side of Karni. But Israel and Mr. Abbas insist that Hamas must have no control over the crossing at all, which Hamas rejects.
 Later on Saturday, Israel killed two Palestinian gunmen from Al Aksa Martyrs Brigades of Fatah as they tried to plant explosives and fire mortars near the Israel-Gaza border. Abu Thaer, a Gaza spokesman for the brigades, confirmed the attempted attack, saying it was a response to efforts by Fatah and Mr. Fayyad to drop the principle of ''armed resistance'' against Israel.

HEADLINE: An Apology From Albany

BYLINE: By ELIOT SPITZER. 
Eliot Spitzer is the governor of New York.

 BODY:
Albany
 WE made mistakes.
 Though two independent investigations proved that no illegal activity occurred on my watch, it is crystal clear that what members of my administration did was wrong -- no ifs, ands or buts. 
 I have apologized to Joe Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and now I want to apologize to all New Yorkers.
 What you've been reading about in the papers and watching on television this week is not what we are about. In fact, it represents just the opposite.
 On my first day in office, I brought my staff together and told them what our guiding principles must be: ''First, we're going to fight for what we believe in. And second, we're going to maintain the highest ethical standards while doing it.''
 Over the past few weeks, two members of my administration forgot that second principle -- creating an appearance that the State Police were being used inappropriately. 
 As soon as this became clear, we acted immediately and decisively, suspending one of my longtime advisers indefinitely and transferring the other out of the governor's office. These steps were not taken lightly. Both of these people have served New York with distinction for decades.
 But the message was simple: even though they didn't break the law, they forgot what we were about, and that won't be tolerated. 
 The worst thing that could happen now would be for this to stop our progress, preventing us from building on our many successes of the past six months: health insurance for every child; historic investment in our schools tied to accountability; the largest property tax cut in history; ethics, lobbying and campaign finance reform; breaking the impasse at ground zero; and a 20 percent cut in workers' compensation rates that will save New York businesses $1 billion and make our state more competitive.
 Albany had long been mired in gridlock, but we are changing that. Working together with the Senate and Assembly, we have managed to make remarkable progress -- and we are on the brink of so much more.
 There are two ways this can go.
 We can get bogged down in partisan politics that serve only to distract us from the business at hand -- the kind of head-hunting that we're beginning to see for people in my administration who were cleared by these investigations.
 Or we can move forward and pick up where we left off, addressing the long list of issues and challenges that matter to all New Yorkers -- which are just as important today as they were last week.
 So let us keep our eye on the ball and focus our energy and our resources on the needs of New Yorkers -- fighting for a revitalized economy, more jobs, lower health care costs, better schools and lower taxes.
 We will renew those two guiding principles I spoke about on my first day in office. 
 We will continue to fight vigorously to change the status quo on behalf of all New Yorkers. I'm never going to apologize for that. But we must recognize that this effort will succeed only if our means for changing the status quo are as honorable as our ends.

HEADLINE: The Hedge Fund Class and the French Revolution

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LET'S start with the obvious. Hedge funds have created a terribly wealthy new class. Although the data is overwhelming that the mass of hedge funds have not been outperforming the market after fees, money still pours into them. This has often made their proprietors terribly rich. 
 Somehow, by some alchemy of brilliant tax lawyers, these people are paying long-term capital gains rates of 15 percent on their compensation (even though much of their pay is tied to trades with holding periods that last seconds). Doctors and lawyers and writers and actors pay about two times that amount. 
 Then there are the private equity people. They buy and sell companies, usually with other people's money. They put up a tiny slice of their own capital and multiply it with investments from pension funds, very wealthy families and foreign government investment authorities, and they buy companies. They shake the companies up, cut spending, cut reserves and then resell them to us patsies in the public markets for huge profits. ''Rip, strip and flip,'' as they say. I am not saying all of them do, but some do.
 The private equity people get an immense interest in the profits, vastly outstripping whatever capital they had on the line. This ''carried interest,'' as they call it, is then taxed at low capital-gains rates. If the private equity companies play their cards right, they use yet another loophole involving amortization of good will to eliminate any tax at all if and when they go public.
 Now, all of the above appears to be legal, in that it conforms to laws made by Congress and regulations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service.
 So what? The fact that the law is such and such as of July 2007 does not mean that it has to be that way in July 2008 or even in September 2007. The laws of taxation, like all laws, are political. They are not based on commandments from the Lord God Jehovah carried down on tablets from the mountaintop. They are not ordained by Solomon. They are political, hewn from the give-and-take of lobbyists, expert witnesses, law professors, economists and donors.
 The law can be changed. Laws are changed all of the time in the tax arena. The oil companies used to get immense tax allowances that they don't get any more because of political pressures. The tax rate on the last dollars of high-income people used to be above 90 percent. It's not like that any longer. Why? Political change. It applies to the tax code as well as to all other laws.
 Now, let's think about what's going on in America right now. We are in a war. We are apparently not winning the war. The military is desperately shy of funds, to the point where our fighting men and women are being shortchanged in training and equipment. 
 We also need more money for our soldiers' pay, so their families do not have to live like church mice while their spouses are deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan. In these circumstances, is it fitting and morally right for the richest of the rich to be paying either very low taxes or no tax at all?
 Is it right or even admissible in the human conscience that while teachers, emergency room technicians, police and firefighters are taxed at full earned-income rates -- and often underpaid -- that the highest-earning people in this country should pay at either very low tax rates or none at all?
 Or, put it like this: do we dare send our men and women to fight for an America in which the very rich are so favored by the government that it amounts almost to an aristocracy?
 Long ago, I had a European history teacher named Mrs. Enright. She explained to me that one of the causes of the French Revolution was the sad truth that the aristocracy was not taxed at all, while the workers and burghers were taxed highly. Is this our future?
 Maybe the law does allow for favorable tax treatment for hedge funds if you have good enough lawyers. Maybe the law does allow for private-equity managers to receive capital-gains treatment for what is clearly money management, not risking their own capital.
 But the mark of a great society is that its laws approximate morality and fairness. Is this really what we have in the tax code now? If so, fine. If not, why are we not changing it?
 (Is it because of the pitifully cheap contributions of the finance industry to the two parties? If so, the politicians are much more pitiful than I had thought. Contributions in the thousands and hundreds of thousands for tax breaks in the billions? This isn't sensible even on an old Tammany Hall basis. Contribute a penny to get a hundred dollars? What's up with that?)
 AND please, let's not haul out that old chestnut about having tax incentives to encourage entrepreneurship. We already have enough people who want to be rich (which is another phrase for ''entrepreneurship''). What we are lacking is oil and gas. Maybe we should give the oil exploration people lower taxes. What we are lacking is people willing to fight the war on terror.
 Why don't we just have a tax holiday for people who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years after they get back? This would be the tax code addressing real shortages, not an imaginary shortage of money mania (oops, I mean ''entrepreneurship'').
 Let's keep it real: Congress can take notice of a mammoth inequity in taxation during wartime and make the tax on private equity and hedge funds approximate the treatment of other highly paid people -- or it can continue down the road to the Bastille.

HEADLINE: Boxed Set

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
A few years ago, an experimental music duo called FM3 toured Europe, playing a 40-minute set that the duo's founder Christiaan Virant describes as ''very reductionist, very minimalist, very sparse.'' He and Zhang Jian, who are based in Beijing, performed on laptops. Some of these compositions were later released on a CD by Staalplaat, a specialty label based in Amsterdam; it sold about a thousand copies. In the context of avant-garde music, that's not bad: ''If someone can sell 2,000 CDs,'' Virant says with a laugh, ''they're like a superstar.'' So it's hard to find the right superlative to describe what happened when some of that same sparse music was released again -- not on CD but in a little plastic box called the Buddha Machine. Two years later, sales are approaching 50,000 units and still going strong. 
The crass use of the word ''unit'' to describe a buyable collection of music makes a certain sense in this case. The $25 Buddha Machine is the size of a cigarette pack, with one button, an on-off dial and a rather tinny speaker. Inside is a chip containing nine digitally encoded music loops. The button allows the listener to switch from one to another, but that's the extent of user control over the experience, leading some observers to refer to the thing as the anti-iPod. 
 A native of Omaha, Neb., Virant moved to China in the 1980s to study music and Chinese culture. He had been playing in punk bands but was already interested in the loops and rhythmic cycles explored by composers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and he describes his first electronic compositions as ''highly repetitive''; friends suggested that they sounded like video-game music. FM3 was founded in 1999, starting out as ''the ambient, chill-out band that played in the back room'' of Beijing clubs and evolving into a ''meditative'' sound. Virant had long been interested in the chanting he heard in some Buddhist temples, which he discovered was coming from a plastic box. He and Zhang pondered putting some of their own music into something similar; Staalplaat agreed to release a batch, and they made their first factory order for 500 Buddha Machines, guessing that it would also be their last.
 Word of the Buddha Machine traveled quickly among adventurous music consumers, says Eric Benoit, the publicist for Forced Exposure, a distributor specializing in a wide range of nonmainstream music, which peddles the device through its own site and sells it wholesale to progressive music retailers. Early coverage on Web sites like Disquiet.com, which focuses on ambient music and electronica, and other music sites, as well as a mention in this newspaper, made the 2005 holiday season seem like the peak -- but sales continue thanks to steady attention online and from the press. The public radio show Studio 360 featured the device in 2006; FM3 toured Europe again with a performance built around the Buddha Machines; and bloggers keep finding it anew, attracting music fans, design fans, gadget fans and those who view it as something like a fashion item. Benoit says a recent rerun of that Studio 360 episode sparked about as many sales as the original broadcast. At nearly 50,000 sold, Virant says, ''it still inhabits the world of the cult -- it's this kind of secret thing, and everyone who gets one, it feels like a discovery.''
 And of course there's the anti-iPod factor: the relief of not having to make a choice in a world awash with entertainment and self-expression options. Moreover, at a moment when the unused abilities of feature-loaded computers, cellphones and even microwave ovens pile up faster than we can keep track of them, it's satisfying to know that once you've turned the Buddha Machine on, you are using it to its full capacity. ''We didn't really put that much thought into it,'' Virant confesses, but he figures that the device indirectly addresses issues that haven't gone away. ''What is music in this modern age, and what is technology, and what do we want it to do?''
 Although the American audience for meditative, low-action, experimental music performances is small, its appreciation for little plastic objects is robust. Virant says the majority of Buddha Machine sales so far have been in the U.S. In fact, FM3 is now planning its first ever U.S. tour for next year. Virant envisions an opening set built around the Buddha Machine, followed by the loud and guitar-driven set the duo is playing these days. ''It's the same music, essentially,'' he says. ''It's just that one is turned up to 11. And the other is turned down to minus-1.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From The Loan Scandal

BYLINE: By Laura Pappano. 
Laura Pappano is a writer-in-residence at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.

 BODY:
ERIC SMOLITSKY, a senior at the University of Connecticut, is a sharp guy who is spending the summer doing stem cell research. But when it comes to student loans -- he will graduate $30,000 in debt and plans to borrow $200,000 more for medical school -- Mr. Smolitsky finds it annoyingly complicated. ''I haven't spent much time looking into it,'' he acknowledges. ''They say, 'Here is your financial aid package.' ''
Students in general have not thought much about how it all comes together (as long as the dollars are covered somehow). After all, they had a trusted adviser in the financial aid office. 
 Such assumptions have been shaken by recent disclosures about financial aid officers receiving junkets, consulting fees and kickbacks courtesy of the loan industry, owning stock in loan companies and steering business through ''preferred lender'' lists. A report from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, released last month, details how a lender's place on the list at the University of Texas, Austin, had more to do with what ''treats'' were offered the financial aid director than what rates were offered students. 
 ''Students and families had assumed that the advice they were getting on financial aid and loans from college officials was based on that person's experience and knowledge and on what would work best for that student,'' says Robert M. Shireman, president of the Institute for College Access and Success, in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Shireman points out what is now obvious but was once unthinkable: colleges and financial aid officers can have ''competing interests.'' 
 Legislation is pending in Congress, and the Department of Education has proposed rules governing the relationship between lender and college. 
 Now new concerns have surfaced about whether lenders use fair criteria to assess applicants for private, or ''alternative,'' loans. According to the College Board, such loans accounted for 20 percent of educational borrowing for the 2005-6 school year, up from 4 percent a decade earlier.
 Ultimately, all this attention should benefit borrowers. But for now, students (and parents) scrambling to get loans for next year's tuition bills must navigate this intimidating and labyrinthine industry. 
 ''My wife and I are both college-educated, and we sit there and say, 'How are kids supposed to do this?' '' says David Robinson, who lives in Lexington, Mass. A project manager at I.B.M., he is helping his son apply for student loans, find part-time work and otherwise cover the $41,500 it will cost him to attend Merrimack College in September.
 Despite money from a 529 college savings plan and scholarships for both academics and athletics (lacrosse), David Jr. will need $20,000 a year in loans. Mr. Robinson co-signed a private loan application at Sallie Mae but was stunned at the interest rate -- 10.25 percent plus a 3 percent fee at repayment. ''I think that's too expensive,'' says Mr. Robinson. ''I find this an extremely daunting, nerve-racking process. You don't know now what you are getting into.'' 
 If the student loan scandal has made some wary, it has also provided a prod to get smart before borrowing.
 SAM IS YOUR BEST RICH UNCLE. 
 ''You should never get a private student loan unless you have exhausted your government student loans,'' says Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of FinAid
 .org. Post-scandal, that fact is displayed prominently on lender home pages.
 Private loans, which carry variable rates, can come with double-digit interest (and no cap). Interest on federal loans, on the other hand, is set by Congress 5 percent for a Perkins (for the neediest students), a cap of 6.8 percent for a Stafford (for any income level) and 8.5 percent for a PLUS (for parents and graduate students).
 ''Why would anyone ever get a private loan?'' wonders Mr. Kantrowitz, author of ''FastWeb College Gold: The Step-by-Step Guide to Paying for College.'' 
 The answer is that Perkins and Stafford loans have limits on how much can be borrowed, and despite plans in Congress to raise those limits, loan amounts can fall well short of college costs. As for undergraduate PLUS loans, parents might not qualify (unlike Stafford and Perkins loans, a PLUS requires a credit check, so a loan default, a credit card delinquency or a bankruptcy can sink an application). Or parents might not warm to decades paying off their child's debt. 
 Mr. Robinson thought it would be good for his son to get a private loan as a way of investing in his own future. Also, he says, with three other children to raise and educate, ''I didn't want to totally be on the hook for it.''
 For Rates, EXPECT THE WORST.
 Shopping for a mortgage? Flip to the newspaper's business section for a chart comparing rates. But in the student loan industry, which has grown fast and unchecked, rates for private loans are all over the map. Lenders have developed their own criteria for assessing borrowers with unknown future income, no collateral (like that house to foreclose on) and brief (if any) credit histories. 
 In short, the greater the likelihood of default, the higher the interest rate. 
 Credit score is the biggest factor in determining the rate, but every lender judges differently the risk that you won't pay back what you borrow. 
 Lenders advertise catchy interest rates, Mr. Kantrowitz says, but note with an asterisk that they are available only to customers with the best credit history. His research shows fewer than 10 percent of student borrowers qualify for the best rates, and more than 75 percent get the worst. ''A good rule of thumb is to look at the worst rate and assume you will get a rate pretty close to that,'' he says.
 Lenders won't reveal the cutoff scores that qualify for one rate or another. But in general, a borrower in the 500s (on a scale of 300 to 850) ''could expect to get a fairly cool reception from any lender,'' whereas someone in the 700s is appealing, says Craig Watts, spokesman for the Fair Isaac Corporation, whose FICO formula is widely used to calculate scores. 
 Mr. Watts says multiple lenders inquiring into a credit history can lower a score slightly, because it implies a propensity to seek credit. Borrowers with average to good scores aren't likely to be affected by comparison shopping. But students with short credit histories may see their scores dip temporarily. 
 For students who lack a credit history, the lender MyRichUncle boasts on its Web site that it considers ''their merits as a student, including G.P.A., school and program of study.'' Raza Khan, the company president, says weighted formulas are used to assess borrowers.
 Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, doesn't take academic markers into account. ''We don't believe an A student should get dramatically better treatment than an A-minus or B student or C student,'' says Tom Joyce, its spokesman. He says Sallie Mae ''has standard pricing that is available at all schools,'' though it will improve rates in ''a competitive situation where a lender has come in and dropped prices.''
 Al M. Davis, Nelnet's managing director for private loans, says its underwriters consider a graduate student's field of study but not an undergraduate's except pre-med. They also ''look at the school's accreditation, at their historical performance related to job placement and their default history.'' 
 NOT ALL COLLEGES ARE EQUAL
 IN LENDERS' EYES.
 Six students, including David Robinson Jr., agreed to shop online for their private loans last month and share the results for this article. Rates ranged widely: one student earning a master's degree in public administration at New York University applied to four lenders and was offered rates varying by six percentage points. Some students came back empty-handed. 
 Cindy Grayson is halfway through an online master's program in criminal justice at Florida Metropolitan University, a profit-making accredited career college. She applied for $8,000 to supplement her government loans but was rejected by Bank of America and Sallie Mae. The Sallie Mae rejection, says Ms. Grayson, ''happened instantaneously.'' 
 Ms. Grayson, 50, lives in a mobile home in a town of 3,200 in Arizona and has a foreclosure and bankruptcy in her past. She may not be an appealing private loan candidate but she is, in many ways, a typical one. She sees her online courses and her loans as a ticket to a better-paying job. 
 ''I thought student loans were to help you,'' says Ms. Grayson, a substitute teacher who just landed a second job as a clerk in a sheriff's office. ''If you don't need it, you can have it. If you do need it, you can't have it.''
 Students are told they are free to borrow from any lender. In practice, lenders provide private money only for colleges with which they have a ''relationship,'' as customer service representatives put it. As a result, Ms. Grayson was not able to apply to three other lenders as a student at F.M.U., whose federal student loan default rate is 10 percent.
 Another comparison shopper, Katherine McBrayer, who just graduated from Monroe High School in North Carolina, was denied by Charter One Bank and Wachovia. Education Finance Partners, Citibank and Nelnet would not accept an application for a private loan to attend the Utah College of Massage Therapy, a one-year accredited program with seven campuses (default rate: about 7 percent).
 ''I was irritated,'' says Teresa McBrayer, Katherine's mother. She says her daughter has a grade point average of 3.92 and excelled in calculus and chemistry but dreams of owning her own massage center. 
 ''She didn't choose the triple-A four-star college,'' says Ms. McBrayer, who had wanted her daughter to be responsible for her own debt. She has since taken out a government PLUS loan. 
 Mr. Davis of Nelnet offers two possibilities when asked to explain why his company refused to lend money for the Utah massage college: ''We don't have a current relationship with that school or we have elected not to lend to that particular school.''
 Justin S. Draeger, spokesman for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, says his organization is troubled by such exclusions. 
 ''We are very concerned about students who are treated differently based on the school they attend,'' he says. ''There are definitely some questions that need to be raised about the underwriting of these loans.''
 As part of his continuing investigation, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York sent a letter to Congress last month complaining that ''a significant number of lenders'' weigh private loan applications and set rates depending on the college in question rather than the creditworthiness of the borrowers -- an approach he compared with redlining in the mortgage industry. 
 YOU WILL BE CONFUSED.
 Trying to figure out rates for a private loan is like the admissions process itself: you won't know until you sit down and apply. Even then, the information comes in dizzyingly different forms.
 Lenders talk in terms of margin, the number of percentage points above or below a selected index, which for student loans could be the prime rate, the 91-day Treasury bill or the London interbank offered rate. Some lenders do the calculations; others let you do the math. 
 The comparison shopper attending New York University applied for $8,000 from MyRichUncle. The lender offered $5,900 (through a partner, Doral Bank). The preapproval told her only that she would get prime plus 5 percentage points. She had to look up prime. The resulting rate, 13.25 percent, would be recalculated every quarter during the in-school deferral period and rounded up to the nearest .125 percent. There would also be an origination fee that would be ''disclosed in the initial Disclosure Statement for the first Advance.'' (In fact, the fee was hidden on the promissory note. The loan amount was given as $6,413 -- $5,900 plus a fee of $513.) 
 Confused yet?
 True borrowing costs depend on the fine print: discounts, penalties, fees (which can counteract the benefit of a lower interest rate) and how often the loan is capitalized (when deferred interest is added to the principal -- so in effect you pay interest on interest.) 
 Deanne Loonin, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project of the National Consumer Law Center, says private lenders are required to inform borrowers of interest rate, total number of payments and total cost of repayment key information for comparing deals. But, she says, there is no rule about how soon in the process lenders must divulge that information. (Proposed Senate legislation aims to compel lenders to disclose loan costs earlier.) 
 ''The truth is, there is little substantive regulations of the loans themselves,'' she says. ''There is really no sugar-coating the problem that if someone really wants to shop around now, it's not easy.''
 the PREFERRED lIST is (STILL) 
 where to start.
 Comparison shopping usually begins and ends on a college's preferred lender list. But what gets lenders top billing is still a mystery at many colleges: have they bought their way onto the list or do they represent a college's assessment of which loans serve its students best?
 Even with the credibility of financial aid offices damaged, experts say, don't ignore the list. But do ask questions. New rules are expected to call for at least three lenders to be listed, and for some explanation of how they were selected. 
 A competition last year at the University of California shows the complexity of finding the best deal and how much influence a university can wield. 
 According to Nancy Coolidge, coordinator of student financial support for the system's 10 campuses, administrators determined that students at some campuses were getting less desirable terms. At Santa Cruz, for example, students with the worst credit were paying up to 19.32 percent to Education Finance Partners and 14.25 percent to Sallie Mae with fees of up to 8 percent. The university decided to use the system's volume some 2,000 undergraduates borrowed $20 million in private loans last school year to improve rates.
 Six bidders vied for the coveted top spot on the lender list. Financial officers were seeking, among other criteria, lenders who would eliminate fees, would not demand default insurance and would capitalize loans just once. Administrators sorted through hundreds of pages of data. Citibank got the nod. 
 Borrowers are now classed in four groups: credit worthy (scores of 671 or higher), credit ready (670 to 610), low credit (609 to 570) and poor credit (569 or less), and their rates range from 7.75 to 14.25 percent. Students in the two middle categories get 9.25 and 11.25 percent, respectively, if they have co-signers. 
 CONSOLIDATION IS NO longer 
 a NO-BRAINER.
 It used to be that you got federal loans at variable interest rates; once you graduated, you consolidated them into one neat, low-interest, fixed-rate loan. 
 The value of consolidation has waned since federal rates became fixed last year. But the pressure to consolidate has heated up, with lenders urging students, ''Lower your monthly payments,'' which simply means stretching out the loan for more years and increasing the total interest. 
 It makes sense to consolidate private loans if you can improve terms or better manage payments, Mr. Kantrowitz says. But consolidating is not automatically a better deal, and you may loserebates or pay penalties. Never consolidate federal and private loans together, because that wipes out some benefits of a government loan (such as loan forgiveness for certain types of public service). 
 The Department of Education ombudsman for student aid, Debra Wiley, says her office is fielding more complaints this year -- about 300, compared with 125 last year and 50 the year before from students who say they were tricked or who were uncertain about consolidation forms they had signed. ''I know people are confused,'' she says. ''They think they are signing something to get more information when they are signing a consolidation application.''
 Steven E. Brooks, the executive director of North Carolina's State Education Assistance Authority, a state agency that makes, services and guarantees government loans, says he has received 150 forms at once instructing the agency to transfer student loans to a commercial lender -- and then heard from upset students who hadn't intended to consolidate. 
 In April, the University of Idaho allowed On Campus Student Loans of Helena, Mont., to hold a consolidation workshop at the same time and in the same campus building where university officials were offering exit loan-counseling for seniors. 
 Elaine Ruscilli, a senior in psychology, dropped into the workshop to figure out how to structure repayment of her $40,000 in federal loans (and eat some free pizza). Mistaking the seals on documents and signs for Department of Education insignia, she signed forms, she says. Later she ''got that sinking feeling'' and demanded the company not consolidate her loans. It didn't. But other lenders are still trying. She got a check in the mail for $473.43 from Academic Loan Group hers if she consolidated. ''If you were desperate for money, you might be tempted to cash that,'' she says.
 Dan Davenport, director of admissions and financial aid at the University of Idaho, which lends government money directly to students, says students face a 1.5 percent charge for consolidating federally guaranteed loans with private lenders. 
 ''Students are confused about what to do,'' says Mr. Davenport, who is pessimistic about proposed legislation. ''I am totally convinced that all of this will continue -- the false advertising, the illegal incentives, the misinformation -- until we redesign the loan programs. It's such big money and such easy money that everybody wants to get it.''
 PICK A COLLEGE (AND MAJOR) YOU CAN AFFORD.
 Everyone knows college is expensive. But with so much energy focused on getting in, discussion about whether it's worth the cost is pushed to the background.
 Lewis Mandell, professor of finance and managerial economics at the University at Buffalo (of the State University of New York), says students who need loans should ask themselves if running into debt at a private college makes sense. ''If I could get the same education at a state institution, I need to ask, 'What is the differential? What am I paying for?' '' he says. ''It is one thing if Mom and Dad will send you to college; that's fine. But if you have to pay back $100,000 to $200,000, you should say to yourself, 'Is this degree really going to prepare me for the types of jobs that will be there for much of my career?' '' 
 Robert D. Manning, director of the Center for Consumer Financial Services at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has students compare their expected earnings with expected payments on student loans and credit card debt -- he worries when more than 50 percent of starting salary is needed to repay debts. Mr. Manning says students often have an unrealistic expectation of starting income. ''We've actually had students decide they can't do their major,'' he says. 
 Dawn Wooters followed her passion at the University of Tennessee, graduating in 1998 with a fine arts degree. ''I was thinking, 'This is what I would really love to do and the money wouldn't matter.' It's hard to admit that now,'' says Ms. Wooters, who couldn't live on painting watercolors. At 34, she is getting a second undergraduate degree, in nursing, at Kennesaw State University in Atlanta. 
 Ms. Wooters graduated the first time without debt. She now works full time at a Hampton Inn and has already borrowed $13,000 in Stafford and $3,500 in private loans (which she got with her boyfriend co-signing, after she applied alone and was turned down). ''You never want to tell someone, 'Don't do what you love,' '' she says. ''But you need to have a realistic concept and a backup plan.'' At Debt's Door

HEADLINE: Not Just a Cabaret, Old Friend

BYLINE: By Eric D. Weitz. 
Eric D. Weitz, a professor of history at the University of Minnesota, is the author of the forthcoming ''Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy.''

DATELINE: Minneapolis 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY is aglow with Weimar. Last fall the Met featured the works of Otto Dix and George Grosz in an exhibition titled ''Glitter and Doom: German Portraits From the 1920s.'' Downtown cabarets are buzzing with Weimar knockoffs updated for a post-9/11 city. The Neue Galerie locates itself in fin de siecle Vienna with pride of place given to Gustav Klimt, but its collections, its bookstore and even its pastries quickly bleed into 1920s Berlin. Not since the 1930s and '40s, when refugees from Nazi Germany crowded Washington Heights and lectured at the New School, have there been so many associations with that creative, turbulent period between the end of World War I and the Nazi seizure of power. What is going on here? 
The Weimar on display is the world created in retrospect by the refugees. Only a handful of them -- luminaries like Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann or fans of America like Kurt Weill -- landed well in the United States. For the vast majority, exile was a difficult, wrenching process of adjustment to a new language and new mores. From afar they witnessed the creation of a brutal yet popular dictatorship and then the extension of its murderous policies throughout Europe. Trying to make sense of Germany's descent into barbarism, they looked back on Weimar as an era of excess and corruption, the prelude to the Nazis.
 That is the Weimar that today's New Yorkers revel in, John Kander and Fred Ebb's ''Cabaret'' updated for the 21st century -- scantily clad women and men in various combinations onstage and off; the distorted, mutilated figures painted and drawn by Grosz and Dix; hilarious, sardonic political commentary; Marlene Dietrich in pantsuits; and, coming down the road closely behind, no obstacles in sight, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
 Perhaps it is no wonder that New Yorkers especially, with their own experience of disaster just six years ago, are so drawn to this image of Weimar. In an age of catastrophes and uncertainties, from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, unending war in Iraq and looming environmental meltdown, better to party on while making the occasional nod to the ugly circumstances and figures all around.
 But Weimar Germany was so much more than disaster and decadence. To be sure, Weimar suffered more economic and political crises than any democracy can be expected to bear. And Berlin in the 1920s had seedy bars galore where sex was only one of many forms of business transacted. Yet Weimar was also an era of inspired political, social and cultural innovation, and its leading figures were firmly convinced that they were creating a better, more humane world, whether through modern architecture, expansive social welfare programs or new theatrical forms. They despaired over the tragic waste of lives in World War I, but their hopes and creativity were also unleashed by the revolution that sent the Kaiser packing and established a progressive, socially minded republic. 
 If all one knows is Dix and Grosz and their kin or the torn stockings prevalent in New York's nouveau-Weimar cabaret, then Weimar seems to have been all mutilation and ugliness. But it was also utopian hopes and joyous creativity, a riveting search for beauty that would express the dynamic tendencies of modern, urban life and project a better world ahead.
 Weimar was the inspired public housing designed by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner, which improved the lives of so many Berliners. It was the eight-hour day and trade-union recognition, which overthrew the feudal working conditions typical in prewar German industry. It was the banks of windows in Erich Mendelsohn's Schocken department store in Chemnitz, which gave an ethereal lightness to a massive structure and celebrated a world of plenty. Or his Einstein Tower, which represented the search for knowledge in a building that soared upward to the heavens. Weimar meant the legions of clinics that counseled women and men on how to have a rich and healthy sex life. Weimar meant commitment to the public realm, bristling creativity and belief in the future for all its citizens.
 As we approach the fifth year of a war with no end in sight and governmental policies that see markets as the appropriate setting for every human interaction, we should remember the other Weimar, the one its own protagonists lost sight of through the fog-encased tragedy of their exile.

HEADLINE: The Flights Are Long. The Planes Are Cramped.

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
AS if commercial air travel weren't miserable enough, more airlines are using narrower jets on long-haul flights, putting an even greater squeeze on travelers in coach. Delta Air Lines is among the latest to announce plans to use the slim Boeing 757 on trans-Atlantic routes serving destinations like Britain and Ireland. Continental, which now flies 21 routes to 20 European cities with the 757, was among the first. Northwest and US Airways also have begun flying the narrower jets to Europe. 
 Travelers can find some advantages. The increasing use of 757s to Europe has led to expanded schedules, with more nonstop routes to choose from when planning trips. That means more time saved by avoiding long layovers or plane changes in hub cities. It can also mean a quicker trip through customs at the smaller airports. And for some travelers, like those who live close to Bradley International Airport in Connecticut, where Northwest's new Hartford-to-Amsterdam service departs, it can mean a shorter drive home than the one from the larger hub airport -- Boston Logan in this example. 
 But the 757s, which are generally tolerated on shorter, domestic routes, tend to bring out claustrophobia in passengers on long-haul flights. Unlike wide-body aircraft like 767s and A330s, which typically have two aisles, a 757 has one, which means a lot less room for stretching cramped legs. Because the 757 has no two-seat rows in coach, just three seats on each side of the aisle, there is a higher chance of getting stuck in a middle seat. And while most airlines using the 757s on trans-Atlantic flights are reconfiguring their premium class cabins with better seats and entertainment systems, the coach cabins haven't been changed all that much. 
 ''What this means for the economy passenger is that some amenities they typically receive on international flights, such as personal video screens or laptop power ports, are not available,'' said Matthew Daimler, founder of Seatguru.com, which ranks seat quality and offers insider information -- for example, which exit-row seats won't recline. In addition to the amenities, Mr. Daimler added, wide-body planes like 777s and A330s, ''generally offer more overhead storage per passenger, slightly extra seat width, bassinets for infants and typically a better chance of getting an upgrade.''
 For example, there are 48 business class seats on Continental's international routes flying 777-200 aircraft and 235 seats in coach. That's roughly one business class seat for every five in coach. On its 757-200, there are 16 business class and 159 coach seats, or about one business class seat for every 10 in coach. And seats in both business and coach are slightly narrower on the 757. 
 To try to make passengers a little more comfortable, some airlines are taking out seats to offer more legroom in coach and retrofitting their premium cabins with updated business class seats and entertainment. Northwest, for example, has configured its 757s to Europe with 16 new World Business Class seats, which come with portable in-flight entertainment systems with 40 movies, 40 compact discs of music and 6 games. In coach, the pitch, or distance between rows, has been increased up to four inches. Continental completed installation last winter of new entertainment systems in the BusinessFirst cabins of its fleet of 41 Boeing 757 aircraft used primarily on trans-Atlantic flights to and from Newark. This summer it began installing the systems, which offer customers up to 25 movies, 25 short-subject programs and 50 compact discs, in its economy cabins, too. US Airways said it plans to upgrade in-flight entertainment on its 757s later this year. 
 Still, there is the bathroom factor. Because of the single aisle, travelers are effectively trapped, either in their seats or in the aisle on the way back to their seats, every time a cart comes rolling along, which can be often on an international flight. 
 ''If the only aisle is continually clogged and you've got to go -- it's a problem,'' said Jerry Chandler, who writes Cheapflights.com's travel blog. ''You've got to get a kid back to the bathroom? I'm sorry, you're stuck.'' 
 The use of 757s on trans-Atlantic flights was recently made possible by so-called blended winglets -- new devices on wings that reduce drag, increase fuel efficiency and boost flight range. The 757, which took to the skies in the early 1980s, was used at first on mid-length domestic flights and then, after regulations were changed to allow twin-engine airplanes on longer routes, also on transcontinental flights. The new winglet technology, further expanding the 757's range, allows United States carriers in search of new markets overseas to expand service to more regions, often with direct routes to smaller cities -- moves they wouldn't be able to justify using larger planes that eat up more fuel and have many more seats to fill. 
 Northwest, for example, began flying 757s with 160 seats nonstop from Hartford to Amsterdam on July 1. It also started flying from Detroit to Dusseldorf and Brussels this summer using the 757. US Airways now flies 757s to Brussels, Shannon, Dublin, Lisbon, Amsterdam and Glasgow from its Philadelphia hub.
 To try to maximize your comfort on a 757 to Europe this summer, take a look at the diagrams on the airline's homepage to see which seats are open for your flight. Then cross-reference your findings with information on Web sites like SeatGuru.com or SeatExpert.com, which rank seat quality. SeatGuru.com recommends seats in Row 16 on Continental's 767-200, for instance, because they are exit-row seats, with extra legroom, and they recline fully. It advises avoiding Row 14, where reclining is limited. 
 Or you could avoid single-aisle planes altogether. Joseph Remy, a financial analyst from Washington, bought a ticket on a 757 from Newark to Dublin in October for the convenience of flying nonstop. But the experience was so miserable, he said, that he purposely avoided 757s when booking another trip to Ireland this summer. 
 The lack of psychological space was part of the issue. ''To go that long, it just seems so small,'' said Mr. Remy who was stuck next to ''a very large woman'' on the way east and to a drunken man on the way home. With only one aisle, ''there was no escape route'' to take a break from his seatmates or to get around the cart when it came down the aisle. And after having to squint at ''a really small screen'' for the in-flight movie, Mr. Remy said, ''it felt like it was 1965.'' 
 Mr. Remy is flying a two-aisle 767 with a stopover before landing in Dublin for his trip next month. Though a couple of flights on 757s were cheaper, Mr. Remy, said, he wasn't tempted. ''I said no way.''

HEADLINE: Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
IT'S not so much the modest bungalow's spacious second-floor addition or the expansive side yard that gets to Lori Ann Vendetti. 
 The thing that keeps her fighting is the misty ocean air that floats through her doorway when she lets her dog out in the morning. The salty aroma can transport her back to childhood weekends spent playing on the beach with her two brothers, long since dead and gone.
Neither Ms. Vendetti, 46, nor her parents across the street believe they can afford another place within a sniff of the ocean if the City of Long Branch, N.J., wins its 12-year effort to turn their homes over to a private developer who wants to build luxury condominiums.
 ''We always feel like things are stacked against us,'' said Ms. Vendetti, who has lived in her home for 12 years. ''But if they're going to take it from me, they're going to take it with a fight.'' 
 During the last two years, homeowners and property-rights advocates across the country have echoed that sentiment, and state lawmakers have answered. A controversial United States Supreme Court decision in June 2005, which upheld the power of local governments to seize private property for the benefit of private businesses, inspired an uprising that led 40 states to pass laws that rein in, to varying degrees, that authority. 
 But legislatures in the three states in the New York metropolitan area, long seen by property-rights advocates as home to some of the worst abuses of eminent domain, have done little to change the status quo.
 ''New Jersey and New York are among the worst states in the country for eminent domain abuses -- New Jersey is really awful,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Va., which represents residential and business owners facing condemnation. ''What's interesting is that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are some of the few states that have not managed to pass any decent legislation.''
 In Connecticut, where the United States Supreme Court case originated, Gov. M. Jodi Rell late last month signed a law that includes a prohibition on taking property ''primarily'' to increase local tax revenues, leaving open that reasoning as a secondary cause. 
 New York, which already allowed the taking of property for private use, saw its lawmakers introduce 17 related bills in 2006. But the Legislature passed only those laws seeking to ban two specific projects. 
 Similarly, New Jersey legislators have been unable to pass any bill. The State Supreme Court recently stepped into the breach, arguing that cities and towns cannot condemn properties simply because another use could be more productive. That ruling, in Gallenthin Realty Development v. Borough of Paulsboro, has already had an impact on several projects, including a plan to build 2,000 condominiums in downtown Newark.
 Other states have instituted more precise definitions of blight, set minimum compensation levels above market value for the owners of seized properties and restricted eminent domain to more traditional public projects like schools and roads. The legislative changes have been driven by an unusual alliance of conservative Republican property-rights advocates and liberals interested in the rights of lower-income people. 
 Not everyone believes such measures are needed. It remains to be seen if the new laws will protect property owners without chilling redevelopment projects. ''You had this huge uproar,'' said Larry Morandi, who has tracked the new laws at the National Conference of State Legislatures, ''and an incredibly fast legislative response. The effect of that legislation will be seen in how it is implemented, and that takes time.''
 While supporters of the current laws say a reasoned analysis would show that eminent domain is most often employed as a last resort and without major conflict, what has driven the push for change and has led to so many lawsuits is anger at the potential loss of control over such a fundamental aspect of life.
 The lead plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court case, Susette Kelo, a nurse who lived in a pink Victorian cottage in New London, opposed the town's condemnation of her neighborhood to make way for a private development of offices, condominiums and a hotel. The 5-to-4 majority opinion held that promoting economic development met the ''public use'' clause of the Fifth Amendment that allows condemnations. In a dissenting opinion in the case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor gave voice to the fear that started a revolt: ''Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded.''
 IN Norwalk, Nancy Esposito doesn't want to be uprooted or upgraded. Her family has owned and run Casey's Sheet Metal Service in Norwalk for 15 years. Five years ago, a developer showed up offering to buy their building as part of a plan to remake several blocks. Ms. Esposito has resisted, and watched as the developer bought most of the buildings and land around her.
 ''They keep saying they want to make this area a destination,'' Ms. Esposito said. ''I say that it is a destination. It's my destination.''
 The developer, Stanley M. Seligson, a Norwalk native, envisions a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood spanning several blocks, with more than 500,000 square feet of stores, restaurants and theaters, 350 apartments and a large medical center. Mr. Seligson said he has so far acquired 75 percent of the property and was determined to acquire the remaining properties without the town invoking eminent domain. Town officials see the neighborhood as part of an old urban core that has not responded to less sweeping redevelopment incentives. Four contiguous redevelopment projects are in the works, all of which have involved or could involve taking property through eminent domain if negotiations between the developer and property owners fail, said Susan Sweitzer, a senior project manager for the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency.
 ''The impetus is on the private developer to make this a nonissue,'' she said.
 Ms. Esposito said she believed the cards were already stacked against her.
 ''They keep saying they will use eminent domain as a last resort,'' she said. ''But when they have the ultimate power to take your property, it's a done deal. There is no such thing as private property anymore.''
 Governor Rell responded to the United States Supreme Court ruling involving the Kelo case by asking local governments to observe a voluntary moratorium on condemnations for private development until the state legislature could act. This year, she introduced legislation.
 ''It is time to clarify our eminent domain laws and make it absolutely clear when and why governments can -- and cannot -- take private property for public purposes,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement in March.
 The law that Mrs. Rell signed requires that municipal legislative bodies approve eminent domain seizures by a two-thirds majority and that property owners be reimbursed at 125 percent of fair market value. It also built in other protective measures for property owners. A spokesman for the governor said Mrs. Rell viewed the bill as ''a considerable step forward.''
 ''She has always felt that it was the Legislature's responsibility to define the proper scope of eminent domain, when and whether it should he used for any kind of economic development activity,'' said the spokesman, Rich Harris.
 But property-rights advocates say the law's ban on citing increased tax revenues as a primary reason for condemnation will do little to clarify concerns about when property can be taken. 
 James S. Alesi, a state senator from the Rochester area, held a series of hearings across the state on eminent domain after the Kelo decision. He said he was repeatedly told that New York didn't need a handful of hastily drafted bills, but rather a commission to study the issue.''I thought it was beneficial to learn one key thing: We don't really have to do a lot in New York State,'' he said. ''As compared to other areas around the country, New York's laws are pretty strong.''
 The New York State Bar Association has been the most prominent supporter of that position. Patricia E. Salkin, chairwoman of the association's eminent domain task force, said state laws might need tweaking, including a passage to increase public involvement in redevelopment plans and to extend the 30-day period allowed for owners of condemned property to file appeals. But she said states that passed more sweeping laws risked losing vital projects.
 ''We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' said Ms. Salkin, director of the Government Law Center of Albany Law School. ''We should make sure that it's a fair playing field for everybody.'' 
 State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh in Westchester County, said the choice was not black and white. ''The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''The bar is entrenched on this one, and they're wrong.''
 In 2004, Mr. Brodsky pushed through a bill that required that towns notify by mail property owners facing condemnation. 
 It followed a controversy in Port Chester, in which a local business owner hadn't seen the Westchester village's notice in a local newspaper that his property was facing condemnation to make way for a Stop & Shop supermarket. 
 The 30 days that the state law allows for appeals passed before the businessman, Bill Brody, had even heard about the plan. A federal judge this month ruled that Mr. Brody's due process rights had been violated. 
 ''I think it's obvious that people are upset by what eminent domain is being used for,'' Mr. Brody said, ''and I think things are going to change.'' 
 Not all redevelopment projects engender large controversy. On Long Island, the Village of Hempstead is moving forward with a $2 billion plan to replace 26 acres in the village's downtrodden center with a mix of 2,500 housing units, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a performing arts center. The city has agreed to sell 21 properties it owns to the developer and seize up to 58 privately owned properties if the developer cannot come to terms with the owners. Most of the concerns voiced so far, including at a packed meeting last week, have involved ensuring that the plan includes a significant amount of affordable housing and that current residents receive enough compensation to find new homes.
 Mr. Brodsky introduced a bill last year calling for the appointment of an eminent domain ombudsman, compensating displaced homeowners at 150 percent of fair market value, and requiring that all condemnations for economic development be part of a comprehensive plan. 
 THE bill gained no traction in the State Assembly. ''This is an area where there's a lot of comfort with a bad law, and that's unfortunate,'' Mr. Brodsky said.
 Mr. Alesi, the state senator from Rochester, maintains that state laws need only to be ''buffed up'' and that the laws may not offer enough protections. Courts are relied on to catch abuses, but average people don't have the resources for a legal fight with the government, he said. ''No one should have the American dream turned into their own personal nightmare because of the government,'' he said.
 Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Town of Paulsboro had overreached in relying on a consultant's determination that an undeveloped 63-acre parcel could be condemned because it was ''not fully productive.''
 ''Under that approach, any property that is operated in less than optimal manner is arguably 'blighted,' '' wrote Chief Justice James R. Zazzali in the court's unanimous opinion. ''If such an all-encompassing definition were adopted, most property in the state would be eligible for redevelopment.''
 Citing the Supreme Court ruling, an Essex County Superior Court judge ruled this month that Newark could not designate as blighted a 14-acre area on and around Mulberry Street so the land could be used to build condominiums. Several property owners had fought the city's efforts to take the land by eminent domain, arguing to the court that the area was still productive. A spokeswoman for Mayor Cory A. Booker said the city had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling. 
 And an appellate panel last week rejected Lodi officials' efforts to replace two trailer parks with housing and shops. A newly elected Borough Council had dropped the plan earlier this month.
 A bill that would more narrowly define blight passed the New Jersey State Assembly last year but has been tied up in a State Senate committee since.
 The New Jersey League of Municipalities opposes limiting the power of municipalities in using eminent domain. Its opinion carries weight in a state with 566 municipalities, a strong tradition of home rule, and one in which many legislators are also mayors of their hometowns.
 William G. Dressel, executive director of the league, said that with little undeveloped land left in the state, and with towns increasingly relying on property taxes to provide services, responsible town leaders must look for ways to redevelop unproductive land. ''We were quite frankly relieved that the court did not unravel the eminent domain statutes as it relates to the use of that tool for economic development purposes,'' he said. ''We feel very strongly that eminent domain is a viable economic development tool in New Jersey that is used sparingly.''
 The state's public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, said a 1992 revision of the state statute created the ''not fully productive'' justification that ''opened up the floodgates'' for the improper use of eminent domain. 
 Mr. Chen's office recently issued a report that listed the plan in Long Branch, where Ms. Vendetti lives near the beach, under the heading ''Bogus Blight.'' It said the town based its conclusion on ''superficial'' exterior inspections that noted deteriorating paint or chipped masonry.
 Nothing appears to be decrepit about the Vendettis' homes. 
 Carmen Vendetti, 80, had saved his money driving a truck to buy his family, in 1960, a modest respite from the harsher environs of their home in Newark. He and his wife, Josephine, moved there full time after he retired. Ms. Vendetti saved her money from a job with Amtrak and bought a house across the street from her parents in 1995. Two months later, she attended a town meeting where a developer's model of the neighborhood showed luxury buildings all along the oceanfront.
 ''They had a house on my lot,'' she said. ''I just laughed and thought, 'How are they going to do that?' No one ever used the words 'eminent domain.' ''
 But Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for 17 years, said some in the area ignored the redevelopment plan, thinking it would fail, as had many before. Some homeowners have accepted offers of units made affordable to them in the new development, he said. He said that with just 20 percent of the construction completed, the beachfront has been transformed from a dangerous area of boarded-up storefronts to an upscale, year-round destination that includes packed restaurants and a popular park. 
 He said he thought the recent emotional backlash may dissuade officials in other areas from even trying such a sweeping turnaround using eminent domain.
 ''Politically it won't work anymore,'' he said. ''I think the time has come and gone.''

 But property-rights advocates say the law's ban on citing increased tax revenues as a primary reason for condemnation will do little to clarify concerns about when property can be taken. 
 James S. Alesi, a state senator from the Rochester area, held a series of hearings across the state on eminent domain after the Kelo decision. He said he was repeatedly told that New York didn't need a handful of hastily drafted bills, but rather a commission to study the issue.
 ''I thought it was beneficial to learn one key thing: We don't really have to do a lot in New York State,'' he said. ''As compared to other areas around the country, New York's laws are pretty strong.''
 The New York State Bar Association has been the most prominent supporter of that position. Patricia E. Salkin, chairwoman of the association's eminent domain task force, said state laws might need tweaking, including a passage to increase public involvement in redevelopment plans and to extend the 30-day period allowed for owners of condemned property to file appeals. But she said states that passed more sweeping laws risked losing vital projects.
 ''We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' said Ms. Salkin, director of the Government Law Center of Albany Law School. ''We should make sure that it's a fair playing field for everybody.'' 
 State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh in Westchester, said the choice was not black and white. ''The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''The bar is entrenched on this one, and they're wrong.''
 In 2004, Mr. Brodsky pushed through a bill that required that towns notify by mail property owners facing condemnation. 
 It followed a controversy in Port Chester, in which a local business owner hadn't seen the Westchester village's notice in a local newspaper that his property was facing condemnation to make way for a Stop & Shop supermarket. 
 The 30 days that the state law allows for appeals passed before the businessman, Bill Brody, had even heard about the plan. A federal judge this month ruled that Mr. Brody's due process rights had been violated. 
 ''I think it's obvious that people are upset by what eminent domain is being used for,'' Mr. Brody said, ''and I think things are going to change.'' 
 Not all redevelopment projects engender large controversy. On Long Island, the Village of Hempstead is moving forward with a $2 billion plan to replace 26 acres in the village's downtrodden center with a mix of 2,500 housing units, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a performing arts center. The city has agreed to sell 21 properties it owns to the developer and seize up to 58 privately owned properties if the developer cannot come to terms with the owners. Most of the concerns voiced so far, including at a packed meeting last week, have involved ensuring that the plan includes a significant amount of affordable housing and that current residents receive enough compensation to find new homes.
 Mr. Brodsky introduced a bill last year calling for the appointment of an eminent domain ombudsman, compensating displaced homeowners at 150 percent of fair market value, and requiring that all condemnations for economic development be part of a comprehensive plan. 
 THE bill gained no traction in the State Assembly. ''This is an area where there's a lot of comfort with a bad law, and that's unfortunate,'' Mr. Brodsky said.
 Mr. Alesi, the state senator from Rochester, maintains that state laws need only to be ''buffed up'' and that the laws may not offer enough protections. Courts are relied on to catch abuses, but average people don't have the resources for a legal fight with the government, he said. ''No one should have the American dream turned into their own personal nightmare because of the government,'' he said.
 Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Town of Paulsboro had overreached in relying on a consultant's determination that an undeveloped 63-acre parcel could be condemned because it was ''not fully productive.''
 ''Under that approach, any property that is operated in less than optimal manner is arguably 'blighted,' '' wrote Chief Justice James R. Zazzali in the court's unanimous opinion. ''If such an all-encompassing definition were adopted, most property in the state would be eligible for redevelopment.''
 Citing the Supreme Court ruling, an Essex County Superior Court judge ruled this month that Newark could not designate as blighted a 14-acre area on and around Mulberry Street so the land could be used to build condominiums. Several property owners had fought the city's efforts to take the land by eminent domain, arguing to the court that the area was still productive. A spokeswoman for Mayor Cory A. Booker said the city had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling. 
 And an appellate panel last week rejected Lodi officials' efforts to replace two trailer parks with housing and shops. A newly elected Borough Council had dropped the plan earlier this month.
 A bill that would more narrowly define blight passed the New Jersey State Assembly last year but has been tied up in a State Senate committee since.
 The New Jersey League of Municipalities opposes limiting the power of municipalities in using eminent domain. Its opinion carries weight in a state with 566 municipalities, a strong tradition of home rule, and one in which many legislators are also mayors of their hometowns.
 William G. Dressel, executive director of the league, said that with little undeveloped land left in the state, and with towns increasingly relying on property taxes to provide services, responsible town leaders must look for ways to redevelop unproductive land. ''We were quite frankly relieved that the court did not unravel the eminent domain statutes as it relates to the use of that tool for economic development purposes,'' he said. ''We feel very strongly that eminent domain is a viable economic development tool in New Jersey that is used sparingly.''
 The state's public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, said a 1992 revision of the state statute created the ''not fully productive'' justification that ''opened up the floodgates'' for the improper use of eminent domain. 
 Mr. Chen's office recently issued a report that listed the plan in Long Branch, where Ms. Vendetti lives near the beach, under the heading ''Bogus Blight.'' It said the town based its conclusion on ''superficial'' exterior inspections that noted deteriorating paint or chipped masonry.
 Nothing appears to be decrepit about the Vendettis' homes. 
 Carmen Vendetti, 80, had saved his money driving a truck to buy his family, in 1960, a modest respite from the harsher environs of their home in Newark. He and his wife, Josephine, moved there full time after he retired. Ms. Vendetti saved her money from a job with Amtrak and bought a house across the street from her parents in 1995. Two months later, she attended a town meeting where a developer's model of the neighborhood showed luxury buildings all along the oceanfront.
 ''They had a house on my lot,'' she said. ''I just laughed and thought, 'How are they going to do that?' No one ever used the words 'eminent domain.' ''
 But Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for 17 years, said some in the area ignored the redevelopment plan, thinking it would fail, as had many before. Some homeowners have accepted offers of units made affordable to them in the new development, he said. He said that with just 20 percent of the construction completed, the beachfront has been transformed from a dangerous area of boarded-up storefronts to an upscale, year-round destination that includes packed restaurants and a popular park. 
 He said he thought the recent emotional backlash may dissuade officials in other areas from even trying such a sweeping turnaround using eminent domain.
 ''Politically it won't work anymore,'' he said. ''I think the time has come and gone.''

HEADLINE: New Fees May Put a Bite On Midwest Tournaments

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Larry Krohn, the director of the annual Minnetonka Classic Bass Tournament, says he loves handing the big checks to the people who reel in the biggest fish. The prize pool last month was more than $30,000, including the $9,400 for the top-catching two-person team.
 But Krohn's mood seems to sour at the thought of another check he will have to cut before his next event: a new $400 fee to Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources for a tournament permit. He is already paying smaller fees to the Lake Minnetonka Conservation District, for the city's bill for park use and for the insurance policy required by the local sheriff's department. 
''After 15 years of running this, my level of frustration is mounting every year,'' Krohn said. ''Every year, it gets worse and worse in terms of the things you have to do. It's going to be enough of a hassle for some tournament directors that they aren't going to do it.''
 Next week, the Department of Natural Resources begins imposing the highest fees in the nation on fishing tournament organizers. They will range from $120 to $1,000, depending on the number of participants and whether fish are taken off-site to be weighed -- costs almost certain to be passed along to anglers through higher entrance fees. The permits had been free.
 Agency officials say they want to recover the cost of issuing event permits, pegged at $108,000 annually. But many competitive anglers consider fees an assault on their sport and say they worry that they will be the final straw for small tournaments struggling to survive.
 It is a debate that has also come to neighboring Wisconsin, where officials are refining a proposed tournament fee schedule after one failed last year amid concerns that it was excessive. Andrew Fayram, a fisheries policy analyst at the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, said he expected the next plan to split regulatory costs between competitive anglers and contest organizers.
 Beneath the fee fight is a deeper dispute over water use.
 The spread of tournaments -- traced by some to competitive fishing's increasing television presence -- has stoked questions about the sport's possible strain on fisheries; organizers say they follow catch-and-release practices and that tournaments do not increase fish mortality. There is also tension over lake access and waterway traffic because the events can draw dozens of boats.
 Vern Wagner, who has been active in Minnesota tournament fishing for two decades, said he wondered if the fees were an attempt to discourage contests.
 ''If this was 30 guys in canoes, there wouldn't be a problem,'' he said. ''It's the fact that a bass boat costs $35,000, so, accordingly, somehow we're economically profiting. 
 ''It's a perception that it's a bunch of rich guys going out on the lake and somehow exploiting the resource.''
 Terry Peltier, a member of a Department of Natural Resources citizen panel that recommended the fees, denied trying to curb tournaments.
 But if fewer tournaments is the result, Dave Zentner, an angler from Duluth, Minn., said he was all for it. He viewed fishing as a recreational escape and said he was bothered by corporate sponsorships attached to many tournaments.
 ''I still want to puke when I look at an outdoor channel and see guys grabbing a fish out of a tank and running it across a stage like they've just won the Boston Marathon,'' Zentner said. ''It just turns me off.''
 The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources issues roughly 600 tournament permits a year. The agency requires permits when there are 30 or more entrants for open-water contests and above 150 when the water is iced over.
 Al Stevens, a fisheries program consultant for the agency, said permits helped the department manage where tournaments were held and made sure popular lakes were not overused. The cost of processing permit applications and compiling after-event reports grew more than sixfold in the last decade. The citizen panel recommended a fee to replace dollars currently drawn from a fund fed by regular fishing license fees.
 Under the new system, it will cost tournament organizers $120 for an ice-fishing permit, $400 for open-water events with more than 100 people and onsite fish weighing, $500 for midsized contests where fish are taken off-site and $1,000 for tournaments with 100 or more entrants and off-site weighing.
 Stevens said Minnesota's rates were unrivaled. For instance, Vermont charges a $50 fee and Washington, New Mexico and South Carolina are in the $25 range. Many other states charge nothing.
 Mickey Goetting, the conservation director of the Minnesota Bass Anglers Sportsman Society Federation, said the fees would be especially cumbersome to groups that put on multiple-tournament leagues. 
 The federation would have rather seen the Department of Natural Resources establish a tournament stamp that anglers could buy at a nominal fee with their license that would let them into any event.
 Stevens said some organizers would limit the size of their fields to avoid having to get a permit, and others would merely try to fly under the radar.
 ''I'm afraid of the backlash,'' he said. ''That's just bad for fish management. When we lose sight of how many tournaments there are and where they're at, it could lead to more conflicts at lakes. That's not what we want.''

HEADLINE: At War, At Home, At Risk

BYLINE: By Ayub Nuri. 
Ayub Nuri, who is based in New York City, is a freelance reporter and has worked as a researcher on Iraq for Human Rights Watch.

 BODY:
I was born in 1979 in the northern Iraqi town of Halabja. In Kurdish, Halabja means ''the wrong place,'' and that is how the town felt when I was growing up, because I never knew a life without war. My father worked in Halabja's electricity office, and we farmed for a few months every year. When I was 4, an Iraqi Army convoy passed by our farm. It was the summer of 1983, three years into the Iran-Iraq war, and as my family stood in the fields, a rocket was fired at the convoy from the Iranian mountains. It exploded yards from our house. Shrapnel took half my right knee. My grandmother was hit in the head. She died from her injuries a few months later. Mine healed, though never fully. Halabja always seemed to be under bombardment. Finally Iraqi airplanes attacked my town with chemical weapons, killing 5,000 civilians in just a few hours. Many were family friends and relatives. Growing up in this situation, I grew weary of war, but I also, in some way, lost my fear of it. 
In 2003, when the United States threatened war against Saddam Hussein, I was thrilled. I thought a U.S.-led invasion would overthrow the dreadful man whose wars took my childhood. At the time I was in Turkey as a refugee, and I was hoping to reach Europe or America. But as the war became imminent in early March of that year, I changed my mind. I bought a bus ticket and took a 21-hour trip to my home.
 It was spring, and the entire region had turned green. The mountain peaks were still covered with snow; the hillsides were colorful with wildflowers. I arrived in the city of Sulaimaniya at nightfall as a light rain washed the city. It was too late to continue my journey to Halabja, which was another hour away by car, so I checked into a hotel.
 The next morning, I met a friend at a nearby teahouse. As I was enjoying a glass of black tea, my friend told me about all the foreign journalists pouring into town. Then someone called out, ''Which one is Ayub?'' It was a man in a brown coat. He drove me to a house where two American journalists needed an interpreter to do an interview. They worked for this magazine: Elizabeth Rubin, a writer, and Lynsey Addario, a photographer. They were sitting with a local Kurdish commander waiting for someone to help them talk to him.
 When the interview was finished, they asked me to be their ''fixer.'' The word initially puzzled me. I was two years out of the Teachers' Institute in Sulaimaniya, trained to instruct children in the English alphabet and vocabulary. I would have taught those children that a ''fixer'' is a person who repairs broken machines. But in a war zone, a fixer is a journalist's interpreter, guide, source finder and occasional lifesaver. Every major media organization in Iraq would come to have its fixers. And fixers, it turned out, were well paid. I was offered $100 a day, about 25 times what I could make as a teacher.
 I was 24, and suddenly I was the eyes and ears for some of the world's top journalists. I would spend the next three years as a fixer and watch as my country learned a painful lesson: sometimes when you try to fix something, you break it even more. 
 The trigger of war was pulled on the morning of March 20, 2003. It wasn't long before fixers were dying in the line of duty, which made me and others like me think twice about our new jobs. Kamaran Abdurazaq Muhamed was a fixer with BBC-TV. Soon after the war started, he went to help film what was to be an American bombing mission aimed at an Iraqi Army position. A U.S. warplane mistakenly dropped a bomb on a convoy of U.S. Special Forces and Kurdish soldiers. The accident killed 18 people and injured 45, among them Kamaran. He later died. 
 When Baghdad fell, on April 9, 2003, journalists in the north wanted to go south. Until then I had never seen Baghdad, the capital of my country. As a child I always thought of Baghdad as a big city crowded with people and cars at night, but now the city was dark and lifeless -- a sad place. 
 In Baghdad, too, the journalists were hiring fixers. I quickly became friends with fixers for National Public Radio, Knight Ridder, The Boston Globe, the BBC and The Times of London. To them I was a novelty because the Kurdish areas of Iraq had essentially split from the rest of the country in 1991. The fixers would quiz me about the north, and I asked them for directions and addresses in Baghdad when I needed them. I supported the war, as did many of my countrymen and pretty much all the fixers. We thought that only a powerful outside force could take on the job of ousting Saddam. The war also brought an economic boom. People began to refurbish their houses. In some streets, the sidewalks were piled with boxes containing TV sets, air-conditioners and other appliances. People thought Iraq would become a kind of 51st state. Everyone wanted to find a job with a news agency, a foreign company or the U.S. Army. Speaking English was a key for success in ''the new Iraq,'' so English schools sprang up around Baghdad. 
 I rented an apartment in Karrada, a Christian neighborhood in Baghdad. One Friday I was wandering Mutanabi Street, which has a book market with a popular teahouse. In one of the bookstores I found 27 Agatha Christies in English. I wanted to buy them all because I love her books. Instead, Elizabeth bought them and gave them to me as a present. I sat and relaxed at that teahouse, drinking tea and browsing through my new books. It was one of the happiest days of my life. 
 n a televised address on May 1, 2003, President Bush announced, ''Major combat operations in Iraq have ended.'' But the war had only entered a new phase. A few weeks after Bush's announcement, American troops were battling insurgents across Iraq. Humvees were being blown up by roadside bombs, and some Iraqis were beginning to settle old scores among themselves, often fatally. All of these were stories for the Western journalists. 
 My responsibilities as a fixer were rapidly expanding. I was not only taking reporters around the country and interpreting for them and then choosing safe routes home, but I was also finding people to be interviewed. Then, five months into the new phase of the war, Elizabeth was leaving Iraq, which meant I was out of a job. But before she left, she introduced me to Quil Lawrence, an American reporter for the BBC who worked for the show ''The World.'' 
 Quil needed a fixer, and I was very excited to work with him. I grew up listening to the BBC; my father was fond of radio, and he used to listen to the Arabic and Persian services. Almost every morning I woke to the sound of Big Ben. At 19, I bought my own radio to listen to the BBC; this is how I started learning English. After a while I memorized the names of all the BBC programs and their reporters. I would daydream about being a radio reporter and having a ''sign off'' as a foreign correspondent. 
 Every morning, Quil and I would set out for interviews along with our driver, Abdulrazzaq. We did political reports as well as human-interest stories on reconstruction, the printing of new textbooks, the release of new albums by local singers. From the beginning, I watched carefully as reporters asked questions. When I began working with radio reporters, I also learned the techniques of recording. But I was still trying to figure out the rules of journalism. Every time we interviewed someone I thought we had enough to write a story, but the reporters always wanted to meet a variety of people. I thought to myself, But that guy told us everything. I did not understand the concept of interviewing multiple sources. 
 Other Iraqi journalists were getting a similar education. During Saddam's regime, the media were controlled by the state, and journalism was not an enviable profession. But only a few months after Saddam was toppled, there were more than 100 newspapers being published in Baghdad alone. Newsboys stood on street corners with packs of colorful newspapers on their shoulders. It was a turning point in the history of the Iraqi media. 
 Soon, however, the situation in Iraq grew much worse. The insurgency spread to cities, and all foreign nationals became targets. The fixers were in danger, too. The insurgents hated fixers. They called us ''collaborators.'' They broke into my apartment three times in Baghdad, but luckily I wasn't there. Many of my fixer friends received letters from armed groups ordering them to quit their jobs or they would be killed. At times, fixers have been killed without warning. Just two weeks ago, Khalid W. Hassan, a 23-year-old interpreter and reporter with The New York Times in Baghdad, was on his way to the bureau when he was stopped by gunmen and shot dead.
 Though fixers run as many and often more risks than Western reporters, we haven't had the same protections. There have been no insurance plans to cover us, no guidelines on what we should wear or when it is O.K. for us to travel for a story. As Iraqi natives, we have been expected to use our judgment about these things. Even large American newspapers like The Times can't guarantee that they will be able to help fixers if they become targets. And while American news organizations have often supported fixers' applications for visas to the United States, the U.S. government does not see itself as having a special obligation to them.
 Many Americans don't realize how central Iraqis are to bringing them the news they read every morning -- that if Iraqis didn't risk their lives everyday, Western reporters wouldn't be able to do their jobs. But most of the journalists we worked with knew, even before we did, that they would come to rely on us more and more. 
 One day, Quil and I were sitting in our hotel-room studio when he turned to me and said it was time for me to learn how to edit sound on the computer and file radio pieces myself. 
 I asked him why.
 ''One day we won't be able to come to this country anymore,'' he said. ''You fixers will have to replace us.'' 
 In March 2004, insurgents in Falluja killed four American contractors, mutilating their bodies and hanging two of them from a bridge over the Euphrates. As U.S. troops entered the city to battle Sunni insurgents, the followers of the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr began clashing with coalition forces throughout Iraq. This countrywide revolt signaled the end of even the little safety foreign reporters still enjoyed. Often, now, they were afraid to leave their hotel rooms. Increasingly, they were asking their fixers to go out and do interviews for them. It was challenging, but we were happy to do it on our own -- and honestly, it was a huge relief to no longer have to worry about the reporters' safety. I began going out with the radio equipment to interview the police, militia leaders and people on the street. I would take the tape back to the hotel and give it to the reporter or reporters I was working for. Sometimes a reporter would call me on my cellphone and tell me whom to interview and even what questions to ask. And sometimes I would do my own article. Some fixers had so much autonomy -- this was especially true of those who worked with print journalists -- that after doing interviews and research for an article they would get a byline in a foreign paper. 
 In the fall of 2004 Iraq's political parties were preparing for general elections. At the same time, American troops were preparing for their second attack on Falluja -- to make the city ''safe for voters,'' they said. In this assault many hundreds of Iraqis, among them civilians, were killed. The attack came seven months after the disclosure of the torture of Iraqi prisoners at Abu Ghraib. I had always justified the war by saying it would bring democracy and freedom. But when I saw the pictures of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib, I was so disgusted that I wanted to give up my job as a fixer and anything else that had to do with the English language and America. 
 Amid my anger and disillusionment, I recognized that as a journalist I was in the right place to help Iraq. A few weeks before the elections, Quil told me it was time for me to do my own radio pieces. With the recording equipment in my bag, I set off. First I went to the headquarters of the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. At the gate I introduced myself as a BBC reporter and showed the guard my press badge. 
 They ushered me into a room that had a set of new and comfortable sofas. A man in a blue suit stepped into the room and introduced himself as the party's spokesman. A moment later a young man brought us two cups of tea, which we sipped while talking. When the interview was over, I noticed the man seemed very happy to meet a BBC reporter. If only he had known how I was feeling. I was so nervous the entire time, sitting with the spokesman of the most powerful party and dealing with all the equipment. The minute the interview ended, I couldn't remember the taste of the tea or a single sentence he said. Luckily I managed to work the tape recorder properly. 
 Over the next two days I met a range of politicians and people in the street. The Iraqis I talked to were angry about the plan to attack Falluja. One man told me, ''You cannot hold an election on the blood of Iraqis.'' I took the tapes back to the office, and I sat down to write my script. Finally it was time to read my piece over an ISDN line that would allow me to be recorded in the studios in Boston. My report was broadcast the next day. The only way for me to listen to my story was via the Internet, so I logged in and listened to it over and over again. I was not paid for that story because I was still in training, but my ''sign off'' dream had finally come true. 
 ''For The World, this is Ayub Nuri, in Baghdad.'' 
 There was so much for me to learn. I especially wanted to improve my writing skills so that I might one day write for foreign newspapers. I often found radio frustrating. I would work on a story for a week, and it would air for only four minutes. A newspaper article would stay around for at least a day, I thought to myself. I had also had enough of covering the everyday violence and needed to get away. My American journalist friends encouraged me to apply to Columbia University's journalism school. It was an online application, with which I was unfamiliar, but my friends helped me out with the process. 
 Last summer, I received a scholarship from Columbia. I was very excited to begin that new experience and get away from the war for a while. Unfortunately, the American Embassy in Baghdad -- the biggest U.S. embassy in the world, with thousands of employees -- does not issue many visas, so Iraqi citizens have to risk their lives driving through hostile areas where the insurgency is still at its strongest to get to Jordan and apply for visas at the embassy there. I spent several thousand dollars flying back and forth to Jordan applying for my student visa. Then I waited 47 days while the Department of Homeland Security screened my application. I checked my e-mail eagerly until the weeks of waiting killed my excitement. Finally, at 2 o'clock one morning, my phone rang, and I was told that my visa was ready. I had only a few hours to say goodbye to my family. I landed at Kennedy Airport the night before my classes started. 
 Soon I faced a big challenge. The first semester, I had a class called Reporting and Writing I. I was assigned to cover Sunset Park in Brooklyn. When I interviewed people there, I did not understand many of the things they said. In class, I would sit with a dozen American students, and the professor would be talking about something, and suddenly everyone was laughing -- but I had no idea why. One day during a local primary election, I stepped into a class, and my adjunct professor said, ''Ayub, you are going to cover the S.P. Maloney race.'' I did not know what S.P. Maloney meant, and by ''race'' I wondered if he meant a horse race or the human race. 
 Several other Iraqi fixers have also come to the United States to attend journalism school. We all face the same problem: understanding local issues. One, Omar Fekeiki, now studies at U.C. Berkeley's journalism school. ''In Iraq I was a king, but here I am nothing,'' Omar complained to me on the phone one day. ''Now I need a fixer myself.'' When we left Iraq, we were all planning to go back after graduation. But the worsening war has made return all but impossible. We are stranded here. Every time we speak with our families on the phone, they tell us not to come home. 
 ''At least one less person to worry about,'' they say.
 Many of the fixers fled Iraq and are now refugees in neighboring countries. Those who remained risk their lives every day. Some of them have big families to feed, so they stay. But some fixers I know refuse to leave the country merely out of loyalty to their trade. We welcomed the U.S. war with a lot of hope. We changed careers and became fixers to help Iraq. Some of us paid with our lives. Now we are no longer sure we will ever be able to fix anything.

HEADLINE: Helicopters Can Hush Themselves

BYLINE: By Todd Rome. 
Todd Rome is the president and co-founder of Blue Star Jets.

DATELINE: Southampton 

 BODY:
THE number of helicopters flying low over eastern Long Island has risen steadily in the past few years. And noise complaints are up. As the president of a company that books helicopters to Long Island and a resident of Southampton, I can attest to the increasing chop chop of whirlybirds overhead.
The problem needs to be addressed without delay. But Senator Charles Schumer's solution, to require that the Federal Aviation Administration study ways to divert helicopter flight paths away from homes, is not a good one. It would be far too complicated and costly. A much easier and less expensive approach would be to work with helicopter operators to voluntarily reduce noise. 
 Part of the reason helicopters are so difficult to regulate is that they are not all alike and do not all generate the same amount of noise. Age, size and other factors make some louder than others. (The newer models are typically the quietest.) Helicopters also have a broad range of flying abilities. Some can always follow flight patterns that keep them up high or out over the water. But those that lack the kind of navigation equipment needed to maneuver in fog sometimes need to move inland and lower for better visibility. 
 Helicopters serving a variety of purposes -- including traffic reporting, heavy lifting for construction, law enforcement and air ambulance work -- fly over eastern Long Island. And though Senator Schumer suggests that emergency and news helicopters should be exempt from flight pattern regulations in times of emergency, he does not anticipate how these helicopters could clog flight corridors, or suggest where other helicopters should go when they do.
 Nor does he take into account the many different airports on eastern Long Island. As often happens in busy airspaces, helicopters and other small aircraft are pushed out by airplanes carrying more passengers. When flight patterns are interrupted in this way, helicopter pilots need to move out of the corridor to keep traffic moving. 
 To regulate helicopter routes would also be bad for the economy, given how fast the helicopter industry is now growing. Helicopter operators from outside the New York region would be discouraged from flying here, and that could put a damper on local business.
 Helicopter owners and operators have already demonstrated their willingness to cut back on noise. In the late '90s, when noise complaints about sightseeing helicopters in New York City skyrocketed, the F.A.A. worked with local operators to develop voluntary strategies like not flying in the early morning or after dark and keeping whenever possible to routes over the Hudson and East Rivers. The result was a significant reduction in the number of noise complaints. Many of the same Manhattan operators also run choppers out to Long Island. One way to begin to resolve the noise problem on eastern Long Island would be to simply expand the scope of the New York City agreements.
 Indeed, steps are already being taken to reduce flight noise in residential areas. East Hampton Airport, the most popular landing place, has established noise abatement policies that govern helicopters. It now requires, for example, that helicopters maintain high altitude until they are cleared to land, and that they land by 11 p.m. And several companies are now working to develop technology that will aid aircraft in finding quieter flight routes. 
 My company, Blue Star Jets, has asked all the helicopter companies that fly our customers to keep above 2,000 feet when over residential areas; to fly over water, railroad tracks and highways whenever possible; and to land before 11 p.m. at East Hampton Airport and before dark at the Southampton helipad. Though in instances of bad weather or heavy air traffic, these policies sometimes cannot be followed, if they are taken as general rules, noise will be diminished.
 Senator Schumer and the residents of eastern Long Island should spare taxpayers the expense and trouble of writing federal regulations, and instead work cooperatively with helicopter operators to reduce noise.

HEADLINE: Our War on Terror

BYLINE: By Samantha Power. 
Samantha Power is the Anna Lindh professor of the practice of global leadership at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard.

 BODY:
The day after the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush declared the strikes by Al Qaeda ''more than acts of terror. They were acts of war.'' Bush's ''war on terror'' was ''not a figure of speech,'' he said. Rather, it was a defining framework. The war, Bush announced, would begin with Al Qaeda, but would ''not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.'' The global war on terror, he said, was the ''inescapable calling of our generation.'' 
The phrase and the agenda that grew out of it caught on, and from 9/11 onward, the administration used its pulpit to propagate several new premises. First, with the threat of Islamic radical terrorism, new rules, new tools and new mind-sets had to be devised to meet the novelty of the menace. As Vice President Dick Cheney put it, ''old doctrines of security do not apply.'' The criminal justice approach of trying terrorists would have to be scrapped, supplanted by a military approach. Second, we were told, the states that sponsored terrorism or offered lodging to terrorists had to be treated the same way as those nonstate actors who carried out the threats. Even more dramatically, America's friends had to prove their loyalty by taking concrete steps in our global war. As Bush put it, the ''duties'' of peace-loving people ''involve more than sympathy or words. No nation can be neutral.'' By requiring governments to step up, we would be able to root out the unreliable and distribute sanctions and favors accordingly.
 Third, since international treaties and institutions often constrained Washington's ability to combat terrorism on its own terms, they should be dipped into and exploited selectively. While it was true that other countries valued those laws and institutions, the gravity of the terrorist threat would ultimately unite nations with shared interests. The urgency of the common cause would override choosiness about the means. Our allies would need us more than we would need them, so we could count on them to rally to our side in a crunch.
 And fourth, in Bush's view, wartime demanded a strong commander in chief, and he would be far more effective prosecuting the war if he could free himself of the meddlesome legislative, judicial and even interagency checks fashionable in peacetime. Surely, Bush's team argued, the extreme continuing threats to our national security warranted a dramatic expansion of presidential power.
 Six years later, most Americans still rightly believe that the United States must confront Islamic terrorism -- and must be relentless in preventing terrorist networks from getting weapons of mass destruction. But Bush's premises have proved flawed, and the war-on-terror frame has obscured more than it has clarified.
 As with the war on drugs and the war on crime, the invocation of ''war'' initially seemed metaphorical (we do not send the 82nd Airborne into downtown Detroit to combat street crime). But in the terrorism context, war proved less a rhetorical frame than a strategic assertion that armed conflict (that is, ground and air invasions of other countries) was the main tool the United States should employ to neutralize terrorism. The United Nations-endorsed war against the Taliban regime in Afghanistan gave way to a period in which the Bush administration used its post-9/11 political capital to smuggle its pre-existing anti-Saddam Hussein agenda to the fore -- with disastrous results for American forces, for Iraq and for the wider strategic goal of eliminating Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups.
 Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld offered perhaps the best standard by which to measure the Bush administration's performance: ''Are we capturing, killing or deterring and dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas and the radical clerics are recruiting, training and deploying against us?'' Leaked intelligence reports have shown that the answer is negative. The administration's tactical and strategic blunders have crippled American military readiness; exposed vulnerabilities in training, equipment and force structure; and accelerated terrorist recruitment. In short, although the United States has not been directly hit since 9/11, we are less safe as a result of the Bush administration's rhetoric, conduct and strategy.
 The war rhetoric has raised expectations that a ''complete victory'' is not only possible, but in fact necessary (even as Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy preamble reminds us that it will be a ''global enterprise of uncertain duration''). That same rhetoric has licensed the executive branch to remove itself from traditional legal frameworks and consolidate power in imperial fashion. And the torture, kidnappings and indefinite detentions carried out at the behest of senior administration officials have blurred the moral distinction between ''us'' and ''them'' on which much of Bush's logic rested.
 While our allies still share intelligence with us in order to combat domestic terrorism, our disavowal of international law has made it harder for our friends to contribute military and even financial resources to shore up failing states like Afghanistan, which is portrayed by the opposition in countries like Canada and the Netherlands as one of Bush's wars. Many of our friends believe that too close an association with American objectives will make them electorally vulnerable and their cities potential targets.
 Moreover, by branding the cause a war and calling the enemy terror, the administration has lumped like with unlike foes and elevated hostile elements from the ranks of the criminal (stigmatized in all societies) to the ranks of soldiers of war (a status that carries connotations of sacrifice and courage). Although anybody taking aim at the American superpower would have seemed an underdog, the White House's approach enhanced the terrorists' cachet, accentuating the image of self-sacrificing Davids taking up slingshots against a rich, flaccid, hypocritical Goliath. In rejecting the war-on-terror frame recently, Hilary Benn, the British secretary of state for international development, argued: ''What these groups want is to force their individual and narrow values on others, without dialogue, without debate, through violence. And by letting them feel part of something bigger, we give them strength.''
 But criticizing the calamities of the last six years of American foreign policy has become all too easy. And it does not itself improve our approach to combating terrorist threats that do in fact loom large -- larger, in fact, because of Bush's mistakes. The challenge now is to accept that just because George W. Bush hyped the threat does not mean the threat should be played down. Rather, we must urgently set about reversing the harm done to the nation's standing and security by simultaneously reasserting the moral difference between the United States and Islamic terrorists and by developing a 21st-century toolbox to minimize actual terrorist threats. Several new books take up this challenge, each addressing a different piece of the national security predicament. Together, they allow one to begin to define a new approach to counterterrorism.
 If the United States is to reduce the terrorist threat (diminishing both the probability of attack and the likely scale of harm), the next president must do a far better job of improving the security of civilians abroad, discerning and exploiting fissures among our enemies, persuading our allies to share the burdens of tackling terrorism and strengthening our capacity to withstand attacks at home. None of these steps will be taken in earnest unless we acknowledge the fallacies not simply of Bush's post-9/11 policies but also of his post-9/11 premises. One question in particular hangs over this discussion: Are the American and international publics so disenchanted with Bush's effort to curb terrorism the wrong way that they will deprive his successor of the resources he or she needs to change course?
 The book to begin with in looking for a revised 21st-century strategy is, unexpectedly, the landmark U.S. Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual (University of Chicago, paper, $15). It was released as a government document in December 2006, but owing to its enormous popularity (1.5 million downloads in the first month alone), it has now been published by a university press, with a provocative, highly readable new foreword and introduction that testify to the manual's ''paradigm-shattering'' content. 
 When the terrorists struck on 9/11, the United States military was singularly unprepared to deal with them. One reflection of the Pentagon's mind-set at the time was the fact that the Army counterinsurgency manual had not been updated since 1986 and the Marine Corps guide had not been revised since 1980.
 This lack of preparedness showed. In Afghanistan and Iraq, the armed forces did not have the appropriate intelligence, linguistic capabilities, weapons, equipment, force structures, civil affairs know-how or capacity to train security forces in other countries. ''It is not unfair to say that in 2003 most Army officers knew more about the U.S. Civil War than they did about counterinsurgency,'' Lt. Col. John A. Nagl writes in the foreword to the University of Chicago edition. But while the Bush administration dug in, refusing to admit how ill-suited its premises were to the new century, American military officers revised their old doctrines on the fly.
 The leading architect of the manual was David Petraeus, then a lieutenant general, who commanded the 101st Airborne Division in the initial invasion of Iraq in 2003 and took responsibility for governing Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, immediately thereafter. He is now the overall American commander in Iraq. Petraeus emphasized economic and political development and is said to have asked his soldiers, ''What have you done for the people of Iraq today?'' He worked with another military man who also saw that his job would have to be more than strictly military -- Lt. Gen. James Mattis, who commanded the First Marine Division during the initial invasion and then in 2004 returned to help stabilize Anbar Province. His division motto was ''No Better Friend, No Worse Enemy -- First Do No Harm.'' In February 2006, while the new counterinsurgency doctrine was still being drafted, and while international criticism of American military excesses mounted, Petraeus invited journalists, human rights lawyers, academics and practitioners of counterinsurgency to Fort Levenworth to vet a draft, initiating what participants characterized as one of the most open and productive exchanges of ideas they had ever witnessed.
 The fundamental premise of the manual is that the key to successful counterinsurgency is protecting civilians. The manual notes: ''An operation that kills five insurgents is counterproductive if collateral damage leads to the recruitment of 50 more insurgents.'' It suggests that force size be calculated in relation not to the enemy, but to inhabitants (a minimum of 20 counterinsurgents per 1,000 residents). It emphasizes the necessity of coordination with beefed-up civilian agencies, which are needed to take on reconstruction and development tasks. 
 The most counterintuitive, as well as the most politically difficult, premise of the manual is that the American military must assume greater risk in order to gather much-needed intelligence and, in the end, achieve greater safety. The emphasis of the 1990s on force protection is overturned by the assertion of several breathtaking paradoxes: ''Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be.'' ''Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is.'' ''Sometimes doing nothing is the best reaction.'' Sarah Sewall, a former Pentagon official who teaches at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (and a close colleague of mine), has contributed an introduction that should be required reading for anybody who wants to understand the huge demands effective counterinsurgency will place on the military and the voting public. ''Those who fail to see the manual as radical probably don't understand it,'' she writes, ''or at least what it's up against.''
 Sewall can say what the generals who devised the manual cannot. She addresses the concern that the manual is nothing more than a ''marketing campaign for an inherently inhumane concept of war,'' arguing that if politicians continue to put young American men and women in harm's way, military leaders have an obligation to enhance effectiveness, which in a globalized era cannot be disentangled from taking better care of civilians. Military actions that cause civilian deaths, she argues, are not simply morally questionable; they are self-defeating. 
 But Sewall explains that even if the military can overcome the substantial challenges of executing such a counterintuitive doctrine -- and here the near-daily reports of large-scale civilian loss of life as a result of United States counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan and Iraq are a reminder of the yawning gap between theory and practice -- it will not succeed if it does not get the civilian leadership and support it needs. The military does not have the expertise to perform the range of economic and political tasks associated with nation-building, but in Iraq and Afghanistan, as civilian reconstruction teams went unstaffed, it was forced to pinch-hit. Sewall rightly calls for the ''risks and costs of counterinsurgency'' to be spread across the American government, but notes this is not an overnight job. ''More people play in Army bands than serve in the U.S. foreign service,'' she writes. 
 The manual shows that the demands of counterinsurgency are greater than those the American public has yet been asked to bear. Sewall is skeptical that the public -- now feeling burned by Iraq -- will muster the will, even in Afghanistan, to ''supply greater concentrations of forces, accept higher casualties, fund serious nation-building and stay many long years to conduct counterinsurgency by the book.''
 While the United States military's new counterinsurgency doctrine is based on achieving legitimacy with the local population, Ian Shapiro, a professor of political science at Yale, believes American foreign policy as a whole must vastly increase its legitimacy if it is to defang terrorists in the long term. For this to happen, he writes in his book CONTAINMENT: Rebuilding a Strategy Against Global Terror (Princeton University, $24.95), the president's critics in the Democratic Party must stop freezing like ''donkeys in the headlights'' in the face of Bush's war on terror and instead put forth an alternative strategy. ''You can't beat something with nothing,'' he insists. Shapiro argues for a return to the cold war rubric of ''containment'' -- a halfway house between ''appeasement and the chimerical aspiration to achieve U.S. control over the global security environment.''
 While Bush's 2002 National Security Strategy preamble says that in the ''new world,'' the ''only path to peace and security is the path of action,'' Shapiro shows how aggressive action has played into the hands of terrorist recruiters. When vital interests are imperiled, war may be necessary, he concedes. But generally the United States will invite fewer threats if, rather than attempting to achieve military hegemony, it employs economic, political and law-enforcement tools. ''The idea behind containment,'' Shapiro writes, ''is to refuse to be bullied, while at the same time declining to become a bully.''
 Shapiro is at his most persuasive when he argues against lumping Islamic radical threats together. He points out that at the time of the cold war, George Kennan, the formulator of the containment policy, warned against treating Communism as a monolith. Policy makers, Kennan said, ought to emphasize the differences among and within Communist groups and ''contribute to the widening of these rifts without assuming responsibility.'' The Bush administration, by contrast, has grouped together a hugely diverse band of violent actors as terrorists, failing to employ divide-and-conquer tactics. 
 Although it is tempting to feel overwhelmed by the diversity of the threats aligned against the United States, Shapiro says that very diversity presents us with opportunities, since it ''creates tensions among our adversaries' agendas, as well as openings for competition among them.'' To pry apart violent Islamic radicals, the United States has to become knowledgeable about internal cleavages and be patient in exploiting them. Arguably, this is what American forces in Iraq are doing belatedly -- and perilously -- as they undertake the high-risk approach of turning Sunni ex-Baathists against Qaeda forces.
 Shapiro argues, much as the Counterinsurgency Field Manual does, that the United States must learn to get inside the minds of its enemies, to try to see the world as they do. Take Iran, for example. A Bush administration that had stepped into Iran's shoes might have toned down its inflammatory rhetoric, having seen that the American occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq would be, in Shapiro's words, ''as if the Soviet Union had occupied Canada and Mexico at the height of the cold war, and had its fleet anchored off Cuba.'' United States intelligence capacities, he says, must be revamped so that policy makers in Washington can guard against a ''propensity to confuse leaders the United States might regard as desirable with leaders who actually enjoy legitimacy on the ground.''
 Had President Bush adopted Shapiro's approach on Sept. 12, 2001, it is quite likely that he would have had more success in marginalizing adversaries. Security Council powerhouses like Russia and China would still have thrown their weight around in ways that the administration would have found problematic, but Washington would have been better able to coerce or persuade the fence sitters. Today, however, containment is more challenging than it was before 9/11, or in the days of the cold war. 
 In addition, for containment to work, Washington needs to be able to deliver credible threats. The irony of Bush's flawed approach is that it has exposed the limits of American enforcement tools, stretching military and financial resources beyond recognition. This has a doubly negative effect: it emboldens those who need to be contained, and it deters those we once might have counted on for help in doing the containing.
 Shapiro seems consoled by his belief that the threat we now face is not new -- that the potential accessibility of weapons of mass destruction has not changed anything fundamental in the global order from the cold war years. Nuclear weapons, he writes, are too hard to assemble, and biological agents too hard to store; chemical weapons, though a genuine danger, are not a new one. ''Nothing in the nature of the materials themselves,'' he says, ''presents a qualitatively new threat.'' But here, he seems far too eager to minimize the threat, perhaps fearing that by conceding any aspect of the Bush doctrine, he somehow legitimizes the whole flawed approach. In fact, after six years of dishonesty and alarmism, it seems especially important -- if challenging -- to retain a capacity for grave, calibrated concern about the proliferation of nuclear aspirant states and their proud ties to terrorist networks.
 How real is the difference between our foes and us? One of the most incisive challenges to current debates comes from Talal Asad, whose On Suicide Bombing (Columbia University, $19.95) argues that the distinction between what Bush calls ''us'' and ''them'' exists in the heads of Western leaders, publics and intellectuals, but not in reality. Asad, a professor of anthropology at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, takes aim less at the Bush administration than at the rest of us, and at what he sees as our unspoken complicity in ''some kinds of cruelty as opposed to others.'' He hopes, he writes, to ''disturb the reader sufficiently'' by showing the hypocrisy of rules that permit murderous conduct by states but deny it to nonstate actors. And he is angered by scholars, theorists and journalists who don't speak Arabic and have never set foot in the Middle East, yet sound off about why suicide bombers do what they do. He is understandably aghast that the American public has expressed so little shock over the bloodshed inflicted in its name. And by the end of the book, his rage has overtaken him. The Bush administration's actions in the Middle East have left him so disgusted that he declares simply, ''It seems to me that there is no moral difference between the horror inflicted by state armies (especially if those armies belong to powerful states that are unaccountable to international law) and the horror inflicted by insurgents.''
 It is hard to answer Asad's argument without drifting into the distinctions he attempts to demolish. For instance, he cites the political philosopher Michael Walzer's definition of the ''peculiar evil of terrorism,'' which, according to Walzer, is ''not only the killing of innocent people but also the intrusion of fear into everyday life, the violation of private purposes, the insecurity of public spaces, the endless coerciveness of precaution.'' Asad then asks why the United States' war in Iraq and the Israeli cluster bombs in Lebanon do not earn the same condemnation as bombs wielded by terrorists. But if you continue to believe (as I do) that there is a moral difference between setting out to destroy as many civilians as possible and killing civilians unintentionally and reluctantly in pursuit of a military objective, you will indeed find ''On Suicide Bombing'' disturbing, if not always in the way he intends. 
 Nonetheless, Asad's book is valuable because the legal distinctions he is challenging are especially vulnerable now. They are vulnerable sociologically, in that millions -- if not billions -- of people around the world do not see the difference between a suicide bomber's attack on a pizzeria and an American attack on what turns out to be a wedding party. Asad's challenge is one politicians must answer if they stand any chance of recapturing hearts and minds. At the same time, when a war is fought on false grounds, like that in Iraq, the notion of ''collateral damage'' breaks down, since one must ask what civilian harm could possibly be justified in a war that was itself unnecessary.
 Revamping our approach to terrorism requires changes that extend far beyond the battlefields of Iraq all the way back to the American homefront. Remarkably, despite six years of warnings about ''imminent threats'' and inevitable mushroom clouds, the Bush administration has not led the country into taking precautions that would reduce mass casualties in the event of a major terrorist strike. The White House's emphasis on war has come at the expense of homefront preparedness. For Stephen Flynn, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, we are a surprisingly ''brittle nation.'' 
 By defining American security objectives in military terms, the Bush administration has failed to set achievable goals that could vastly decrease the human and financial damage from a large-scale attack at home. While the United States military has done its best to adjust to the inadequacies recent conflicts have exposed, almost no meaningful midcourse corrections have been made on the homefront, Flynn argues in The Edge of Disaster: Rebuilding a Resilient Nation (Random House, $25.95) -- not in educating the public, training emergency responders, fortifying ''soft targets,'' securing hazardous materials or strengthening critical infrastructure.
 Regardless of how catastrophic or imminent one believes the threats are, and regardless of whether American legitimacy can be retrieved abroad, the government has an obligation to protect its citizens and its infrastructure from future attack. Flynn reminds us of the importance of ''resiliency'' -- the ability to recover from a disaster. ''A society that can match its strength to deliver a punch with the means to take one,'' he writes, ''makes an unattractive target.''
 Flynn observes that the twin catastrophes of 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina testify to major gaps in our preparedness and competence. He calls for open debates about our vulnerabilities. Exposing our weaknesses will not empower our foes, he insists, but will help build broad support at home for a reallocation of resources. ''What makes a disaster a true catastrophe,'' Flynn says, ''has more to do with our own acts of omission or commission than with the forces that lie beyond our control.'' Publicity and free discussion are necessary to produce political action.
 None of the recommendations outlined in any of these books would be easy to achieve under the best of circumstances. But what is striking is how few have even been pursued. The Bush administration's unwillingness to admit failure causes it to cling to a flawed approach rather than revisit its premises, adopt a new strategy or experiment with new tactics.
 The president, apparently, remains determined to treat the American people as if they have no role to play in what will, in fact, be a ''global struggle of uncertain duration.'' In a January interview with Jim Lehrer, Bush was asked why he hadn't called for more Americans to ''sacrifice something.'' He said: ''Well, you know, I think a lot of people are in this fight. I mean, they sacrifice peace of mind when they see the terrible images of violence on TV every night.''
 The effect of such an attitude is not simply that the American military will continue to bear the lion's share of the national security burden -- a burden, the Counterinsurgency Field Manual practically screams out, the military cannot meet alone. It is that the American public, with little faith in the credibility of the government's claims, may deny even cleareyed leaders the resources they need to meet the complex demands of neutralizing modern threats.h
 Will the United States military have to assume greater risks to achieve greater safety in the end?

HEADLINE: Congestion Pricing, Still Alive

 BODY:
There were more fits than starts along the way, but lawmakers in Albany last week finally passed legislation that keeps the city's congestion pricing proposal alive. The bill was a critical, if belated, step, deserving of bows by all concerned, starting with Gov. Eliot Spitzer, legislative leaders and Mayor Michael Bloomberg. There's much more work to be done, however, before New York can begin to get a handle on gridlock and pollution by reducing the number of cars and trucks on its streets. 
The bill authorizes a commission to draw up a plan to mitigate traffic congestion; among the proposals to be considered is congestion pricing, which means charging drivers a fee to enter the central city, as Mr. Bloomberg has proposed. This was not a complete victory for the mayor. There are many pitfalls ahead requiring negotiation, beginning with the selection of the panel's 17 members, who must at least be open to the mayor's courageous vision.
 A final plan would have to be approved by lawmakers in both the City Council and the state legislature. That will inevitably create opportunities for political grandstanding but will also allow for serious discussions, which should include the public. 
 The bill also requires a federal contribution. That is still possible. For various reasons, Albany's lawmakers missed by nearly two weeks a deadline for federal aid set by the Department of Transportation. However, federal officials -- including Transportation Secretary Mary Peters -- have praised the mayor's plan, and have not ruled out giving the city a slice of the $1.2 billion Washington has set aside to help cities ease congestion. 
 Nine cities are competing for a piece of that pie, and the expectation has been that New York would be awarded about $500 million.
 That kind of windfall would buy a lot of additional buses, ferries and subway upgrades -- all needed, and soon, if commuters who now drive are to be coaxed out of their cars and into public transit. Before any fees for cars are charged, mass transportation must be improved; otherwise, the idea loses its legs.
 While other cities have mostly focused on fixing congestion on highways in and around them, the Bloomberg plan is centered on reducing traffic in Manhattan's main business district. The area accounts for nearly half of the region's $900 billion economy, but its streets are a mess. The mayor is betting that the fees will cause drivers to think twice before traveling south of 86th Street in Manhattan.
 Under his plan, cars would pay $8, trucks $21, and tolls from bridges and tunnels would be deducted. The fees could be expected to bring in hundreds of millions of dollars that would be used to expand and improve public transit. Or they could be used to help keep down bus, subway and train fares. 
 Less traffic would also mean quicker commutes, less pollution and a freer flow of commerce. And a larger, positive impact would ripple through the region's roadways, where commutes begin.
 Versions of congestion pricing have been successful in London and Stockholm. Mr. Bloomberg became a convert to the idea as he sought ways to put New York at the forefront of efforts to reduce tailpipe emissions that cause smog and contribute to global warming. Now he -- and the city -- are inching closer to a healthier and cleaner future.

HEADLINE: Sending Back The Doctor's Bill

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
HOW to fix the health care system?
 Easy, liberals say. If Washington would just force cuts in prescription drug prices and insurance company profits, plenty of money would be left over to cover the uninsured.
 Conservatives prefer to argue that the answer lies in forcing people to pay more of their own medical costs.
 But many health care economists say both sides are wrong. These economists, some of whom are also doctors, say the partisan fight over insurers and drug makers is a distraction from a bigger problem: the relatively high salaries paid to American doctors, and even more importantly, the way they are compensated.
 ''I always find it ironic that when I go to doctor groups and such, they always talk about the cost of prescription drugs,'' said Dana Goldman, director of health economics at the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research institute in Santa Monica, Calif. 
 Prescription drugs cost, on average, 30 percent to 50 percent more in the United States than in Europe. But the difference in doctors' salaries is far larger, Dr. Goldman said.
 Doctors in the United States earn two to three times as much as they do in other industrialized countries. Surveys by medical-practice management groups show that American doctors make an average of $200,000 to $300,000 a year. Primary care doctors and pediatricians make less, between $125,000 and $200,000, but in specialties like radiology, physicians can take home $400,000 or more.
 In Europe, however, doctors made $60,000 to $120,000 in 2002, according to a survey sponsored by the British government in 2004.
 Given the years of training that doctors require and the stress and importance of their jobs, few would disagree that they should be well paid. In addition, with a year of medical school now about $30,000, many doctors leave school deeply in debt. And many doctors would argue that cutting salaries would only persuade talented, college graduates to pursue better-paying professions. 
 Still, the lower salaries are a significant part of the reason that European countries spend less on health care than the United States does -- a fact liberals avoid mentioning when they preach the advantages of a European-style single-payer system.
 Americans generally do not seem to mind the fact that doctors are well paid. In public opinion surveys, doctors usually rank as the most trusted professionals. Congress has repeatedly blocked Medicare's efforts to reduce the amount it pays for each procedure doctors perform, even though overall Medicare payments to doctors are soaring and the cuts are legally required to keep the program's budget balanced.
 The way that doctors are paid may be an even more significant factor driving up costs and may lead to unnecessary care, said Dr. Peter B. Bach, a pulmonary physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and a former senior adviser to Medicare and Medicaid.
 In the United States, nearly all doctors are paid piecemeal, for each test or procedure they perform, rather than a flat salary. As a result, physicians have financial incentives to perform procedures that further drive up overall health care spending.
 Doctors are paid little for routine examinations and very little for ''cognitive services,'' such as researching different treatment options or offering advice to help patients get better without treatment.
 ''I don't have a view on whether doctors take home too much money or not enough money,'' Dr. Bach said. ''The problem is the way they earn their money. They have to do stuff. They have to do procedures.''
 Primary care doctors and pediatricians, who rarely perform complex procedures, make less than specialists. They are attracting a declining percentage of medical students, and some states are facing a shortage of primary care doctors. 
 Doctors are also paid whether the procedures they perform go well or badly, Dr. Bach said, and whether they are crucial to a patient's health or not..
 ''Almost all expenditures pass through the pen of a doctor,'' he said. So a doctor may decide to perform a test that costs a total of $4,000 in order to make $800 for himself -- when a cheaper test might work equally well. ''This is a highly inefficient way to pay doctors,'' Dr. Bach said.
 Medicare, especially, does not like to second-guess doctors' clinical decisions, said Dr. Stephen Zuckerman, a health economist at the Urban Institute. ''There's not a lot of utilization review or prior authorization in Medicare,'' he said. ''If you're doing the work, you can expect to get paid.''
 As a result, doctors have steadily increased the number of procedures they perform on Medicare beneficiaries -- and thus have increased their income from Medicare, Dr. Zuckerman said. But the extra procedures have not helped patients' health much, he said. ''I don't think there's any real strong evidence of improvements in health status.''
 Private insurers like H.M.O.'s are more aggressive than Medicare in second-guessing physicians' clinical decisions, and they will refuse to pay for imaging scans or other expensive new procedures. Now Medicare and private insurers are moving cautiously to change the current system. Recently, they have proposed pay-for-performance measures that would give doctors small bonuses if their care meets the standards set by national medical organizations such as the American Heart Association.
 BUT all those measures are a minor fix, said Dr. Alan Garber, a practicing internist and the director of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University. Instead, he argues, the United States should move toward paying doctors fixed salaries, plus bonuses based on the health of the patients they care for.
 Even in the existing system, some health insurers, notably Kaiser Permanente, already have large networks of salaried doctors. But it would require doctors to give up some of their autonomy and move into larger group practices or work directly for insurers, a step they have been reluctant to take. About 40 percent of doctors are in single or two-physician practices, Dr. Garber said.
 Nor is the American Medical Association, which represents doctors, eager for wholesale changes in the system, said Dr. Edward L. Langston, chairman of the A.M.A. board. 
 Insurance company profits and the rising cost of preventable diseases like diabetes are big culprits in soaring health care spending, Dr. Langston said.
 But Dr. Goldman of RAND said that doctors are misleading themselves if they think the current system serves patients' needs.
 For example, if a diabetic patient visits a doctor, he said, ''the doctor is paid to check his feet, they're paid to check his eyes; they're not paid to make sure he goes out and exercises and really, that may be the most important thing.'' 
 ''The whole health-care system is set up to pay for services that are rendered,'' he said, ''when the patient, and society, is interested in health.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 12, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 29 about how doctors' compensation affects health-care costs misstated the views of Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and the director of the Center for Health Policy at Stanford University. He said health care organizations like Kaiser Permanente, which have salaried doctors on staff, are a good model for the future, but he did not say that all doctors should eventually be salaried.

HEADLINE: In All Things Moderation, Including Market Timing

BYLINE: By MARK HULBERT. 
Mark Hulbert is editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest, a service of MarketWatch. E-mail: strategy@nytimes.com

 BODY:
WHEN it comes to making asset allocation decisions in your portfolio, it is best not to be dogmatic. That is the conclusion of a new study, which found that investors are likely to do better over the long term by resisting the advice of those who take extreme positions about how much of their portfolios should be allocated among the various asset classes.
 The new study, ''Predictable Returns and Asset Allocation: Should a Skeptical Investor Time the Market?,'' recently began circulating in academic circles as a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper. A version is available at http://www.nber.org/papers/w13165. Its authors are Jessica A. Wachter, an assistant professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Missaka Warusawitharana, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank in Washington. 
 Asset allocation and market timing are closely related. Market timing refers to jumping into and out of a single asset class in the hopes of participating in rallies and sidestepping declines, like what the domestic stock market experienced last week. Asset allocation is market timing applied to more than one asset class. 
 The extremes in the asset allocation debate are well known. At one pole are those who believe that successful market timing is impossible over the long run, and that it never makes sense to alter a portfolio on the basis of beliefs about the various asset classes' relative attractiveness. The only occasions on which those allocations should be shifted are when an investor's life circumstances have changed; otherwise, it is best to leave these allocations alone.
 At the other extreme are those who believe that, not only is successful market timing theoretically possible, it is not all that difficult in practice. As a result, investors should be willing to make large and frequent changes to how much they allocate to each of the asset classes. In fact, some advisers at this extreme believe that it may make sense to shift an entire portfolio from being invested in equities one day to being completely in bonds the next.
 In their new study, the researchers explored the middle ground between these two extremes. In particular, they were interested in how an investor might behave if he believed that, while the future course of the markets was not completely random, the extent of any predictability was still quite small. As Professor Wachter put it in an interview, such an investor ''is skeptical of the market timers' claims, but not dogmatically so, and therefore willing to modestly alter his asset allocation when the evidence in favor of doing so is particularly compelling.''
 While conceptualizing this nondogmatic skeptic may be relatively straightforward, actually modeling his behavior is complex. To do that, the researchers resorted to a branch of statistics championed by the Rev. Thomas Bayes in the 18th century. His theory shows how to update probabilities in light of new information. It allowed the researchers to quantify the skepticism of their hypothetical investor and then to estimate how his beliefs would change from time to time as the markets either did or did not live up to previous forecasts.
 An example can help make this approach clearer. Imagine an investor whose default asset allocation is to be 65 percent invested in domestic equities and 35 percent in short- and long-term bonds. Imagine further that this investor operates in a hypothetical world in which there is only one stock market timing indicator: the stock market's dividend yield, which has an excellent long-term record, but whose performance over the last 15 years has been checkered. If this investor dogmatically believes that market timing is impossible, of course, his allocation to domestic equities will always be 65 percent. If, however, this investor is at the other extreme and is a strong believer in market timing, he would currently have only 23 percent of his portfolio allocated to domestic equities, Professor Wachter says. That is because the stock market's current dividend yield is so much lower than the historical average, suggesting an overvalued stock market.
 What would be the current allocation to domestic equities of the investor pursuing the researchers' middle-of-the-road approach? It would be 40 percent, according to Professor Wachter -- still markedly lower than the default allocation of 65 percent, but nevertheless a lot higher than the 23 percent allocation of the investor who is a strong proponent of market timing. This allocation reflects the influence of a number of factors, ranging from a general humility about any indicator's ability to continue working to the dividend yield's mixed track record in recent years.
 The proof of the pudding is in the eating, of course. Consider what the researchers found upon calculating the track records of the three approaches to asset allocation that they studied, each of which relied on just the dividend-yield indicator to switch between domestic stocks and short- and long-term bonds. Over the 33 years beginning in 1972 and ending in 2004, the portfolio of the nondogmatic skeptic outperformed those at either extreme in the asset allocation debate. He would have beaten the strong proponent of market timing by an annual average of around 10 percentage points, for example. He furthermore would have outperformed the dogmatic opponent of any market timing whatsoever by an annual average of around one percentage point. 
 PROFESSOR Wachter cautioned that she and her co-researcher couldn't say for sure whether the same conclusion would hold for other market-timing tools.
 But she did say they reached similar results for the one other market-timing indicator that they examined -- the yield spread, which is the difference between the yields on long- and short-term bonds -- and she says that she would not be surprised if the same conclusion held for many other market-timing variables as well.
 These results might strike investors as counterintuitive. If a little market timing is good, shouldn't a lot be better? The reason it isn't, Professor Wachter says, is that even when a good market timing system is right more often than wrong, those wrong times can be disastrous to those who bet on it too heavily.
 The investment implication is clear: While not dismissing market timing, don't bet all-or-nothing on it, either.

HEADLINE: Opponents Pay A Painful Price In Walking Bonds

BYLINE: By DAN ROSENHECK. 
Dan Rosenheck writes for The Economist. E-mail: keepingscore@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Barry Bonds may not have had to overcome the obstacles that Hank Aaron did in trying to become baseball's career home run leader, but Aaron did enjoy one advantage Bonds would dearly appreciate: He rarely lacked for a pitch to hit.
 Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Bonds's late-career surge toward the record is that he has challenged Aaron's mark, 755, despite the best efforts of opposing managers and pitchers to deposit him safely on first base whenever possible. Since 2001, Bonds has drawn walks or been hit by a pitch in more than 30 percent of his plate appearances, and more than half of those walks have come on four consecutive pitches. Giants fans have become so fed up with teams pitching around Bonds that for years they have wielded rubber chickens, which they use to taunt opponents for their cowardice. 
 But if winning is more important than records, San Franciscans should break out in cheers whenever their beleaguered, beloved Bonds trots to first base. Although Bonds's walks may not be able to match one of his laser beams into McCovey Cove for spectacle, opposing teams far more often than not are adding victories to the Giants' ledger when they walk him.
 Walking Bonds is the right move in certain circumstances. But evaluating the treatment of Bonds in the aggregate requires a more sophisticated tool than intuition: a statistic known as Win Expectancy. Although difficult to calculate, Win Expectancy is perhaps the most intuitive statistic ever developed. It is, quite simply, the probability that a player's team will win the game. By comparing the Giants' likelihood of victory if Bonds walks against their chances of winning if he is pitched to, the impact of the decision whether to walk him can be expressed with mathematical certainty. 
 For example, if the 2002 version of Bonds is allowed to hit with the go-ahead run on second base with two outs in the bottom of the ninth, the Giants win the game 69.2 percent of the time. But if he is walked, their probability of victory falls to 62.5 percent. By contrast, if he is allowed to hit with one out in the bottom of the ninth, a man on second, and the Giants trailing by two runs, San Francisco has a 16.8 percent chance of winning, but if he draws a walk, their odds improve to 18.7 percent.
 Tom M. Tango, a co-author of ''The Book: Playing the Percentages in Baseball,'' applied this Win Expectancy framework to every possible game situation -- inning, outs, score differential, and runners on base -- to determine when the seemingly unstoppable Bonds of 2001-4 should have been given a walk.
 Of the 284 official intentional walks Bonds drew in that period, only 80 clearly decreased the Giants' chances of winning, and 91 substantially improved their odds. (The remaining 113 were toss-ups). According to Tango, those 91 ill-advised intentional walks were worth 4.7 wins to San Francisco, including 2.1 in 2004 alone.
 ''Two wins is enormous,'' Tango said. ''It's the equivalent of turning a league-average hitter into someone playing in the All-Star Game.''
 The official intentional walks drawn by Bonds between 2001 and 2004 were actually the least beneficial to his club of all his walks. During the same four years, he drew an additional 136 four-pitch walks not recorded as intentional. Only 6 of those were preferable to pitching to Bonds, and 77 definitely benefited the Giants, resulting in an additional 4.1 wins.
 Since Bonds returned from his 2005 knee injury, he has not been the same hitter -- his slugging percentage has been a merely excellent .550 rather than the stratospheric .800 he posted during his peak -- but opposing clubs continue to treat him as if he is. While most hitters with .550 slugging percentages could expect to receive around 13 intentional walks in the 837 plate appearances Bonds has accumulated the past two seasons, Bonds has received 69. That represents an additional 2.4 wins opposing managers have handed to the Giants.
 So how many home runs has the National League's Bondsophobia cost the slugger? If one simply eliminates the inadvisable official intentional walks from Bonds's record since 2001 and replaces them with the average of his production when he is pitched to, he would have only 11 more home runs than his current total. Yet the results are much more dramatic if all his unwisely granted four-pitch walks, as well as half of the toss-up decisions, are replaced with official at-bats. In that case, Bonds would have blasted a single-season record of 78 home runs in 2001, surpassed Aaron late in 2006, and have continued well into uncharted territory this year, reaching 784 by today. He would still have reached a milestone last week, though: his 3,000th hit.
 Barry Bonds may not be anyone's idea of a great teammate. But every time he takes a pitch, he is truly taking one for the team: passing up a chance at personal glory to edge the Giants closer to victory.

HEADLINE: Family-Leave Values

BYLINE: By Eyal Press. 
Eyal Press is a contributing writer for The Nation. The paperback edition of his book, ''Absolute Convictions: My Father, a City and the Conflict That Divided America,'' was published earlier this year.

 BODY:
When Karen Deonarain was discharged from Prince George's Hospital Center in Maryland following the birth of her daughter, Razia, several years ago, the status of her job did not rank high on her list of worries. ''My main concern was the baby,'' she said one recent afternoon, as a heavy rain drenched the sidewalks outside the cafe where we had arranged to meet.
 Deonarain was 30 when her daughter was born. A small, heavyset woman with a gentle voice and a reserved manner, she worked at the time as a senior claims examiner for a company called Computer Literacy World, which does contract work in data entry and computer-system configuration. She liked the job, though she was in no condition to return to the office after her discharge. The pregnancy had been a difficult one, ending in a weeklong marathon of unnerving medical consultations and impromptu prayer sessions that began when Deonarain's water broke 16 weeks earlier than expected. At one point, her doctor warned her that a baby born so prematurely stood a 50 percent chance of suffering from cerebral palsy. Days later, her 1-pound-10-ounce newborn was wheeled into the neonatal intensive care unit. 
 Deonarain remembers her ordeal being made somewhat easier by the sympathy extended to her by her employer. On Jan. 7, 2004, the day after she was admitted to the hospital and told she should remain there until delivering her child, she says she spoke to her supervisor, a woman named Gwen Tolbert. They kept no written record of their conversations, and the company disputes Deonarain's version of the events. But according to Deonarain, Tolbert told her not to worry and indicated that the company understood the baby's fragile health would likely prevent her from coming back to work until April. The two women chatted again a week later, after Razia was born. This time, Deonarain says, Tolbert congratulated her and said she had already arranged to have some sick leave transferred to her. 
 ''I felt really reassured,'' Deonarain told me. 
 It was almost 10 weeks before Razia was discharged from the hospital. It took considerably less time for Deonarain's sense of reassurance to turn into bewilderment. One morning about six weeks after giving birth, she received a phone call from the mortgage company with which she and her husband had been working to refinance their home. A loan officer informed her that, according to information received from Computer Literacy World, she was no longer on the payroll there -- which, if true, meant the refinancing loan could not be approved. Deonarain told the loan officer not to worry, since she was sure the information was erroneous. After they finished talking, she called Gwen Tolbert. But, Deonarain says, Tolbert told her there had been no mistake: her job had been terminated because she'd failed to contact the company since Jan. 5, 2004, violating a rule requiring workers to account for any absence within three days. 
 Deonarain listened, amazed: she had been at work on Jan. 6, she says, and had spoken to Tolbert herself from the hospital on two occasions after that date. She says she had also been given every indication the company understood she would need time off after the pregnancy. (Computer Literacy World would not comment on the case, and Tolbert did not return calls, but in sworn statements the company has said that after the baby was born, Deonarain promised to let Tolbert know within a few days when she would be returning to work, and that she was fired after Tolbert didn't hear from her for five weeks.) Deonarain remembers being on the phone, pleading for sympathy. ''I was like, 'Please, I need my job -- I have a premature child.' '' Tolbert said that she was sorry, but that the job had already been filled; Deonarain recalls being told that she was welcome to apply for another position, at a lower salary.
 Deonarain did something else instead: after overcoming her initial shock, she got in touch with the D.C. Employment Justice Center, an organization based in Washington that she had heard defended workers' rights. The center referred her to a couple of lawyers, one of them a Maryland attorney named Daniel A. Katz. As he listened to the details of the story, Katz was flabbergasted. He soon started searching about to find grounds for a lawsuit. 
 Until recently, lawsuits claiming workplace discrimination because of family care-giving obligations were rare -- in part because, however harsh it may seem to lose your job under circumstances like Deonarain's, employers could often get away with it. The 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees workers some unpaid time off in the event of a serious health problem, after the birth of a child or to care for a sick family member, but the law's scope is limited. (It doesn't cover companies with fewer than 50 employees, for example. Computer Literacy World had just under 50 at the time.) And no federal antidiscrimination statute exists that explicitly protects family caregivers in the workplace. 
 But what constitutes discrimination in the eyes of the law is changing. And one reason it's changing is that the ranks of people like Karen Deonarain have grown. Since the mid-1990s, the number of workers who have sued their employers for supposed mistreatment on account of family responsibilities -- becoming pregnant, needing to care for a sick child or relative -- has increased by more than 300 percent. More than 1,150 such lawsuits have been filed in federal and state courts, a trend that has not gone unnoticed in the business world, not only because companies are well aware of the negative publicity lawsuits can generate but also because numerous plaintiffs have walked away with hefty damage awards. In one case, a jury granted $11.65 million to a hospital maintenance worker who was penalized for having to care for his elderly parents. In Ohio recently, a jury awarded $2.1 million to an assistant store manager who was demoted because she has several kids. 
 The workers pressing such claims have invoked a dizzying array of laws to prove they were mistreated. Some have relied on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which a number of courts have ruled prohibits not only overt sex discrimination but also seemingly neutral policies that have a disparate impact on women. Others have invoked the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, which covers both individuals with disabilities and, to a lesser extent, the people who care for them. Others still have drawn on the many state and local laws passed in recent years to safeguard the rights of employees with families. 
 The flood of cases reflects not just the increased presence of women in the workplace but also the growing difficulty Americans of all social backgrounds seem to be having in balancing the demands of work and family. Unlike so-called ''glass ceiling'' cases involving women barred from the top rungs of a handful of elite professions, the plaintiffs in these new work-family disputes have ranged across the occupational spectrum, from physicians to police officers to grocery clerks. While not all have become millionaires, more than half have prevailed in court -- a success rate significantly higher than that of more conventional employment-discrimination cases, which is below 20 percent. Beyond causing headaches for their employers, the lawsuits are serving notice that the battle over ''family values'' is no longer just about gay marriage and abortion: it's also about workplace attitudes that some advocates believe do significantly more to undermine family life than those controversial practices do.
 o person has made this argument with more vigor in recent years than Joan C. Williams. A professor at the University of California's Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco, Williams, 55, is tall and slender, with reddish-brown hair and something approaching rock-star status among the small but growing network of lawyers and scholars who litigate or study family-responsibility discrimination cases. I first met Williams in April at the headquarters of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in Washington, where she'd been invited to testify at a hearing on balancing work and family. It was the day after the student massacre at Virginia Tech, and the session opened with a moment of silence. Then Stuart Ishimaru, an E.E.O.C. commissioner, thanked the various panelists for taking the time to share their expertise with the agency, singling out Joan Williams. She had flown to Washington the previous day; she would soon be off to Sacramento, where she was scheduled to testify before the California Legislature, and after that to Colorado, to appear before the National Association for Law Placement. 
 Williams has been racing across the country giving such speeches since 2000, the year her book ''Unbending Gender'' appeared. In the book, which set in motion the legal trend that now consumes much of her time, Williams argued that the growing tension between work and family was not simply a product of economic necessity. It stemmed, rather, from a marketplace structured around an increasingly outdated masculine norm: the ''ideal worker'' who can work full time for an entire career while enjoying ''immunity from family work.'' At a time when both adults in most families had come to participate in the labor force, Williams argued that this standard was unrealistic, especially for women, who remained the primary caregivers in most households. 
 At a Starbucks after the E.E.O.C. hearing, as she sipped tea and picked haphazardly at a brownie, Williams told me she wasn't sure when she wrote the book what the best remedy was. One possibility was legislation -- subsidized child care, generous parental-leave policies -- of the sort many European countries have. Another was for employees to take legal action, an idea she described in the book's most provocative chapter. To show how discrimination can harm caregivers, Williams told the story of a lawyer with sterling performance reviews who was passed over for a promotion because she was a mother; management had assumed she wouldn't be interested and promoted an unmarried woman instead. Even though the position was not given to a man, a court agreed the firm's action might constitute sex discrimination, not least because numerous fathers had received such promotions. Negative assumptions about the capabilities of women with children pervade the marketplace, Williams averred, and can violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act even when employers insist their actions are not motivated by sexism. 
 ''Unbending Gender'' struck a nerve -- soon after its publication, Williams found herself fielding ''a zillion invitations to speak'' -- but its author admits she had ''no idea'' whether the legal theory she had sketched out might catch on. There were plenty of skeptics, which is not surprising. Unlike being black or female, after all, becoming a parent is a choice, one that often limits an employee's availability. As she traveled across the country, Williams heard this frequently from feminists convinced that courts would side with businesses in such disputes. But she heard something different from the lawyers she met, who seemed equally certain jurors would sympathize with workers punished simply for trying to be responsible caregivers. Meanwhile, with each passing day, more lawsuits kept being filed. Williams soon established the Center for WorkLife Law, which emerged as the place to go to learn more about the subject -- not only for scholars and journalists but also for employees, who started calling its hot line to find out how they, too, might file a claim. It was, for Williams, a bracing moment, as much for personal reasons as for professional ones. After attending Harvard Law School, she told me, she worked for several years as an attorney. Then she had a daughter, Rachel, and found herself staring at the quandary so many women face. ''I got sort of obsessed with the issues,'' she recalls, ''because they were framing my life.'' Williams also thought back on occasion to her grandmother, one of the first women to attend Johns Hopkins Medical School. Before graduating, she married and moved with her husband to a new city. When she tried to complete her degree, a medical-school dean told her that a woman should be ashamed of nurturing such ambitions. After that, Williams says, ''she gave up.''
 Williams viewed the lawsuits as a way to complete an unfinished revolution. But she also recognized they could be perceived another way, a point she pressed on feminist colleagues who saw in them a noble but losing cause. ''I said to them: 'You're thinking of these as very edgy gender-discrimination cases. In fact, they're family-values cases.' ''
 This view would meet with no objection from a former Maryland state trooper named Kevin Knussman, who does not fit the conventional image of a plaintiff in a sex-discrimination case. Knussman, who is 50, has close-cropped brown hair shaved high above the ears and a neatly trimmed, graying mustache. He lives in the town of Easton, on Maryland's Eastern Shore, in a saltbox-style house with an American flag out front and framed passages of Scripture on the walls inside. On the day I visited him recently, he wore a short-sleeved shirt emblazoned with the logo of the Easton little-league softball team, which he coaches. 
 Knussman is a churchgoing Christian and a conservative Republican. In 1999, he also became the first person to prevail in a sex-discrimination lawsuit filed under the Family and Medical Leave Act. A jury awarded him $375,000 in damages, although a judge subsequently reduced the amount to $40,000. The suit was filed shortly after his wife, Kimberly, became pregnant and began to suffer from an array of medical complications, including pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening condition. Wishing to be there to support her, Knussman wrote to his boss at the Maryland State Police to request four to eight weeks of leave, to which he was entitled under the F.M.L.A. He was told there was ''no way'' he could take more than two weeks. Later, after his wife gave birth to a baby girl, he asked for 30 days off, as is available to primary caregivers under Maryland law. A personnel manager for the state police, where he had worked for 17 years, denied the request, telling him, ''Unless your wife is in a coma or dead, you can't be primary care provider.'' The same person also told him that God made women to have babies. 
 Knussman chuckled as he recalled these statements. But the experience was considerably less amusing at the time. The stress of being forced back to work when he felt his family needed him was shattering. Caught between the demands of a job he loved and his family, he plunged into depression, he says, and briefly contemplated suicide. ''I would come home after work and Kim was asleep on the couch, and my daughter was crying, and I felt it was really hindering Kim's ability to heal and recuperate,'' he told me. ''It certainly didn't make me feel good -- I had to abandon my family in order to collect my paycheck.'' 
 The case was not without its incongruities. Representing Knussman in court was the American Civil Liberties Union, an organization that would most likely not win any popularity contests at the Calvary Baptist Church near Easton, where Knussman and his family attend services. At one point, he was invited to the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, for a photo op with President Clinton to celebrate the anniversary of the F.M.L.A. 
 ''I told the woman who called, 'You know I'm a conservative Republican,' '' he recalled, laughing. 
 ''I know you won't embarrass us like that,'' she replied.
 He showed me the photograph with a proud smile spread across his face. When I asked whether he had any regrets about taking legal action, he shook his head. ''They had hurt my family significantly, especially my wife. To hurt my family -- it really was important to rectify.''
 The plaintiffs in roughly four-fifths of the work-family lawsuits filed thus far have been women. As Knussman's case shows, men, too, may find themselves subjected to stereotypes about their domestic responsibilities -- by employers who feel they shouldn't have any. What women alone appear to encounter is a powerful set of negative assumptions associated with motherhood. The rise of lawsuits in recent years has coincided with a new body of research, much of it produced by a scholarly project called the Cognitive Bias Working Group. One member of the group is Shelley Correll, a sociologist at Cornell. A few years ago, Correll was poring over labor-market data and noticed that while the gap between the wages of men and women had narrowed, the gap between mothers and everyone else remained wide. She wanted to understand why. As an experiment, Correll and other researchers asked volunteers to evaluate a pool of equally qualified male and female job applicants. On some resumes, a clue signaled that the applicant was a parent. Correll also sent 1,276 resumes for entry-level and midlevel marketing jobs to 638 real employers. 
 The results, as reported in the May 2007 issue of The American Journal of Sociology, are striking. Among the volunteers, mothers were consistently viewed as less competent and less committed and were held to higher performance and punctuality standards. They were 79 percent less likely to be hired and, if hired, would be offered a starting salary $11,000 lower than nonmothers. Fathers, by contrast, were offered the highest salaries of all. Meanwhile, in the test run with real-world employers, the hypothetical female applicants without children were more than twice as likely as equally qualified mothers to be called back for interviews. Correll's findings echo a discovery made by the psychologist Amy Cuddy. Cuddy asked volunteers to evaluate four imaginary professionals: a childless female, a childless male, a mother and a father. All these professionals had identical experience and educational backgrounds. Yet the mothers were given the lowest competency ratings, by both male and female evaluators, and were least likely to be recommended for hiring and promotions. 
 Some employers, lawyers say, may be tolerant, even welcoming, of an employee who bears one child, only to balk when discovering she has become pregnant again. Attorneys who handle such cases refer to this as ''the second-baby syndrome.'' Other times, tension may arise when another factor -- say, a disability -- enters the picture. This is what Lucia Kanter believes happened to her. An attorney from San Francisco, Kanter started working several years ago at the Administrative Office of the Courts, the policy-making body of the California judicial system. She loved the job and, she says, was well regarded by her superiors. She also thought she would finish her career there, in part because it seemed like an accommodating place for working parents. After the birth of her first son, Julian, in January 2004, Kanter was given a generous (albeit unpaid) 11-month leave. She was then allowed to return on a four-day-a-week, 80 percent schedule. A year and a half later, she had a second son, Thanael, and this time was given six months off. 
 Shortly after Thanael was born, however, tests confirmed something that Kanter and her husband had begun to suspect: Julian, their older child, was autistic. They now faced the daunting challenge of raising a child with a disability. When Kanter learned this, she says she wrote to her manager to ask whether she might return, at least initially, either on a 60 percent schedule or an 80 percent schedule with a rotating day off, so she could attend Julian's therapy sessions. Her request, she says, was denied. Then she asked for an extended leave of absence but again was turned down. Finally, she says, she suggested resuming her prior schedule, but with some additional time off so she could hire a second nanny. She figured the agency would at least be open to discussing this, but it said no. 
 Instead, she says, she received a termination letter.
 She was stunned. ''If my jaw could have dropped to the floor, it would have,'' she told me when I visited her recently at her home in San Francisco. Now, invoking both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the Americans With Disabilities Act, she is suing her former employer for discrimination, a decision she said she agonized over: ''I have a child with 14 therapists, and another young child -- I don't need this headache.'' 
 Of course, her colleagues at the Administrative Office of the Courts may have had reason to worry about that very fact, and to wonder whether her hands might be too full to handle an ordinary workload. (The agency would not address the specifics of the case, but in court papers and in a statement it denied all wrongdoing alleged by Kanter.) In non-F.M.L.A. cases, if employers can show an adverse action was taken for legitimate business reasons -- if a worker's presence in the office is essential to a company's operations, say -- they often can persuade a judge or jury to spare them liability, particularly if they can point to a positive track record toward the protected class of employees. Kanter acknowledged there were worse places for women with children to work, though she also recalled how, at an office baby shower, she overheard a high-ranking superior tell a female attorney: ''So this is it, right? There aren't going to be any more pregnant women after this?'' 
 Even so, when Kanter first sat down with a lawyer after her dismissal, she said, she pinned her hopes not on a lawsuit but on a settlement that would reinstate her job, which she still describes with unrestrained fondness. At one point, she ushered me into her living room, flipped on the computer and inserted a DVD of the training sessions she used to conduct at work (where, coincidentally, one of her main responsibilities was to counsel members of the court system about employment law). Her black Lab lay curled in the corner. Her kids were asleep upstairs. As the video played, Kanter gazed at the monitor with a look of pure longing in her eyes. She was suing only because she had run out of options, she said with a heavy sigh, and because she had come to identify with working mothers who've been ''pushed or nudged out of their jobs.''
 Until recently, prevailing in such a case likely would have required showing that a man in the same situation was treated differently. In the past, the absence of a so-called ''male comparator'' had often led courts to dismiss sex-discrimination claims even when evidence of stereotyping seemed to exist. But this is by no means certain anymore. In 2004, in the case of Back v. Hastings-on-Hudson, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that a school psychologist who claimed she was denied tenure because she was a mother did not need a comparator to prove she had been unlawfully stereotyped. 
 The Back opinion was drafted by one of the nation's most liberal courts. But conservative judges have issued plenty of pro-plaintiff rulings as well. In 2005, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in Virginia -- considered among the most conservative in the country -- upheld $520,000 awarded to an attorney who claimed she was mistreated for being a working mother, and it ordered a lower court to consider additional punitive damages. Perhaps the most surprising decision to date emerged out of Nevada, in a case involving a state social worker named William Hibbs, who filed a lawsuit under the F.M.L.A. when his wife suffered a near-fatal car accident and he was ordered back to work after his employer said he had exhausted the leave the state offered. The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which, in 2003, affirmed Hibbs's right to recover damages. It was a stunning ruling, both because the court had upheld states' immunity from federal lawsuits in a string of prior cases and because, in his majority opinion, Chief Justice William Rehnquist underscored the importance of transforming workplace stereotypes. ''The fault line between work and family,'' he declared, is ''precisely where sex-based overgeneralization has been and remains strongest.'' The Second Circuit subsequently cited this language in the Back decision. 
 Had Chief Justice Rehnquist secretly been dropping in on meetings of the Cognitive Bias Working Group? A more likely explanation is that, like conservative judges in other cases, he saw the issue through the prism of family values -- and, perhaps, his own personal experience. At one point in his career, Rehnquist had to care for his own wife, who was terminally ill with cancer. As reported by Linda Greenhouse in this newspaper, his daughter, Janet, was a single mother who had a demanding job and apparently relied on his help on occasion. Several times during the term the Hibbs case was argued Rehnquist left the chambers early to fetch his granddaughters from school.
 s surprising as such rulings have been, they have not convinced everyone that the proliferation of lawsuits is a good thing. Among those with reservations is Zachary Fasman, a partner at the New York office of Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who specializes in employment law. At the E.E.O.C. hearing back in April, Fasman testified that there is a danger the lawsuits will be used as a lever to force companies to change legitimate business practices (mandatory overtime, strict attendance rules) that not all workers can handle. Imagine the effect on the workplace, or the potential impact on America's competitiveness, if United States courts ruled, for example, that companies could no longer dictate to their employees what time the workday began and ended. ''I'm not against work-life balance -- who is?'' Fasman later told me. ''But the organization of the work force has always been left, to a large extent, to the discretion of the employer. So long as it doesn't discriminate, where a business draws the line on these things depends on the nature of the business. You can't rewrite the rules of the American workplace unless Congress does it.''
 Some C.E.O.'s, however, have begun rewriting the rules on their own, spurred by the need to compete for high-quality employees. Several years ago, a businessman named Jim Johnson dropped in on a talk Joan Williams was giving in Denver, because his wife had heard about Williams and urged him to go. Afterward, he decided to reorganize the moving-and-storage company he runs. Today, many of Johnson's employees log more hours at home than at the office. ''I've got customer-service people working at home, order-entry people, long-distance dispatchers,'' he told me. There has been a slight increase in productivity, he said, as well as another benefit: ''This flex-hour, work-at-home group -- the turnover has been almost nonexistent.''
 Clearly, though, not every company in America would embrace such a blueprint. In the meantime, as the number of workers suing their employers continues to grow, there is another danger -- that lawsuits will come to be seen as the vehicle of reform for problems that could be addressed more effectively through other means. By way of contrast, consider Britain, where, several years ago, the Blair government passed a flexible-work law that allows employees with children under 6 to request a reduction or rearrangement in their schedules. Employers can refuse but must explain their reasoning in writing. In Sweden, parents have the right to work a six-hour day until their children turn 8, at a prorated salary. Although some view such practices as a drag on the economy, policies mandating lengthy, paid parental leave and government-subsidized child care are the norm throughout Europe.
 In ''Unbending Gender,'' Joan Williams wrote that ''suing your employer is not the ideal mechanism of social change.'' When we met not long ago in San Francisco, I reminded her of this passage. She smiled. Lawsuits ''are the worst possible vehicle for social change,'' she said, ''except for nothing, and that's where we are right now.'' Williams pointed out that, in addition to the hot line for aggrieved employees, the Center for WorkLife Law advises a rapidly expanding number of employers and management-side lawyers. Of course, she would prefer that Congress pass legislation guaranteeing all workers paid sick leave, paid parental leave and access to affordable child care, she went on to say. ''But what's happening in public policy in this arena? It took more than a decade to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act, and it's very limited. So when people say, 'Well, the lawsuits are limited achievements,' I say: 'Well, compared to what? You're not in Europe.' ''
 Indeed, in the United States today, working parents receive supports and benefits that in much of the developed world would be considered scandalously ungenerous. Some unflattering comparisons with Europe were drawn at the E.E.O.C. hearing in April, where Williams suggested that even companies had reached the point of wanting more guidance from Washington about how caregivers should be treated. The message was evidently heard. In late May, the agency issued enforcement guidelines that for the first time spell out the myriad situations -- a police detective removed from high-profile investigations after she adopts a child, a technician and father denied a part-time posting reserved for a woman -- prohibited under existing law. The E.E.O.C. makes clear that personnel decisions implemented on the basis of stereotypical assumptions are unacceptable and urges employers ''to make it easier for all workers, whether male or female, to balance work and personal responsibilities.''
 It would be hard to imagine such a step happening were it not for the wave of lawsuits in recent years. Meanwhile, people like Karen Deonarain are waiting for their days in court. It has been more than three years since she lost her job. Her lawsuit, which charges that she was fired for complications related to her pregnancy, amounting to a form of sex discrimination, is in the discovery phase. A hint of weariness creeps into her voice when she talks about the case. ''I think they want to drag it out so I'll go away,'' she told me, laughing softly. 
 But Deonarain is not planning to give up anytime soon. Since her dismissal, she and her husband, a car wholesaler, have made a major lifestyle adjustment -- no vacations, no expensive meals. She has yet to land a full-time job. The refinancing loan on the house eventually came through, and her daughter, Razia, is doing O.K., but the experience of being fired has had lasting psychological effects. ''I find myself acting a little timid, protecting myself, so the world out there won't hurt you,'' Deonarain said. She told me she often thinks about what might have happened had she been a single mother. ''I'm doing this so they won't do it to the next person.'' And what does she expect to get out of it herself? She paused. Some compensatory damages would be nice, she admitted. Her eyes circled the room. ''And an apology would be good, too.''

HEADLINE: Can Ford Clean Up After Itself?

BYLINE: By RON STODGHILL

 BODY:
IN the summer of 2005, around the time that residents of Upper Ringwood, N.J., began to wonder whether the skin rashes, nose bleeds and bronchitis that plagued their community were more than bad luck, the Ford Motor Company and the Environmental Protection Agency made a request: the automaker and the regulator wanted access to the yards around two families' homes to remove waste that had been dumped in the area. Ford boasts in its ads that ''It's Easy Being Green,'' but residents feared the request suggested something not so easy at all. From the mid-1950s to the late 1970s, Ford operated an assembly plant in northern New Jersey, in nearby Mahwah, that cranked out millions of passenger cars. Ford closed the plant in 1980, after dumping what the E.P.A. describes as thousands of tons of paint sludge and other waste in Upper Ringwood, a community of about 350 working-class residents located in the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains. 
 A few years later, the Environmental Protection Agency identified Upper Ringwood for priority cleanup under its Superfund program. Ford, deemed responsible for the pollution, spent the next five years assessing and removing sludge from a 500-acre site that included 50 homes. Satisfied with Ford's cleanup, the E.P.A. dropped Upper Ringwood as a Superfund site in 1994, having determined, according to a public notice, that ''no further cleanup by responsible parties is appropriate'' and that ''the current risk posed by the site is within an acceptable range.''
 Yet recently, based on Ford's and the E.P.A.'s own recent follow-up studies of the soil and groundwater in Upper Ringwood, those conclusions unraveled and became fodder in what environmental experts say is now among the messiest industrial cleanup efforts in Superfund's 27-year history. 
 Since the E.P.A. relisted Upper Ringwood last year as a Superfund site, cleanup experts in the area have not only removed several thousand tons of waste that crews had previously overlooked, but workers have also identified substantial amounts of potentially hazardous paint sludge in the yards of at least two private homes, according to federal regulators and Ford.
 Last year, residents sued Ford in a New Jersey state court for property damage and personal injuries, citing the improper disposal of waste from the Mahwah plant. The lawsuit claims that Ford's hazardous paint sludge and other contaminated material, while dumped decades ago, still contaminate the soil, air and groundwater in their community; that Ford failed to tell more than 600 residents how dangerous the waste was; and that Ford has yet to properly clean up the mess. 
 To make their case, residents have enlisted several high-profile legal experts and consultants, including the environmental lawyer Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the physician James Dahlgren of ''Erin Brockovich'' fame, and the law firm of the late civil rights lawyer Johnnie Cochran. The lawyers contend in the suit that contaminated waste that Ford left behind has contributed to such illnesses among residents as the diabetes that caused Paul Eugene VanDunk to have his leg amputated and the cancer that killed his daughter. ''This community was here long before Ford had anything to do with Upper Ringwood,'' says Andrew Carboy, a lead lawyer for the residents. ''Ford's involvement here ended almost 40 years ago, but the community is still dealing with the health consequences of Ford's dumping.''
 Ford counters that its history of dumping in Upper Ringwood, which occurred for four years, was legal and authorized by town supervisors. It says it was just one of several companies that deposited waste in the area during the years that its Mahwah plant operated and that its dumping activities and recent cleanup efforts have not endangered the health of residents.
 ''Bronchitis could be caused by a number of things that have nothing to do with toxins,'' said Alan Kraus, a Ford lawyer, during a recent court appearance. According to records of the proceedings, Mr. Kraus said he needed a medical history from each of the plaintiffs before turning over any records concerning the automaker's waste disposal activities.
 ''To be honest, I'm not a doctor, but I don't know whether bronchitis can be caused by toxins,'' he said in court. 
 Citing the litigation, Ford officials declined to be interviewed, but said in a statement that ''the company is working diligently to address remaining issues related to its past disposal activities.'' Ford also noted that ''the Borough of Ringwood used the site as a general dump before, during and after the four-year period that Ford-related waste materials were disposed at the site'' and that recent surveys of the property ''recorded the presence of non-Ford related miscellaneous wastes and debris on approximately half of all locations included in the survey.'' 
 Ford contractors and E.P.A. officials also say that residents here have been wary about granting access to their homes to remove potentially dangerous, brick-size shards of sludge. 
 ''C'mon, we understand that the residents in Ringwood do not trust the agency or Ford too much,'' says Patricia Carr, an E.P.A. spokeswoman. ''But how can they voice concern about the health effects of the waste there for all these years and then not allow us access into their homes?'' 
 Residents see things quite differently. ''Tell me what they can do to satisfy us for the lives that have been lost already?'' asks Wayne Mann, a local activist and community leader. ''How do you justify what they've done?''
 THIS rustic community, an hour's drive from the heart of Manhattan, is home to the Ramapough Lenape Indian Nation, a group of American Indians with roots in the area reaching back before the Revolutionary War. The tribe has maintained many of its traditions, and has been slow to integrate; residents hunt deer and turkey and fish the local streams for food. They also harvest vegetables grown on small plots in their yards, and are not politically active -- which contributed to Ford's and the E.P.A.'s inefficiency in cleaning the area, residents say.
 Environmental advocates say that the significance of the fight between Ford and residents here transcends Ford's activities, plaintiffs' lawyers' claims of ''environmental racism,'' or so-called green-washing efforts of companies with dubious environmental records to improve their images. They say it sheds light on the inherent limitations of the Superfund program, which has relied heavily on the scientific research and the purse strings of corporate polluters to clean up sites -- limitations that have only been compounded by severe cuts recently in the E.P.A.'s budget.
 The plaintiffs' lawyers also contend that Ford's waste has resulted in the contamination of a local reservoir that provides drinking water for 2.5 million people in the surrounding area. Ford denies that.
 ''This site is the poster child of corporate bad behavior and the inability of the E.P.A. to really make corporate polluters do proper cleanup of sites,'' said Robert Spiegel, executive director of the Edison Wetlands Association, an environmental advocacy group in New Jersey. Ford's waste, Mr. Spiegel said, ''is polluting the drinking water for millions of people, yet it's still unclear whether the E.P.A. will ever force Ford into really cleaning it up.'' 
 ROGER DeGROAT, 58, leaves the above-ground swimming pool outside his Upper Ringwood home empty because he's afraid he might be filling it with contaminated water. He points at a purple rash on his arms to illustrate other fears. ''I don't know what these blotches are,'' he says. ''It scares me because my doctor doesn't know what's wrong with me either. I get dizzy for no apparent reason; my eyes itch.
 ''My children have nose bleeds so bad in their sleep that they wake up stuck to the bed, like they've been hit in the head or something,'' he adds. 
 Mr. DeGroat, like many other residents here, says he believes that hazardous waste contributed to his family's illnesses as well as elevated rates of leukemia, cancer, diabetes and asthma in other residents. 
 A line of trucks barrels past Mr. DeGroat's house and disappears behind gates securing the work site where a business hired by Ford is cleaning Upper Ringwood. In recent months, workers have been removing sludge and investigating the possible presence of such hazardous substances as lead, arsenic, chromium, ethylbenzene and P.C.B.'s in local soil, according to the E.P.A. 
 Residents say that the cleanup makes their close-knit community feel like an occupied military zone, with the constant rumble of tank-size tractors drowning out the banter from children playing tag and hopscotch.
 Despite the noise and the threat of illnesses, Mr. DeGroat says that he, like most of the American Indians who live here, can't imagine relocating. Tribe members have maintained largely isolated lives (due, they say, to racial taunting and stereotyping from people outside their community) and are groomed to be suspicious of most outsiders. 
 After Ford built its Mahwah plant in 1955 and bought 800 nearby acres to build homes for its workers, it became among the largest employers in the area. In 1967, Ford hired a contractor to dispose of waste from the Mahwah plant. Court filings say that Ford's agreement with the contractor ''called for disposal of cardboard and other packing materials from the plant, scrap car parts, paint sludge and scrap and dented drums containing obsoleted hardened production sealing and insulating stock of noninflammable nature.'' Ford says that state and local officials approved the dumping that occurred from 1967 to 1971. 
 Residents say that regardless of who approved the dumping, their lives were changed. ''The way we were living is not how people live in the real world,'' says Mr. Mann, who is also a lead plaintiff in the lawsuit against Ford. ''There was trash everywhere. There were drums and chemicals all around, and trucks coming and dumping anywhere and everywhere. The Dumpsters would get so high that they would mysteriously burn for weeks.'' 
 STARTING in the late 1960s, Ford says it began divesting large portions of the dump site in Upper Ringwood. It donated 300 acres of land to the town government, which, it claims, allowed other companies to continue dumping on the site between 1972 and 1976 (at which point state regulators shut it down). 
 Joseph Maraziti, a lawyer representing the town government said that after Ford left the area, the Upper Ringwood site was used for only household waste, not potentially toxic industrial waste. ''As of this moment, there has been no identification of any hazardous material connected with that site other than Ford's,'' he says. 
 Ford closed its Mahwah plant in 1980. Two years later, New Jersey regulators discovered substantial levels of arsenic in local water samples and gave their findings to the E.P.A., which added Upper Ringwood to a national priorities list under its Superfund program. Ford's cleanup crews arrived in Ringwood in 1983, but the company acknowledges that the process from the start was prolonged by extensive research and bureaucratic red tape. 
 ''With the site sprawling over more than 500 acres, the E.P.A. had to make decisions regarding how best to investigate, characterize and then address the disposal of hazardous substances on the site,'' the company said in a statement. 
 Part of the problem, too, Ford and E.P.A. officials say, was a steep learning curve in the remediation of Superfund sites, or as the 1980 law is called, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act. Superfund was a response to public outcries in the 1970s over the discovery that some 22,000 tons of toxic waste had been dumped in the Love Canal neighborhood in Niagara Falls, N.Y.
 ''There was no model out there and no mentors in cleaning up sites,'' says Ms. Carr, the E.P.A. spokeswoman. ''The law was detailed and prescriptive but nobody had any experience in how to do this.'' 
 Among the most costly initial mistakes, Ms. Carr says, was the agency's failure to involve residents in the cleanup. ''In the early days, we didn't have a lot of interaction with the residents in Ringwood and from that have learned to reach out earlier in the process,'' she said. 
 Ford says it does not accept full responsibility for the lack of dialogue with the community. In its statement, the company says that ''in the 1980s and early 1990s, neither the Borough of Ringwood nor the residents expressed significant interest in the process to Ford.'' 
 Residents don't dispute that they were hesitant to speak out early on, but say they were silent because of fears of retribution. ''When the berries and the fruit and the frogs started disappearing, I looked the other way,'' Mr. Mann says. ''Who is going to cry out when you are only renting and can be thrown out? There were some who wanted to be vocal, but if you fought back against the state, local government and a major company like Ford, what was going to happen to you?''
 Ford says in a statement that even its best efforts to alleviate those fears during the more recent cleanup often proved ineffective. It says it helped the E.P.A. set up a toll-free number early in the reinvestigation process that residents could use to anonymously report information regarding the location of paint sludge on the site. ''The toll-free number was never used,'' the company said.
 But as Alan J. Steinberg, a regional E.P.A. administrator says: ''Regardless of who was at fault for what, I find the situation to be heartbreaking. It's obvious that some mistakes were made, that the site was cleaned up too quickly. We are in the process of correcting that mistake by supervising a very intensive cleanup effort by Ford.''
 SOME environmental experts and analysts say the biggest problem in cleaning Upper Ringwood, as well as the nation's more than 1,000 other Superfund sites, stems from the depleted resources of the Superfund itself. Superfund's budget was built on an excise tax on crude oil and chemicals used for manufacturing. The tax lapsed in 1995, and the trust fund has shrunk from $1.5 billion in 1994 to insolvency today -- leaving the E.P.A. struggling to find other sources of money to identify and assess the nation's future cleanup needs, according to several recent studies. The E.P.A. says that Superfund's shrinking resources don't undermine its ability to monitor corporate polluters and that companies themselves can adequately manage and police cleanups on their own. 
 The price tag for all of this remains large: according to a 2005 Government Accountability Office report, it will cost $20 billion to remediate the 142 largest Superfund sites.
 Superfund has proved to be effective in spurring corporate polluters to pay for their own cleanups, analysts say. Rather than face fines of as much as three times the actual cost of a cleanup if the E.P.A. undertook the effort on its own, most major corporate polluters have opted to clean the sites themselves. But that, in turn, has left the E.P.A. dependent on corporate polluters to oversee and clean up problem sites.
 ''Funding of cleanups is a really central issue now that the tax fund has been depleted,'' says Katherine N. Probst, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future, a nonpartisan economic research group in Washington. ''And there are issues about money, and issues about the future of the program, and questions about what you can expect to get in a cleanup these days.'' 
 For its part, Ford says its efforts to clean the area through the years have been nothing less than rigorous, and that the company's voluntary decision to study the area's ground and streams for pollutants after closing its plant reflects its overall commitment to making the area safe for residents. The company says it is doing additional cleanup work at known landfill areas, including at two abandoned mine sites.
 More specifically, the company said in a statement that contractors have removed several tons of paint sludge deposits from Upper Ringwood sites and that samples of soil, surface water, sediment and groundwater have shown that the sludge has not migrated into soils or water supplies. 
 But residents say other warning signs still concern them, despite assurances from Ford and the E.P.A. Earlier this year, for example, New Jersey health authorities warned residents not to hunt squirrels (a longtime staple of the local diet) after discovering a squirrel that was contaminated with lead. 
 Vivian Milligan, 55, said that the notification unnerved her and that she had not gotten satisfactory answers as to why she had two miscarriages, an ulcer, and has high blood pressure. Or why her husband has had four of his toes amputated. Or why three of her cousins have each had a leg amputated. 
 ''I really feel that there's a connection between the contamination and all the health problems around here,'' she says. ''There's just too many sick people for one little area.''

HEADLINE: New Housing on Resort Islands

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
EDGARTOWN, Mass.
 FOR decades, hotels seemed as intrinsic to the landscape of the island of Martha's Vineyard as its wide beaches and finger-shaped lagoons. Ditto for Nantucket, 10 miles farther out to sea to the southeast, where bed-and-breakfast places and stately inns crowded the wide cobblestone streets. 
 Yet in an increasingly common trend, many of these longtime lodgings are either closing outright or drastically scaling back the number and availability of their rooms. 
 Rising home values have made it attractive to convert hotels and inns into condominiums and single-family homes, while high hotel-room rates have led many tourists to stay on Cape Cod, from where ferries sail for both islands, and take day trips over instead. 
 At the same time, island planners say, demand for permanent housing has increased. The year-round population in Martha's Vineyard has risen nearly 30 percent a decade since 1970, according to census data, and Nantucket's shot up 58 percent between 1990 and 2000. 
 From 2002 to 2007, the islands have shed about 200 of 2,500 hotel rooms, based on an analysis of data from business owners. Most of the losses came from bed-and-breakfasts that are converted to single-family homes. But in the next two years, those losses could rise sharply, with hundreds of other rooms coming off the market, as developers transform properties into condos. 
 The decline in hotel beds is a consequence of a sizzling real estate market, where home prices are up 80 to 90 percent in five years, according to the islands' multiple listings services, with an average home price of $775,000 on Martha's Vineyard and $1.19 million on Nantucket. 
 For many hotel and bed-and-breakfast owners, it makes sense financially to convert their properties to single-family homes or condos, and not maintain their current business model of short-term lodging. 
 Escalating hotel rates -- a consequence of the higher cost of living on the islands -- have also put accommodations beyond the reach of many tourists. ''For certain people, the Vineyard is pricing itself out'' of the seasonal hotel market, said Mark London, the executive director of the Martha's Vineyard Commission, a regulatory agency that approves large-scale conversions. 
 Peter Martell, the owner of the 95-room Wesley Hotel in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard, put his property on the market in September 2006 for $6.5 million, but it has not sold yet. The gray-shingled hotel, where rates average $205 a night, was just 55 percent full during the Fourth of July holiday week. In the late 1990s, when rates averaged $130 a night, the hotel was around 90 percent full that time of year. 
 ''Occupancy rates are too low,'' Mr. Martell said. ''The common man just can't afford to come here anymore.''
 Those tourists who still choose the islands are increasingly opting to stay in rented homes, where they can save money by cooking their own meals.
 Hotel rooms typically start at $200 a night, so staying a week can cost $1,400, said Alan Schweikert, the owner of Ocean Park Realty in Oak Bluffs on Martha's Vineyard. ''But for $1,200,'' he said, ''you can rent your own house for a week with a lot more privacy,'' though it might be an older property far from the ocean. 
 This summer, Martha's Vineyard had 500 houses for rent, scattered from Vineyard Haven to Aquinnah, which doubled the offerings in 2000, according to Mr. Schweikert and Abby Rabinovitz, a principal of Tea Lane Associates, a brokerage in the town of Chilmark on the western side of Martha's Vineyard.
 And on Nantucket, 1,000 homes were listed as rentals this year, versus about 650 seven years ago. As the supply has swelled, and competition has grown, the rental rates have held relatively steady, increasing by just 5 percent since 2000, according to Linda Bellevue, a broker with Congdon & Coleman Real Estate on Nantucket.
 Though rentals may guarantee more creature comforts, like kitchens and outdoor showers, the island's creakier hotels could be retooled to offer similar amenities, said Alan Worden, the chief executive of Scout Real Estate Capital.
 Last December, Mr. Worden bought both the Harbor View Hotel and the Kelley House, two historic Martha's Vineyard properties, in Edgartown.
 As part of a $117 million three-year renovation, the Harbor View will add a spa, fitness center and banquet hall. When the renovation is complete, 85 hotel rooms will either have disappeared or become condos, leaving just 45 traditional hotels rooms, a fraction of the hotel's 130 rooms last year. 
 Eight condos went on the market this month, ranging from 500-square-foot one-bedrooms to 2,000-square-foot three-bedrooms, priced from $525,000 to $1.25 million; none have yet sold. And at the Kelley House, 60 rooms will be whittled down to 45 condos by 2009, Mr. Worden said.
 While it may seem as if guests would not have as many hotel rooms to choose from, most owners will rent their condo-hotel rooms out for a fee, which could be split between owner and hotel, Mr. Worden said. 
 These condo-hotel rooms can be pricey -- about $1,000 a night -- but walk-ins don't seem to blanch, because they are part of an untapped luxury market that expects top-of-the-line finishes like granite and marble counters. ''The affluent traveler doesn't want to be in a small room listening to the noise through the wall, or dealing with a small armoire,'' Mr. Worden said.
 Buyers, meanwhile, attain the best of both worlds: equity in a second home without the hassles of maintaining it, said Robert Matthews, the chief executive of Matthews Ventures Holdings, which is developing the Point Breeze, a luxury condo complex on Nantucket. ''You don't have to deal with plumbers and carpenters and painters,'' he said, explaining that for a monthly fee property managers would maintain the home. 
 Although the Point Breeze will have new construction across its six-acre parcel, it is also adapting an existing structure, the former Gordon Folger Hotel, a 78-foot-tall gabled edifice built during the Depression. 
 The first phase of the $110 million three-year project focuses on the Folger Hotel and calls for trimming the number of rooms to 31 from 36 and selling them as condos. Those units, which range from 350-square-foot studios to 1,150-square-foot two-bedrooms, went on sale this month, priced from $1 million to $4.2 million, though none have yet sold, Mr. Matthews said.
 The second phase, which has not yet been approved by the Nantucket Planning and Economic Development Commission, will convert existing cottages to condos, and actually increase the number of rooms, to 31 from 25, he said.
 Every room at the Point Breeze will be a condo, whereas the Harbor View will keep 45 traditional hotel rooms. Still, Mr. Matthews expects 80 percent of his buyers to agree to rent out the rooms when they are not using them. ''It may not be the Holiday Inn,'' he said, ''but people don't want that anymore.''

HEADLINE: In a Highly Complex World, Innovation From the Top Down

BYLINE: By G. PASCAL ZACHARY. 
G. Pascal Zachary teaches journalism at Stanford and writes about technology and economic development. E-mail: gzach@nytimes.com

 BODY:
USER-GENERATED content -- from Wikipedia to YouTube to open-source software -- is generating waves of excitement. But the opening of innovation to wider numbers of people obscures another trend: many of the most popular new products, like the iPod, are dominated by a top-down, elite innovation model that doesn't allow for customization.
 ''New technologies are becoming so complex that many are beyond the possibility of democracy playing a role in their development,'' said Thomas P. Hughes, a science and technology professor at the University of Pennsylvania. 
 Consider: Electronic implants into human bodies; gene-splicing as common as cosmetic surgery; computer networks mining vast databases to discern consumer preferences. All of these innovations are the result of corporate or government initiatives overseen by elites.
 ''The process of innovation leaves out a huge proportion of the population,'' said Daniel Sarewitz, director of the Consortium for Science, Policy and Outcomes at Arizona State University. 
 To be sure, experts like Eric von Hippel, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, argue that the proliferation of ''user-generated'' designs signals the ''democratizing'' of innovation. Armed with inexpensive digital tools and networks, ordinary people, he says, can band together to push their own innovations. They also can hijack existing technologies, taking them in directions only dimly envisioned by the original creators. 
 One example is an electronic community called Instructables whose participants share methods for customizing standard products in unpredictable ways. The chief of Instructables, Eric J. Wilhelm, who earned his doctorate at M.I.T., where he was inspired by Mr. von Hippel, has posted a clever means of turning a white Asics Gel-Foundation 7 running shoe into a purple model. (The $90 official version comes only in a white-black-and-blue combination.) 
 Today's Web-savvy consumers ''expect innovations to meet their needs,'' Mr. Wilhelm says. ''If innovation isn't tailored to them, they expect to be able to tailor it to themselves. That is a big change.''
 But does this really mean that elites no longer sit at the top of the innovation food chain? 
 ''Elites have a lot of leverage but less than they used to,'' says Peter Leyden, director of the New Politics Institute in San Francisco. ''More people are getting their voices heard.'' Mr. Leyden sees an emergent American ''republic of innovation,'' where growing numbers of people influence what innovations are made and when. 
 Skeptics, however, say that the rosy scenario is exaggerated and that user-generated innovation is merely a kind of ''democracy lite,'' emphasizing high-end consumer products and services rather than innovations that broadly benefit society. 
 ''Difficult questions are going unasked about who is participating in innovation and on what terms,'' says James Wilsdon, director of the innovation program at Demos, a think tank in London. 
 In that scenario, needed innovations can be overlooked. For example, huge amounts of money are spent on improving Web search engines or MP3 players, while scant attention is given to alternative energy sources. Battling diseases like AIDS or Alzheimer's -- efforts that lobbying groups in wealthy countries help highlight -- attract legions of well-financed innovators, while big global killers, like childhood diarrhea and sleeping sickness, are ignored.
 Popular pressure to pursue certain innovations sometimes gets results, of course. In 2004, voters in California passed a law lavishly funding a stem-cell research institute -- in a rebuke to the Bush administration, which has banned federal funding for such research. ''This was a great example of a democratic adjudication of an innovation issue,'' Mr. Sarewitz of Arizona State said. Even so, bureaucratic and legal delays have meant a slow start for the San Francisco lab, which has not yet received approval to spend any of the $3 billion in promised taxpayer funds.
 The California example suggests that the balance between expert leadership and mass influence is hard to achieve. The underlying complexity of many innovations demands an ever-rising technological literacy from the public, and yet such an outcome ''is a dream that will not likely come to pass,'' insists Mr. Hughes, a visiting professor at M.I.T.
 For all the hoopla over the power and promise of user-generated content, consumer-directed design and other hallmarks of our new golden era of democratized innovation, one of the iconic products of our times -- the iPod -- can't be customized (no, I'm not counting putting on different-colored protective jackets). There is an unbroken line between Henry Ford (with his Model T) and Steve Jobs. The new iPhone similarly reflects the elite, corporate innovator's drive to find one size that fits many.
 The cliche that committees can't create great ideas, or art, still seems to be true -- though whether or not that is the best way to innovate remains an open question. Who knows how much longer?

DRIVEN OUT
 The Forgotten War Against
 Chinese Americans.
 By Jean Pfaelzer.
 Illustrated. 400 pp. Random House. $27.95.
Thinking realistically about the history of the American West easily lands on the list of this nation's top 10 least favorite pastimes. Hundreds of historians have invested their life force in pointing out the inaccuracies in the image of the 19th-century West as a place of colorful romance and innocent adventure. ''No thanks,'' the believers reliably respond. ''We like our version a lot better.''
 Now, Jean Pfaelzer steps forward as a fresh reinforcement in this morale-draining campaign. In ''Driven Out: The Forgotten War Against Chinese Americans,'' she tells the story of the ''thousands of Chinese people who were violently herded onto railroad cars, steamers or logging rafts, marched out of town or killed,'' from the Pacific coast to the Rocky Mountains. Despite the forceful adjective of Pfaelzer's subtitle, this burdensome history has not been entirely ''forgotten.'' Scholars have written comprehensively and memorably about it. But it is surely accurate to say that a majority of Americans live without a recognition of the degree, scale and extent of these chilling undertakings. 
 Most know even less about the extraordinary record of the Chinese people's responding to persecution with boycotts, petitions, lawsuits and demands for reparations. In Wing Hing v. City of Eureka, 53 Chinese men and women joined together in asserting that the Northern California city had a duty to protect its residents and in demanding reparations and financial compensation for the violence that drove them out in 1885. Confronted with the requirement, in the Geary Act of 1892, that Chinese immigrants carry an identity card proving they were in the country legally or else face deportation, thousands refused to submit to what they called the ''Dog Tag Law,'' thus undertaking what Pfaelzer says was ''perhaps the largest organized act of civil disobedience in the United States.''
 Altogether, Chinese immigrants filed more than 7,000 lawsuits in the decade after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, ''and they won the vast majority of them,'' Pfaelzer writes. In truth, these efforts to claim the protection of American law should require historians to come up with a whole new understanding -- in geography, chronology and cast of characters -- of the civil rights movement.
 To a surprising and heartening degree, some white Westerners championed the Chinese in their assertion of rights. Taking the job of San Francisco consul for the Chinese government, the lawyer Frederick Bee became an indefatigable filer of lawsuits and writer of protests on behalf of the dispossessed. After the brutal expulsion of the Chinese from the city of Tacoma in 1885, W. H. White, a courageous United States attorney, prosecuted the leaders of the mob, including Tacoma's mayor, chief of police, two councilmen, a probate court judge and the president of the Y.M.C.A. In Southern California, a missionary's wife, one remarkable Mrs. Trumble, protected 30 Chinese men from a mob, standing on her porch aiming a rifle -- and the good advice to disperse -- at the vigilantes. 
 But that, ladies and gentlemen, concludes the uplifting part of this review. ''Driven Out'' cites records of more than 100 roundups, pogroms, expulsions and ethnic cleansings (to use Pfaelzer's various terms for these actions) in which white Westerners united to drive the Chinese out of their communities from 1850 to 1906. They used warnings, arson, boycotts and violence to achieve their goal. In many circumstances, labor organizations led the campaigns, casting the Chinese as competitors for jobs and depressors of wages. But middle-class civic leaders often acted in alliance with workers. 
 And what motivated the proud participants in these acts of stunning cruelty? Following the influential work of the historian Alexander Saxton, Pfaelzer -- a professor of English, East Asian studies and American studies at the University of Delaware -- points to the disappointment and disillusion that afflicted many seekers of fortune in the American West, native-born whites and European immigrants alike. When the West defaulted on their high expectations, they directed their frustration at the Chinese. In a more subtle casting of this usual explanation, Pfaelzer portrays it as an act of projection. ''Whites saw in Chinese workers precisely what they hated about their own lives: hard and underpaid work, long hours, poor living conditions and a dearth of women.'' In other words, white workers made the Chinese their scapegoats because of the similarities, rather than the differences, between them.
 Every now and then, as in this example, Pfaelzer hits her stride in a clear and insightful passage of analysis. Her summation of the implications of Chinese litigation is a model of memorable historical interpretation. ''The Chinese brought these suits as part of a strategy of forcing a nation to obey its own laws. Despite the violence and the limits on access to the courts, they acted as if legal judgments could be impartial.''
 The stories Pfaelzer tells deserve our attention, and yet this is not a particularly well-written or well-organized book. In the end, her tireless and thorough research -- sifting through 19th-century newspapers, pursuing diaries and memoirs from local historical societies, seeking out court documents, tracking diplomatic correspondence -- has left her with a nearly impossible problem. How is a writer to make an artful narrative out of tales in which the same miserable events unfold over and over again? Cataloging the harassment of the Chinese in the 1880s, Pfaelzer finally resorts to assembling, in white type on 35 black pages, what she calls a ''litany of hate'': ''a topical and chronological register of acts of ethnic cleansing.'' This is, in other words, the literary genre the rest of us call a list.
 With a topic of this seriousness, it may seem petty to dwell on cryptic sentences or the lack of a uniting theme in paragraphs held together by intellectual duct tape of weakened stickiness. But the uneven quality of the writing has consequence. It gives the reader an unintended relief from an otherwise unrelenting confrontation with human cruelty. One more round of revisions, with sharper phrasing, clearer narrative and more thorough analysis, and Pfaelzer could have sealed off the reader's route of emotional escape.
 In her introduction, Pfaelzer makes an ambitious, though brief, effort to place the Chinese expulsions in a broad planetary history, remembering her ''own family's diaspora'' in flight from Nazi Germany and referring to the ''millions of refugees in Nigeria, Eritrea, Iraq and Darfur'' today. She also notes that ''thousands of immigrants, thousands of people born in the United States to parents born abroad, and thousands of others are marching through the streets of Los Angeles, Houston and New York, refusing to be temporary people, transients, braceros, guests or sojourners.'' 
 Could a reckoning with the unhappy history Pfaelzer documents bring some clarity and wisdom to contemporary debates on immigration? When we ask it to guide our decisions in the present, history has a way of speaking more like a sphinx than like the author of a how-to manual. And yet, in this particular territory, historical perspective surrenders some of its habitual obliqueness and subtlety. First, like many other important works in this field, Pfaelzer's book makes an irrefutable case that immigration played a crucial role in building the economic well-being of the United States. Second, we must acknowledge that nothing has immunized us against the unhappy effect that economic disappointment works on the soul, or against the temptation to find scapegoats to hold responsible for deeper problems. 
 In 1876, commenting on violence against the Chinese in nearby Truckee, Calif., The Reno Evening Gazette in Nevada declared that one attack, in which vigilantes set two cabins on fire and shot at the occupants as they fled, represented a ''phase of human depravity and cupidity that would cast a gloom over the dark shades of hell.'' You might dismiss that phrasing as melodramatic and overwrought. But contemplate the stories brought together in this book, and the writers at that newspaper will seem simply to have stated the truth.

HEADLINE: Director's Quest for Truth Among the Downtrodden

BYLINE: By DENNIS LIM

 BODY:
FOR someone whose films have until recently gone largely unseen, the Portuguese director Pedro Costa has a pretty vociferous fan club. His admirers include the French director Jacques Rivette (who called him ''genuinely great'') and the Canadian photographer Jeff Wall (who claimed that Mr. Costa's films improve on Robert Bresson's). He has been feted at festivals and museums from Vienna to Mexico City to Tokyo. His work has been extensively discussed in Cahiers du Cinema, Artforum and Film Comment. Last fall Cinema Scope magazine produced promotional -- or, more to the point, polemical-- T-shirts, identical to the ''Vote for Pedro'' T's from ''Napoleon Dynamite'' except for an additional phrase: ''Pedro Costa, that is.''
But Mr. Costa, 48, is not uniformly loved by world-cinema tastemakers. The press screening for ''Colossal Youth'' at the Cannes Film Festival last year was punctuated by a steady stream of departing critics. Detractors call his films slow and obdurate. Their rigor and stringency, along with the ferocious rhetoric often deployed by his champions, have given him the forbidding air of a high-art Spartan. 
 That reputation does the work a disservice. Few movies are as concretely rooted in physical reality or as profoundly attentive to their social context as Mr. Costa's. In recent years he has shot almost exclusively in the slums of Lisbon, working closely with the downtrodden inhabitants. Staking out a radical middle between documentary and fiction, he has invented a heroic and quite literal form of Arte Povera, a monumental cinema of humble means. (A retrospective of his films, which has been touring North America, starts Friday at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan and runs through Aug. 12.)
 Speaking by telephone from Lisbon, Mr. Costa called his methods a throwback to, of all things, old Hollywood. ''It's like a studio system,'' he said. ''We go to work every day. We have our economic structure -- everyone gets paid the same -- and we have our stars.''
 Mr. Costa's first feature, ''O Sangue'' (''The Blood,'' 1989), was not a reliable indicator of things to come. A black-and-white reverie of family disintegration, it is, in the best sense, a young man's film, drunk on romantic doom and movie love -- a rhapsodic style Mr. Costa now regards as ''camouflage.'' 
 Frustrated with the rightward drift in Portuguese politics and the scarcity of financing, he ventured abroad -- to the West African islands of Cape Verde, a former Portuguese colony -- and made ''Casa de Lava'' (Down to Earth,'' 1994). The story of a nurse who accompanies a comatose laborer home to Cape Verde, it changed the course of his career.
 The Cape Verdeans he met sent him back to Lisbon with gifts for relatives who had emigrated there. The delivery mission led him to the shantytown of Fontainhas, where many Cape Verdeans had settled. He decided to set a film in the neighborhood, using residents as actors. 
 The result, ''Ossos'' (''Bones,'' 1997), centered on the newborn infant of two hapless teenagers, is a parable of economic and spiritual desperation as oblique and concentrated as anything by Bresson. Mr. Costa was dissatisfied with the shoot, not least for having invaded a residential neighborhood with the unwieldy machinery of film production.
 ''We would be shooting late at night and shining lights into people's houses,'' he said. ''I realized there's something wrong with the way movies are made today.''
 Mr. Costa set out to address not merely logistical headaches but also the responsibility that comes with picking up a camera. The act of filmmaking is premised on a discrepancy of power. As Mr. Costa put it, ''The balance is off between those behind and in front of the camera.'' His next film, ''In Vanda's Room'' (2000), went a long way toward redressing the inequality. 
 Encouraged by Vanda Duarte, an actress in ''Ossos,'' he continued to film in Fontainhas, which was being demolished. This time he did so with a small video camera, often by himself. He grew close to his subjects and shot for almost two years. From 140 hours of footage he shaped a three-hour film.
 A series of shadowy domestic tableaus (the camera never moves, and Mr. Costa used only available light), ''In Vanda's Room'' is a stark, intimate portrait of a community whose world is literally falling apart. (Bulldozers are continuously heard on the soundtrack.) It feels at times like a documentary but is actually the result of long conversations and multiple takes. Ms. Duarte and her friends, who sit around, talk, prepare heroin fixes, smoke and shoot up, are not documentary subjects so much as actors playing themselves. 
 Mr. Costa handled the copious drug use matter-of-factly. ''I was never moralistic,'' he said. ''But I was hoping to get them to see that drugs are a punishment imposed on them by external forces.''
 While shooting ''In Vanda's Room'' he recognized that he didn't want to return to traditional filmmaking. ''Going to work on the bus I felt exactly like I should for the rest of my life,'' he said. ''It's almost not a film at that point. It's a job you do, a job you like. We could be making chairs or shoes. It just happens to be images and sounds.''
 Mr. Costa's films assert that there are more important things than art, even as they insist that beauty is everywhere to be found. ''Art should be more than it is and a lot less than it is,'' he said, voicing the implicit manifesto of his films. ''Brecht said he made jewels for the poor. He talked about the epic quality of the day-to-day life of common people. That's something I pursue. I really want them to be heroes.''
 He left Fontainhas to make ''Where Lies Your Hidden Smile?'' (2001), a documentary on Jean-Marie Straub and Daniele Huillet, the avant-garde filmmakers he had long admired. (Mr. Costa speaks passionately of his ''idols'' who range from the Hollywood titan John Ford to the punk-rock rabble-rouser John Lydon.)
 ''Colossal Youth,'' which came next, stemmed from an impulse to document the relocation of the Fontainhas residents. Ms. Duarte, now on methadone though still possessed of her signature hacking cough, appears in the film, but the focus is on Ventura, an elderly Cape Verdean whose wife has left him. Mr. Costa again amassed hundreds of hours of footage, but he moves further from documentary to include surreal and mythic touches. Ventura wanders between the old ghetto, where a few stragglers remain, and the new housing project. He refers to the men and women he meets as his children and repeatedly recites a love letter (adapted from the poet Robert Desnos) to his absent wife.
 In a sense ''Colossal Youth'' is a film about walls. The contrast between the worn interiors of Fontainhas, walls on which entire lives are inscribed, and the whitewashed surfaces of the anonymous new apartments is almost shocking.
 There is a third space the movie briefly occupies -- the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon -- and to hear Mr. Costa describe the genesis of a scene he shot there, the walls are again significant. He was driving with Ventura one day when they passed the Gulbenkian. ''Ventura told me he worked on the construction years ago but had never been to the museum,'' Mr. Costa said, so they pulled over. Inside he noticed that Ventura was drawn less to the art than to his own handiwork: the walls. ''He's moved that his walls have Rubens and Rembrandts,'' he said. ''But he kept looking behind the paintings.''

HEADLINE: Now You Own It, Soon You Don't?

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
IT'S not so much the modest bungalow's spacious second-floor addition or the expansive side yard that gets to Lori Ann Vendetti.
The thing that keeps her fighting is the misty ocean air that floats through her doorway when she lets her dog out in the morning. The salty aroma can transport her back to childhood weekends spent playing on the beach with her two brothers, long since dead and gone.
 Neither Ms. Vendetti, 46, nor her parents across the street believe they can afford another place within a sniff of the ocean if the City of Long Branch, N.J., wins its 12-year effort to turn their homes over to a private developer who wants to build luxury condominiums.
 ''We always feel like things are stacked against us,'' said Ms. Vendetti, who has lived in her home for 12 years. ''But if they're going to take it from me, they're going to take it with a fight.'' 
 During the last two years, homeowners and property-rights advocates across the country have echoed that sentiment, and state lawmakers have answered. A controversial United States Supreme Court decision in June 2005, which upheld the power of local governments to seize private property for the benefit of private businesses, inspired an uprising that led 40 states to pass laws that rein in, to varying degrees, that authority. 
 But legislatures in the three states in the New York metropolitan area, long seen by property-rights advocates as home to some of the worst abuses of eminent domain, have done little to change the status quo.
 ''New Jersey and New York are among the worst states in the country for eminent domain abuses -- New Jersey is really awful,'' said Dana Berliner, a senior lawyer at the Institute for Justice in Arlington, Va., which represents residential and business owners facing condemnation. ''What's interesting is that New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are some of the few states that have not managed to pass any decent legislation.''
 In Connecticut, where the United States Supreme Court case originated, Gov. M. Jodi Rell late last month quietly signed a law that includes a prohibition on taking property ''primarily'' to increase local tax revenues, leaving open that reasoning as a secondary cause. 
 New York, which already allowed the taking of property for private use, saw its lawmakers introduce 17 related bills in 2006. But the Legislature passed only those laws seeking to ban two specific projects. 
 Similarly, New Jersey legislators have been unable to pass any bill. The State Supreme Court recently stepped into the breach, arguing that cities and towns cannot condemn properties simply because another use could be more productive. That ruling, in Gallenthin Realty Development v. Borough of Paulsboro, has already had an impact on several projects, including a plan to build 2,000 condominiums in downtown Newark.
 Other states have instituted more precise definitions of blight, set minimum compensation levels above market value for the owners of seized properties and restricted eminent domain to more traditional public projects like schools and roads. The legislative changes have been driven by an unusual alliance of conservative Republican property-rights advocates and liberals interested in the rights of lower-income people. 
 Not everyone believes such measures are needed. It remains to be seen if the new laws will protect property owners without chilling redevelopment projects. ''You had this huge uproar,'' said Larry Morandi, who has tracked the new laws at the National Conference of State Legislatures, ''and an incredibly fast legislative response. The effect of that legislation will be seen in how it is implemented, and that takes time.''
 While supporters of the current laws say a reasoned analysis would show that eminent domain is most often employed as a last resort and without major conflict, what has driven the push for change and has led to so many lawsuits is anger at the potential loss of control over such a fundamental aspect of life.
 The lead plaintiff in the United States Supreme Court case, Susette Kelo, a nurse who lived in a pink Victorian cottage in New London, Conn., opposed the town's condemnation of her neighborhood to make way for a private development of offices, condominiums and a hotel. The 5-to-4 majority opinion held that promoting economic development met the ''public use'' clause of the Fifth Amendment that allows condemnations. In a dissenting opinion in the case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor gave voice to the fear that started a revolt: ''Under the banner of economic development, all private property is now vulnerable to being taken and transferred to another private owner, so long as it might be upgraded.''
 IN Norwalk, Conn., Nancy Esposito doesn't want to be uprooted or upgraded. Her family has owned and run Casey's Sheet Metal Service in Norwalk for 15 years. Five years ago, a developer showed up offering to buy their building as part of a plan to remake several blocks. Ms. Esposito has resisted, and watched as the developer bought most of the buildings and land around her.
 ''They keep saying they want to make this area a destination,'' Ms. Esposito said. ''I say that it is a destination. It's my destination.''
 The developer, Stanley M. Seligson, a Norwalk native, envisions a pedestrian-friendly neighborhood spanning several blocks, with more than 500,000 square feet of stores, restaurants and theaters, 350 apartments and a large medical center. His project would be contiguous with other large developments.
 Mr. Seligson said he has so far acquired 75 percent of the property and was determined to acquire the remaining properties without the town invoking eminent domain. Town officials see the neighborhood as part an old urban core that has not responded to less sweeping redevelopment incentives. Four contiguous redevelopment projects are in the works, all of which have involved or could involve taking property through eminent domain if negotiations between the developer and property owners fail, said Susan Sweitzer, a senior project manager for the Norwalk Redevelopment Agency.
 ''The impetus is on the private developer to make this a nonissue,'' she said.
 Ms. Esposito said she believed the cards were already stacked against her.
 ''They keep saying they will use eminent domain as a last resort,'' she said. ''But when they have the ultimate power to take your property, it's a done deal. There is no such thing as private property anymore.''
 Governor Rell responded to the United States Supreme Court ruling involving the Kelo case by asking local governments to observe a voluntary moratorium on condemnations for private development until the state legislature could act. This year, she introduced legislation.
 ''It is time to clarify our eminent domain laws and make it absolutely clear when and why governments can -- and cannot -- take private property for public purposes,'' Mrs. Rell said in a statement in March.
 The law that Mrs. Rell signed requires municipal legislative bodies to approve eminent domain seizures by a two-thirds majority and build in other protective measures for property owners. But property-rights advocates say the law's ban on citing increased tax revenues as a primary reason for condemnation will do little to clarify concerns about when property can be taken. 
 The new law also didn't include a provision that had been proposed by the governor to reimburse property owners at 125 percent of fair market value. Still, a spokesman for the governor said Mrs. Rell was pleased.
 ''Did it achieve everything that she wanted in one fell stroke? No,'' said Rich Harris, the spokesman. ''But certainly this is a considerable step forward from where the state was.''
 James S. Alesi, a state senator from the Rochester area, held a series of hearings across the state on eminent domain after the Kelo decision. He said he was repeatedly told that New York didn't need a handful of hastily drafted bills, but rather a commission to study the issue.
 ''I thought it was beneficial to learn one key thing: We don't really have to do a lot in New York State,'' he said. ''As compared to other areas around the country, New York's laws are pretty strong.''
 The New York State Bar Association has been the most prominent supporter of that position. Patricia E. Salkin, chairwoman of the association's eminent domain task force, said state laws might need tweaking, including a passage to increase public involvement in redevelopment plans and to extend the 30-day period allowed for owners of condemned property to file appeals. But she said states that passed more sweeping laws risked losing vital projects.
 ''We shouldn't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' said Ms. Salkin, director of the Government Law Center of Albany Law School. ''We should make sure that it's a fair playing field for everybody.'' 
 State Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Greenburgh in Westchester, said the choice was not black and white. ''The bottom line is we can fix the law so it protects average people and still maintain it as a tool,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''The bar is entrenched on this one, and they're wrong.''
 In 2004, Mr. Brodsky pushed through a bill that required that towns notify by mail property owners facing condemnation. 
 It followed a controversy in Port Chester, in which a local business owner hadn't seen the Westchester village's notice in a local newspaper that his property was facing condemnation to make way for a Stop & Shop supermarket. 
 The 30 days that the state law allows for appeals passed before the businessman, Bill Brody, had even heard about the plan. A federal judge this month ruled that Mr. Brody's due process rights had been violated. 
 ''I think it's obvious that people are upset by what eminent domain is being used for,'' Mr. Brody said, ''and I think things are going to change.'' 
 Not all redevelopment projects engender large controversy. On Long Island, the Village of Hempstead is moving forward with a $2 billion plan to replace 26 acres in the village's downtrodden center with a mix of 2,500 housing units, 600,000 square feet of retail space and a performing arts center. The city has agreed to sell 21 properties it owns to the developer and seize up to 58 privately owned properties if the developer cannot come to terms with the owners. Most of the concerns voiced so far, including at a packed meeting last week, have involved ensuring that the plan includes a significant amount of affordable housing and that current residents receive enough compensation to find new homes.
 Mr. Brodsky introduced a bill last year calling for the appointment of an eminent domain ombudsman, compensating displaced homeowners at 150 percent of fair market value, and requiring that all condemnations for economic development be part of a comprehensive plan. 
 THE bill gained no traction in the State Assembly. ''This is an area where there's a lot of comfort with a bad law, and that's unfortunate,'' Mr. Brodsky said.
 Mr. Alesi, the state senator from Rochester, maintains that state laws need only to be ''buffed up'' and that the laws may not offer enough protections. Courts are relied on to catch abuses, but average people don't have the resources for a legal fight with the government, he said. ''No one should have the American dream turned into their own personal nightmare because of the government,'' he said.
 Last month, the New Jersey Supreme Court ruled that the Town of Paulsboro had overreached in relying on a consultant's determination that an undeveloped 63-acre parcel could be condemned because it was ''not fully productive.''
 ''Under that approach, any property that is operated in less than optimal manner is arguably 'blighted,' '' wrote Chief Justice James R. Zazzali in the court's unanimous opinion. ''If such an all-encompassing definition were adopted, most property in the state would be eligible for redevelopment.''
 Citing the Supreme Court ruling, an Essex County Superior Court judge ruled this month that Newark could not designate as blighted a 14-acre area on and around Mulberry Street so the land could be used to build condominiums. Several property owners had fought the city's efforts to take the land by eminent domain, arguing to the court that the area was still productive. A spokeswoman for Mayor Cory A. Booker said the city had not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling. 
 And an appellate panel last week rejected Lodi officials' efforts to replace two trailer parks with housing and shops. A newly elected Borough Council had dropped the plan earlier this month.
 A bill that would more narrowly define blight passed the New Jersey State Assembly last year but has been tied up in a State Senate committee since.
 The New Jersey League of Municipalities opposes limiting the power of municipalities in using eminent domain. Its opinion carries weight in a state with 566 municipalities, a strong tradition of home rule, and one in which many legislators are also mayors of their hometowns.
 William G. Dressel, executive director of the league, said that with little undeveloped land left in the state, and with towns increasingly relying on property taxes to provide services, responsible town leaders must look for ways to redevelop unproductive land. ''We were quite frankly relieved that the court did not unravel the eminent domain statutes as it relates to the use of that tool for economic development purposes,'' he said. ''We feel very strongly that eminent domain is a viable economic development tool in New Jersey that is used sparingly.''
 The state's public advocate, Ronald K. Chen, said a 1992 revision of the state statute created the ''not fully productive'' justification that ''opened up the floodgates'' for the improper use of eminent domain. 
 Mr. Chen's office recently issued a report that listed the plan in Long Branch, where Ms. Vendetti lives near the beach, under the heading ''Bogus Blight.'' It said the town based its conclusion on ''superficial'' exterior inspections that noted deteriorating paint or chipped masonry.
 Nothing appears to be decrepit about the Vendettis' homes. 
 Carmen Vendetti, 80, had saved his money driving a truck to buy his family, in 1960, a modest respite from the harsher environs of their home in Newark. He and his wife, Josephine, moved there full time after he retired. Ms. Vendetti saved her money from a job with Amtrak and bought a house across the street from her parents in 1995. Two months later, she attended a town meeting where a developer's model of the neighborhood showed luxury buildings all along the oceanfront.
 ''They had a house on my lot,'' she said. ''I just laughed and thought, 'How are they going to do that?' No one ever used the words 'eminent domain.' ''
 But Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for 17 years, said some in the area ignored the redevelopment plan, thinking it would fail, as had many before. Some homeowners have accepted offers of units made affordable to them in the new development, he said. He said that with just 20 percent of the construction completed, the beachfront has been transformed from a dangerous area of boarded-up storefronts to an upscale, year-round destination that includes packed restaurants and a popular park. 
 He said he thought the recent emotional backlash may dissuade officials in other areas from even trying such a sweeping turnaround using eminent domain.
 ''Politically it won't work anymore,'' he said. ''I think the time has come and gone.''

HEADLINE: Tapping Equity in an Emergency

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
AMERICANS have used the run-up in real estate values in recent years to build financial flexibility for themselves, and many homeowners reasonably believe they can use their home equity for last-minute emergencies.
 But if they wait until an emergency actually strikes to apply for a home-equity loan, they may be in for a painful shock, financial advisers and mortgage executives say. The very nature of some financial emergencies, like unemployment, may disqualify an applicant from a loan.
 A better alternative for many, planners say, is to open a relatively small home-equity line of credit and leave it untouched until a true emergency arises. 
 ''It's always good to have some place to go in an emergency where you can just write a check without asking someone,'' said Dick Bellmer, chairman of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors. ''And a home-equity credit line will, in most cases, be the cheapest way to obtain that debt, because it's tax deductible.''
 Home-equity credit lines work much the same way as credit cards, but they also have important advantages. Not only is the interest paid on the loan's balance typically tax deductible, but the interest rates themselves are much lower than those on credit cards. As of late July, many banks offered these loans to borrowers with good credit at interest rates that were equal to the prime rate, or even slightly below -- roughly 8.25 percent. The average interest rate on a credit card, meanwhile, is about 14.5 percent, and it is generally not tax deductible.
 These benefits have not been lost on the millions of homeowners who have taken out home-equity credit lines in recent years. Some have even taken out such loans to pay off their more costly credit-card debts. 
 Most of the time, borrowers have not fallen behind on paying back these loans. According to a recent survey of commercial banks by the American Bankers Association, the delinquency rate on home-equity credit lines is the lowest of any consumer credit category it tracks, at just 0.6 percent.
 That is good news, said Mr. Bellmer, a partner in Deerfield Financial Advisors Inc. in Indianapolis. ''If you abuse one of these, it'll hurt you, because it's tied to something more than just a credit card,'' he said. ''It'll affect your ability to get another mortgage, and all kinds of other things.''
 Assuming homeowners are interested in using a home-equity credit line only as an emergency fund, Mr. Bellmer said, they should look closely at monthly expenses and the sorts of emergencies they might encounter. Self-employed people who do not have disability insurance, for instance, may need a relatively large credit line to protect them for a longer period.
 Home-equity lines come in a number of varieties. Borrowers will find variations in the indexes to which the loan's interest rates are tied, the period over which borrowers may draw from the credit line, and the lender's flexibility when it comes to locking in the interest rate for portions of the credit line.
 Industry executives say that borrowers should try to avoid loans with prepayment penalties. The average homeowner keeps a house for about seven years, and when it's sold, the credit line must be paid off. 
 ''If you already have a good relationship with your bank,'' Mr. Bellmer said, ''you might be able to get the prepayment penalty waived.''

HEADLINE: The Profit and The Pauper

BYLINE: By Joe Nocera. 
Joe Nocera writes the Talking Business column for The Times.

 BODY:
I GRADUATED from college about $8,000 in debt.
Yes, I know, with English majors now emerging from graduate school saddled with as much as $100,000 worth of student loans, my puny amount seems almost laughable. But it was a different era -- 1974 -- and, at least to me, it was real money. 
 I was exactly the kind of person the student loan program is intended to help; without those loans, I could never have afforded to go to a private university. But I was also the kind of college graduate who was always going to struggle to pay the loans back. I entered the job market in the teeth of a recession. I had to ask for a one-year ''hardship'' delay because I couldn't find a job. And when I finally did find work, it was fulfilling but low-paying. 
 Consequently, I was constantly falling behind on my payments. The bank that administered my federally guaranteed loans would send a stern notice whenever I got too far behind, which would prompt me to cobble together a few payments by skipping some other bill. Then I would start falling behind again. 
 Though I found the situation onerous at the time, what strikes me now is how benign it actually was. My bank probably didn't make a dime on me. It never raised my interest rate as punishment, nor did I ever have to pay any late fees. My chronic tardiness didn't even affect my credit rating. And had I defaulted, I would not have had my wages garnished, or been stuck with the debt if I had filed for bankruptcy. All of which can happen today. 
 ''Student loans have become big business,'' says Barmak Nassirian, the executive director of the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers -- and high interest rates and hefty late fees are part of what makes it so profitable. Many a student comes out of college only to discover that his loan has become a noose around his neck. 
 For some months now, the news about student loans has largely been about scandal -- how lenders have curried favor with financial aid officers to get on their ''preferred lender'' lists, for instance. Bills in both the House and the Senate aim to reform the system. But there is a larger, perhaps sadder story here: How did this critically important social program become so unmoored from its original intent, which was to help poor and middle-class students pay for college? To put it another way, why did student loans become more about shareholders than about students?
 GEORGE MILLER, a Democratic Congressman from California, has been obsessing about student loans for a long time. ''If you were going to start this program all over again,'' he says ''you would go back to the concept that this is a service, and an investment, provided by the federal government. And you would probably go back to a direct loan program, funded with some sort of revolving fund. That is how the G.I. bill worked. But that is now viewed as foreign and wrongheaded. Now we have this idea that there has to be a business model.''
 Representative Miller is the author of the bill passed by the House earlier this month. It calls for many useful changes. It raises the amount a student can borrow, which is necessary because the cost of college has risen so dramatically. Over the next five years it cuts interest rates in half, to 3.4 percent, for the neediest students. It insures that no more than 15 percent of a graduate's income would have to go toward repayment -- an important idea, since recent graduates shouldn't have to choose a job based solely on how much it pays. 
 But let's be honest here. No reform legislation is going to change the essential nature of any business, and student loans are no exception. 
 Big lenders will see their subsidies lowered, but they will still be guaranteed big profits. They will still be able to charge those late fees and higher interest rates when borrowers get in trouble. And they will still be able to pursue deadbeats practically into the grave, since people who file for bankruptcy have to keep paying back their student loans -- an astonishing exception to the bankruptcy law that lenders lobbied for, and won, in the 1990s. The student loan business will still be, well, a business. 
 The critical markers in the evolution of the student loan begin, really, with the decision to offer federally guaranteed loans through banks and other financial institutions. It didn't have to be done that way. Congress could have decided that only the government could lend taxpayer dollars. But without a middleman, the loans would be listed as outstanding on the government's books, thus increasing the federal deficit. It was far more politically attractive to use banks to make the loans, and then guarantee them with the taxpayers' money.
 Even with the guarantee, banks were not terribly excited about administering a loan program for college students with uncertain job prospects. So the government tried to make lending even more attractive. It subsidized the interest rates. In the case of a default, it guaranteed that banks would get back not just the principal but the interest. It took all the risk out of lending.
 And to get more loans into the hands of students, in 1972 the government established a quasi-government entity, the Student Loan Marketing Association, now known as Sallie Mae. Sallie's role was to buy up student loans from banks, freeing capital for yet more loans. It could also market and service loans, but it could not originate them. Although always a corporation -- much the way Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have both government status and corporate status -- ''it didn't go all out in search of the next buck,'' Mr. Nassarian says.
 In the 1990s, two important events took place. First, Congress finally decided to lend directly to students. The Direct Loan Program was an immediate hit; within a few years, it had 40 percent of the market. But this was not the kind of G.I. bill, revolving-fund loan that Representative Miller envisions; its intent was to minimize the cost to the taxpayer, not to the student. So it had many of the late fees and higher interest penalties that private lenders were allowed to impose, and the interest rate was the same, 6.8 percent. Shortly after the program passed, the Republicans won both houses of Congress, and began fighting a rear-guard action against it.
 Second, Sallie Mae broke away from the federal government. Its chief executive was an aggressive, profit-oriented man named Albert L. Lord, who feared that the Direct Loan Program would hurt Sallie. Privatization would enable him to fight back. 
 Once it had the ability to originate loans, Sallie devised marketing plans, sought ways to undercut the government lending program and began convincing college financial aid officers to give it special preference. It wasn't too long before private lenders won back some of the market share they had lost to the Direct Loan Program; they now control about 75 percent of the market. 
 As for Sallie Mae, by early 2006, it controlled 35 percent of the federally guaranteed student loan market; No. 2, Citibank, had less than 10 percent. Sallie is also the dominant player in the private student loan market -- that is, loans that are not federally guaranteed. Between the two, it originated $23.4 billion in loans last year alone, and made more than $1 billion in profits.
 ''Sallie revolutionized the industry,'' says Representative Miller, and he doesn't mean that as a compliment. It imposed fees and penalties that added costs when students were already having trouble repaying loans -- while increasing Sallie's profits. It bought its own collection agency. It lobbied to make it nearly impossible for borrowers to escape their student debt. (It was aided along the way by occasional reports of the wealthy reneging on their student debt, thus saddling the taxpayer with the bill.) 
 On one level, what Sallie Mae did under Mr. Lord's leadership was consistent with the times. The dotcom bubble was in full flower. The only thing Americans seemed to care about was whether a company's stock price was rising. And Sallie's was certainly doing that -- more than 1,400 percent between 1995 and 2006. But in our obsession with the market, we had forgotten that this stock's performance resulted in no small part from Sallie Mae -- like many of its competitors -- making money on the backs of struggling college graduates. It was a little like the credit card business: the ''best'' customers aren't the ones who pay off their monthly charges on time; they're the ones who can't. For the student loan industry, the best customers are the students who take on more debt than they can handle to get through school. What's been lost is the idea that student loans are a service with benefits that transcend the financial.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Lord, who stepped down as C.E.O. in 2006 and is currently chairman, was getting rich; between 1999 and 2004, his pay package was worth $235 million, most of it in stock options. In April, Sallie Mae agreed to be bought by a private equity consortium for $26 billion. When the deal closes, as it is expected to in the fall, Mr. Lord will walk off with an additional $135 million.
 No company likes to think of itself as rapacious, and Sallie Mae is no exception. When I spoke to the company spokesman, Tom Joyce, he portrayed Sallie Mae as a company that is doing well by doing good. 
 Sallie dominates the marketplace because people like its products, he said. If wages are garnished to pay back a college loan, that is Congress's fault, because Congress passed the law. ''The private sector is more efficient in making and collecting loans,'' he said. ''When is the last time you had good service from the government?''
 As for the pending legislation, Mr. Joyce said that cutting government subsidies will whittle Sallie's already thin margins to nearly nothing, and student borrowers will wind up bearing extra costs. ''Let's be careful of the unintended consequences,'' he said. When I asked him about the social goals -- as opposed to the business goal -- of lending to college students, he replied, ''Universities are huge businesses with huge endowments. Shouldn't their vendors be in business, too?'' 
 It's good that Congress is wrestling with the problem of student loans. Let's hope a decent law emerges. But let's also keep in mind that student loans went from being a service to a business because that's the way the larger society has evolved over the past few decades. And until society changes, we can hardly expect the student loan business to change. 
 It's a sobering lesson in the limits of capitalism. As a culture, we praise the ability of the market to create the proper incentives and do more good than not. And mostly that's true. But there are some things that are too important to entrust to the profit motive. Shouldn't paying for a college education be one of them?

HEADLINE: Your Energy Use Measured Daily And on Facebook

 BODY:
Clive Thompson in the Aug. 15 issue of Wired magazine came up with a creative way to save energy. 
 To improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions, we first need to make omnipresent the hidden facts about our usage -- paint them on the world around us. ...
 There's already solid evidence that feedback mechanisms can change eco-behavior. Think about how hybrid-car owners become obsessed with the dashboard display showing an on-the-fly calculation of gas mileage. The result? They change the way they drive, specifically trying to maximize mileage. It becomes a game, an enjoyable challenge, complete with quantifiable personal bests. 
 Here's an even wilder idea: How about making our energy use visible to everyone? Imagine if your daily consumption were part of your Facebook page -- and broadcast to your friends by RSS feed. ... 
 The hope is that it could spawn a cascade of conservation. It's fun seeing your personal energy tab go down by kilowatts -- but just imagine watching the world's usage plunge by terawatts or petawatts. It would be like a global Prius, with millions worldwide tweaking the Earth for maximum mileage. Now that's fun.
 Test Tube Demographics
 In its latest issue, The Economist offered a way to stop the declining population in many countries: encouraging greater use of assisted reproductive technologies, or ARTS.
 I.V.F. does seem to be keeping up the numbers in at least one country. Tina Jensen of the University of Southern Denmark has just finished a study of more than 700,000 Danish women. She found that young women in Denmark have a significantly lower natural conception rate than in past decades. ... Whatever the cause, she also found that the effect has been almost completely compensated for by an increasing use of ARTS. Denmark's native population is more or less stable, but some 3.9 percent of babies born there in 2003 (the most recent year for which figures are available) were the result of I.V.F. The comparable figure for another northern European country, Britain was 1.5 percent.
 Without I.V.F., then, the number of Danes would be shrinking fast.
 Lobbying From Turkey
 Michael Crowley, a senior editor at The New Republic, offers up what might be a huge battle in Washington. And it's a very old issue, fueled by money from lobbyists.
 Few people would place the Armenian genocide on their top 10 -- or even top 1,000 -- list of the day's pressing issues. In fact, many Americans would likely be at a loss to explain who or what the Armenians are, much less what happened to them 90 years ago. Not so in Washington. For the past several years, U.S. representatives, lobbyists, and foreign emissaries have been locked in a vicious struggle over a resolution in Congress that would officially deem as genocide the massacre of up to 1.5 million ethnic Armenians in the Ottoman Empire....
 Even more striking than the historic Turkish-Armenian hatred festering in the halls of Congress, however, is the way Washington's political elites are cashing in on it. ...Turkey showers Washington with political operators more than happy to argue their case--for the right price. Few niches of Washington lobbying are as lucrative as the foreign racket, which explains why more than 1,800 lobbyists are currently registered to represent more than 660 overseas clients. Thus the Turks have found no shortage of willing pitchmen. Turkey currently maintains expensive contracts with at least four different Washington lobbying and p.r. firms. The result is that unsuspecting congressmen and staffers frequently find themselves badgered by well-heeled Turkish emissaries. ...
 Strange as it may be to find a World War I massacre on the 2007 Washington agenda, even more bizarre is the possibility that it may precipitate an international crisis. ... The Turks, should their lobbying firepower fail to stop the genocide bill from moving forward, have an even mightier weapon to brandish: the war in Iraq. As they did in 2000, the Turks are hinting they will shut down Incirlik, a far more dire threat now that Incirlik supplies U.S. forces occupying Iraq. Administration officials also fear Turkey might close the Habur Gate, a border point through which U.S. supplies flow into northern Iraq. In an April letter to congressional leaders, [Condoleezza] Rice and Defense Secretary Robert Gates bluntly warned that a House resolution ''could harm American troops in the field [and] constrain our ability to supply our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.''

HEADLINE: How Ford Brought Power to the People

BYLINE: By DON SHERMAN

DATELINE: DEARBORN, Mich. 

 BODY:
THE Age of Speed turns 75 this year along with the Little Deuce Coupe that ushered it in, democratizing horsepower and providing the clay from which countless hot rods would be molded.
Three decades before the heyday of the muscle car, Henry Ford inadvertently invented the hot rod by bolting a 65-horsepower V-8 engine into a light, attractive body. His breakthrough cost $460 in its most basic form, a two-door roadster, only $50 more than the same car powered by a four-cylinder engine. Ford figured that even in the depths of the Depression, this was within reach of the working class.
 Six million Americans flocked to Ford dealerships on the announcement day. 
 Yet the car, which is now seen as a 20th century icon and one of the industry's most significant models, was not a financial success. After an initial spurt of orders, harsh reality set in: most Americans couldn't afford lunch, let alone installment payments, so Ford's 1932 sales were barely half of the previous year's volume. 
 Over 10 months of production, 178,749 Ford Model 18 V-8s were manufactured, along with about 75,000 Model Bs that had the same body but a 4-cylinder engine. Both versions of the '32 Ford, each offered in 14 body styles, were lumped together under a common label: the Deuce. 
 After World War II, returning servicemen found that Deuces were cheap and plentiful used cars; that the flathead V-8 engine could be easily tweaked to produce more horsepower; and that the clean design lent itself to modification. Hot-rodders smitten by the combination made the Deuce the holy grail of home-built concoctions.
 ''The Deuce won the hot rodder's admiration because it was the first car that was both affordable and fast right out of the box,'' said Pete Chapouris, a hot-rodder for 50 years and the president of the SoCal Speed Shop in Pomona, Calif.
 To check the vital signs of the seminal Deuce as it turns 75, I test-drove an original '32 Ford V-8 De Luxe Roadster owned by Lynn Stringer of Northville, Mich.
 Motoring sedately along park roads near Mr. Stringer's home in suburban Detroit, the Deuce copes without the trappings now considered necessary. Climate control is achieved by tipping the windshield open to flush the cockpit's heat with a cool breeze. Video entertainment is a soothing sky and a cloud show reflected in the rear of a headlamp shell. The soundtrack is a V-8 murmur so subdued that conversation with my chaperone was not impeded. Mr. Stringer's Deuce roadster elicited so many smiles and thumbs-up salutes that we felt like Marines in a Memorial Day parade.
 The '32 Ford was the most fruitful collaboration between Henry Ford, the homespun industrialist who put the world on wheels, and his son, Edsel, who was president of the Ford Motor Company from 1919 until his death in 1943.
 By the late 1920s Chevrolet had passed Ford, whose Model T had lingered too long, in sales. Chevy countered Ford's new Model A of 1928 by introducing a ''Six for the price of a Four'' the next year. The '32 V-8 was Ford's counterpunch: it cost only $15 more than the Chevy Six and $35 less than a four-cylinder Plymouth.
 Henry Ford's other foe was the Great Depression, which drove the city of Detroit to bankruptcy, left half the local workforce unemployed and slashed car production to 15 percent of capacity. He hoped that an exciting new Ford might draw cash being hoarded under mattresses, driving the country out of the economic ditch.
 Edsel Ford brought an eye for design to the project. Henry's son, more urbane than his father, borrowed visual touches from the company's luxury division to give the '32 the look of a baby Lincoln. A streamlined radiator shell, fluted bumpers and bright accents made the new model a standout.
 While V-8s were available in several luxury models, no such engine had ever been offered in a car designed for the working class. Henry relished the challenge of inventing a V-8 for the masses. He integrated several components into a single engine-block casting to cut manufacturing steps; simplified fuel, lubrication and ignition systems also cut costs.
 But rushing the new V-8 to market proved a mistake, with engine failures attributed to fragile pistons, inadequate cooling and marginal lubrication. Once the bugs were ironed out, though, customers raved about the Deuce's speed. 
 Letters of appreciation came from the dark side. Clyde Barrow wrote, ''For sustained speed and freedom from trouble, the Ford has got every other car skinned.'' A letter to Ford bearing John Dillinger's signature, of doubtful authenticity, bragged, ''I can make any other car take a Ford's dust.''
 Hot-rodders soon discovered that 65 horsepower and a 75-mile-an-hour top speed were merely the start for the V-8. On dry lake beds, racers in California clocked nearly 130 m.p.h. before World War II. The flathead V-8 was also the engine of choice on dragstrips and oval tracks.
 Mr. Stringer joined the movement in 1955 as a teenager in Steubenville, Ohio. ''I started buying any car magazine containing '32 Ford photos or articles,'' he said. ''While attending Purdue University, I drove a hot rod consisting of a Ford Model A body on a '32 frame with Chevy V-8 power. I finally got my first Deuce, a 5-window coupe, in 1959.''
 Mr. Stringer joined the Ford Motor Company in 1963 and spent most of his 35 years there as a truck engineer. By 1968, his tastes had shifted from hot rods to factory-original Deuces; he has owned and restored a dozen or so over the years. 
 ''The '32 has always appealed to me because of its lines and smooth look,'' he said. 
 In 1978, Mr. Stringer purchased the roadster I drove for $7,000. After an eight-year rebuild using still-available new parts and period-correct medium maroon paint, this car has won top honors at several prestigious shows, including ones organized by the Early Ford V-8 Club of America. With less than 50,000 miles and only 500 miles since restoration, it's the closest thing there is to a brand-new '32 Ford. Mr. Stringer estimates the value of his Deuce at $125,000.
 In contrast to most old cars, no putt-putt or wheezing emanates from under a Deuce V-8's hood. The engine starts quickly and chuckles contentedly after the press of a floor button. The tall shift lever pokes straight out of the floor with no boot to shroud its workings. Shifting is easy as long as you heed the wide horizontal gate of the H-pattern and don't hurry gear changes.
 Of course, the driving dynamics are antiquated. The steering is either heavy (during parking) or in need of constant correction (to take up slack in the system while cruising). The brakes groan at low speeds and lack the stopping power for freeway driving. Bumps provoke a cacophony of squeaks and rattles despite the extensive rubber insulation added to the 1932 model. The rudimentary suspension reacts to big jolts with a few cycles of hobby-horse motion.
 When motivated by a quick jab of throttle, the Deuce drives smartly away from the past. The V-8's surge forward is modest by today's standards, but on the 1930's thrill scale it probably rivaled rising hemlines, airplane rides and the end of Prohibition. The first-gear kick carries you to 25 miles an hour, and second is worth 40. At 75 years of age, the Deuce is still a driver's delight. Several hundred '32 Fords are expected to converge on Dearborn, Mich., on Aug. 9-12 to celebrate the Deuce's 75th anniversary. Information is available at deuce75.com. 
 CLASSY CHASSIS: Lynn Stringer's '32 Ford V-8 De Luxe Roadster has, clockwise from above, a panel of engine-turned metal around the gauges; a flathead V-8 of elegant simplicity; and stately rear-end styling with an outside-mount spare tire.

HEADLINE: A Lesson in European Economy

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
TESTED 2007 Chrysler 300C CRD 
 WHAT IS IT? Full-size rear-drive four-door sedan.
 HOW MUCH? Not for sale in the United States. Estimated base price, $28,500.
 WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A Mercedes-Benz 3-liter turbodiesel V-6 (215 horsepower, 376 pound feet of torque); five-speed automatic transmission.
IS IT THIRSTY? Hardly, for a car this big. By European test standards, combined mileage is 36 percent better than its V-6 gasoline counterpart. 
 ALTERNATIVES Mercedes-Benz E320 Bluetec, $52,325. THE day after a diesel-powered Audi racecar won the 24 Hours of Le Mans last month -- for the second year running -- was the perfect occasion for my drive in a European-specification diesel family sedan. Sure, the Chrysler 300C CRD I drove around northern New Jersey was not nearly as fast as the winning Audi R10, and I certainly didn't cover as many miles, but in the long run that brooding sedan may be prove as influential as Audi's all-conquering racecar.
 The wonderfulness of Europe's diesels -- half of all new cars sold there are diesel-powered -- is an old story by now. Vacationers returning from the Continent may whine that the locals are rude and American dollars nearly worthless, but they'll be just as likely to sing the praises of their rental car. 
 Many, blissfully ignorant of the E.P.A.'s byzantine regulations, ask, Why can't we get these? I doubt that French tourists go home from a week at Disney World with the same degree of longing for the Sebring they got from Hertz. 
 Hearing the 300C CRD start when I picked it up at the parking garage after work, I wouldn't have immediately known it was a diesel by the sound alone, though the enormous lettering on its flanks made the point. The 300C CRD has less invested in noise containment than an E-Class Benz diesel, it would seem, but it is still quite tolerable.
 There was none of the sooty discharge from the tailpipe one might see from a vintage Oldsmobile diesel, should one of those still be running somewhere. A subdued clatter became notable only at stoplights, and then just enough to make me glance at the mirror expecting to find a heavy-duty pickup on my bumper. 
 Driving the Chrysler, a demonstration vehicle making the rounds courtesy of Bosch, the supplier of its fuel injection system, required some recalibration of my expectations. A foot-to-the-floor merge onto the Interstate brought the speedometer to 120 before I knew it, but that was in kilometers an hour, just about the prevailing pace of traffic. The smooth-shifting five-speed automatic transmission clicked off full-throttle gear changes at 3,700 r.p.m., appropriate for a diesel but unexpectedly early by gas-engine standards, where shifts come at 5,000 or so.
 The 300C CRD (for common-rail diesel) has a 215-horsepower Mercedes-Benz V-6 under the hood, essentially the engine from the E320, rather than the gasoline V-6 or V-8 engines Chrysler offers in the United States. DaimlerChrysler has already done a similar transplant with the Jeep Grand Cherokee CRD; in that case, the diesel costs about $3,000 more than the gasoline V-6 model.
 The appeal of a diesel is economy, and the 300C CRD has plenty to offer: in the European mileage ratings, it returns 26 m.p.g in town and 43 on the highway, compared with 18/34 for its twin powered by a 3.5-liter gas V-6. (The American version is rated 19/27 on the E.P.A.'s test.) 
 That's not bad, considering the diesel produces nearly as much torque as the 5.7-liter Hemi V-8. At the time I drove it, diesel fuel was selling for $2.99 a gallon in New Jersey, about a nickel less than midgrade gas and 30 cents cheaper than premium. 
 There may be some measure of romantic charm to living with a small and relatively low-powered car for a week or two while on vacation, but it's quite another matter to use one in a home-field context. I have driven other Euro models that were touring the States, most memorably a Smart ForTwo, and they were all a treat, but the novelty might have worn thin in short order. Using the large and familiar Chrysler 300 in my own neighborhood offered a better basis for comparison. 
 This much is certain: The sedan I drove was not quite ready for American drivers, at least not without a little retuning. The 4,200-pound car was lazy away from stoplights, finally coming to life at about 2,000 r.p.m. and muscling its way to 60 m.p.h in 7.6 seconds, according to DaimlerChrysler. At a highway cruise, though, the response was perfectly acceptable, and while I could not pass all the cars in the left lane, I took comfort in rolling by a lot of filling stations. NORMAN MAYERSOHN

HEADLINE: When, Exactly, Is a Barn a Suburban Eyesore?

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER. 
E-mail: lijournal@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Bridgehampton 

 BODY:
BILLY BABINSKI is the first to say he could be making more money and working fewer hours doing something other than farming.
But since he was a boy, Mr. Babinski, 28, has had a passion for tilling the soil that his father, grandfather and several other generations of his family worked. At age 5, he and his older sister, Lisa, started selling home-grown produce at a small stand by the family's Wainscott home. 
 After graduating from the University of Delaware in 2001 with a degree in agricultural economics, Mr. Babinski couldn't think of anything he would rather do than return to the family farm. A row cropper, he grows corn, tomatoes, pumpkins and sunflowers on close to 70 acres in three locations, some owned, some rented. 
 ''There is something to be said about enjoying what you do,'' Mr. Babinski said. ''There's a lot of satisfaction to see you have raised something that other people come to get.'' 
 But the hurdles for a young farmer can be formidable. Mr. Babinski supplements his income by mowing lawns. There is the weather to contend with and deer that must be fenced out. Then there are the neighbors who sued him because of a barn he wanted to build. 
 Houses ring a 3.23-acre plot of farmland that Mr. Babinski received from his father, William Babinski, shortly after graduating from college. The land, then valued at about $12,000 an acre, was reserved for agricultural use when his father subdivided half of 6.5 acres into four residential lots. 
 Corn is growing on more than two-thirds of that 3.23-acre plot, which is hidden from Lumber Lane down a gravel and dirt driveway. At the center is a new brown and coffee-colored 3,420-square-foot metal barn crowned with two cupolas topped with weathervanes. 
 Billy Babinski finished putting up the $170,000 barn in December, betting he would prevail in a lawsuit seven of his neighbors filed against him and Southampton Town, trying to prevent the barn, for storing farm equipment, from being built. 
 ''It is just the nature of the beast,'' Mr. Babinski said, gazing from the barn across the landscape to the neighboring houses. ''It is going to be close to somebody.''
 In a decision earlier this month, a State Supreme Court justice upheld Mr. Babinski's right to have the barn. Justice Jeffrey Arlen Spinner wrote that the court was ''somewhat mystified'' by the neighbors' complaint. 
 ''It seems totally inconsistent to own property adjacent to or nearby an Agricultural Reserve, and consider construction of a modern barn, or the appearance of farm machinery along the driveway of such Agricultural Reserve, as not contemplated,'' Justice Spinner said in his decision. 
 David E. Eagan, Mr. Babinski's lawyer, said that ''land use out here is blood sport.'' 
 Homeowners are under the impression that land reserved for agricultural use ''will be lying fallow,'' Mr. Eagan said. It can be used for agricultural activities, ''and therein lies the rub,'' he said.
 According to the state Agriculture and Markets Law, Mr. Eagan said, a farm operation may consist of parcels of owned or rented land that may be contiguous or noncontiguous.
 Kathryn Dalli, a lawyer for the neighbors, said that a decision about appealing had not been made. 
 ''The farmers are making out like bandits,'' Ms. Dalli said, referring to money made selling land for development and getting permission to subdivide in exchange for keeping a percentage of the land for agricultural use. ''No one wanted to prevent him from farming this piece, but the idea of having a storage facility with heavy machinery on this piece of property was not something that was contemplated or necessary.''
 Inside the barn, Mr. Babinski keeps a trailer, a pumpkin stand, bales of hay, a plow, a harrow, grain drills and a large mower. Farming on fragmented segments of land makes it necessary to keep the equipment centrally located, he said. As a concession to the neighbors, he agreed not to leave any farm equipment outside. 
 Joseph Gergela, executive director of the Long Island Farm Bureau, said the squabble represented a clash between suburban and farm values. ''If people really want to have agriculture,'' he said, ''they have to be able to tolerate that we need a building, we may need a greenhouse, we may need a barn, we may need a farm stand.''
 Mr. Babinski said he put his barn on that lot because he owned it. Had he erected the barn on his father's Wainscott acreage, he said, ''there was no guarantee that I would even be able to afford to keep it'' if his father died. 
 Still, Mr. Babinski acknowledged that having land in his family gave him ''a head start.'' His grandmother gave him eight acres. His father is in the process of transferring to him 20 acres of agricultural reserve land, recently appraised at $71,000 an acre. (Last year, the Town of East Hampton paid $7 million to the elder Mr. Babinski for the development rights. He retained the building rights to an additional four acres.) 
 ''To work and make that money with your hands is almost impossible,'' Billy Babinski said. ''You are not going to go out and buy that and grow tomatoes. You are not going to live long enough to pay it back.''

HEADLINE: An Apology From Albany

BYLINE: By ELIOT SPITZER. 
Eliot Spitzer is the governor of New York.

 BODY:
Albany
 WE made mistakes.
 Though two independent investigations proved that no illegal activity occurred on my watch, it is crystal clear that what members of my administration did was wrong -- no ifs, ands or buts. 
 I have apologized to Joe Bruno, the Senate majority leader, and now I want to apologize to all New Yorkers.
 What you've been reading about in the papers and watching on television this week is not what we are about. In fact, it represents just the opposite.
 On my first day in office, I brought my staff together and told them what our guiding principles must be: ''First, we're going to fight for what we believe in. And second, we're going to maintain the highest ethical standards while doing it.''
 Over the past few weeks, two members of my administration forgot that second principle -- creating an appearance that the State Police were being used inappropriately. 
 As soon as this became clear, we acted immediately and decisively, suspending one of my longtime advisers indefinitely and transferring the other out of the governor's office. These steps were not taken lightly. Both of these people have served New York with distinction for decades.
 But the message was simple: even though they didn't break the law, they forgot what we were about, and that won't be tolerated. 
 The worst thing that could happen now would be for this to stop our progress, preventing us from building on our many successes of the past six months: health insurance for every child; historic investment in our schools tied to accountability; the largest property tax cut in history; ethics, lobbying and campaign finance reform; breaking the impasse at ground zero; and a 20 percent cut in workers' compensation rates that will save New York businesses $1 billion and make our state more competitive.
 Albany had long been mired in gridlock, but we are changing that. Working together with the Senate and Assembly, we have managed to make remarkable progress -- and we are on the brink of so much more.
 There are two ways this can go.
 We can get bogged down in partisan politics that serve only to distract us from the business at hand -- the kind of head-hunting that we're beginning to see for people in my administration who were cleared by these investigations.
 Or we can move forward and pick up where we left off, addressing the long list of issues and challenges that matter to all New Yorkers -- which are just as important today as they were last week.
 So let us keep our eye on the ball and focus our energy and our resources on the needs of New Yorkers -- fighting for a revitalized economy, more jobs, lower health care costs, better schools and lower taxes.
 We will renew those two guiding principles I spoke about on my first day in office. 
 We will continue to fight vigorously to change the status quo on behalf of all New Yorkers. I'm never going to apologize for that. But we must recognize that this effort will succeed only if our means for changing the status quo are as honorable as our ends.

HEADLINE: The Hedge Fund Class and the French Revolution

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LET'S start with the obvious. Hedge funds have created a terribly wealthy new class. Although the data is overwhelming that the mass of hedge funds have not been outperforming the market after fees, money still pours into them. This has often made their proprietors terribly rich. 
 Somehow, by some alchemy of brilliant tax lawyers, these people are paying long-term capital gains rates of 15 percent on their compensation (even though much of their pay is tied to trades with holding periods that last seconds). Doctors and lawyers and writers and actors pay about two times that amount. 
 Then there are the private equity people. They buy and sell companies, usually with other people's money. They put up a tiny slice of their own capital and multiply it with investments from pension funds, very wealthy families and foreign government investment authorities, and they buy companies. They shake the companies up, cut spending, cut reserves and then resell them to us patsies in the public markets for huge profits. ''Rip, strip and flip,'' as they say. I am not saying all of them do, but some do.
 The private equity people get an immense interest in the profits, vastly outstripping whatever capital they had on the line. This ''carried interest,'' as they call it, is then taxed at low capital-gains rates. If the private equity companies play their cards right, they use yet another loophole involving amortization of good will to eliminate any tax at all if and when they go public.
 Now, all of the above appears to be legal, in that it conforms to laws made by Congress and regulations adopted by the Internal Revenue Service.
 So what? The fact that the law is such and such as of July 2007 does not mean that it has to be that way in July 2008 or even in September 2007. The laws of taxation, like all laws, are political. They are not based on commandments from the Lord God Jehovah carried down on tablets from the mountaintop. They are not ordained by Solomon. They are political, hewn from the give-and-take of lobbyists, expert witnesses, law professors, economists and donors.
 The law can be changed. Laws are changed all of the time in the tax arena. The oil companies used to get immense tax allowances that they don't get any more because of political pressures. The tax rate on the last dollars of high-income people used to be above 90 percent. It's not like that any longer. Why? Political change. It applies to the tax code as well as to all other laws.
 Now, let's think about what's going on in America right now. We are in a war. We are apparently not winning the war. The military is desperately shy of funds, to the point where our fighting men and women are being shortchanged in training and equipment. 
 We also need more money for our soldiers' pay, so their families do not have to live like church mice while their spouses are deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan. In these circumstances, is it fitting and morally right for the richest of the rich to be paying either very low taxes or no tax at all?
 Is it right or even admissible in the human conscience that while teachers, emergency room technicians, police and firefighters are taxed at full earned-income rates -- and often underpaid -- that the highest-earning people in this country should pay at either very low tax rates or none at all?
 Or, put it like this: do we dare send our men and women to fight for an America in which the very rich are so favored by the government that it amounts almost to an aristocracy?
 Long ago, I had a European history teacher named Mrs. Enright. She explained to me that one of the causes of the French Revolution was the sad truth that the aristocracy was not taxed at all, while the workers and burghers were taxed highly. Is this our future?
 Maybe the law does allow for favorable tax treatment for hedge funds if you have good enough lawyers. Maybe the law does allow for private-equity managers to receive capital-gains treatment for what is clearly money management, not risking their own capital.
 But the mark of a great society is that its laws approximate morality and fairness. Is this really what we have in the tax code now? If so, fine. If not, why are we not changing it?
 (Is it because of the pitifully cheap contributions of the finance industry to the two parties? If so, the politicians are much more pitiful than I had thought. Contributions in the thousands and hundreds of thousands for tax breaks in the billions? This isn't sensible even on an old Tammany Hall basis. Contribute a penny to get a hundred dollars? What's up with that?)
 AND please, let's not haul out that old chestnut about having tax incentives to encourage entrepreneurship. We already have enough people who want to be rich (which is another phrase for ''entrepreneurship''). What we are lacking is oil and gas. Maybe we should give the oil exploration people lower taxes. What we are lacking is people willing to fight the war on terror.
 Why don't we just have a tax holiday for people who are fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan for five years after they get back? This would be the tax code addressing real shortages, not an imaginary shortage of money mania (oops, I mean ''entrepreneurship'').
 Let's keep it real: Congress can take notice of a mammoth inequity in taxation during wartime and make the tax on private equity and hedge funds approximate the treatment of other highly paid people -- or it can continue down the road to the Bastille.

HEADLINE: Boxed Set

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
A few years ago, an experimental music duo called FM3 toured Europe, playing a 40-minute set that the duo's founder Christiaan Virant describes as ''very reductionist, very minimalist, very sparse.'' He and Zhang Jian, who are based in Beijing, performed on laptops. Some of these compositions were later released on a CD by Staalplaat, a specialty label based in Amsterdam; it sold about a thousand copies. In the context of avant-garde music, that's not bad: ''If someone can sell 2,000 CDs,'' Virant says with a laugh, ''they're like a superstar.'' So it's hard to find the right superlative to describe what happened when some of that same sparse music was released again -- not on CD but in a little plastic box called the Buddha Machine. Two years later, sales are approaching 50,000 units and still going strong. 
The crass use of the word ''unit'' to describe a buyable collection of music makes a certain sense in this case. The $25 Buddha Machine is the size of a cigarette pack, with one button, an on-off dial and a rather tinny speaker. Inside is a chip containing nine digitally encoded music loops. The button allows the listener to switch from one to another, but that's the extent of user control over the experience, leading some observers to refer to the thing as the anti-iPod. 
 A native of Omaha, Neb., Virant moved to China in the 1980s to study music and Chinese culture. He had been playing in punk bands but was already interested in the loops and rhythmic cycles explored by composers like Steve Reich and Philip Glass, and he describes his first electronic compositions as ''highly repetitive''; friends suggested that they sounded like video-game music. FM3 was founded in 1999, starting out as ''the ambient, chill-out band that played in the back room'' of Beijing clubs and evolving into a ''meditative'' sound. Virant had long been interested in the chanting he heard in some Buddhist temples, which he discovered was coming from a plastic box. He and Zhang pondered putting some of their own music into something similar; Staalplaat agreed to release a batch, and they made their first factory order for 500 Buddha Machines, guessing that it would also be their last.
 Word of the Buddha Machine traveled quickly among adventurous music consumers, says Eric Benoit, the publicist for Forced Exposure, a distributor specializing in a wide range of nonmainstream music, which peddles the device through its own site and sells it wholesale to progressive music retailers. Early coverage on Web sites like Disquiet.com, which focuses on ambient music and electronica, and other music sites, as well as a mention in this newspaper, made the 2005 holiday season seem like the peak -- but sales continue thanks to steady attention online and from the press. The public radio show Studio 360 featured the device in 2006; FM3 toured Europe again with a performance built around the Buddha Machines; and bloggers keep finding it anew, attracting music fans, design fans, gadget fans and those who view it as something like a fashion item. Benoit says a recent rerun of that Studio 360 episode sparked about as many sales as the original broadcast. At nearly 50,000 sold, Virant says, ''it still inhabits the world of the cult -- it's this kind of secret thing, and everyone who gets one, it feels like a discovery.''
 And of course there's the anti-iPod factor: the relief of not having to make a choice in a world awash with entertainment and self-expression options. Moreover, at a moment when the unused abilities of feature-loaded computers, cellphones and even microwave ovens pile up faster than we can keep track of them, it's satisfying to know that once you've turned the Buddha Machine on, you are using it to its full capacity. ''We didn't really put that much thought into it,'' Virant confesses, but he figures that the device indirectly addresses issues that haven't gone away. ''What is music in this modern age, and what is technology, and what do we want it to do?''
 Although the American audience for meditative, low-action, experimental music performances is small, its appreciation for little plastic objects is robust. Virant says the majority of Buddha Machine sales so far have been in the U.S. In fact, FM3 is now planning its first ever U.S. tour for next year. Virant envisions an opening set built around the Buddha Machine, followed by the loud and guitar-driven set the duo is playing these days. ''It's the same music, essentially,'' he says. ''It's just that one is turned up to 11. And the other is turned down to minus-1.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From The Loan Scandal

BYLINE: By Laura Pappano. 
Laura Pappano is a writer-in-residence at the Wellesley Centers for Women at Wellesley College.

 BODY:
ERIC SMOLITSKY, a senior at the University of Connecticut, is a sharp guy who is spending the summer doing stem cell research. But when it comes to student loans -- he will graduate $30,000 in debt and plans to borrow $200,000 more for medical school -- Mr. Smolitsky finds it annoyingly complicated. ''I haven't spent much time looking into it,'' he acknowledges. ''They say, 'Here is your financial aid package.' ''
Students in general have not thought much about how it all comes together (as long as the dollars are covered somehow). After all, they had a trusted adviser in the financial aid office. 
 Such assumptions have been shaken by recent disclosures about financial aid officers receiving junkets, consulting fees and kickbacks courtesy of the loan industry, owning stock in loan companies and steering business through ''preferred lender'' lists. A report from Senator Edward M. Kennedy, released last month, details how a lender's place on the list at the University of Texas, Austin, had more to do with what ''treats'' were offered the financial aid director than what rates were offered students. 
 ''Students and families had assumed that the advice they were getting on financial aid and loans from college officials was based on that person's experience and knowledge and on what would work best for that student,'' says Robert M. Shireman, president of the Institute for College Access and Success, in Berkeley, Calif. Mr. Shireman points out what is now obvious but was once unthinkable: colleges and financial aid officers can have ''competing interests.'' 
 Legislation is pending in Congress, and the Department of Education has proposed rules governing the relationship between lender and college. 
 Now new concerns have surfaced about whether lenders use fair criteria to assess applicants for private, or ''alternative,'' loans. According to the College Board, such loans accounted for 20 percent of educational borrowing for the 2005-6 school year, up from 4 percent a decade earlier.
 Ultimately, all this attention should benefit borrowers. But for now, students (and parents) scrambling to get loans for next year's tuition bills must navigate this intimidating and labyrinthine industry. 
 ''My wife and I are both college-educated, and we sit there and say, 'How are kids supposed to do this?' '' says David Robinson, who lives in Lexington, Mass. A project manager at I.B.M., he is helping his son apply for student loans, find part-time work and otherwise cover the $41,500 it will cost him to attend Merrimack College in September.
 Despite money from a 529 college savings plan and scholarships for both academics and athletics (lacrosse), David Jr. will need $20,000 a year in loans. Mr. Robinson co-signed a private loan application at Sallie Mae but was stunned at the interest rate -- 10.25 percent plus a 3 percent fee at repayment. ''I think that's too expensive,'' says Mr. Robinson. ''I find this an extremely daunting, nerve-racking process. You don't know now what you are getting into.'' 
 If the student loan scandal has made some wary, it has also provided a prod to get smart before borrowing.
 SAM IS YOUR BEST RICH UNCLE. 
 ''You should never get a private student loan unless you have exhausted your government student loans,'' says Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of FinAid
 .org. Post-scandal, that fact is displayed prominently on lender home pages.
 Private loans, which carry variable rates, can come with double-digit interest (and no cap). Interest on federal loans, on the other hand, is set by Congress 5 percent for a Perkins (for the neediest students), a cap of 6.8 percent for a Stafford (for any income level) and 8.5 percent for a PLUS (for parents and graduate students).
 ''Why would anyone ever get a private loan?'' wonders Mr. Kantrowitz, author of ''FastWeb College Gold: The Step-by-Step Guide to Paying for College.'' 
 The answer is that Perkins and Stafford loans have limits on how much can be borrowed, and despite plans in Congress to raise those limits, loan amounts can fall well short of college costs. As for undergraduate PLUS loans, parents might not qualify (unlike Stafford and Perkins loans, a PLUS requires a credit check, so a loan default, a credit card delinquency or a bankruptcy can sink an application). Or parents might not warm to decades paying off their child's debt. 
 Mr. Robinson thought it would be good for his son to get a private loan as a way of investing in his own future. Also, he says, with three other children to raise and educate, ''I didn't want to totally be on the hook for it.''
 For Rates, EXPECT THE WORST.
 Shopping for a mortgage? Flip to the newspaper's business section for a chart comparing rates. But in the student loan industry, which has grown fast and unchecked, rates for private loans are all over the map. Lenders have developed their own criteria for assessing borrowers with unknown future income, no collateral (like that house to foreclose on) and brief (if any) credit histories. 
 In short, the greater the likelihood of default, the higher the interest rate. 
 Credit score is the biggest factor in determining the rate, but every lender judges differently the risk that you won't pay back what you borrow. 
 Lenders advertise catchy interest rates, Mr. Kantrowitz says, but note with an asterisk that they are available only to customers with the best credit history. His research shows fewer than 10 percent of student borrowers qualify for the best rates, and more than 75 percent get the worst. ''A good rule of thumb is to look at the worst rate and assume you will get a rate pretty close to that,'' he says.
 Lenders won't reveal the cutoff scores that qualify for one rate or another. But in general, a borrower in the 500s (on a scale of 300 to 850) ''could expect to get a fairly cool reception from any lender,'' whereas someone in the 700s is appealing, says Craig Watts, spokesman for the Fair Isaac Corporation, whose FICO formula is widely used to calculate scores. 
 Mr. Watts says multiple lenders inquiring into a credit history can lower a score slightly, because it implies a propensity to seek credit. Borrowers with average to good scores aren't likely to be affected by comparison shopping. But students with short credit histories may see their scores dip temporarily. 
 For students who lack a credit history, the lender MyRichUncle boasts on its Web site that it considers ''their merits as a student, including G.P.A., school and program of study.'' Raza Khan, the company president, says weighted formulas are used to assess borrowers.
 Sallie Mae, the nation's largest student lender, doesn't take academic markers into account. ''We don't believe an A student should get dramatically better treatment than an A-minus or B student or C student,'' says Tom Joyce, its spokesman. He says Sallie Mae ''has standard pricing that is available at all schools,'' though it will improve rates in ''a competitive situation where a lender has come in and dropped prices.''
 Al M. Davis, Nelnet's managing director for private loans, says its underwriters consider a graduate student's field of study but not an undergraduate's except pre-med. They also ''look at the school's accreditation, at their historical performance related to job placement and their default history.'' 
 NOT ALL COLLEGES ARE EQUAL
 IN LENDERS' EYES.
 Six students, including David Robinson Jr., agreed to shop online for their private loans last month and share the results for this article. Rates ranged widely: one student earning a master's degree in public administration at New York University applied to four lenders and was offered rates varying by six percentage points. Some students came back empty-handed. 
 Cindy Grayson is halfway through an online master's program in criminal justice at Florida Metropolitan University, a profit-making accredited career college. She applied for $8,000 to supplement her government loans but was rejected by Bank of America and Sallie Mae. The Sallie Mae rejection, says Ms. Grayson, ''happened instantaneously.'' 
 Ms. Grayson, 50, lives in a mobile home in a town of 3,200 in Arizona and has a foreclosure and bankruptcy in her past. She may not be an appealing private loan candidate but she is, in many ways, a typical one. She sees her online courses and her loans as a ticket to a better-paying job. 
 ''I thought student loans were to help you,'' says Ms. Grayson, a substitute teacher who just landed a second job as a clerk in a sheriff's office. ''If you don't need it, you can have it. If you do need it, you can't have it.''
 Students are told they are free to borrow from any lender. In practice, lenders provide private money only for colleges with which they have a ''relationship,'' as customer service representatives put it. As a result, Ms. Grayson was not able to apply to three other lenders as a student at F.M.U., whose federal student loan default rate is 10 percent.
 Another comparison shopper, Katherine McBrayer, who just graduated from Monroe High School in North Carolina, was denied by Charter One Bank and Wachovia. Education Finance Partners, Citibank and Nelnet would not accept an application for a private loan to attend the Utah College of Massage Therapy, a one-year accredited program with seven campuses (default rate: about 7 percent).
 ''I was irritated,'' says Teresa McBrayer, Katherine's mother. She says her daughter has a grade point average of 3.92 and excelled in calculus and chemistry but dreams of owning her own massage center. 
 ''She didn't choose the triple-A four-star college,'' says Ms. McBrayer, who had wanted her daughter to be responsible for her own debt. She has since taken out a government PLUS loan. 
 Mr. Davis of Nelnet offers two possibilities when asked to explain why his company refused to lend money for the Utah massage college: ''We don't have a current relationship with that school or we have elected not to lend to that particular school.''
 Justin S. Draeger, spokesman for the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators, says his organization is troubled by such exclusions. 
 ''We are very concerned about students who are treated differently based on the school they attend,'' he says. ''There are definitely some questions that need to be raised about the underwriting of these loans.''
 As part of his continuing investigation, Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo of New York sent a letter to Congress last month complaining that ''a significant number of lenders'' weigh private loan applications and set rates depending on the college in question rather than the creditworthiness of the borrowers -- an approach he compared with redlining in the mortgage industry. 
 YOU WILL BE CONFUSED.
 Trying to figure out rates for a private loan is like the admissions process itself: you won't know until you sit down and apply. Even then, the information comes in dizzyingly different forms.
 Lenders talk in terms of margin, the number of percentage points above or below a selected index, which for student loans could be the prime rate, the 91-day Treasury bill or the London interbank offered rate. Some lenders do the calculations; others let you do the math. 
 The comparison shopper attending New York University applied for $8,000 from MyRichUncle. The lender offered $5,900 (through a partner, Doral Bank). The preapproval told her only that she would get prime plus 5 percentage points. She had to look up prime. The resulting rate, 13.25 percent, would be recalculated every quarter during the in-school deferral period and rounded up to the nearest .125 percent. There would also be an origination fee that would be ''disclosed in the initial Disclosure Statement for the first Advance.'' (In fact, the fee was hidden on the promissory note. The loan amount was given as $6,413 -- $5,900 plus a fee of $513.) 
 Confused yet?
 True borrowing costs depend on the fine print: discounts, penalties, fees (which can counteract the benefit of a lower interest rate) and how often the loan is capitalized (when deferred interest is added to the principal -- so in effect you pay interest on interest.) 
 Deanne Loonin, director of the Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project of the National Consumer Law Center, says private lenders are required to inform borrowers of interest rate, total number of payments and total cost of repayment key information for comparing deals. But, she says, there is no rule about how soon in the process lenders must divulge that information. (Proposed Senate legislation aims to compel lenders to disclose loan costs earlier.) 
 ''The truth is, there is little substantive regulations of the loans themselves,'' she says. ''There is really no sugar-coating the problem that if someone really wants to shop around now, it's not easy.''
 the PREFERRED lIST is (STILL) 
 where to start.
 Comparison shopping usually begins and ends on a college's preferred lender list. But what gets lenders top billing is still a mystery at many colleges: have they bought their way onto the list or do they represent a college's assessment of which loans serve its students best?
 Even with the credibility of financial aid offices damaged, experts say, don't ignore the list. But do ask questions. New rules are expected to call for at least three lenders to be listed, and for some explanation of how they were selected. 
 A competition last year at the University of California shows the complexity of finding the best deal and how much influence a university can wield. 
 According to Nancy Coolidge, coordinator of student financial support for the system's 10 campuses, administrators determined that students at some campuses were getting less desirable terms. At Santa Cruz, for example, students with the worst credit were paying up to 19.32 percent to Education Finance Partners and 14.25 percent to Sallie Mae with fees of up to 8 percent. The university decided to use the system's volume some 2,000 undergraduates borrowed $20 million in private loans last school year to improve rates.
 Six bidders vied for the coveted top spot on the lender list. Financial officers were seeking, among other criteria, lenders who would eliminate fees, would not demand default insurance and would capitalize loans just once. Administrators sorted through hundreds of pages of data. Citibank got the nod. 
 Borrowers are now classed in four groups: credit worthy (scores of 671 or higher), credit ready (670 to 610), low credit (609 to 570) and poor credit (569 or less), and their rates range from 7.75 to 14.25 percent. Students in the two middle categories get 9.25 and 11.25 percent, respectively, if they have co-signers. 
 CONSOLIDATION IS NO longer 
 a NO-BRAINER.
 It used to be that you got federal loans at variable interest rates; once you graduated, you consolidated them into one neat, low-interest, fixed-rate loan. 
 The value of consolidation has waned since federal rates became fixed last year. But the pressure to consolidate has heated up, with lenders urging students, ''Lower your monthly payments,'' which simply means stretching out the loan for more years and increasing the total interest. 
 It makes sense to consolidate private loans if you can improve terms or better manage payments, Mr. Kantrowitz says. But consolidating is not automatically a better deal, and you may loserebates or pay penalties. Never consolidate federal and private loans together, because that wipes out some benefits of a government loan (such as loan forgiveness for certain types of public service). 
 The Department of Education ombudsman for student aid, Debra Wiley, says her office is fielding more complaints this year -- about 300, compared with 125 last year and 50 the year before from students who say they were tricked or who were uncertain about consolidation forms they had signed. ''I know people are confused,'' she says. ''They think they are signing something to get more information when they are signing a consolidation application.''
 Steven E. Brooks, the executive director of North Carolina's State Education Assistance Authority, a state agency that makes, services and guarantees government loans, says he has received 150 forms at once instructing the agency to transfer student loans to a commercial lender -- and then heard from upset students who hadn't intended to consolidate. 
 In April, the University of Idaho allowed On Campus Student Loans of Helena, Mont., to hold a consolidation workshop at the same time and in the same campus building where university officials were offering exit loan-counseling for seniors. 
 Elaine Ruscilli, a senior in psychology, dropped into the workshop to figure out how to structure repayment of her $40,000 in federal loans (and eat some free pizza). Mistaking the seals on documents and signs for Department of Education insignia, she signed forms, she says. Later she ''got that sinking feeling'' and demanded the company not consolidate her loans. It didn't. But other lenders are still trying. She got a check in the mail for $473.43 from Academic Loan Group hers if she consolidated. ''If you were desperate for money, you might be tempted to cash that,'' she says.
 Dan Davenport, director of admissions and financial aid at the University of Idaho, which lends government money directly to students, says students face a 1.5 percent charge for consolidating federally guaranteed loans with private lenders. 
 ''Students are confused about what to do,'' says Mr. Davenport, who is pessimistic about proposed legislation. ''I am totally convinced that all of this will continue -- the false advertising, the illegal incentives, the misinformation -- until we redesign the loan programs. It's such big money and such easy money that everybody wants to get it.''
 PICK A COLLEGE (AND MAJOR) YOU CAN AFFORD.
 Everyone knows college is expensive. But with so much energy focused on getting in, discussion about whether it's worth the cost is pushed to the background.
 Lewis Mandell, professor of finance and managerial economics at the University at Buffalo (of the State University of New York), says students who need loans should ask themselves if running into debt at a private college makes sense. ''If I could get the same education at a state institution, I need to ask, 'What is the differential? What am I paying for?' '' he says. ''It is one thing if Mom and Dad will send you to college; that's fine. But if you have to pay back $100,000 to $200,000, you should say to yourself, 'Is this degree really going to prepare me for the types of jobs that will be there for much of my career?' '' 
 Robert D. Manning, director of the Center for Consumer Financial Services at the Rochester Institute of Technology, has students compare their expected earnings with expected payments on student loans and credit card debt -- he worries when more than 50 percent of starting salary is needed to repay debts. Mr. Manning says students often have an unrealistic expectation of starting income. ''We've actually had students decide they can't do their major,'' he says. 
 Dawn Wooters followed her passion at the University of Tennessee, graduating in 1998 with a fine arts degree. ''I was thinking, 'This is what I would really love to do and the money wouldn't matter.' It's hard to admit that now,'' says Ms. Wooters, who couldn't live on painting watercolors. At 34, she is getting a second undergraduate degree, in nursing, at Kennesaw State University in Atlanta. 
 Ms. Wooters graduated the first time without debt. She now works full time at a Hampton Inn and has already borrowed $13,000 in Stafford and $3,500 in private loans (which she got with her boyfriend co-signing, after she applied alone and was turned down). ''You never want to tell someone, 'Don't do what you love,' '' she says. ''But you need to have a realistic concept and a backup plan.'' At Debt's Door

HEADLINE: Not Just a Cabaret, Old Friend

BYLINE: By Eric D. Weitz. 
Eric D. Weitz, a professor of history at the University of Minnesota, is the author of the forthcoming ''Weimar Germany: Promise and Tragedy.''

DATELINE: Minneapolis 

 BODY:
NEW YORK CITY is aglow with Weimar. Last fall the Met featured the works of Otto Dix and George Grosz in an exhibition titled ''Glitter and Doom: German Portraits From the 1920s.'' Downtown cabarets are buzzing with Weimar knockoffs updated for a post-9/11 city. The Neue Galerie locates itself in fin de siecle Vienna with pride of place given to Gustav Klimt, but its collections, its bookstore and even its pastries quickly bleed into 1920s Berlin. Not since the 1930s and '40s, when refugees from Nazi Germany crowded Washington Heights and lectured at the New School, have there been so many associations with that creative, turbulent period between the end of World War I and the Nazi seizure of power. What is going on here? 
The Weimar on display is the world created in retrospect by the refugees. Only a handful of them -- luminaries like Albert Einstein and Thomas Mann or fans of America like Kurt Weill -- landed well in the United States. For the vast majority, exile was a difficult, wrenching process of adjustment to a new language and new mores. From afar they witnessed the creation of a brutal yet popular dictatorship and then the extension of its murderous policies throughout Europe. Trying to make sense of Germany's descent into barbarism, they looked back on Weimar as an era of excess and corruption, the prelude to the Nazis.
 That is the Weimar that today's New Yorkers revel in, John Kander and Fred Ebb's ''Cabaret'' updated for the 21st century -- scantily clad women and men in various combinations onstage and off; the distorted, mutilated figures painted and drawn by Grosz and Dix; hilarious, sardonic political commentary; Marlene Dietrich in pantsuits; and, coming down the road closely behind, no obstacles in sight, Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.
 Perhaps it is no wonder that New Yorkers especially, with their own experience of disaster just six years ago, are so drawn to this image of Weimar. In an age of catastrophes and uncertainties, from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina, unending war in Iraq and looming environmental meltdown, better to party on while making the occasional nod to the ugly circumstances and figures all around.
 But Weimar Germany was so much more than disaster and decadence. To be sure, Weimar suffered more economic and political crises than any democracy can be expected to bear. And Berlin in the 1920s had seedy bars galore where sex was only one of many forms of business transacted. Yet Weimar was also an era of inspired political, social and cultural innovation, and its leading figures were firmly convinced that they were creating a better, more humane world, whether through modern architecture, expansive social welfare programs or new theatrical forms. They despaired over the tragic waste of lives in World War I, but their hopes and creativity were also unleashed by the revolution that sent the Kaiser packing and established a progressive, socially minded republic. 
 If all one knows is Dix and Grosz and their kin or the torn stockings prevalent in New York's nouveau-Weimar cabaret, then Weimar seems to have been all mutilation and ugliness. But it was also utopian hopes and joyous creativity, a riveting search for beauty that would express the dynamic tendencies of modern, urban life and project a better world ahead.
 Weimar was the inspired public housing designed by Bruno Taut and Martin Wagner, which improved the lives of so many Berliners. It was the eight-hour day and trade-union recognition, which overthrew the feudal working conditions typical in prewar German industry. It was the banks of windows in Erich Mendelsohn's Schocken department store in Chemnitz, which gave an ethereal lightness to a massive structure and celebrated a world of plenty. Or his Einstein Tower, which represented the search for knowledge in a building that soared upward to the heavens. Weimar meant the legions of clinics that counseled women and men on how to have a rich and healthy sex life. Weimar meant commitment to the public realm, bristling creativity and belief in the future for all its citizens.
 As we approach the fifth year of a war with no end in sight and governmental policies that see markets as the appropriate setting for every human interaction, we should remember the other Weimar, the one its own protagonists lost sight of through the fog-encased tragedy of their exile.
